RISK FACTORS\nThe Corporation\u2019s financial condition and results of operations are subject to various risks inherent in its business. The material risks and uncertainties that management believes affect the Corporation are described below. If any of these risks actually occur, the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. The following risks together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should be considered.\nEconomic Risks\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and measures intended to prevent its spread have had, and another pandemic or public health crisis in the future could have, a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Such effects will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and difficult to predict.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had and continues to have, and another pandemic or public health crisis in the future could have, repercussions across domestic and global economies and financial markets. The global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic evolved rapidly and many countries and state and local governments in the United States, including those in which we operate, reacted by instituting government restrictions, border closings, quarantines, \u201cshelter-in-place\u201d orders and \u201csocial distancing\u201d guidelines that, among other things, resulted in a dramatic increase in national unemployment and a significant economic contraction in 2020. Although the United States government has taken steps to attempt to mitigate some of the more severe anticipated economic effects of the pandemic, including the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the \"CARES Act\") in 2020 and ongoing relief efforts, there can be no assurance that such steps will be effective or achieve their desired results in a timely fashion.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to adversely impact our business, workforce, as well as the operations of our borrowers, customers and business partners. In particular, we may experience financial losses due to a number of operational factors impacting us or our borrowers, customers or business partners, including but not limited to:\n\u2022credit losses resulting from financial stress being experienced by our borrowers as a result of the outbreak and related governmental actions, particularly in the hospitality, energy and restaurant industries, but across other industries as well;\n\u2022declines in collateral values;\n\u2022third party disruptions, including outages at network providers and other suppliers;\n\u2022higher inflation and supply chain disruptions;\n\u2022increased cyber and payment fraud risk, as cybercriminals attempt to profit from the disruption, given increased online and remote activity; and\n\u2022operational failures due to changes in our normal business practices necessitated by the outbreak and related governmental actions.\nThese factors may persist for a significant period of time and may continue to adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused us to modify our business practices (including restricting employee travel and developing work from home and social distancing plans for our employees), and we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or as we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers and business partners. There is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the pandemic or will otherwise be satisfactory to government authorities.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, each of which is highly uncertain and difficult to predict, including, but not limited to, the scope, severity and duration of the pandemic and its impact on our customers and demand for financial services, the actions governments, businesses and individuals take in response to the pandemic, the direct and indirect economic effects of the pandemic and containment measures, treatment developments, public adoption rates of COVID-19 vaccines, including booster shots, and their effectiveness against emerging variants of COVID-19, such as the Delta and Omicron variants, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may continue to experience materially adverse impacts to our business as a result of the global economic impact of the pandemic, including the availability of and access to credit, adverse impacts on our liquidity and any recession that has occurred or may occur in the future.\nThe ultimate impact of the pandemic is highly uncertain and subject to change. We do not yet know the full extent of the impacts on our business, our operations or the global economy as a whole. Nevertheless, any of the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including those described above, alone or in combination with others, have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Any of these negative impacts, alone or in combination with others, could exacerbate many of the risk factors discussed in this Part I, \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\".\nThe possibility of the economy\u2019s return to recessionary conditions and the possibility of further turmoil or volatility in the financial markets would likely have an adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s business, financial position and results of operations. Volatility and uncertainty related to inflation and the effects of inflation, which may lead to increased costs for businesses and consumers and potentially contribute to poor business and economic conditions generally, may also enhance or contribute to some of the risks discussed herein. For example, higher inflation, or volatility and uncertainty related to inflation, could reduce demand for the Corporation\u2019s products, adversely affect the creditworthiness of the Corporation\u2019s borrowers or result in lower values for the Corporation\u2019s investment securities and other interest-earning assets.\nThe Corporation continues to face risks resulting from the aftermath of the severe recession generally and the moderate pace of the current recovery. A slowing or failure of the economic recovery would likely aggravate the adverse effects of these difficult economic and market conditions on the Corporation and on others in the financial services industry. In particular, the Corporation may face the following risks in connection with the economic or market environment:\n\u2022The Corporation\u2019s and the Bank\u2019s ability to borrow from other financial institutions or to access the debt or equity capital markets on favorable terms or at all could be adversely affected by further disruptions in the capital markets or other events, including actions by rating agencies and deteriorating investor expectations.\n\u2022The Corporation faces increased regulation of the banking and financial services industry. Compliance with such regulation may increase its costs and limit its ability to pursue business opportunities.\n\u2022Market developments may affect customer confidence levels and may cause increases in loan delinquencies and default rates, which management expects would adversely impact the Bank\u2019s charge-offs and provision for credit losses.\n\u2022Market developments may adversely affect the Bank\u2019s securities portfolio by causing other-than-temporary-impairments, prompting write-downs and securities losses.\n\u2022Competition in banking and financial services industry could intensify as a result of the consolidation of financial services companies in connection with current market conditions.\nThe Corporation may not be able to meet its cash flow needs on a timely basis at a reasonable cost, and the Corporation\u2019s cost of funds for banking operations may significantly increase as a result of general economic conditions, interest rates and competitive pressures.\nLiquidity is the ability to meet cash flow obligations as they come due and cash flow needs on a timely basis and at a reasonable cost. The liquidity of the Bank is used to make loans and to repay deposit and borrowing liabilities as they become due, or are demanded by customers and creditors. Many factors affect the Bank\u2019s ability to meet liquidity needs, including variations in the markets served by its network of offices, its mix of assets and liabilities, reputation and standing in the marketplace, and general economic conditions.\nThe Bank\u2019s primary source of funding is retail deposits, gathered throughout its network of banking offices. Periodically, the Corporation utilizes term borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank (the \"FHLB\") of Pittsburgh, of which the Bank is a member, and other lenders to meet funding obligations. The Bank\u2019s securities and loan portfolios provide a source of contingent liquidity that could be accessed in a reasonable time period through sales.\nSignificant changes in general economic conditions, market interest rates, competitive pressures or otherwise, could cause the Bank\u2019s deposits to decrease relative to overall banking operations, and it would have to rely more heavily on brokered funds and borrowings in the future, which are typically more expensive than deposits.\nManagement and the Corporation's Board of Directors, through the Asset-Liability Committee (\"the ALCO\"), monitor liquidity and the ALCO establishes and monitors acceptable liquidity ranges. The Bank actively manages its liquidity position through target ratios. Continual monitoring of these ratios, both historical and through forecasts under multiple rate scenarios, allows the Bank to employ strategies necessary to maintain adequate liquidity.\nChanges in economic conditions, including consumer savings habits and availability of or access to capital, could potentially have a significant impact on the Bank\u2019s liquidity position, which in turn could materially impact the Corporation\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCredit and Interest Rate Risks\nThe Bank\u2019s allowance for credit losses may not be adequate to cover loan losses which could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA significant source of risk for the Corporation arises from the possibility that losses will be sustained because borrowers, guarantors and related parties may fail to perform in accordance with the terms of their loan agreements. Most loans originated by the Bank are secured, but some loans are unsecured based upon management\u2019s evaluation of the creditworthiness of the borrowers. With respect to secured loans, the collateral securing the repayment of these loans principally includes a wide variety of real estate, and to a lesser extent personal property, either of which may be insufficient to cover the obligations owed under such loans.\nCollateral values and the financial performance of borrowers may be adversely affected by changes in prevailing economic, environmental and other conditions, including declines in the value of real estate, changes in interest rates and debt service levels, changes in oil and gas prices, changes in monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government, widespread disease, terrorist activity, environmental contamination and other external events, which are beyond the control of the Bank. In addition, collateral appraisals that are out of date or that do not meet industry recognized standards might create the impression that a loan is adequately collateralized when in fact it is not. Although the Bank may acquire any real estate or other assets that secure defaulted loans through foreclosures or other similar remedies, the amounts owed under the defaulted loans may exceed the value of the assets acquired.\nThe allowance for credit losses is subject to a formal analysis by the Credit Administration and Finance Departments of the Corporation. Following the issuance by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) of Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) 2016-13, \u201cMeasurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,\u201d the Corporation adjusted its loan allowance methodology to reflect the new standard, which requires periodic estimates of lifetime expected credit losses on financial assets and categorizes expected credit losses as allowances for credit losses under the current expected credit loss (\"CECL\") methodology. The Corporation measures expected credit losses of financial assets on a collective (pool) basis, when the financial assets share similar risk characteristics. Depending on the nature of the pool of financial assets with similar risk characteristics, the models utilized by the Corporation to estimate expected credit losses include a discounted cash flow (\"DCF\") model that discounts instrument-level contractual cash flows, adjusted for prepayments and curtailments, incorporating loss expectations, and a weighted average remaining maturity (\"WARM\") model which contemplates expected losses at a pool-level, utilizing historic loss information. The Corporation's models for estimating the allowance for credit losses consider available relevant information about the collectability of cash flows, including information about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts.\nThe Bank monitors delinquencies and losses on a monthly basis. The Bank has adopted underwriting and credit monitoring policies and procedures, including the review of borrower financial statements and collateral appraisals, which management believes are appropriate to mitigate the risk of loss by assessing the likelihood of borrower nonperformance and the value of available collateral. The Bank also manages credit risk by diversifying its loan portfolio. An ongoing independent review, subsequent to management\u2019s review, of individual credits is performed by an independent loan review function, which reports to the Loan Committee of the Corporation\u2019s Board of Directors.\nThe determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires the Corporation to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes. Although management believes that the processes in place for assessing the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses are robust, such policies and procedures have limitations, including judgment errors in management\u2019s risk analysis, and may not prevent unexpected losses in the future. Moreover, the CECL methodology may create more volatility in the level of our allowance for credit losses from quarter to quarter as changes in the level of allowance for credit losses will be dependent upon, among other things, macroeconomic forecasts and conditions, loan portfolio volumes and credit quality. These factors could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nInterest rate volatility could significantly reduce the Corporation\u2019s profitability.\nThe Corporation\u2019s earnings largely depend on the relationship between the yield on its earning assets, primarily loans and investment securities, and the cost of funds, primarily deposits and borrowings. This relationship, commonly known as the net interest margin, is susceptible to significant fluctuation and is affected by economic and competitive factors that influence the yields and rates, and the volume and mix of the Bank\u2019s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities.\nInterest rate risk can be defined as the sensitivity of net interest income and of the market value of financial instruments to the direction and frequency of changes in interest rates. Interest rate risk arises from the imbalance in the re-pricing, maturity and/or cash flow characteristics of assets and liabilities. The Corporation is subject to interest rate risk to the degree that its interest bearing liabilities re-price or mature more slowly or more rapidly or on a different basis than its interest earning assets. Changes in interest rates, including those due to federal monetary policy, will affect the levels of income and expense recorded on a large portion of the Bank\u2019s assets and liabilities, and fluctuations in interest rates will impact the market value of all interest sensitive assets. Significant fluctuations in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.\nThe Bank\u2019s interest rate risk measurement and management techniques incorporate the re-pricing and cash flow attributes of its balance sheet and off-balance sheet instruments as they relate to current and potential changes in interest rates. The level of interest rate risk, measured in terms of the potential future effect on earnings, is determined through the use of static gap analysis and earnings simulation modeling under multiple interest rate scenarios. Management\u2019s objectives are to measure, monitor and develop strategies in response to the interest rate risk profile inherent in the Bank\u2019s balance sheet in order to preserve the sensitivity of net interest income to actual or potential changes in interest rates. For further information on risk relating to interest rates, refer to Part I, Item 7a, \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk,\" herein.\nThe Corporation\u2019s investment securities portfolio is subject to credit risk, market risk, and liquidity risk, and declines in value in its investment securities portfolio may require it to record other-than-temporary impairment charges that could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Corporation\u2019s investment securities portfolio has risks beyond its control that can significantly influence the portfolio\u2019s fair value. These factors include, but are not limited to, rating agency downgrades of the securities, defaults of the issuers of the securities, lack of market pricing of the securities, and continued instability in the credit markets. Recent lack of market activity with respect to certain of the securities has, in certain circumstances, required the Corporation to base its fair market valuation on unobservable inputs. The Corporation has engaged valuation experts to price these certain securities using proprietary models, which incorporate assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the securities, including bid/ask spreads and liquidity and credit premiums. Any change in current accounting principles or interpretations of these principles could impact the Corporation\u2019s assessment of fair value and thus its determination of other-than-temporary impairment of the securities in its investment securities portfolio.\nThe Bank may be required to record other-than-temporary impairment charges on its investment securities if they suffer declines in value that are considered other-than-temporary. Numerous factors, including collateral deterioration underlying certain private label mortgage-backed securities, lack of liquidity for re-sales of certain investment securities, absence of reliable pricing information for certain investment securities, adverse changes in business climate, adverse actions by regulators, or unanticipated changes in the competitive environment could negatively affect the Bank\u2019s securities portfolio in future periods. An other-than-temporary impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nA substantial decline in the value of the Bank\u2019s FHLB common stock may adversely affect the Corporation\u2019s results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nAs a requirement of membership in the FHLB of Pittsburgh, the Bank must own a minimum required amount of FHLB stock, calculated periodically based primarily on its level of borrowings from the FHLB. Borrowings from the FHLB represent the Bank\u2019s primary source of short-term and long-term wholesale funding.\nIn an extreme situation, it is possible that the capitalization of an FHLB, including the FHLB of Pittsburgh, could be substantially diminished or reduced to zero. Consequently, given that there is no trading market for the Bank\u2019s FHLB common stock, the Corporation\u2019s management believes that there is a risk that the Corporation\u2019s investment could be deemed impaired at some time in the future. If this occurs, it may adversely affect the Corporation\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nIf the capitalization of the FHLB of Pittsburgh is substantially diminished, the Bank\u2019s liquidity may be adversely impacted if it is not able to obtain alternative sources of funding.\nThere are 11 FHLB banks, including the FHLB of Pittsburgh, in the FHLB system. The 11 FHLB banks are jointly liable for the consolidated obligations of the FHLB system. To the extent that one FHLB bank cannot meet its obligations to pay its share of the system\u2019s debt, other FHLB banks can be called upon to make the payment. The Corporation cannot assure you, however, that the FHLB system will be able to meet these obligations.\nThe Bank could be held responsible for environmental liabilities relating to properties acquired through foreclosure, resulting in significant financial loss.\nIn the event the Bank forecloses on a defaulted commercial or residential mortgage loan to recover its investment, it may be subject to environmental liabilities in connection with the underlying real property, which could significantly exceed the value of the real property. Although the Bank exercises due diligence to discover potential environmental liabilities prior to acquiring any property through foreclosure, hazardous substances or wastes, contaminants, pollutants, or their sources may be discovered on properties during its ownership or after a sale to a third party. The Corporation cannot assure you that the Bank would not incur full recourse liability for the entire cost of any removal and cleanup on an acquired property, that the cost of removal and cleanup would not exceed the value of the property, or that the Bank could recover any of the costs from any third party. Losses arising from environmental liabilities could have a material adverse impact on the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.\nReplacement of the\u202fLIBOR\u202fbenchmark interest rate could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority (\"FCA\"), which regulates the London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\"), announced that the FCA intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit the rates required to calculate LIBOR after 2021. As a result, the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York organized the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (\"ARRC\"), which identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\") as its preferred alternative to LIBOR in derivatives and other financial contracts. The U.S. bank regulators issued a Statement on LIBOR Transition on November 30, 2020 encouraging banks to transition away from U.S. Dollar (USD) LIBOR as soon as practicable and in any event by December 31, 2021 for new contracts. LIBOR is currently anticipated to be fully phased out by June 30, 2023. We are not able to predict with certainty when LIBOR will cease to be available or when there will be sufficient liquidity in the SOFR markets. Any changes adopted by the FCA or other governing bodies in the method used for determining LIBOR may result in a sudden or prolonged increase or decrease in reported LIBOR. If such an increase or decrease were to occur, our interest payments that are higher or lower than if LIBOR were to remain available in its current form.\nWe have a number of loans, derivative contracts, borrowings and other financial instruments with attributes that are either directly or indirectly dependent on\u202fLIBOR. The transition from\u202fLIBOR, or any changes or reforms to the determination or supervision of\u202fLIBOR,\u202fcould have an adverse impact on the market for or value of any\u202fLIBOR-linked securities, loans, and other financial obligations or extensions of credit held by or due to us, could create considerable costs and additional risk and could have an adverse impact on our overall financial condition or results of operations. Since proposed alternative rates (including SOFR) are calculated differently, payments under contracts referencing new rates will differ from those referencing\u202fLIBOR. The transition will change our market risk profiles, requiring changes to risk and pricing models, valuation tools, product design and hedging strategies. Furthermore, failure to adequately manage this transition process with our customers could adversely impact our reputation. Although we are currently unable to assess what the ultimate impact of the transition from\u202fLIBOR\u202fwill be, failure to adequately manage the transition could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to an Investment in the Corporation\u2019s Securities\nSome provisions contained in the Corporation\u2019s articles of incorporation and its bylaws and under Pennsylvania law could deter a takeover attempt or delay changes in control or management of the Corporation.\nCertain anti-takeover provisions of the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law of 1988, as amended, apply to Pennsylvania registered corporations (e.g., publicly traded companies) including, but not limited to, those relating to (1)\u202fcontrol share acquisitions, (2)\u202fdisgorgement of profits by certain controlling persons, (3)\u202fbusiness combination transactions with interested shareholders, and (4)\u202fthe rights of shareholders to demand fair value for their stock following a control transaction. Pennsylvania law permits corporations to opt-out of these anti-takeover provisions, but the Corporation has not done so. Such provisions could have the effect of deterring takeovers or delaying changes in control or management of the Corporation. Additionally, such provisions could limit the price that some investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of the Corporation\u2019s common stock.\nFor example, the Corporation\u2019s amended and restated articles of incorporation require the affirmative vote of 66% of the outstanding shares entitled to vote to effect a business combination. In addition, the Corporation\u2019s amended and restated articles of incorporation, subject to the limitations prescribed in such articles and subject to limitations prescribed by Pennsylvania law, authorize the Corporation\u2019s Board of Directors, from time to time by resolution and without further shareholder action, to provide for the issuance of shares of preferred stock, in one or more series, and to fix the designation, powers, preferences and other rights of the shares and to fix the qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof. As a result of its broad discretion with respect to the creation and issuance of preferred stock without shareholder approval, the Corporation's Board of Directors could adversely affect the voting power and other rights of the holders of common stock and, by issuing shares of preferred stock with certain voting, conversion and/or redemption rights, could discourage any attempt to obtain control of the Corporation.\nThe Corporation\u2019s bylaws, as amended and restated, provide for the division of the Corporation\u2019s Board of Directors into three classes of directors, with each serving staggered terms. In addition, any amendment to the Corporation\u2019s bylaws must be approved by the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by all shareholders entitled to vote thereon and, if any shareholders are entitled to vote thereon as a class, upon receiving the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by the shareholders entitled to vote as a class.\nAny of the foregoing provisions may have the effect of deterring takeovers or delaying changes in control or management of the Corporation.\nThe price of the Corporation\u2019s common stock may fluctuate significantly, and this may make it difficult for you to resell shares of common stock owned by you at times or at prices you find attractive.\nThe price of the Corporation\u2019s common stock on the Global Select Market of The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (\"NASDAQ\") constantly changes. The Corporation expects that the market price of its common stock will continue to fluctuate, and the Corporation cannot give you any assurances regarding any trends in the market prices for its common stock.\nThe Corporation\u2019s stock price may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are beyond its control. These factors include the Corporation\u2019s:\n\u2022past and future dividend practice;\n\u2022financial condition, performance, creditworthiness and prospects;\n\u2022quarterly variations in the Corporation\u2019s operating results or the quality of the Corporation\u2019s assets;\n\u2022operating results that vary from the expectations of management, securities analysts and investors;\n\u2022changes in expectations as to the Corporation\u2019s future financial performance;\n\u2022announcements of innovations, new products, strategic developments, significant contracts, acquisitions and other material events by the Corporation or its competitors;\n\u2022the operating and securities price performance of other companies that investors believe are comparable to the Corporation;\n\u2022future sales of the Corporation\u2019s equity or equity-related securities;\n\u2022the credit, mortgage and housing markets, the markets for securities relating to mortgages or housing, and developments with respect to financial institutions generally; and\n\u2022instability in global financial markets and global economies and general market conditions, such as interest or foreign exchange rates, stock, commodity or real estate valuations or volatility, budget deficits or sovereign debt level concerns and other geopolitical, regulatory or judicial events.\nThe Corporation\u2019s ability to pay dividends is limited by law and regulations.\nThe future declaration of dividends by the Corporation\u2019s Board of Directors will depend on a number of factors, including capital requirements, regulatory limitations, the Corporation\u2019s operating results and financial condition and general economic conditions. As a bank holding company, the Corporation\u2019s principal assets and sources of income are derived from the Bank and, as a result, the Corporation\u2019s ability to pay dividends depends primarily on the receipt of dividends from the Bank. Dividend payments from the Bank are subject to legal and regulatory limitations, generally based on retained earnings, imposed by bank regulatory agencies. The ability of the Bank to pay dividends is also subject to financial condition, regulatory capital requirements, capital expenditures and other cash flow requirements. The Corporation cannot assure you that the Bank will be able to pay dividends to the Corporation in the future. If the Corporation were unable to receive dividends from the Bank, it would materially and adversely affects the Corporation\u2019s liquidity and its ability to service its debt, pay its other obligations, or pay cash dividends on its common stock. The Corporation may decide to limit the payment of dividends to its stockholders even when the Corporation has the legal ability to pay them in order to retain earnings for use in the Corporation\u2019s business.\nOperational and Strategic Risks\nThe Bank\u2019s loans are principally concentrated in certain areas of Pennsylvania, Ohio and New York, and adverse economic conditions in those markets could adversely affect the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Corporation\u2019s success is dependent to a significant extent upon general economic conditions in the United States and, in particular, the local economies in central and northwest Pennsylvania, central and northeast Ohio, and western New York - the primary markets served by the Bank. The Bank is particularly exposed to real estate and economic factors in these geographic areas, as most of its loan portfolio is concentrated among borrowers in these markets. Furthermore, because a substantial portion of the Bank\u2019s loan portfolio is secured by real estate in these areas, the value of the associated collateral is also subject to regional real estate market conditions.\nThe Bank is not immune to negative consequences arising from overall economic weakness and, in particular, a sharp downturn in the local real estate markets served by the Bank. While the Bank\u2019s loan portfolio has not shown significant signs of credit quality deterioration despite continued challenges in the U.S. economy, we cannot assure you that no deterioration will occur. An economic recession in the markets served by the Bank, and the nation as a whole, could negatively impact household and corporate incomes. This impact could lead to decreased loan demand and increase the number of borrowers who fail to pay the Bank interest or principal on their loans, and accordingly, could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.\nSevere weather, flooding and other effects of climate change and other natural disasters, such as earthquakes, could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nOur branch locations and our customers\u2019 properties may be adversely impacted by flooding, wildfires, high winds and other effects of severe weather conditions that may be caused or exacerbated by climate change. These events can force property closures, result in property damage and/or result in delays in expansion, development or renovation of our properties and those of our customers. Even if these events do not directly impact our properties or our customers\u2019 properties, they may impact us and our customers through increased insurance, energy or other costs. In addition, changes in laws or regulations, including federal, state or city laws, relating to climate change could result in increased capital expenditures to improve the energy efficiency of our branch locations and/or our customers\u2019 properties.\nThe preparation of the Corporation\u2019s financial statements requires the use of estimates that could significantly vary from actual results, which could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make significant estimates that affect the financial statements. For example, one of these significant estimates is the allowance for credit losses. Due to the inherent nature of estimates, the Corporation cannot provide absolute assurance that it will not significantly increase the allowance for credit losses and/or sustain credit losses that are significantly higher than the provided allowance, which could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nThe Corporation\u2019s financial results may be subject to the impact of changes in accounting standards or interpretation in new or existing standards.\nFrom time to time the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\"), and the SEC change accounting regulations and reporting standards that govern the preparation of the Corporation\u2019s financial statements. In addition, the FASB, SEC, and bank regulators may revise their previous interpretations regarding existing accounting regulations and the application of these accounting standards. These revisions in their interpretations are out of the Corporation\u2019s control and may have a material impact on its financial statements.\nThe Corporation depends on the accuracy and completeness of information about customers and counterparties.\nIn deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with customers and counterparties, we rely on information furnished to us by or on behalf of customers and counterparties, including financial statements and other financial information. We also rely on representations of customers and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and, with respect to financial statements, on reports of independent auditors. For example, in deciding whether to extend credit to clients, we may assume that a customer's audited financial statements conform to GAAP and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the customer. Our earnings are significantly affected by our ability to properly originate, underwrite and service loans. Our financial condition, results of operations and capital could be negatively impacted to the extent we incorrectly assess the creditworthiness of our borrowers, fail to detect or respond to deterioration in asset quality in a timely manner, or rely on financial statements that do not comply with GAAP or are materially misleading.\nThe risks presented by acquisitions could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nAny acquisitions will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in acquisitions including, among other things: our ability to realize anticipated cost savings and avoid unanticipated costs relating to the merger, the difficulty of integrating operations and personnel, the potential disruption of our or the acquired company\u2019s ongoing business, the inability of our management to maximize our financial and strategic position, the inability to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies, and the impairment of relationships with the acquired company\u2019s employees and customers as a result of changes in ownership and management. These risks may prevent the Corporation from fully realizing the anticipated benefits of an acquisition or cause the realization of such benefits to take longer than expected.\nStrong competition within the Corporation\u2019s markets and technological change may have a material adverse impact on its profitability.\nThe Corporation competes with an ever-increasing array of financial service providers. As noted above, as a financial holding company and state-chartered financial institution, respectively, the Corporation and the Bank are subject to extensive regulation and supervision, including, in many cases, regulations that limit the type and scope of activities. The non-bank financial service providers that compete with the Corporation and the Bank may not be subject to such extensive regulation, supervision, and tax burden. Competition from nationwide banks, as well as local institutions, is strong in the Corporation\u2019s markets.\nThe financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological change and technological advances are likely to intensify competition. In addition to improving customer services, effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce costs. Accordingly, the Corporation\u2019s future success will depend in part on its ability to address customer needs by using technology. The Corporation cannot assure you that it will be able to successfully take advantage of technological changes or advances or develop and market new technology driven products and services to its customers. Failure to keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nMany regional, national and international competitors have far greater assets and capitalization than the Corporation has and greater resources to invest in technology and access to capital markets and can consequently offer a broader array of financial services than it can. We cannot assure you that we will continue to be able to compete effectively with other financial institutions in the future. Developments increasing the nature or level of competition could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. For further information on competition, refer to Part I, Item\u202f1, \"Competition,\" herein.\nThe unsoundness of other financial institutions with which the Corporation does business could adversely affect the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, investment or other relationships. The Corporation routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry such as commercial banks, brokers and dealers, investment banks and other institutional clients for a range of transactions including loan participations, derivatives and hedging transactions. In addition, the Corporation invests in securities or loans originated or issued by financial institutions or supported by the loans they originate. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial institutions, or the financial industry generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or other institutions. Many of these transactions expose the Corporation to credit or investment risk in the event of default by the Corporation\u2019s counterparty. In addition, the Corporation\u2019s credit risk may be exacerbated if the collateral it holds cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or other exposure to the Corporation. The Corporation could incur losses to its securities portfolio as a result of these issues. These types of losses may have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operation.\nThe Corporation\u2019s operations may be adversely affected if its external vendors do not perform as expected or if its access to third-party services is interrupted.\nThe Corporation relies on certain external vendors to provide products and services necessary to maintain the day-to-day operations of the Corporation. Some of the products and services provided by vendors include key components of our business infrastructure including data processing and storage and internet connections and network access, among other products and services. Accordingly, the Corporation\u2019s operations are exposed to the risk that these vendors will not perform in accordance with the contracted arrangements or under service level agreements. The failure of an external vendor to perform in accordance with the contracted arrangements or under service level agreements, because of changes in the vendor\u2019s organizational structure, financial condition, support for existing products and services or strategic focus or for any other reason, could disrupt the Corporation\u2019s operations. If we are unable to find alternative sources for our vendors\u2019 services and products quickly and cost-effectively, the failures of our vendors could have a material adverse impact on the Corporation\u2019s business and, in turn, the Corporation\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, and we could experience service denials if demand for such services exceeds capacity or such third-party systems fail or experience interruptions. If sustained or repeated, a system failure or service denial could result in a deterioration of our ability to process new and renewal loans, gather deposits and provide customer service, compromise our ability to operate effectively, damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business and subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nA failure in or breach of the Corporation\u2019s or any of its subsidiaries\u2019 operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of third party vendors and other service providers, including as a result of cyber attacks, could disrupt the Corporation\u2019s or any of its subsidiaries\u2019 businesses, result in the unauthorized disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage its reputation, increase its costs, or cause losses.\nThe Corporation, primarily through the Bank, depends on its ability to continuously process, record and monitor a large number of customer transactions. The Corporation also collects and processes regulated personal date of employees and customer, public and regulatory expectations regarding operational and information security have increased over time. Accordingly, its and its subsidiaries\u2019 operational systems and infrastructure must continue to be safeguarded and monitored for potential failures, vulnerabilities, disruptions and breakdowns. Although the Corporation has business continuity plans and other safeguards in place, disruptions or failures in the physical infrastructure or operating systems that support its businesses and customers, or cyber attacks or security breaches of the networks, systems or devices on which employees' or customers\u2019 personal information is stored and that customers use to access the Corporation\u2019s and its subsidiaries products and services could result in customer attrition, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensation costs, and/or additional compliance costs, any of which could materially adversely affect the Corporation\u2019s results of operations or financial condition. In addition, significant disruptions of our third party vendors\u2019 and/or service providers\u2019 security systems or infrastructure, or other similar data security incidents, could adversely affect our business operations and/or result in the loss, misappropriation, and/or unauthorized access, use or disclosure of, or the prevention of access to, regulated personal or confidential information, which could harm our business.\nAlthough to date the Corporation has not experienced any material losses relating to cyber attacks or other information security breaches, there can be no assurance that it or its subsidiaries will not suffer such losses in the future and our information systems remain a target of cyber attacks. Given the evolving nature of security threats and evolving safeguards, there can be no assurance that any preventive, protective, or remedial measures are or will be adequate to address threats that arise. However, even security measures that are appropriate, reasonable, and/or in accordance with applicable legal requirements may not be able to fully protect our operational or security systems or infrastructure and the data contained therein, or our data that is contained in our subsidiaries\u2019 or third parties\u2019 systems. Additionally, while we have implemented security measures that we believe are appropriate, a regulator could deem our security measures not to be appropriate given the lack of prescriptive measures in certain data protection laws. The Corporation continues to enhance its data security systems, technology platforms, employee education and risk management processes, in an effort to underpin its business strategy as well as in response to the evolving threat landscape and any incidents we experience. In connection with these efforts, we have incurred costs and expect to incur additional costs as we continue to enhance our data security infrastructure and take further steps to prevent unauthorized access to our systems and the data we maintain. In addition, any actual or perceived failure by the Corporation or our vendors or business partners to comply with our privacy, confidentiality, or data security-related legal or other obligations to third parties may result in claims by third parties that we have breached our privacy- or confidentiality-related obligations, which could materially and adversely affect our business and prospects.\nThe Corporation\u2019s risk and exposure to these matters, including future \"phishing\" attempts like the 2020 incident, remain heightened because of, among other things, the evolving nature of these threats, our plans to continue to implement our Internet banking and mobile banking channel strategies and develop additional remote connectivity solutions to serve our customers when and how they want to be served. As a result, cybersecurity and the continued development and enhancement of the Corporation\u2019s controls, processes and practices designed to protect its and its subsidiaries systems, computers, software, data and networks from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a priority for the Corporation. As cyber threats continue to evolve, the Corporation may be required to expend further significant resources to continue to modify or enhance its protective measures or to investigate and remediate future information security vulnerabilities.\nWhile we have purchased cybersecurity insurance, there are no assurances that the coverage would be adequate in relation to any incurred losses. Moreover, as cyber attacks increase in frequency and magnitude, we may be unable to obtain cybersecurity insurance in amounts and on terms we view as adequate for our operations.\nRisks Related to Legal and Compliance Matters\nThe Corporation is subject to extensive government regulation and supervision, which may affect its ability to conduct its business and may negatively impact its financial results.\nThe Corporation, primarily through the Bank and its non-bank subsidiary, is subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors\u2019 funds, the Federal Deposit Insurance Fund and the safety and soundness of the banking system as a whole, not stockholders. These regulations affect the Corporation\u2019s lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy and growth, among other things. Congress and federal regulatory agencies continually review banking laws, regulations and policies for possible changes. Changes to statutes, regulations or regulatory policies, including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes, regulations or policies, could affect the Corporation in substantial and unpredictable ways. Such changes could subject it to additional costs, limit the types of financial services and products the Corporation may offer, and/or limit the pricing it may charge on certain banking services, among other things.\nFailure to comply with laws, including the Bank Secrecy Act and USA Patriot Act, regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, restrictions, civil money penalties and/or reputation damage, which could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations and/or cause the Corporation to lose its financial holding company status. While the Corporation has policies and procedures designed to prevent any such violations, there can be no assurance that such violations will not occur. See the section captioned \"Supervision and Regulation\" in Part I, Item 1 of this report for further information.\nFederal and state governments could pass legislation responsive to current credit conditions which could cause the Corporation to experience higher credit losses.\nThe Corporation could experience higher credit losses because of federal or state legislation or regulatory action that reduces the amount the Bank\u2019s borrowers are otherwise contractually required to pay under existing loan contracts. Also, the Corporation could experience higher credit losses because of federal or state legislation or regulatory action that limits the Bank\u2019s ability to foreclose on property or other collateral or makes foreclosure less economically feasible. The Corporation cannot assure you that future legislation will not significantly and adversely impact its ability to collect on its current loans or foreclose on collateral.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nThe Corporation relies on its management and other key personnel, and the loss of any of them may adversely affect its operations.\nThe Corporation is and will continue to be dependent upon the services of its executive management team. In addition, it will continue to depend on its ability to retain and recruit key client relationship managers. The unexpected loss of services of any key management personnel, or the inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future, could have an adverse effect on its business and financial condition.\nThe Corporation's risk management framework may not be effective in mitigating risk and loss.\nThe Corporation maintains an enterprise risk management program that is designed to identify, quantify, monitor, report, and control the risks that it faces. These risks include, but are not limited to: strategic, interest-rate, credit, liquidity, operations, pricing, reputation, compliance, litigation, and cybersecurity. While the Corporation assesses and improves this program on an ongoing basis, there can be no assurance that its approach and framework for risk management and related controls will effectively mitigate all risk and limit losses in its business. If conditions or circumstances arise that expose flaws or gaps in the Corporation's risk-management program, or if its controls break down, the Corporation's results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.", "PERMNO": 86384, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "CCNE"}
