{"cik": "750199", "company": "EPL OIL & GAS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-10-13", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOil and natural gas prices are volatile, and a substantial or extended decline in oil and natural gas prices would adversely affect our financial results and impede our growth. Oil and natural gas prices historically have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future. For example, oil prices declined severely during our 2015 fiscal year with continued lower prices in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2016. The WTI crude oil price per barrel for the period from July 1, 2014 to June 30, 2015 ranged from a high of $105.34 to a low of $43.46, a decrease of 58.7%, and the NYMEX natural gas price per MMBtu for the period July 1, 2014 to June 30, 2015 ranged from a high of $4.49 to a low of $2.49, a decrease of 44.5%. As of September 22, 2015, the spot market price for WTI was $45.83. Prices for oil and natural gas fluctuate widely in response to relatively minor changes in the supply and demand for oil and natural gas, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors beyond our control, such as:\n\u2022 domestic and foreign supplies of oil and natural gas;\n\u2022 price and quantity of foreign imports of oil and natural gas;\n\u2022 actions of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other state-controlled oil companies relating to oil and natural gas price and production controls;\n\u2022 level of consumer product demand, including as a result of competition from alternative energy sources;\n\u2022 level of global oil and natural gas exploration and production activity;\n\u2022 domestic and foreign governmental regulations;\n\u2022 level of global oil and natural gas inventories;\n\u2022 political conditions in or affecting other oil-producing and natural gas-producing countries, including the current conflicts in the Middle East and conditions in South America and Russia;\n\u2022 weather conditions;\n\u2022 technological advances affecting oil and natural gas production and consumption;\n\u2022 overall U.S. and global economic conditions; and\n\u2022 price and availability of alternative fuels.\nOur financial condition, revenues, profitability and the carrying value of our properties depend upon the prevailing prices and demand for oil and natural gas. The speed and severity of the decline in oil prices during our 2015 fiscal year and the continued lower prices in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2016 has materially affected our results of operations and our estimates of our proved oil and natural gas reserves. Any sustained periods of low prices for oil or natural gas are likely to materially and adversely affect our financial position, the quantities of natural gas and oil reserves that we can economically produce, our cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to access funds from EGC and EGC\u2019s ability to access funds under our revolving credit facility and through the capital markets.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions in order to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful. As of June 30, 2015, we had total indebtedness of $1,018 million. Based on our current debt balance, we expect to have substantial interest payments due during fiscal year 2016, totaling $80.1 million. In addition, our $510 million aggregate principal amount 8.25% Senior Notes are due February 15, 2018.\nIn addition, our revolving credit facility is scheduled to mature on April 9, 2018; however, the maturity of our revolving credit facility will accelerate if EGC\u2019s 9.25% Senior Notes are not retired or refinanced by May 15, 2017 or our 8.25% Senior Notes are not retired or refinanced by July 15, 2017.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on, or to refinance, our debt obligations will depend on our financial and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and\ncertain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operating activities or that future sources of capital will be available to us in an amount sufficient to permit us to service our indebtedness or repay our indebtedness as it becomes due or to fund our other liquidity needs. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will have the ability to borrow or otherwise raise the amounts necessary to repay or refinance our indebtedness as it matures. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt or meet our debt obligations as they become due, we may be required to:\n\u2022 restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt;\n\u2022 obtain additional financing;\n\u2022 sell some of our assets or operations; or\n\u2022 reduce or delay capital expenditures, including development and exploration efforts.\nEGC and EPL may be unable to restructure or refinance our debt, obtain additional financing or capital or sell assets on satisfactory terms, if at all. If we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we will be in default under the terms of the agreements governing our debt and, as a result:\n\u2022 our debt holders could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable, which would in turn trigger cross-acceleration or cross-default rights between the relevant agreements and the holders of EGC\u2019s 11.0% Notes due March 15, 2020 could foreclose against the assets securing their notes;\n\u2022 the lenders under our revolving credit facility could terminate their commitments to lend us money and foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings; and\n\u2022 we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nOur significant level of indebtedness may limit our ability to borrow additional funds or capitalize on acquisition or other business opportunities. In addition, the covenants in the indentures governing our senior notes and our revolving credit facility impose restrictions that may limit our ability to take certain actions. Our failure to comply with these covenants could result in the acceleration of our outstanding indebtedness. As of June 30, 2015, we had total indebtedness of $1,018 million. Our leverage and the current and future restrictions contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness may reduce our ability to incur additional indebtedness, engage in certain transactions or capitalize on acquisition or other business opportunities. Our indebtedness and other financial obligations and restrictions could have financial consequences. For example, they could:\n\u2022 impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for capital expenditures, potential acquisitions, general business activities or other purposes;\n\u2022 increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022 result in higher interest expense in the event of increases in interest rates since some of our debt is at variable rates of interest;\n\u2022 require us to dedicate a substantial portion of future cash flow to payments of our indebtedness and other financial obligations, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements;\n\u2022 limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry; and\n\u2022 place us at a competitive disadvantage to those who have proportionately less debt.\nIn addition, our revolving credit facility contains and our indentures governing our unsecured notes contain covenants that restrict our ability to take various actions, such as:\n\u2022 engaging in businesses other than the oil and gas business;\n\u2022 incurring or guaranteeing additional indebtedness or issuing disqualified capital stock;\n\u2022 making investments;\n\u2022 paying dividends, redeeming certain indebtedness or making other restricted payments;\n\u2022 entering into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022 creating or incurring liens;\n\u2022 transferring or selling assets;\n\u2022 incurring dividend or other payment restrictions affecting certain subsidiaries;\n\u2022 consummating a merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all our assets; and\n\u2022 entering into sale/leaseback transactions.\nIn addition, under our revolving credit facility, there is a restriction on changes in our management. If John D. Schiller, Jr. ceases to be the chief executive officer of our parent company Energy XXI Ltd (except as a result of his death or disability) and a reasonably acceptable successor is not appointed within 180 days, the lenders of our revolving credit facility could declare amounts outstanding thereunder immediately due and payable. In the event that Mr. Schiller ceases to be our parent\u2019s chief executive officer, amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility would not automatically be reclassified as current debt as it is probable that we could identify a successor within the 180 day period. Our revolving credit facility requires, and any future credit facilities may require, us to comply with specified financial ratios, including regarding interest coverage and total leverage coverage.\nOur ability to comply with these covenants will likely be affected by events beyond our control and we cannot assure you that we will satisfy those requirements. A prolonged period of oil and gas prices at current levels or a further decline could further increase the risk of our inability to comply with covenants to maintain specified financial ratios. A breach of any of these provisions could result in a default under our debt instruments, which could allow all amounts outstanding thereunder to be declared immediately due and payable, which would in turn trigger cross-acceleration and cross-default rights under our other debt. In addition, our lenders could compel us to apply all of our available cash to repay our borrowings or they could prevent us from making payments on the notes in the event of acceleration of our outstanding indebtedness. In the event of such acceleration, we cannot assure that we would be able to repay our debt or obtain new financing to refinance our debt. Even if new financing was made available to us, it may not be on terms acceptable to us. We may also be prevented from taking advantage of business opportunities that arise if we fail to meet certain ratios or because of the limitations imposed on us by the restrictive covenants under these instruments.\nWe may be able to incur additional debt in the future. This could exacerbate the risks associated with our indebtedness. Despite our current level of indebtedness, we may incur more debt in the future, which could further exacerbate the risks described above. The terms of the indentures governing our senior notes and our revolving credit facility do not fully prohibit us or our subsidiaries from incurring more indebtedness, which could intensify the related risks that we now face.\nContinued low commodity prices may impact our ability to comply with debt covenants Based on projected market conditions and commodity prices, we currently expect that we will be in compliance with covenants under our credit agreement for the near term; however, a protracted period of low commodity prices could cause us to not be in compliance with certain financial covenants under our credit agreements in future periods, including prior to June 30, 2016. A breach of the covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility would cause a default under such facility, potentially resulting in acceleration of all amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. If the lenders under our credit facility were to accelerate the indebtedness under our revolving credit facility as a result of such defaults, such acceleration of outstanding indebtedness under our Revolving Credit Facility could cause a cross-default or cross-acceleration of all of our other outstanding indebtedness, as well as all of EGC\u2019s and our parent\u2019s other outstanding indebtedness. As of June 30, 2015, EGC and our parent had outstanding indebtedness of $3,916 million, excluding all of our\nindebtedness. Such a cross-default or cross-acceleration could have a wider impact on our liquidity than might otherwise arise from a default or acceleration of a single debt instrument. If an event of default occurs, or if other debt agreements cross-default, and the lenders under the affected debt agreements accelerate the maturity of any loans or other debt outstanding, we may not have sufficient liquidity to repay all of our outstanding indebtedness.\nWe expect to have substantial capital requirements, and we may be unable to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms. We expect to make substantial capital expenditures related to our oil and gas properties. Our capital requirements depend on numerous factors making it difficult to predict the timing and amount of our capital expenditures. We intend to primarily finance our capital expenditures with advances from EGC which intends to primarily finance near term capital expenditures with cash on hand. However, if our capital requirements vary materially from those provided for in EGC\u2019s current projections, we or EGC may require additional financing. A decrease in expected revenues or an adverse change in market conditions could make obtaining this financing economically unattractive or impossible.\nThe cost of raising money in the debt and equity capital markets may increase substantially while the availability of funds from those markets may diminish significantly. Also, as a result of concerns about the stability of financial markets generally and the solvency of counterparties specifically, the cost of obtaining money from the credit markets may increase as lenders and institutional investors could increase interest rates, impose tighter lending standards, refuse to refinance existing debt at maturity at all or on terms similar to our current debt and, in some cases, cease to provide funding to borrowers.\nAn increase in our indebtedness, as well as the credit market and debt and equity capital market conditions discussed above could further negatively impact our ability to remain in compliance with the financial covenants under our revolving credit facility which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. If we are unable to finance our growth as expected, we could be required to seek alternative financing, the terms of which may be less favorable to us, or not pursue growth opportunities.\nWithout additional capital resources, we may be forced to limit or defer our planned natural gas and oil exploration and development program and this will adversely affect the recoverability and ultimate value of our natural gas and oil properties, in turn negatively affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may also be unable to obtain sufficient credit capacity with counterparties to finance the hedging of our future crude oil and natural gas production which may limit our ability to manage price risk. As a result, we may lack the capital necessary to obtain credit necessary to enter into derivative contracts to hedge our future crude oil and natural gas production or to capitalize on other business opportunities.\nWe have been asked by the BOEM to obtain bonds or other surety in order to maintain compliance with BOEM regulations, which may be costly and could potentially reduce borrowings available under our revolving credit facility. To cover the various obligations of lessees on the OCS, such as the cost to plug and abandon wells and decommission and remove platforms and pipelines at the end of production, the BOEM generally requires that lessees post substantial bonds or other acceptable assurances that such obligations will be met unless the BOEM exempts the lessee from such financial assurance requirements. As a result of the bankruptcy of another Gulf of Mexico operator, the BOEM indicated that it may review the estimated cost of future plugging, abandonment, decommissioning and removal obligations of other OCS operators, may evaluate any waivers or exemptions for such financial assurance obligations, and may increase the amount of financial assurance required with respect to these obligations. In April 2015, we received letters from the BOEM stating that certain of our subsidiaries no longer qualify for waiver of certain supplemental bonding requirements for potential offshore decommissioning, plugging and abandonment liabilities. The letters notified us that certain of our subsidiaries must provide approximately $566.5 million in supplemental financial assurance and/or bonding for their offshore oil and gas leases, rights-of-way, and rights-of-use and easements. In June 2015, we reached agreements with the BOEM pursuant to which we provided $54.7 million of supplemental bonds issued to the BOEM, and the BOEM agreed to withdraw its orders with regard to supplemental bonding and\npostpone until November 15, 2015 the issuance of further requirements of us related to these supplemental bonding obligations. On June 30, 2015, we sold the East Bay field and the $566.5 million of requested supplemental bonding was reduced by approximately $178 million.\nOn September 22, 2015, the BOEM issued Draft Guidance relating to supplemental bonding procedures that will, among other things, eliminate the \u201cwaiver\u201d exemption currently allowed by BOEM with respect to supplemental bonding and, instead, broaden the self-insurance approach that would allow more operators on the OCS to seek self-insurance for a portion of their supplemental bond obligations, but only for an amount that is no more than 10% of such operators\u2019 tangible net worth. Further, the Draft Guidance would implement a phased-in period for establishing compliance with supplemental bonding obligations, whereby operators may seek payment of estimated costs of decommissioning obligations owed under a \u201ctailored plan\u201d that is approved by the BOEM and requires payment of the supplemental bonding amount in three equal installment of one-third each, by no later than 120, 240 and 360 calendar days, respectively, from the date of BOEM approval of the tailored plan.\nWe currently maintain approximately $58.3 million in lease and/or area bonds issued to the BOEM and approximately $122.5 million in bonds issued to predecessor third party assignors of certain wells and facilities on leases pursuant to a contractual commitment made by us to those third parties at the time of assignment with respect to the eventual decommissioning of those wells and facilities. Thus, our total supplemental bonding is approximately $180.8 million, with an annual premium expense of $2.7 million. In addition, since June 2015, we have received additional letters from the BOEM in which the BOEM requests additional supplemental bonding for certain other properties previously exempt from supplemental bonding, generally as a result of exempt co-owners either losing their exemptions or no longer owning an interest in the property. Furthermore, we anticipate our supplemental bonding requirements to increase as we further develop or acquire additional properties subject to the BOEM\u2019s financial assurance requirements.\nAlthough we believe we are currently in compliance with the supplemental bonding requirements, the BOEM may in the future continue to review our plugging, abandonment, decommissioning and removal obligations; re-evaluate the adequacy of our financial assurances; and require us to provide additional supplemental bonding or other surety for most or all of our properties. Furthermore, in addition to the Draft Guidance describing revised supplemental bonding procedures that may be used by the BOEM, the BOEM is actively seeking to adjust its financial assurance requirements mandated by rule for all companies operating in federal waters. In August 2014, the BOEM issued an ANPR in which the agency indicated that it was considering bolstering the financial assurance requirements currently mandated by rule. The cost of compliance with our existing supplemental bonding requirements or any other changes to the BOEM\u2019s current bonding requirements or regulations applicable to us or our properties could be substantial and could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations. In addition, we may be required to provide letters of credit to support the issuance of these bonds or other surety. Such letters of credit would likely be issued under our credit facility and would reduce the amount of borrowings available under such facility in the amount of any such letter of credit obligations. We can provide no assurance that we can continue to obtain bonds or other surety in all cases, and if we are unable to obtain the additional required bonds or assurances as requested, the BOEM may require any of our operations on federal leases to be suspended or terminated, and such action could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\nOur estimates of future asset retirement obligations may vary significantly from period to period and are especially significant because our operations include the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. We are required to record a liability for the discounted present value of our asset retirement obligations to plug and abandon inactive, non-producing wells, to remove inactive or damaged platforms, facilities and equipment, and to restore the land or seabed at the end of oil and natural gas production operations. These costs are typically considerably more expensive for offshore operations as compared to most land-based operations due to increased regulatory scrutiny and the logistical issues associated with working in waters of various depths. Estimating future restoration and removal costs in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico is especially difficult because most of the removal obligations are many years in the future, regulatory requirements are subject to change or more restrictive interpretation, and asset removal technologies are constantly evolving, which may result in additional or increased costs. As a result, we may make significant increases or decreases\nto our estimated asset retirement obligations in future periods. For example, because we operate in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, platforms, facilities and equipment are subject to damage or destruction as a result of hurricanes. The estimated cost to plug and abandon a well or dismantle a platform can change dramatically if the host platform from which the work was anticipated to be performed is damaged or toppled rather than structurally intact. Accordingly, our estimate of future asset retirement obligations could differ dramatically from what we may ultimately incur as a result of damage from a hurricane.\nMoreover, the timing for pursuing restoration and removal activities has accelerated for operators in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico following the DOI\u2019s issuance of a NTL, effective October 2010, that established a more stringent regimen for the timely decommissioning of what is known as \u201cidle iron\u201d wells, platforms and pipelines that are no longer producing or serving exploration or support functions with respect to an operator\u2019s lease in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Historically, many oil and natural gas producers in the Gulf of Mexico have delayed the plugging, abandoning or removal of idle iron until they met the final decommissioning regulatory requirement, which has been established as being within one year after the lease expires or terminates, a time period that sometimes is years after use of the idle iron has been discontinued. The idle iron NTL establishes new triggers for commencing decommissioning activities - any well that has not been used during the past five years for exploration or production on active leases and is no longer capable of producing in paying quantities must be permanently plugged or temporarily abandoned within three years\u2019 time. Plugging or abandonment of wells may be delayed by two years if all of such wells\u2019 hydrocarbon and sulfur zones are appropriately isolated. Similarly, platforms or other facilities no longer useful for operations must be removed within five years of the cessation of operations. The triggering of these plugging, abandonment and removal activities under what may be viewed as an accelerated schedule in comparison to historical decommissioning efforts may serve to increase, perhaps materially, our future plugging, abandonment and removal costs, which may translate into a need to increase our estimate of future asset retirement obligations required to meet such increased costs. Moreover, as a result of the implementation of this NTL, there is expected to be increased demand for salvage contractors and equipment operating in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, resulting in increased estimates of plugging, abandonment and removal costs and associated increases in operators\u2019 asset retirement obligations.\nIn addition to the Draft Guidance describing revised supplemental bonding procedures that may be used by the BOEM, in August 2014, the BOEM issued an ANPR in which the agency indicated that it was considering increasing the financial assurance requirements mandated by rule. The cost of compliance with our existing supplemental bonding requirements or any other changes to the BOEM\u2019s current bonding requirements or regulations applicable to us or our properties could be substantial and could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations. We can provide no assurance that we can continue to obtain bonds or other surety in all cases, and if we are unable to obtain the additional required bonds or assurances as requested, the BOEM may require any of our operations on federal leases to be suspended or terminated, and such action could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. Please read \u201cRisk Factors - We have been asked by the BOEM to obtain bonds or other surety in order to maintain compliance with BOEM regulations, which may be costly and could potentially reduce borrowings available under our revolving credit facility.\u201d\nLower oil and gas prices and other factors may result in ceiling test write-downs of our asset carrying values. Under the full cost method of accounting, we are required to perform each quarter, a \u201cceiling test\u201d that determines a limit on the book value of our oil and gas properties. If the net capitalized cost of proved oil and gas properties, net of related deferred income taxes, plus the cost of unevaluated oil and gas properties, exceeds the present value of estimated future net cash flows discounted at 10%, net of related tax effects, plus the cost of unevaluated oil and gas properties, the excess is charged to expense and reflected as additional accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization. As of the reported balance sheet date, capitalized costs of an oil and gas producing company may not exceed the full cost limitation calculated under the above described rule based on the average prices for oil and natural gas. However, if prior to the balance sheet date, we enter into certain hedging arrangements for a portion of our future natural gas and oil production, thereby enabling us to receive future cash flows that are higher than the estimated future cash flows indicated, these higher hedged prices are used if they qualify as cash flow hedges.\nThe recent declines in oil prices have adversely affected our financial position and results of operations and the quantities of oil and natural gas reserves that we can economically produce. For the second, third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2015, we recognized ceiling test write-downs of our oil and natural gas properties totaling $1,678.8 million.\nBased on the average oil and natural gas price calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month for the 12 months ending September 30, 2015, we presently expect to incur an impairment of $300 million to $500 million in the first fiscal quarter of 2016. If the current low commodity price environment or downward trend in oil prices continues beyond first fiscal quarter of 2016, we could incur further impairment to our full cost pool in fiscal 2016 based on the average oil and natural gas price calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the previous 12-month period under the SEC pricing methodology.\nThe present value of future net cash flows from our proved reserves is not necessarily the same as the current market value of our estimated reserves. This Form 10-K contains estimates of our future net cash flows from our proved reserves. We base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on average prices for the preceding twelve-month period and costs in effect at the time of the estimate. As a result of significant recent declines in commodity prices, such average sales prices are significantly in excess of more recent prices. Unless commodity prices or reserves increase, the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves would generally be expected to decrease as additional months with lower commodity sales prices will be included in this calculation in the future. Actual future net cash flows from our natural gas and oil properties will be affected by factors such as:\n\u2022 the volume, pricing and duration of our natural gas and oil hedging contracts;\n\u2022 supply of and demand for natural gas and oil;\n\u2022 actual prices we receive for natural gas and oil;\n\u2022 our actual operating costs in producing natural gas and oil;\n\u2022 the amount and timing of our capital expenditures and decommissioning costs;\n\u2022 the amount and timing of actual production; and\n\u2022 changes in governmental regulations or taxation.\nThe timing of both our production and our incurrence of expenses in connection with the development and production of natural gas and oil properties will affect the timing of actual future net cash flows from proved reserves, and thus their actual present value. In addition, the 10% discount factor we use when calculating discounted future net cash flows may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the natural gas and oil industry in general. Any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur actual recovery of reserves may differ from our proved reserve estimates. This Form 10-K contains estimates of our proved oil and gas reserves. Estimating crude oil and natural gas reserves is complex and inherently imprecise. It requires interpretation of the available technical data and making many assumptions about future conditions, including price and other economic conditions. In preparing such estimates, projection of production rates, timing of development expenditures and available geological, geophysical, production and engineering data are analyzed. The extent, quality and reliability of this data can vary. This process also requires economic assumptions about matters such as oil and natural gas prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. If our interpretations or assumptions used in arriving at our reserve estimates prove to be inaccurate, the amount of oil and gas that will ultimately be recovered may differ materially from the estimated quantities and net present value of reserves owned by us. Any inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions could also\nmaterially affect the estimated quantities of reserves shown in the reserve reports summarized in this Form 10-K. Actual future production, oil and natural gas prices, revenues, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses, decommissioning liabilities and quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves most likely will vary from estimates. In addition, we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history, results of exploration and development, prevailing oil and natural gas prices and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nWe may be limited in our ability to maintain or book additional proved undeveloped reserves under the SEC\u2019s rules. We have included in this Form 10-K certain estimates of our proved reserves as of June 30, 2015 prepared in a manner consistent with our interpretation of the SEC rules relating to modernizing reserve estimation and disclosure requirements for oil and natural gas companies, as well as the interpretation of our independent petroleum consultant who prepares our reserve estimates. Included within these SEC reserve rules is a general requirement that, subject to limited exceptions, proved undeveloped reserves may only be classified as such if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years of the date of booking. This rule may limit our potential to book additional proved undeveloped reserves as we pursue our drilling program. Further, if we postpone drilling of proved undeveloped reserves beyond this five-year development horizon, we may have to write off reserves previously recognized as proved undeveloped. We cannot assure you that our long-term plans will not change based on commodity prices, costs or our liquidity in a manner that would require us to reduce our proved reserve estimate in the future due to the five-year development rule or otherwise. During the year ended June 30, 2015, we were required to reduce proved reserve estimates by 2.8 Mmboe due to the five year development rule.\nThe development of our proved undeveloped reserves may take longer and may require higher levels of capital expenditures than we currently anticipate. Approximately 24% of our proved reserves as of June 30, 2015 were proved undeveloped reserves and may not be ultimately developed or produced. Recovery of proved undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations. The reserves data included in the reserves engineer reports assumes that substantial capital expenditures are required to develop such reserves. We cannot be certain that the estimated costs of the development of these reserves are accurate, that development will occur as scheduled or that the results of such development will be as estimated. In addition, there are external factors such as such as changes in commodity prices, the availability of capital, the availability of drilling rigs (capable of drilling in the given area), that could result in certain development plans being delayed and/or accelerated relative to the current schedule.\nDelays in the development of our reserves or increases in costs to drill and develop such reserves will reduce the present value of our estimated proved undeveloped reserves and future net revenues estimated for such reserves and may result in some projects becoming uneconomic. For example, our proved reserves of 57.2 Mmboe and $826 million of PV-10 as of June 30, 2015 were lower than our proved reserves of 89.5 Mboe and $2,482 million of PV-10 as of June 30, 2014 in part due to the rescheduling or write off of certain of our reserves as a result of lower oil and gas prices and reductions in our capital expenditure budget as compared to our June 30, 2014 reserve report. Delays in the development of these reserves could cause us to have to reclassify our proved reserves as unproved reserves. Please read \u201cBusiness - Development of Proved Undeveloped Reserves.\u201d\nAs of June 30, 2015, approximately 24% of our total proved reserves were undeveloped and approximately 23% of our total proved reserves were developed non-producing. There can be no assurance that all of those reserves will ultimately be developed or produced. While we have plans or are in the process of developing plans for exploiting and producing a majority of our proved reserves, there can be no assurance that all of those reserves will ultimately be developed or produced. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that all of our undeveloped and developed non-producing reserves will ultimately be produced during the time periods we have planned, at the costs we have budgeted, or at all, which could result in the write-off of previously recognized reserves.\nUnless we replace crude oil and natural gas reserves, our future reserves and production will decline. A large portion of our drilling activity is located in mature oil-producing areas of the GoM shelf. Accordingly, increases in our future crude oil and natural gas production depend on our success in finding or acquiring additional reserves that are economically recoverable. If we are unable to replace reserves through drilling or acquisitions on economic terms, our level of production and cash flows will be adversely affected. In general, production from oil and gas properties declines as reserves are depleted, with the rate of decline depending on reservoir characteristics. Our total proved reserves decline as reserves are produced unless we conduct other successful exploration and development activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves, or both. Our ability to make the necessary capital investment to maintain or expand our asset base of crude oil and natural gas reserves would be impaired to the extent cash flow from operations is reduced and external sources of capital become limited or unavailable. We may not be successful in exploring for, developing or acquiring additional reserves. We also may not be successful in obtaining funds to acquire additional reserves.\nProduction periods or reserve lives for Gulf of Mexico properties subject us to higher reserve replacement needs and may impair our ability to reduce production during periods of low oil and natural gas prices. High production rates generally result in recovery of a relatively higher percentage of reserves from properties in the Gulf of Mexico during the initial few years when compared to other regions in the U.S. Typically, 50% of the reserves of properties in the Gulf of Mexico are depleted within three to four years with natural gas wells having a higher rate of depletion than oil wells. Due to high initial production rates, production of reserves from reservoirs in the Gulf of Mexico generally decline more rapidly than from other producing reservoirs. The vast majority of our existing operations are in the Gulf of Mexico. As a result, our reserve replacement needs from new prospects may be greater than those of other oil and gas companies with longer-life reserves in other producing areas. Also, our expected revenues and return on capital will depend on prices prevailing during these relatively short production periods. Our need to generate revenues to fund ongoing capital commitments or repay debt may limit our ability to slow or shut in production from producing wells during periods of low prices for oil and natural gas.\nThe borrowing base under our revolving credit facility may be reduced in the future if commodity prices decline, which will limit our available funding for exploration and development. We may have difficulty obtaining additional credit, which could adversely affect our operations and financial position. We and EGC depend on the revolving credit facility for a portion of its future capital needs. As of June 30, 2015, our borrowing base under our revolving credit sub-facility was $150 million of the total $500 million borrowing base of EGC\u2019s revolving credit facility. As of June 30, 2015, we had borrowed the full $150 million.\nIn the future, we and EGC may not be able to access adequate funding under the revolving credit facility as a result of (1) a decrease in the borrowing base due to the outcome of a subsequent borrowing base redetermination, or (2) an unwillingness or inability on the part of the lending counterparties to meet their funding obligations.\nOur borrowing base will be redetermined semi-annually by our lenders in their sole discretion. We expect the next determination of the borrowing base under the revolving credit facility will occur in the fall of 2015, although an early redetermination is possible. In addition, the lenders can unilaterally adjust the borrowing base and the borrowings permitted to be outstanding under our revolving credit facility. The lenders will redetermine the borrowing base based on an engineering report with respect to our natural gas and oil reserves, which will take into account the prevailing natural gas and oil prices at such time. If oil and natural gas commodity prices continue to deteriorate, the revised borrowing base under our revolving credit facility may be reduced. If the borrowing base is reduced or maintained, the new borrowing base is subject to approval by banks holding not less than 67% of the lending commitments under our revolving credit facility, and the final borrowing base may be lower than the level recommended by the agent for the bank group. As we have borrowed all available capacity under our current borrowing base, if our borrowing base were adjusted downward, we would be required to pay down amounts outstanding under our revolving credit sub-facility to reduce our level of borrowing, or we must pledge other natural gas and oil properties as\ncollateral. We do not currently have any substantial properties which could serve as additional collateral, and we may not have the financial resources in the future to make any mandatory principal prepayments required under our revolving credit facility. If funding is not available from internally generated cash flow, additional borrowings from or investments by EGC in the Company when needed, or is available only on unfavorable terms, it could adversely affect our development plans as currently anticipated, which could have a material adverse effect on our production, revenues and results of operations.\nOur production, revenue and cash flow from operating activities are derived from assets that are concentrated in a single geographic area, making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating in one geographic area. Unlike other entities that are geographically diversified, we do not have the resources to effectively diversify our operations or benefit from the possible spreading of risks or offsetting of losses. By consummating acquisitions only in the Gulf of Mexico and the U.S. Gulf Coast, our lack of diversification may:\n\u2022 subject us to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have an adverse impact upon the particular industry in which we operate; and\n\u2022 result in our dependency upon a single or limited number of hydrocarbon basins.\nIn addition, the geographic concentration of our properties in the Gulf of Mexico and the U.S. Gulf Coast means that some or all of the properties could be affected should the region experience:\n\u2022 severe weather, such as hurricanes and other adverse weather conditions;\n\u2022 delays or decreases in production, the availability of equipment, facilities or services;\n\u2022 delays or decreases in the availability of capacity to transport, gather or process production; and/or\n\u2022 changes in the regulatory environment.\nDuring the 2008 hurricane season, production from certain of our properties was reduced as a result of damage to third party pipelines caused by two hurricanes. The hurricane damage limited our ability to sell our production from certain properties for extended periods of time during the third and fourth quarters of 2008. If mechanical problems, storms or other events were to curtail a substantial portion of the production, such a curtailment could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In accordance with industry practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks and losses. For additional information, please read \u201c- Our insurance may not protect us against all of the operating risks to which our business is exposed.\u201d\nBecause all or a number of the properties could experience many of the same conditions at the same time, these conditions could have a relatively greater impact on our results of operations than they might have on other producers who have properties over a wider geographic area.\nThe nature of our business involves numerous uncertainties and operating risks that can prevent us from realizing profits and can cause substantial losses. We engage in exploration and development drilling activities, which are inherently risky. These activities may be unsuccessful for many reasons. In addition to a failure to find oil or natural gas, drilling efforts can be affected by adverse weather conditions such as hurricanes and tropical storms in the Gulf of Mexico, cost overruns, equipment shortages and mechanical difficulties. Therefore, the successful drilling of an oil or gas well does not ensure we will realize a profit on our investment. A variety of factors, both geological and market-related, could cause a well to become uneconomic or only marginally economic. In addition to their costs, unsuccessful wells could impede our efforts to replace reserves.\nOur business involves a variety of operating risks, which include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022 fires;\n\u2022 explosions;\n\u2022 blow-outs and surface cratering;\n\u2022 uncontrollable flows of gas, oil and formation water;\n\u2022 natural disasters, such as hurricanes and other adverse weather conditions;\n\u2022 pipe, cement, subsea well or pipeline failures;\n\u2022 casing collapses;\n\u2022 mechanical difficulties, such as lost or stuck oil field drilling and service tools;\n\u2022 abnormally pressured formations; and\n\u2022 environmental hazards, such as gas leaks, oil spills, pipeline ruptures and discharges of toxic gases.\nIf we experience any of these problems, well bores, platforms, gathering systems and processing facilities could be affected, which could adversely affect our ability to conduct operations. We could also incur substantial losses due to costs and/or liability incurred as a result of:\n\u2022 injury or loss of life;\n\u2022 severe damage to and destruction of property, natural resources and equipment;\n\u2022 pollution and other environmental damage;\n\u2022 clean-up responsibilities;\n\u2022 regulatory investigation and penalties;\n\u2022 suspension of our operations; and\n\u2022 repairs to resume operations.\nOur offshore operations involve special risks that could affect our operations adversely. Offshore operations are subject to a variety of operating risks specific to the marine environment, such as capsizing, collisions and damage or loss from hurricanes or other adverse weather conditions. These conditions can cause substantial damage to facilities and interrupt production. As a result, we could incur substantial liabilities that could reduce or eliminate the funds available for exploration, development or leasehold acquisitions, or result in loss of equipment and properties. In particular, we are not intending to put in place business interruption insurance due to its high cost. We therefore may not be able to rely on insurance coverage in the event of such natural phenomena.\nUnanticipated decommissioning costs could materially adversely affect our future financial position and results of operations. We may become responsible for unanticipated costs associated with abandoning and reclaiming wells, facilities and pipelines. Abandonment and reclamation of facilities and the costs associated therewith is often referred to as \u201cdecommissioning.\u201d Should decommissioning be required that is not presently anticipated or the decommissioning be accelerated, such as can happen after a hurricane, such costs may exceed the value of reserves remaining at any particular time. We may have to draw on funds from other sources to satisfy such costs. The use of other funds to satisfy such decommissioning costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nOur insurance may not protect us against all of the operating risks to which our business is exposed. We maintain insurance for some, but not all, of the potential risks and liabilities associated with our business. For some risks, we may not obtain insurance if we believe the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. Due to market conditions, including with respect to commodity prices\nsuch as for oil and natural gas, premiums and deductibles for certain insurance policies can increase substantially, and in some instances, certain insurance policies are economically unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. Consistent with industry practice, we are not fully insured against all risks, including high-cost business interruption insurance and drilling and completion risks that are generally not recoverable from third parties or insurance. In addition, pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. Losses and liabilities from uninsured and underinsured events and delay in the payment of insurance proceeds could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Due to a number of catastrophic events like the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, Hurricanes Ivan, Katrina, Rita, Gustav and Ike, and the April 20, 2010 Deepwater Horizon incident, insurance underwriters increased insurance premiums for many of the coverages historically maintained and issued general notices of cancellation and significant changes for a wide variety of insurance coverages. The oil and natural gas industry suffered damage from Hurricanes Ivan, Katrina, Rita, Gustav and Ike. As a result, insurance costs have increased significantly from the costs that similarly situated participants in this industry have historically incurred. Insurers are requiring higher retention levels and limit the amount of insurance proceeds that are available after a major wind storm in the event that damages are incurred. If storm activity in the future is severe, insurance underwriters may no longer insure Gulf of Mexico assets against weather-related damage. In addition, we do not intend to put in place business interruption insurance due to its high cost. If an accident or other event resulting in damage to our operations, including severe weather, terrorist acts, war, civil disturbances, pollution or environmental damage, occurs and is not fully covered by insurance or a recoverable indemnity from a vendor, it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, we may not be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable or be able to obtain insurance against certain risks.\nWeather Based Insurance Linked Securities may not payout in case of a hurricane or may not fully cover damage. We utilize Weather Based Insurance Linked Securities (\u201cSecurities\u201d) to supplement our windstorm insurance coverage to mitigate potential loss to our most valuable oil and gas properties from hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico. These Securities are generally structured to provide for payments of negotiated amounts should a hurricane having a pre-established category pass within specific pre-defined areas encompassing our oil and gas producing fields. While these Securities are meant to provide some excess windstorm coverage, there can be no certainty that these Securities will meet the payout criteria even if there is substantial damage by a hurricane of a lower category than that specified in the Securities. In addition, the payment made may not be sufficient to cover any actual damage incurred from a storm.\nCompetition for oil and gas properties and prospects is intense and some of our competitors have larger financial, technical and personnel resources that could give them an advantage in evaluating and obtaining properties and prospects. We operate in a highly competitive environment for reviewing prospects, acquiring properties, marketing oil and gas and securing trained personnel. Many of our competitors are major or independent oil and gas companies that possess and employ financial resources that allow them to obtain substantially greater technical and personnel resources than ours. We actively compete with other companies when acquiring new leases or oil and gas properties. For example, new leases acquired from the BOEM are acquired through a \u201csealed bid\u201d process and are generally awarded to the highest bidder. These additional resources can be particularly important in reviewing prospects and purchasing properties. The competitors may also have a greater ability to continue drilling activities during periods of low oil and gas prices, such as the current decline in oil prices, and to absorb the burden of current and future governmental regulations and taxation. Competitors may be able to evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or personnel resources permit. Competitors may also be able to pay more for productive oil and gas properties and exploratory prospects than we are able or willing to pay. Further, our competitors may be able to expend greater resources on the existing and changing technologies that we believe will impact attaining success in the industry. If we are unable to compete successfully in these areas in the future, our future revenues and growth may be diminished or restricted.\nMarket conditions or transportation impediments may hinder access to oil and gas markets, delay production or increase our costs. Market conditions (including with respect to commodity prices such as for oil and natural gas), the unavailability of satisfactory oil and natural gas transportation or the remote location of our drilling operations may hinder our access to oil and natural gas markets or delay production. The availability of a ready market for oil and gas production depends on a number of factors, including the demand for and supply of oil and gas and the proximity of reserves to pipelines or trucking and terminal facilities. In deepwater operations, market access depends on the proximity of and our ability to tie into existing production platforms owned or operated by others and the ability to negotiate commercially satisfactory arrangements with the owners or operators. We may be required to shut in wells or delay initial production for lack of a market or because of inadequacy or unavailability of pipeline or gathering system capacity. Restrictions on our ability to sell our oil and natural gas may have several other adverse effects, including higher transportation costs, fewer potential purchasers (thereby potentially resulting in a lower selling price) or, in the event we were unable to market and sustain production from a particular lease for an extended time, possible loss of a lease due to lack of production. In the event that we encounter restrictions in our ability to tie our production to a gathering system, we may face considerable delays from the initial discovery of a reservoir to the actual production of the oil and gas and realization of revenues. In some cases, our wells may be tied back to platforms owned by parties with no economic interests in these wells. There can be no assurance that owners of such platforms will continue to operate the platforms. If the owners cease to operate the platforms or their processing equipment, we may be required to shut in the associated wells, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nMost of our undeveloped leasehold acreage is subject to leases that will expire over the next several years unless production is established on units containing the acreage. We own leasehold interests in areas not currently held by production. Unless production in paying quantities is established on units containing certain of these leases during their terms, the leases will expire. If our leases expire, we will lose our right to develop the related properties. We currently do not have leases expiring in fiscal years 2016 or 2017, but leases covering approximately 21% of our net acreage could potentially expire in fiscal year 2018.\nOur drilling plans for areas not currently held by production are subject to change based upon various factors, including factors that are beyond our control, including drilling results, oil and natural gas prices, the availability and cost of capital, drilling and production costs, availability of drilling services and equipment, gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints and regulatory approvals. On our acreage that we do not operate, we have less control over the timing of drilling, therefore there is additional risk of expirations occurring in those sections.\nWe are not the operator on all of our properties and therefore are not in a position to control the timing of development efforts, the associated costs, or the rate of production of the reserves on such properties. As we carry out our planned drilling program, we will not serve as operator of all planned wells. We operated approximately 88% of our proved reserves (including approximately 24% attributable to the South Pass 49 field operated by Energy XXI) at June 30, 2015. As a result, we may have limited ability to exercise influence over the operations of some non-operated properties or their associated costs. Dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects, and limited ability to influence operations and associated costs could prevent the realization of targeted returns on capital in drilling or acquisition activities. The success and timing of development and exploitation activities on properties operated by others depend upon a number of factors that will be largely outside of our control, including:\n\u2022 the timing and amount of capital expenditures;\n\u2022 the availability of suitable offshore drilling rigs, drilling equipment, support vessels, production and transportation infrastructure and qualified operating personnel;\n\u2022 the operator\u2019s expertise and financial resources;\n\u2022 approval of other participants in drilling wells;\n\u2022 selection of technology; and\n\u2022 the rate of production of the reserves.\nEach of these factors, including others, could materially adversely affect the realization of our targeted returns on capital in drilling or acquisition activities and lead to unexpected future costs.\nWe are exposed to trade credit risk in the ordinary course of our business activities. We are exposed to risks of loss in the event of nonperformance by our vendors, customers and by counterparties to our price risk management arrangements. Some of our vendors, customers and counterparties may be highly leveraged and subject to their own operating and regulatory risks. Many of our vendors, customers and counterparties finance their activities through cash flow from operations, the incurrence of debt or the issuance of equity. From time to time, the availability of credit is more restrictive. Additionally, many of our vendors\u2019, customers\u2019 and counterparties\u2019 equity values have substantially declined. The combination of reduction of cash flow resulting from declines in commodity prices and the lack of availability of debt or equity financing may result in a significant reduction in our vendors, customers and counterparties liquidity and ability to make payments or perform on their obligations to us. Even if our credit review and analysis mechanisms work properly, we may experience financial losses in our dealings with other parties. Any increase in the nonpayment or nonperformance by our vendors, customers and/or counterparties could reduce our cash flows.\nWe sell the majority of our production to three customers. Chevron, ConocoPhillips and Shell each accounted for approximately 58%, 20%, and 20% respectively, of our total oil and natural gas revenues during the year ended June 30, 2015. Our inability to continue to sell our production to Chevron, ConocoPhillips or Shell, if not offset by sales with new or other existing customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nOur success depends on dedicated and skillful management and staff, whose departure could disrupt our business operations. Our success depends on our ability to retain and attract experienced engineers, geoscientists and other professional staff. We depend to a large extent on the efforts, technical expertise and continued employment of these personnel and members of our management team. If a significant number of them resign or become unable to continue in their present role and if they are not adequately replaced, our business operations could be adversely affected.\nAdditionally, if John D. Schiller, Jr. ceases to be the chief executive officer of Energy XXI (except as a result of his death or disability) and a reasonably acceptable successor is not appointed within 180 days, the lenders of our revolving credit facility could declare amounts outstanding thereunder immediately due and payable. Such an event could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nThe unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, personnel and oil field services could adversely affect our ability to execute exploration and exploitation plans on a timely basis and within budget, and consequently could adversely affect our anticipated cash flow. We utilize third-party services to maximize the efficiency of our organization. The cost of oil field services may increase or decrease depending on the demand for services by other oil and gas companies. There is no assurance that we will be able to contract for such services on a timely basis or that the cost of such services will remain at a satisfactory or affordable level. Shortages or the high cost of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies or personnel could delay or adversely affect our exploitation and exploration operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIf we place hedges on future production and encounter difficulties meeting that production, we may not realize the originally anticipated cash flows. Our assets consist of a mix of reserves, with some being developed while others are undeveloped. To the extent that we sell the production of these reserves on a forward-looking basis but do not realize that anticipated level of production, our cash flow may be adversely affected if energy prices rise above the prices\nfor the forward-looking sales. In this case, we would be required to make payments to the purchaser of the forward-looking sale equal to the difference between the current commodity price and that in the sales contract multiplied by the physical volume of the shortfall. There is the risk that production estimates could be inaccurate or that storms or other unanticipated problems could cause the production to be less than the amount anticipated, causing us to make payments to the purchasers pursuant to the terms of the hedging contracts.\nOur price risk management activities could result in financial losses or could reduce our income, which may adversely affect our cash flows. We enter into derivative contracts to reduce the impact of oil and natural gas price volatility on our cash flow from operations. Currently, we use a combination of crude oil and natural gas put, swap and collar arrangements to mitigate the volatility of future oil and natural gas prices received on our production.\nOur actual future production may be significantly higher or lower than we estimate at the time we enter into derivative contracts for such period. If the actual amount of production is higher than we estimate, we will have greater commodity price exposure than we intended. If the actual amount of production is lower than the notional amount that is subject to our derivative financial instruments, we might be forced to satisfy all or a portion of our derivative transactions without the benefit of the cash flow from our sale of the underlying physical commodity, resulting in a substantial decrease in our liquidity. As a result of these factors, our hedging activities may not be as effective as we intend in reducing the volatility of our cash flows, and in certain circumstances may actually increase the volatility of our cash flows. In addition, our price risk management activities are subject to the following risks:\n\u2022 a counterparty may not perform its obligation under the applicable derivative instrument;\n\u2022 production is less than expected;\n\u2022 there may be a change in the expected differential between the underlying commodity price in the derivative instrument and the actual price received; and\n\u2022 the steps we take to monitor our derivative financial instruments may not detect and prevent violations of our risk management policies and procedures.\nDuring periods of declining commodity prices, our commodity price derivative positions increase, which increases our counterparty exposure.\nDeepwater operations present special risks that may adversely affect the cost and timing of reserve development. Currently, we own interests in one undeveloped lease in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and we have a non-operated interest in one developed lease. We may evaluate additional activity in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico in the future. Exploration for oil or natural gas in the deepwater of the Gulf of Mexico generally involves greater operational and financial risks than exploration on the shelf. Deepwater drilling generally requires more time and more advanced drilling technologies, involving a higher risk of technological failure and usually higher drilling costs. Deepwater wells often use subsea completion techniques with subsea trees tied back to host production facilities with flow lines. The installation of these subsea trees and flow lines requires substantial time and the use of advanced remote installation mechanics. These operations may encounter mechanical difficulties and equipment failures that could result in cost overruns. Furthermore, the deepwater operations generally lack the physical and oilfield service infrastructure present on the shelf. As a result, a considerable amount of time may elapse between a deepwater discovery and the marketing of the associated oil or natural gas, increasing both the financial and operational risk involved with these operations. Because of the lack and high cost of infrastructure, some reserve discoveries in the deepwater may never be produced economically.\nAdditional deepwater drilling laws and regulations, delays in the processing and approval of drilling permits and exploration and oil spill response plans, and other related restrictions arising after the Deepwater Horizon incident in the Gulf of Mexico may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. In response to the Deepwater Horizon incident in the Gulf of Mexico in April 2010, BSEE and BOEM, each agencies of the U.S. Department of the Interior, have imposed new and more stringent permitting procedures and regulatory safety and performance requirements for new wells to be drilled in federal waters. These governmental agencies have also implemented and enforced new rules, Notices to Lessees and Operators and temporary drilling moratoria that imposed safety and operational performance measures on exploration, development and production operators in the Gulf of Mexico or otherwise resulted in a temporary cessation of drilling activities. Compliance with these added and more stringent regulatory restrictions in addition to any uncertainties or inconsistencies in current decisions and rulings by governmental agencies and delays in the processing and approval of drilling permits and exploration, development and oil spill response plans could adversely affect or delay new drilling and ongoing development efforts. Moreover, these governmental agencies are continuing to evaluate aspects of safety and operational performance in the Gulf of Mexico and, as a result, are developing and implementing new, more restrictive requirements such as, for example, the 2013 amendments to the federal Workplace Safety Rule regarding the utilization of a more comprehensive safety and environmental management system, (\u201cSEMS\u201d), which amended rule is sometimes referred to as SEMS II, and, more recently, the April 17, 2015 proposed rulemaking by the BSEE that would impose more stringent requirements with respect to use of blow out preventers and related well control equipment.\nAmong other adverse impacts, these additional measures could delay or disrupt our operations, increase the risk of expired leases due to the time required to develop new technology, result in increased supplemental bonding requirements and incurrence of associated added costs, limit operational activities in certain areas, or cause us to incur penalties, fines, or shut-in production at one or more of our facilities. If similar material spill incidents were to occur in the future, the United States or other countries could elect again to issue directives to temporarily cease drilling activities and, in any event, may from time to time issue further safety and environmental laws and regulations regarding offshore oil and natural gas exploration and development. We cannot predict the full impact of any new laws or regulations on our drilling operations or on the cost or availability of insurance to cover some or all of the risks associated with such operations.\nFurther, the deepwater areas of the Gulf of Mexico (as well as international deepwater locations) lack the degree of physical and oilfield service infrastructure present in shallower waters. Therefore, despite our oil spill response capabilities, it may be difficult for us to quickly or effectively execute any contingency plans related to future events similar to the Deepwater Horizon incident. The matters described above, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\nIf we are unable to acquire or renew permits and approvals required for operations, we may be forced to suspend or cease operations altogether. The construction and operation of energy projects require numerous permits and approvals from governmental agencies. In addition, many governmental agencies have increased regulatory oversight and permitting requirements in recent years. We may not be able to obtain all necessary permits and approvals or obtain them in a timely manner, and as a result our operations may be adversely affected. In addition, obtaining all necessary permits and approvals may necessitate substantial expenditures to comply with the requirements of these permits and approvals, future changes to these permits or approvals, or any adverse changes in the interpretation of existing permits and approvals, and these may create a risk of expensive delays or loss of value if a project is unable to proceed as planned due to changing requirements or local opposition.\nOur operations are subject to environmental and other government laws and regulations that are costly and could potentially subject us to substantial liabilities. As described in more detail below, our business activities are subject to regulation by multiple federal, state and local governmental agencies. Our historical and projected operating costs reflect the recurring costs\nresulting from compliance with these regulations, and we do not anticipate material expenditures in excess of these amounts in the absence of future acquisitions or changes in regulation, or discovery of existing but unknown compliance issues. Additional proposals and proceedings that affect the oil and gas industries are regularly considered by Congress, the states, regulatory commissions and agencies, and the courts. We cannot predict when or whether any such proposals may become effective or the magnitude of the impact changes in laws and regulations may have on our business; however, additions or enhancements to the regulatory burden on our industry generally increase the cost of doing business and affect our profitability.\nOur oil and gas exploration, production, and related operations are subject to extensive rules and regulations promulgated by federal, state, and local agencies. Failure to comply with such rules and regulations can result in substantial penalties. The regulatory burden on the oil and gas industry increases our cost of doing business and affects our profitability. Because such rules and regulations are frequently amended or reinterpreted, we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of complying with such laws.\nAll of the jurisdictions in which we operate generally require permits for drilling operations, drilling bonds, and reports concerning operations and impose other requirements relating to the exploration and production of oil and gas. Such jurisdictions also have statutes or regulations addressing conservation matters, including provisions for the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties, the establishment of maximum rates of production from oil and gas wells and the spacing, plugging and abandonment of such wells. The statutes and regulations of certain jurisdictions also limit the rate at which oil and gas can be produced from our properties.\nFERC regulates interstate natural gas transportation rates and terms of service, which affect the marketing of gas we produce, as well as the revenues we receive for sales of such production. Since the mid-1980s, FERC has issued various orders that have significantly altered the marketing and transportation of gas. These orders resulted in a fundamental restructuring of interstate pipeline sales and transportation services, including the unbundling by interstate pipelines of the sales, transportation, storage and other components of the city-gate sales services such pipelines previously performed. These FERC actions were designed to increase competition within all phases of the gas industry. The interstate regulatory framework may enhance our ability to market and transport our gas, although it may also subject us to greater competition and to the more restrictive pipeline imbalance tolerances and greater associated penalties for violation of such tolerances.\nOur sales of oil and natural gas liquids are not presently regulated and are made at market prices. The price we receive from the sale of those products is affected by the cost of transporting the products to market. FERC has implemented regulations establishing an indexing methodology for interstate transportation rates for oil pipelines, which, generally, would index such rate to inflation, subject to certain conditions and limitations. We are not able to predict with any certainty what effect, if any, these regulations will have on us, but, other factors being equal, the regulations may, over time, tend to increase transportation costs which may have the effect of reducing wellhead prices for oil and natural gas liquids.\nUnder the EPAct 2005, FERC has civil penalty authority under the NGA to impose penalties for current violations of up to $1 million per day for each violation and disgorgement of profits associated with any violation. While our operations have not been regulated by FERC under the NGA, FERC has adopted regulations that may subject certain of our otherwise non-FERC jurisdictional entities to FERC annual reporting and daily scheduled flow and capacity posting requirements, as described more fully in Item 1 above. Additional rules and legislation pertaining to those and other matters may be considered or adopted by FERC from time to time. Failure to comply with those regulations in the future could subject us to civil penalty liability.\nAlthough FERC has not made any formal determinations with respect to any of our facilities, we believe that our natural gas gathering pipelines meet the traditional tests that FERC has used to determine if a pipeline is a gathering pipeline and are therefore not subject to FERC\u2019s jurisdiction. The distinction between FERC-regulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services has been the subject of substantial litigation, however, and, over time, FERC\u2019s policy for determining which facilities it regulates has changed. In addition, the distinction between FERC-regulated transmission facilities, on the one hand, and gathering facilities, on the other, is a fact-based determination made by FERC on a case-by-case basis. If FERC were to consider the status of an individual facility and determine that the facility and/or services\nprovided by it are not exempt from FERC regulation under the NGA and that the facility provides interstate service, the rates for, and terms and conditions of, services provided by such facility would be subject to regulation by FERC under the NGA or the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (NGPA). Such regulation could decrease revenue, increase operating costs, and, depending upon the facility in question, could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. In addition, if any of our facilities were found to have provided services or otherwise operated in violation of the NGA or NGPA, this could result in the imposition of civil penalties as well as a requirement to disgorge charges collected for such service in excess of the rate established by FERC.\nState regulation of gathering facilities includes safety, environmental and, in some circumstances, nondiscriminatory take requirements and in some instances complaint-based rate regulation. Our gathering operations may also be subject to state ratable take and common purchaser statutes, designed to prohibit discrimination in favor of one producer over another or one source of supply over another. State and local regulation may cause us to incur additional costs or limit our operations and can have the effect of imposing some restrictions on our ability as an owner of gathering facilities to decide with whom we contract to gather natural gas. Failure to comply with state regulations can result in the imposition of administrative, civil and criminal remedies.\nOur oil and gas operations are subject to stringent laws and regulations relating to the release or disposal of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. These laws and regulations:\n\u2022 require the acquisition of a permit before drilling commences;\n\u2022 restrict the types, quantities and concentration of substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling and production activities;\n\u2022 limit or prohibit drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas; and\n\u2022 impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from operations.\nFailure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in:\n\u2022 the imposition of administrative, civil and/or criminal penalties;\n\u2022 incurring investigatory or remedial obligations; and\n\u2022 the imposition of injunctive relief, which could limit or restrict our operations.\nChanges in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently, and any changes that result in more stringent or costly waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or cleanup requirements could require us to make significant expenditures to attain and maintain compliance and may otherwise have a material adverse effect on our industry in general and on our own results of operations, competitive position or financial condition. Although we intend to be in compliance in all material respects with all applicable environmental laws and regulations, we cannot assure shareholders that we will be able to comply with existing or new regulations. In addition, the risk of accidental spills, leakages or other circumstances could expose us to extensive liability.\nUnder certain environmental laws that impose strict, joint and several liability, we could be held liable for the removal or remediation of previously released materials or property contamination regardless of whether we were responsible for the release or contamination, and regardless of whether current or prior operations were conducted in compliance with all applicable laws and consistent with accepted standards of practice at the time those actions were taken. In addition, claims for damages to persons or property may result from environmental and other impacts of our operations. Such liabilities can be significant, and if imposed could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are unable to predict the effect of additional environmental laws and regulations that may be adopted in the future, including whether any such laws or regulations would materially adversely increase our cost of doing business or affect operations in any area.\nRate regulation may not allow us to recover the full amount of increases in our costs. We have ownership interests in oil pipelines that are subject to regulation by FERC. Rates for service on our system are set using FERC\u2019s price indexing methodology. The indexing method currently allows a pipeline to increase its rates by a percentage factor equal to the change in the producer price index for finished goods plus 2.65 percent. When the index falls, we are required to reduce rates if they exceed the new maximum allowable rate. In addition, changes in the index might not be large enough to fully reflect actual increases in our costs.\nFERC\u2019s indexing methodology is subject to review every five years. The current or any revised indexing formula could hamper our ability to recover our costs because: (1) the indexing methodology is tied to an inflation index; (2) it is not based on pipeline-specific costs; and (3) it could be reduced in comparison to the current formula. Any of the foregoing would adversely affect our revenues and cash flow. FERC could limit our pipeline\u2019s ability to set rates based on its costs, order our pipelines to reduce rates, require the payment of refunds or reparations to shippers, or any or all of these actions, which could adversely affect our financial position, cash flows, and results of operations. If FERC\u2019s ratemaking methodology changes, the new methodology could also result in tariffs that generate lower revenues and cash flow.\nBased on the way our oil pipelines are operated, we believe that the only transportation on our pipelines that is subject to the jurisdiction of FERC is the transportation specified in the tariff we have on file with FERC. We cannot guarantee that the jurisdictional status of transportation on our pipelines and related facilities will remain unchanged, however. Should circumstances change, then currently non-jurisdictional transportation could be found to be FERC-jurisdictional. In that case, FERC\u2019s ratemaking methodologies may limit our ability to set rates based on our actual costs, may delay the use of rates that reflect increased costs, and may subject us to potentially burdensome and expensive operational, reporting and other requirements. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf our tariff rates are successfully challenged, we could be required to reduce our tariff rates, which would reduce our revenues.\nShippers on our pipelines are free to challenge, or to cause other parties to challenge or assist others in challenging, our existing or proposed tariff rates. If any party successfully challenges our tariff rates, the effect would be to reduce revenues.\nOur sales of oil and natural gas, and any hedging activities related to such energy commodities, expose us to potential regulatory risks. FERC, the FTC and the CFTC hold statutory authority to regulate certain segments of the physical and futures energy commodities markets relevant to our business. These agencies have imposed broad regulations prohibiting fraud and manipulation of such markets. With regard to our physical sales of oil and natural gas, and any hedging activities related to these commodities, we are required to observe and comply with these anti-fraud and anti-manipulation regulations. Failure to comply with such regulations, as interpreted and enforced, could materially and adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal controls that, if not properly corrected, could result in material misstatements in our financial statements. Our management has identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2015. Further, we have determined that control deficiencies existed with respect to certain aspects of our historical financial reporting subsequent to the Merger, and accordingly, we have concluded that our reports subsequent to the Merger on disclosure controls and procedures may not have been correct and reports subsequent to the Merger on internal control over financial reporting and changes in internal control over financial reporting may have been incorrect. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies in internal controls over financial reporting that results in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nWe did not maintain properly designed controls over the contemporaneous formal documentation that we had prepared subsequent to the Merger to support our initial designations of derivative financial instruments as cash flow hedges in connection with our crude oil and natural gas hedging program. Specifically, the controls in place subsequent to the Merger relating to the documentation of hedge designations were not properly designed to provide reasonable assurance that these derivative contracts would be properly recorded and disclosed in the financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. As a result subsequent to the Merger, our controls failed to detect that our formal hedge documentation did not meet the technical requirements to qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment in accordance with ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging. The primary reason for this determination was that the formal hedge documentation lacked specificity of the hedged items and, therefore, the designations failed to meet hedge documentation requirements for cash flow hedge accounting treatment. Effective June 30, 2015, management discontinued the use of hedge accounting on all derivative contracts and does not expect the material weakness associated with hedge accounting to recur. If, in the future, we were to begin to designate our derivatives as hedges we would need to enhance our controls regarding consideration of all sources of ineffectiveness.\nIn addition, we recently learned that, in 2007, 2009 and 2014, the Chief Executive Officer of our parent company Energy XXI Ltd borrowed funds from personal acquaintances or their affiliates, certain of whom provided the Company with services. We also learned that Norman Louie, one of the directors of our parent company, made a personal loan to Mr. Schiller in 2014 before Mr. Louie became a director of our parent. At the time the loan was made, Mr. Louie was a managing director at Mount Kellett Capital Management LP, which at the time, and as of June 30, 2015, owned a majority interest in Energy XXI M21K, in which our parent owned a 20% interest (and purchased the remaining 80% interest subsequent to June 30, 2015), and 6.3% of our parent\u2019s common stock. The loans made in 2014 are still outstanding. Since Mr. Schiller did not disclose the personal loans before they were made, our parent\u2019s board of directors has determined that he did not comply with the procedural requirements of the Company\u2019s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. Upon learning of Mr. Schiller\u2019s personal loans from affiliates of service providers, our parent\u2019s board of directors engaged independent legal counsel to conduct an internal investigation, with the assistance of outside forensic accountants, to review these loans and vendor procurement processes across the organization, including EPL. Our parent\u2019s board of directors is still reviewing the results of the internal investigation. Although the internal investigation has not uncovered any illegal activity or any impact on parent or EPL\u2019s financial reporting or financial statements, we have concluded this non-compliance to be a material weakness in its control environment given the leadership position of this officer, the visibility and importance of his actions to the Company\u2019s overall system of controls and the significance with which the Company views this nondisclosure. As part of its review, our parent\u2019s board of directors has begun the process of designing and implementing additional controls and procedures, including, but not limited to, strengthening the vendor procurement procedures across the organization including EPL to address any potential conflicts of interest that could arise from Mr. Schiller\u2019s personal loans; revising our parent\u2019s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics to explicitly ban any such personal loans in the future; and implementing an enhanced comprehensive training program on our parent\u2019s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics.\nIf we are not able to remedy the control deficiencies in a timely manner, we may be unable to provide holders of our securities with the required financial information in a timely and reliable manner, either of which could subject us to litigation and regulatory enforcement actions.\nClimate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of \u201cgreenhouse gases\u201d could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the crude oil and natural gas that we produce. The EPA has determined that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other \u201cgreenhouse gases\u201d present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are, according to the EPA, contributing to warming of the earth\u2019s atmosphere and other climatic changes. Based on these findings, the EPA has begun adopting and implementing regulations to restrict emissions of greenhouse gases under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act (\u201cCAA\u201d). Among the EPA\u2019s rules regulating greenhouse gas emissions under the CAA, one requires a reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases from motor vehicles and requires preconstruction and operating permits for certain large stationary sources of such emissions. The EPA has also adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from specified greenhouse gas emission sources in the United States, including petroleum refineries\nand certain onshore oil and natural gas production facilities. In addition, in January 2015, the Obama Administration announced its goal to reduce methane emissions from the oil and gas sector by 40% to 45% from 2012 emission levels by 2025. As part of this announcement, the EPA announced that it will issue a proposed rule in the summer of 2015 and a final rule in 2016 setting standards for methane and volatile organic compounds emissions from new and modified oil and gas production sources and natural gas processing and transmission sources.\nIn addition, the U.S. Congress has from time to time considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and almost one-half of the states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories and/or regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs. Most of these cap and trade programs work by requiring major sources of emissions, such as electric power plants, or major producers of fuels, such as refineries and gas processing plants, to acquire and surrender emission allowances that correspond to their annual emissions of greenhouse gases. The number of allowances available for purchase is reduced each year in an effort to achieve the overall greenhouse gas emission reduction goal. As the number of emission allowances declines each year, the cost or value of such allowances is expected to escalate significantly.\nThe adoption of legislation or regulatory programs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases could require us to incur increased operating costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems, to acquire emissions allowances or comply with new regulatory or reporting requirements. Any such legislation or regulatory programs could also increase the cost of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for, the oil and natural gas we produced. Consequently, legislation and regulatory programs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Finally, it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, and floods and other climatic events. Our offshore operations are particularly at risk from severe climatic events. If any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe adoption of financial reform legislation by Congress could have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of commodity price, interest rate and other risks associated with our business. Congress adopted comprehensive financial reform legislation that establishes federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market and entities, including us that participate in that market. This legislation, known as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d), was signed into law by President Obama on July 21, 2010 and requires the CFTC, the SEC and other regulators to promulgate rules and regulations implementing the new legislation. In its rulemaking under the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFTC has issued final regulations to set position limits for certain futures and option contracts in the major energy markets and for swaps that are their economic equivalents. Certain bona fide hedging transactions or positions would be exempt from these position limits. The financial reform legislation may also require us to comply with margin requirements and with certain clearing and trade-execution requirements in connection with our derivative activities, although the application of those provisions to us is uncertain at this time. The financial reform legislation may also require certain counterparties to our derivative instruments to spin off some of their derivatives activities to a separate entity, which may not be as creditworthy as the current counterparty. The final rules will be phased in over time according to a specified schedule which is dependent on the finalization of certain other rules to be promulgated jointly by the CFTC and the SEC. The Dodd-Frank Act and any new regulations could increase the cost of derivative contracts (including through requirements to post collateral which could adversely affect our available liquidity), materially alter the terms of derivative contracts, reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks we encounter, reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivative contracts, and increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties. If we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the legislation and regulations, our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable, which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures. Finally, the legislation was intended, in part, to reduce the volatility of oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas prices, which some legislators attributed to speculative trading in derivatives and commodity\ninstruments related to oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas. Our revenues could therefore be adversely affected if a consequence of the legislation and regulations is to lower commodity prices. Any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on us, our financial condition and our results of operations.\nCyber incidents could result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption, and/or financial loss. The oil and gas industry has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct day-to-day operations including certain exploration, development and production activities. For example, software programs are used to interpret seismic data, manage drilling rigs, production equipment and gathering and transportation systems, conduct reservoir modeling and reserves estimation, and for compliance reporting. The use of mobile communication devices has increased rapidly. Industrial control systems such as SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition) now control large scale processes that can include multiple sites and long distances, such as power generation and transmission, communications and oil and gas pipelines.\nWe depend on digital technology, including information systems and related infrastructure, to process and record financial and operating data, communicate with our employees and business partners, analyze seismic and drilling information, estimated quantities of oil and gas reserves and for many other activities related to our business. Our business partners, including vendors, service providers, purchasers of our production, and financial institutions, are also dependent on digital technology. The complexity of the technologies needed to extract oil and gas in increasingly difficult physical environments, such as ultra-deep trend, and global competition for oil and gas resources make certain information more attractive to thieves.\nAs dependence on digital technologies has increased, cyber incidents, including deliberate attacks or unintentional events, have also increased. A cyber-attack could include gaining unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption, or result in denial-of-service on websites. Certain countries, including China, Russia and Iran, are believed to possess cyber warfare capabilities and are credited with attacks on American companies and government agencies. SCADA-based systems are potentially more vulnerable to cyber-attacks due to the increased number of connections with office networks and the internet.\nOur technologies, systems, networks, and those of our business partners may become the target of cyber-attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of proprietary and other information, or other disruption of our business operations. In addition, certain cyber incidents, such as surveillance, may remain undetected for an extended period.\nA cyber incident involving our information systems and related infrastructure, or that of our business partners, could disrupt our business plans and negatively impact our operations in the following ways, among others:\n\u2022 unauthorized access to seismic data, reserves information or other sensitive or proprietary information could have a negative impact on our ability to compete for oil and gas resources;\n\u2022 data corruption, communication interruption, or other operational disruption during drilling activities could result in a dry hole cost or even drilling incidents;\n\u2022 data corruption or operational disruption of production infrastructure could result in loss of production, or accidental discharge;\n\u2022 a cyber-attack on a vendor or service provider could result in supply chain disruptions which could delay or halt one of our major development projects, effectively delaying the start of cash flows from the project;\n\u2022 a cyber-attack on a third party gathering or pipeline service provider could prevent us from marketing our production, resulting in a loss of revenues;\n\u2022 a cyber-attack involving commodities exchanges or financial institutions could slow or halt commodities trading, thus preventing us from marketing our production or engaging in hedging activities, resulting in a loss of revenues;\n\u2022 a cyber-attack which halts activities at a power generation facility or refinery using natural gas as feed stock could have a significant impact on the natural gas market, resulting in reduced demand for our production, lower natural gas prices, and reduced revenues;\n\u2022 a cyber-attack on a communications network or power grid could cause operational disruption resulting in loss of revenues;\n\u2022 a deliberate corruption of our financial or operational data could result in events of non-compliance which could lead to regulatory fines or penalties; and\n\u2022 business interruptions could result in expensive remediation efforts, distraction of management, and damage to our reputation.\nAlthough to date we have not experienced any losses relating to cyber-attacks, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.\nCertain U.S. federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to oil and gas exploration and development may be eliminated as a result of future legislation. The Budget for Fiscal Year 2016 sent to Congress by President Obama on February 2, 2015, among other proposed legislation, contains recommendations that, if enacted into law, would eliminate certain key U.S. federal income tax incentives currently available to oil and natural gas exploration and production companies. These changes include (1) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas properties, (2) the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs, (3) the elimination of the deduction for certain domestic production activities, and (4) an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. Several bills have been introduced in Congress that would implement these proposals. It is unclear whether these or similar changes will be enacted and, if enacted, how soon any such changes could become effective. The passage of this legislation or any similar changes in U.S. federal income tax laws could eliminate or postpone certain tax deductions that are currently available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and development, and any such changes could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.", "PERMNO": 88817, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "EPL"}
