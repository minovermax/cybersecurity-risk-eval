{"cik": "726517", "company": "MERCHANTS BANCSHARES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-14", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS\nSustained low interest rates and interest rate volatility may reduce our profitability.\nOur consolidated earnings and financial condition are primarily dependent upon net interest income, which is the difference between interest earned from loans and investments and interest paid on deposits and borrowings. The narrowing of that difference could adversely affect our earnings and financial condition. We cannot predict with certainty or control changes in interest rates. Regional and local economic conditions and the policies of regulatory authorities, including monetary policies of the FRB, affect interest income and interest expense. While we have ongoing policies and procedures designed to manage the risks associated with changes in market interest rates, changes in interest rates may have an adverse effect on our profitability. Increases in interest rates could affect the amount of loans that we originate, because higher rates could cause customers to apply for fewer loans. Higher interest rates could also cause depositors to shift funds from accounts that have a comparatively lower cost, to accounts with a higher cost. If the cost of interest-bearing deposits increases at a rate greater than the yields on interest-earning assets, net interest income will be negatively affected.\nOur loan portfolio is concentrated in Vermont and we may be adversely affected by regional economic conditions and real estate values.\nBecause our loan portfolio is in Vermont, we may be adversely affected by regional economic conditions. Further, because a substantial portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate in Vermont, the value of the associated collateral is also subject to regional real estate market conditions. If these areas experience adverse economic, political or business conditions, we would likely experience higher rates of loss and delinquency on our loan portfolio than if it was more geographically diverse.\nOur financial condition and results of operations have been adversely affected, and may continue to be adversely affected, by general market and economic conditions.\nWe have been, and continue to be, impacted by general business and economic conditions in the United States and, to a lesser extent, abroad. These conditions include short-term and long-term interest rates, inflation, money supply, political issues, legislative and regulatory changes, fluctuations in both debt and equity capital markets, broad trends in industry and finance, unemployment and investor confidence, all of which are beyond our control. While in recent years there has been gradual improvement in the U.S. economy, deterioration in any of these conditions could result in increases in loan delinquencies and nonperforming assets, decreases in loan collateral values, the value of our investment portfolio and demand for our products and services. Furthermore, while the U.S. economy is improving, the recovery has been slow and there continues to be some uncertainty regarding its sustainability.\nIf our allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, our earnings could decrease.\nOur loan customers may not repay their loans according to the terms of the loans, and the collateral securing the payment of these loans may be insufficient to pay any remaining loan balance. We therefore may experience significant loan losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Material additions to our allowance for loan losses also would materially decrease our net income, and the charge-off of loans may cause us to increase the allowance.\nWe make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans. We rely on our loan quality reviews, our experience and our evaluation of economic conditions, among other factors, in determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses. If our assumptions prove to be incorrect, our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover probable incurred losses in our loan portfolio, resulting in additions to our allowance. In addition, bank regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our provision for loan losses or recognize further loan charge-offs, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur commercial, commercial real estate and construction loan portfolio may expose us to increased credit risks.\nAt December 31, 2015, approximately 59% of our loan portfolio was comprised of commercial, commercial real estate, and construction loans with two of those relationships exceeding $18 million, exposing us to the risks inherent in financings based upon analyses of credit risk, the value of underlying collateral, including real estate, and other more intangible factors, which are considered in making commercial loans. In general, commercial and commercial real estate loans historically pose greater credit risks than owner occupied residential mortgage loans. The repayment of commercial real estate loans depends on the business and financial condition of borrowers, and a number of our borrowers have more than one commercial real estate loan outstanding with us. Economic events and changes in government regulations, which we and our borrowers cannot control or reliably predict, could have an adverse impact on the cash flows generated by properties securing our commercial real estate loans and on the values of the properties securing those loans. Repayment of commercial loans depends substantially on the borrowers\u2019 underlying business, financial condition and cash flows. Commercial loans are generally collateralized by equipment, inventory, accounts receivable and other fixed assets. Compared to real estate, that type of collateral is more difficult to monitor, its value is harder to ascertain, it may depreciate more rapidly and it may not be as readily saleable if repossessed.\nEnvironmental liability associated with our lending activities could result in losses.\nIn the course of business, we may acquire, through foreclosure, properties securing loans we have originated or purchased that are in default. Particularly in commercial real estate lending, there is a risk that material environmental violations could be discovered at these properties. In this event, we might be required to remedy these violations at the affected properties at our sole cost and expense. The cost of remedial action could substantially exceed the value of affected properties. We may not have adequate remedies against the prior owner or other responsible parties and could find it difficult or impossible to sell the affected properties. These events could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment and may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations.\nWe are subject to regulation and supervision by the FRB and Merchants Bank is subject to regulation and supervision by the FDIC and the Commissioner. Federal and state laws and regulations govern numerous matters affecting us, including changes in the ownership or control of banks and bank holding companies, maintenance of adequate capital and the financial condition of a financial institution, permissible types, amounts and terms of extensions of credit and investments, permissible nonbanking activities, the level of reserves against deposits and restrictions on dividend payments. The FDIC and the Commissioner possess the power to issue cease and desist orders to prevent or remedy unsafe or unsound practices or violations of law by banks subject to their regulation, and the FRB possesses similar powers with respect to bank holding companies. These and other restrictions limit the manner in which we may conduct business and obtain financing.\nWe are also affected by the monetary policies of the FRB. Changes in monetary or legislative policies may affect the interest rates we must offer to attract deposits and the interest rates we must charge on our loans, as well as the manner in which we offer deposits and make loans. These monetary policies have had, and are expected to continue to have, significant effects on the operating results of depository institutions generally, including Merchants Bank.\nThe laws, rules, regulations, and supervisory guidance and policies applicable to us are subject to regular modification and change. It is impossible to predict the competitive impact that any such changes would have on the banking and financial services industry in general or on our business in particular. Such changes may, among other things, increase the cost of doing business, limit permissible activities, or affect the competitive balance between banks and other financial institutions. The Dodd-Frank Act instituted major changes to the banking and financial institutions regulatory regimes in light of government intervention in the financial services sector following the 2008 financial crisis. Other changes to statutes, regulations, or regulatory policies, including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes, regulations, or policies, could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways. Such changes could subject us to additional costs, limit the types of financial services and products we may offer, and/or increase the ability of non-banks to offer competing financial services and products, among other things. Failure to comply with laws, regulations, policies or supervisory guidance could result in enforcement and other legal actions by federal or state authorities, including criminal and civil penalties, the loss of FDIC insurance, revocation of a banking charter, other sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties, and/or\nreputational damage, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. See Item 1, \u201cBusiness-Regulation and Supervision.\u201d\nWe have become subject to more stringent capital requirements.\nThe federal banking agencies issued a joint final rule, or the \u201cFinal Capital Rule,\u201d that implemented the Basel III capital standards and established the minimum capital levels required under the Dodd-Frank Act. As of January 1, 2015, we are required to comply with the Final Capital Rule. The Final Capital Rule requires banks and bank holding companies to maintain a minimum common equity Tier I capital ratio of 4.5% of risk-weighted assets, a minimum Tier I capital ratio of 6% of risk-weighted assets, a total capital ratio of 8% of risk-weighted assets, and a leverage ratio of 4%. In addition in connection with implementing the Final Capital Rule, the FDIC revised its prompt corrective action regulations for state nonmember banks to require a minimum common equity Tier I capital ratio of 6.5% of risk-weighted assets for a \u201cwell capitalized\u201d institution and increased the minimum Tier I capital ratio for a \u201cwell capitalized\u201d institution from 6% to 8%. Additionally, subject to a transition period, the Final Capital Rule requires bank and bank holding companies to maintain a 2.5% common equity Tier I capital conservation buffer above the minimum risk-based capital requirements for adequately capitalized institutions to avoid restrictions on the ability to pay dividends, discretionary bonuses, and to engage in share repurchases. The Company [and the Bank] met these requirements as of December 31, 2015. The Final Capital Rule permanently grandfathered trust preferred securities issued before May 19, 2010 for institutions with less than $15 billion in total assets as of December 31, 2009, subject to a limit of 25% of Tier I capital. The Final Capital Rule increased the required capital for certain categories of assets, including high volatility construction real estate loans and certain exposures related to securitizations; however, the Final Capital Rule retained the previous capital treatment of residential mortgages. Under the Final Capital Rule, we were permitted to make a one-time, permanent election to continue to exclude accumulated other comprehensive income from capital. The Company has made this election.\nImplementation of these standards, or any other new regulations, may adversely affect our ability to pay dividends, or require us to reduce business levels or raise capital, including in ways that may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nWe may incur fines, penalties and other negative consequences from regulatory violations, possibly even inadvertent or unintentional violations.\nWe maintain systems and procedures designed to ensure that we comply with applicable laws and regulations. However, some legal/regulatory frameworks provide for the imposition of fines or penalties for noncompliance even though the noncompliance was inadvertent or unintentional and even though there was in place at the time systems and procedures designed to ensure compliance. For example, we are subject to regulations issued by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, or \u201cOFAC,\u201d that prohibit financial institutions from participating in the transfer of property belonging to the governments of certain foreign countries and designated nationals of those countries and certain other persons or entities whose interest in property is blocked by OFAC-administered sanctions. OFAC may impose penalties for inadvertent or unintentional violations even if reasonable processes are in place to prevent the violations. There may be other negative consequences resulting from a finding of noncompliance, including restrictions on certain activities. Such a finding may also damage our reputation as described below and could restrict the ability of institutional investment managers to invest in our securities.\nWe face significant legal risks, both from regulatory investigations and proceedings and from private actions brought against us.\nFrom time to time we are named as a defendant or are otherwise involved in various legal proceedings, including class actions and other litigation or disputes with third parties. There is no assurance that litigation with private parties will not increase in the future. Actions currently pending against us may result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other results adverse to us, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, or cause serious reputational harm to us. As a participant in the financial services industry, it is likely that we will continue to experience a high level of litigation related to our businesses and operations.\nOur businesses and operations are also subject to increasing regulatory oversight and scrutiny, which may lead to additional regulatory investigations or enforcement actions. These and other initiatives from federal and state officials may subject\nus to further judgments, settlements, fines or penalties, or cause us to be required to restructure our operations and activities, all of which could lead to reputational issues, or higher operational costs, thereby reducing our revenue.\nCompetition in the local banking industry may impair our ability to attract and retain customers at current levels.\nCompetition in the markets in which we operate may limit our ability to attract and retain customers. In particular, our competitors include major financial companies whose greater resources may afford them a marketplace advantage by enabling them to maintain numerous banking locations and mount extensive promotional and advertising campaigns. Additionally, banks and other financial institutions with larger capitalization, as well as financial intermediaries not subject to bank regulatory restrictions, have larger lending limits and are able to serve the credit and investment needs of larger customers. There is also increased competition by out-of-market competitors through the Internet. If we are unable to attract and retain customers, we may be unable to continue our loan growth and our results of operations and financial condition may otherwise be negatively impacted.\nMarket changes may adversely affect demand for our services and impact results of operations.\nChannels for servicing our customers are evolving rapidly, with less reliance on traditional branch facilities, more use of online and mobile banking, and increased demand for universal bankers and other relationship managers who can service multiples product lines. We compete with larger providers that are rapidly evolving their service channels and escalating the costs of evolving the service process. We have a process for evaluating the profitability of our branch system and other office and operational facilities. The identification of unprofitable operations and facilities can lead to restructuring charges and introduce the risk of disruptions to revenues and customer relationships.\nPrepayments of loans may negatively impact our business.\nGenerally, our customers may prepay the principal amount of their outstanding loans at any time. The speeds at which such prepayments occur, as well as the size of such prepayments, are within our customers\u2019 discretion. If customers prepay the principal amount of their loans, and we are unable to lend those funds to other borrowers or invest the funds at the same or higher interest rates, our interest income will be reduced. A significant reduction in interest income could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may incur significant losses as a result of ineffective risk management processes and strategies.\nWe seek to monitor and control our risk exposure through a risk and control framework encompassing a variety of separate but complementary financial, credit, operational, compliance and legal reporting systems, internal controls, management review processes and other mechanisms. While we employ a broad and diversified set of risk monitoring and risk mitigation techniques, those techniques and the judgments that accompany their application may not be effective and may not anticipate every economic and financial outcome in all market environments or the specifics and timing of such outcomes. Market conditions over the last several years have involved unprecedented dislocations and highlight the limitations inherent in using historical data to manage risk.\nWe face security risks, including denial of service attacks, hacking and identity theft that could result in the disclosure of confidential information, adversely affect our business or reputation and create significant legal and financial exposure.\nOur computer systems and network infrastructure are subject to potential security risks and could be targeted by cyber-attacks, such as denial of service attacks, hacking, terrorist activities or identity theft. Financial services institutions and companies engaged in data processing have reported breaches in the security of their websites or other systems, some of which have involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information, destroy data, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems, often through the introduction of computer viruses or malware, cyber-attacks and other means. Denial of service attacks have been launched against a number of large financial services institutions. We expect to be subject to similar attacks in the future. Hacking and identity theft risks, in particular, could cause serious reputational harm. Cyber threats are rapidly evolving and we may not be able to anticipate or prevent all such attacks and could be held liable for any security breach or loss.\nDespite efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems, we will not be able to anticipate all security breaches of these types, nor will we be able to implement guaranteed preventive measures against such security breaches. Persistent attackers may succeed in penetrating defenses given enough resources, time and motive. The techniques used by cyber criminals change frequently, may not be recognized until launched and can originate from a wide variety of sources, including outside groups such as external service providers, organized crime affiliates, terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments. These risks may increase in the future as we continue to increase our mobile and internet-based product offerings and expand our internal usage of web-based products and applications.\nEven the most advanced internal control environment may be vulnerable to compromise. Targeted social engineering attacks are becoming more sophisticated and are extremely difficult to prevent. The successful social engineer will attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to its data or that of its clients.\nA successful penetration or circumvention of system security could cause us serious negative consequences, including significant disruption of operations, misappropriation of confidential information, or damage to our computers or systems or those of our customers and counterparties. A successful security breach could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws, financial loss to us or to our customers, loss of confidence in our security measures, significant litigation exposure, and harm to our reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nWe may be unable to attract and retain key personnel.\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract and retain key personnel. Competition for qualified personnel in the financial services industry and in the Vermont marketplace can be intense and we may not be able to hire or retain the key personnel that we depend upon for success. The unexpected loss of services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse impact on our business because of their skills, knowledge of the markets in which we operate, years of industry experience and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel.\nOur ability to attract and retain customers and employees, and maintain relationships with vendors, third-party service providers and others, could be adversely affected to the extent our reputation is harmed.\nWe are dependent on our reputation within our market area, as a trusted and responsible financial company, for all aspects of our relationships with customers, employees, vendors, third-party service providers, and others, with whom we conduct business or potential future business. Our ability to attract and retain customers and employees, and maintain relationships with vendors, third-party service providers and others, could be adversely affected to the extent our reputation is damaged. Our actual or perceived failure to address various issues could give rise to reputational risk that could cause harm to us and our business prospects, including failure to properly address operational risks. These issues also include, but are not limited to, legal and regulatory requirements; privacy; properly maintaining customer and associate personal information; record keeping; money-laundering; sales and trading practices; ethical issues; appropriately addressing potential conflicts of interest; and the proper identification of the legal, reputational, credit, liquidity and market risks inherent in our products. Failure to appropriately address any of these issues could also give rise to additional regulatory restrictions, reputational harm and legal risks, which could, among other consequences, increase the size and number of litigation claims and damages asserted or subject us to enforcement actions, fines and penalties and cause us to incur related costs and expenses.\nWe may suffer losses as a result of operational risk or technical system failures.\nThe potential for operational risk exposure exists throughout our organization. Integral to our performance is the continued efficacy of our internal processes, systems, relationships with third parties and the associates and executives in our day-to-day and ongoing operations. Operational risk also encompasses the failure to implement strategic objectives in a successful, timely and cost-effective manner. Failure to properly manage operational risk subjects us to risks of loss that may vary in size, scale and scope, including loss of customers, operational or technical failures, unlawful tampering with our technical systems, ineffectiveness or exposure due to interruption in third party support, as well as the loss of key individuals or failure on the part of key individuals to perform properly. Although we seek to mitigate operational risk through a system\nof internal controls, losses from operational risk could take the form of explicit charges, increased operational costs, harm to our reputation or foregone opportunities.\nWe rely on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure.\nThird party vendors provide key components of our business infrastructure such as internet connections, network access and core application processing. While we have selected these third party vendors carefully, we do not control their actions. Any problems caused by these third parties, including as a result of their not providing us their services for any reason or their performing their services poorly, could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers or otherwise conduct our business efficiently and effectively. Replacing these third party vendors could also entail significant delay and expense.\nThe market price and trading volume of our common stock may be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile. In addition, the trading volume in our common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur. We cannot assure you that the market price of our common stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly in the future. Some of the factors that could negatively affect our share price or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of our common stock include:\n\u00b7\nquarterly variations in our operating results or the quality of our assets;\n\u00b7\noperating results that vary from the expectations of Management, securities analysts and investors;\n\u00b7\nchanges in expectations as to our future financial performance;\n\u00b7\nannouncements of innovations, new products, strategic developments, significant contracts, acquisitions and other material events by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7\nreputational issues or events;\n\u00b7\nthe operating and securities price performance of other companies that investors believe are comparable to us;\n\u00b7\nour past and future dividend practices;\n\u00b7\nfuture sales of our equity or equity-related securities; and\n\u00b7\nchanges in global financial markets and global economies and general market conditions, such as interest or foreign exchange rates, stock, commodity or real estate valuations or volatility.\nWe are a holding company and depend on Merchants Bank for dividends, distributions and other payments.\nWe are legal entity that is separate and distinct from Merchants Bank. Our revenue (on a parent company only basis) is derived primarily from interest and dividends paid to us by Merchants Bank. Our right, and consequently the right of our stockholders, to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of any subsidiary through the payment of such dividends or otherwise is necessarily subject to the prior claims of creditors of the subsidiary (including depositors, in the case of Merchants Bank), except to the extent that certain claims of Merchants in a creditor capacity may be recognized. See Item 1, \u201cBusiness-Regulation and Supervision-Capital Adequacy and Safety and Soundness.\u201d\nOur stockholders may not receive dividends on our common stock.\nHolders of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends only when, as and if declared by our board of directors. Although we have historically declared cash dividends on our common stock, we are not required to do so and our board of directors may reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in the future. It is the policy of the FRB that bank holding companies should pay dividends only out of current earnings and only if, after paying such dividends, the bank holding\ncompany would remain adequately capitalized. The FRB has the authority to prohibit a bank holding company, such as us, from paying dividends if it deems such payment to be an unsafe or unsound practice. The FDIC has the authority to use its enforcement powers to prohibit a bank from paying dividends if, in its opinion, the payment of dividends would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. Federal law also prohibits the payment of dividends by a bank that will result in the bank failing to meet its applicable capital requirements on a pro forma basis. Further, when the Final Capital Rule comes into effect our ability to pay dividends would be restricted if we do not maintain a capital conservation buffer. A reduction or elimination of dividends could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. See Item 1, \u201cBusiness-Regulation and Supervision-Dividend Restrictions\u201d and \u201cBusiness-Regulation and Supervision-Capital Adequacy and Safety and Soundness -Regulatory Capital Requirements.\u201d\nChanges in accounting standards can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. From time to time, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) changes the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. These changes can be hard to anticipate and implement and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur financial statements are based in part on assumptions and estimates, which, if wrong, could cause unexpected losses in the future.\nPursuant to GAAP, we are required to use certain assumptions and estimates in preparing our financial statements, including in determining credit loss reserves, reserves related to litigation and the fair value of certain assets and liabilities, among other items. If assumptions or estimates underlying our financial statements are incorrect, we may experience material losses. For additional information, see Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies.\u201d\nWe may be unable to integrate successfully NUVO\u2019s operations and retain NUVO\u2019s employees.\nOur recent merger with NUVO involves the integration of NUVO and Merchants Bank, which have previously operated independently. The difficulties of combining the operations of the two companies include:\n\u00b7\nintegrating personnel with diverse business backgrounds;\n\u00b7\nintegrating data and information systems;\n\u00b7\ncombining different corporate cultures;\n\u00b7\noperating in different states and geographic markets; and\n\u00b7\nretaining key employees.\nThe process of integrating operations could cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the business or operations of Merchants Bank and the loss of key personnel. The diversion of management\u2019s attention and any delays or difficulties encountered in connection with the integration of the two companies\u2019 operations could have an adverse effect on the business and results of operations of Merchants following the merger.\nUnanticipated costs relating to the merger with NUVO could reduce our future earnings per share.\nThe success of the merger with NUVO will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from combining the business of Merchants with NUVO. It is possible that we will not be able to achieve expected synergies related to the merger or could incur unexpected future operating expenses such as increased personnel costs or increased taxes, as well as other types of unanticipated adverse developments, which could have a material adverse effect\non the results of operations and financial condition of the combined company. If unexpected costs are incurred, the merger may not be as accretive as expected or could even have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share.\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future and such capital may not be available when needed.\nAs a bank holding company, we are required by regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations. We may need to raise additional capital in the future to provide us with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet our commitments and business needs. Our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on, among other things, conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside of our control, and our financial performance. We cannot assure you that such capital will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. Our inability to raise sufficient additional capital on acceptable terms when needed could subject us to certain activity restrictions or to a variety of enforcement remedies available to the regulatory authorities, including limitations on our ability to pay dividends or pursue acquisitions, the issuance by regulatory authorities of a capital directive to increase capital and the termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC.\nCertain provisions of our articles of incorporation may have an anti-takeover effect.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and regulations and federal banking laws, including regulatory approval requirements, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would be perceived to be beneficial to our stockholders. The combination of these provisions may inhibit a non-negotiated merger or other business combination, which, in turn, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 90086, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "MBVT"}
