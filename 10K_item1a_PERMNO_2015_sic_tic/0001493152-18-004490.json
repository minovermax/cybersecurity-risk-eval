{"cik": "1534708", "company": "Eastside Distilling, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-04-02", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS AND CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION\nThe statements in this section describe the most significant risks to our business and should be considered carefully in conjunction with \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and the \u201cNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d to this Form 10-K. In addition, the statements in this section and other sections of this Form 10-K include \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and involve uncertainties that could significantly impact results. Forward-looking statements give current expectations or forecasts of future events about the company or our outlook. You can identify forward-looking statements by the fact they do not relate to historical or current facts and by the use of words such as \u201cbelieve,\u201d \u201cexpect,\u201d \u201cestimate,\u201d \u201canticipate,\u201d \u201cwill be,\u201d \u201cshould,\u201d \u201cplan,\u201d \u201cproject,\u201d \u201cintend,\u201d \u201ccould\u201d and similar words or expressions.\nForward-looking statements are based on assumptions and on known risks and uncertainties. Although we believe we have been prudent in our assumptions, any or all of our forward-looking statements may prove to be inaccurate, and we can make no guarantees about our future performance. Should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize or underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could materially differ from past results and/or those anticipated, estimated or projected.\nWe undertake no obligation to provide updates to forward-looking statements to the public, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You should, however, consult any subsequent disclosures we make in our filings with the SEC on Form 10-Q or Form 8-K.\nThe following is a cautionary discussion of risks, uncertainties and assumptions that we believe are significant to our business. In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report, the following are some of the important factors that, individually or in the aggregate, we believe could make our actual results differ materially from those described in any forward-looking statements. It is impossible to predict or identify all such factors and, as a result, you should not consider the following factors to be a complete discussion of risks, uncertainties and assumptions.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS\nIf our brands do not achieve more widespread consumer acceptance, our growth may be limited.\nAlthough our brands have achieved acceptance in the Pacific Northwest, most of our brands are relatively new and have not achieved extensive national brand recognition. Also, brands we may develop and/or acquire in the future may not establish widespread brand recognition. Accordingly, if consumers do not accept our brands, we will not be able to penetrate our markets and our growth may be limited.\nWe have incurred significant operating losses every quarter since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur significant operating losses in the future.\nWe believe that we will continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future as we expect to make continued significant investment in product development and sales and marketing and to incur significant administrative expenses as we seek to grow our brands. We also anticipate that our cash needs will exceed our income from sales for the foreseeable future. Some of our products may never achieve widespread market acceptance and may not generate sales and profits to justify our investment in them. Also, we may find that our expansion plans are more costly than we anticipate and that they do not ultimately result in commensurate increases in our sales, which would further increase our losses. We expect we will continue to experience losses and negative cash flow, some of which could be significant. Results of operations will depend upon numerous factors, some of which are beyond our control, including market acceptance of our products, new product introductions and competition. We also incur substantial operating expenses at the corporate level, including costs directly related to being a reporting company with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d). For the year ended December 31, 2017, we reported a net loss of $5.3 million. As of December 31, 2017, we had an accumulated deficit since inception of $18.1 million.\nWe depend on a limited number of suppliers. Failure to obtain satisfactory performance from our suppliers or loss of our existing suppliers could cause us to lose sales, incur additional costs and lose credibility in the marketplace.\nWe depend on a limited number of third-party suppliers for the sourcing of the raw materials for all of our products, including our distillate products and other ingredients. These suppliers consist of third-party producers in the U.S. We do not have long-term, written agreements with any of our suppliers. The termination of our relationships or an adverse change in the terms of these arrangements could have a negative impact on our business. If our suppliers increase their prices, we may not be able to secure alternative suppliers, and may not be able to raise the prices of our products to cover all or even a portion of the increased costs. Also, our suppliers\u2019 failure to perform satisfactorily or handle increased orders, delays in shipments of products from suppliers or the loss of our existing suppliers, especially our key suppliers, could cause us to fail to meet orders for our products, lose sales, incur additional costs and/or expose us to product quality issues. In turn, this could cause us to lose credibility in the marketplace and damage our relationships with distributors, ultimately leading to a decline in our business and results of operations. If we are not able to renegotiate these contracts on acceptable terms or find suitable alternatives, our business could be negatively impacted.\nWe depend on our independent wholesale distributors to distribute our products. The failure or inability of even a few of our distributors to distribute our products adequately within their territories could harm our sales and result in a decline in our results of operations.\nWe are required by law to use state-licensed distributors or, in 18 states known as \u201ccontrol states,\u201d state-owned agencies performing this function, to sell our products to retail outlets, including liquor stores, bars, restaurants and national chains in the U.S. We have established relationships for our brands with a limited number of wholesale distributors; however, failure to maintain those relationships could significantly and adversely affect our business, sales and growth. We currently distribute our products in 26 states - Oregon, Washington, California, Florida, Nevada, Texas, Virginia, Indiana, Illinois, New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Georgia, Rhode Island, Idaho, Maryland, West Virginia, Wyoming, North Carolina, Louisiana, Tennessee, Mississippi, South Dakota, Kansas and Alaska (as wells as in Ontario, Canada).\nOver the past decade there has been increasing consolidation, both intrastate and interstate, among distributors. As a result, many states now have only two or three significant distributors. Also, there are several distributors that now control distribution for several states. If we fail to maintain good relations with a distributor, our products could in some instances be frozen out of one or more markets entirely. The ultimate success of our products also depends in large part on our distributors\u2019 ability and desire to distribute our products to our desired U.S. target markets, as we rely significantly on them for product placement and retail store penetration. In addition, all of our distributors also distribute competitive brands and product lines. We cannot assure you that our U.S. alcohol distributors will continue to purchase our products, commit sufficient time and resources to promote and market our brands and product lines or that they can or will sell them to our desired or targeted markets. If they do not, our sales will be harmed, resulting in a decline in our results of operations.\nWe rely on a few key distributors, and the loss of any one key distributor would substantially reduce our revenues.\nWe currently derive a significant amount of our revenues from a few major distributors. A significant decrease in business from or loss of any of our major distributors could harm our financial condition by causing a significant decline in revenues attributable to such distributors. Sales to one distributor, the Oregon Liquor Control Commission, accounted for approximately 32% of our consolidated sales for each of the years 2017 and 2016. While we believe our relationships with our major distributors are good, we do not have long-term contracts with any of them and purchases generally occur on an order-by-order basis. If we experience a significant decrease in sales to any of our major distributors and are unable to replace such sales volume with orders from other customers, our sales may decrease which would have a material adverse financial effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe sales of our products could decrease significantly if we cannot secure and maintain listings in the control states.\nIn the control states, the state liquor commissions act in place of distributors and decide which products are to be purchased and offered for sale in their respective states. Products selected for listing in control states must generally reach certain volumes and/or profit levels to maintain their listings. Products in control states are selected for purchase and sale through listing procedures which are generally made available to new products only at periodically scheduled listing interviews. Products not selected for listings can only be purchased by consumers in the applicable control state through special orders, if at all. If, in the future, we are unable to maintain our current listings in the control states, or secure and maintain listings in those states for any additional products we may develop or acquire, sales of our products could decrease significantly which would have a material adverse financial effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe must maintain a relatively large inventory of our products to support customer delivery requirements, and if this inventory is lost due to theft, fire or other damage or becomes obsolete, our results of operations would be negatively impacted.\nWe must maintain relatively large inventories of our products to meet customer delivery requirements. We are always at risk of loss of that inventory due to theft, fire or other damage, and any such loss, whether insured against or not, could cause us to fail to meet our orders and harm our sales and operating results. Also, our inventory may become obsolete as we introduce new products, cease to produce old products or modify the design of our products\u2019 packaging, which would increase our operating losses and negatively impact our results of operations.\nIf we are unable to identify and successfully acquire additional brands that are complementary to our existing portfolio, our growth will be limited, and, even if additional brands are acquired, we may not realize anticipated benefits, due to integration difficulties or other operating issues.\nA component of our growth strategy may be the acquisition of additional brands that are complementary to our existing portfolio through acquisitions of such brands or their corporate owners, directly or through mergers, joint ventures, long-term exclusive distribution arrangements and/or other strategic relationships. For example, in May 2017, we acquired 90% of the ownership of BBD for its award-winning range of super-premium gins and whiskeys, and we acquired MotherLode in March 2017, which provides contract bottling and packaging services for existing and emerging spirits producers, some of whom contract with us to blend or distill spirits. If we are unable to identify suitable brand candidates and successfully execute our acquisition strategy, our growth will be limited.\nAlso, even if we are successful in acquiring additional brands, we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability levels that justify our investment in, or realize operating and economic efficiencies or other planned benefits with respect to, those additional brands. The addition of new products or businesses entails numerous risks with respect to integration and other operating issues, any of which could have a detrimental effect on our results of operations and/or the value of our equity. These risks include, but are not limited to:\n\u25cf difficulties in assimilating acquired operations or products;\n\u25cf unanticipated costs that could materially adversely affect our results of operations;\n\u25cf negative effects on reported results of operations from acquisition-related charges and amortization of acquired intangibles;\n\u25cf diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns;\n\u25cf adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers, distributors and retail customers;\n\u25cf risks of entering new markets or markets in which we have limited prior experience; and\n\u25cf the potential inability to retain and motivate key employees of acquired businesses.\nOur ability to grow through the acquisition of additional brands will also be dependent upon the availability of capital to complete the necessary acquisition arrangements. We intend to finance our brand acquisitions through a combination of our available cash resources, third-party financing and, in appropriate circumstances, the further issuance of equity and/or debt securities. Acquiring additional brands could have a significant effect on our financial position, and could cause substantial fluctuations in our quarterly and yearly operating results. Also, acquisitions could result in the recording of significant goodwill and intangible assets on our financial statements, the amortization or impairment of which would reduce reported earnings in subsequent years.\nOur failure to protect our trademarks and trade secrets could compromise our competitive position and decrease the value of our brand portfolio.\nOur business and prospects depend in part on our ability to develop favorable consumer recognition of our brands and trademarks. Although we apply for registration of our brands and trademarks, they could be imitated in ways that we cannot prevent. Also, we rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how, concepts and formulas. Our methods of protecting this information may not be adequate. Moreover, we may face claims of misappropriation or infringement of third parties\u2019 rights that could interfere with our use of this information. Defending these claims may be costly and, if unsuccessful, may prevent us from continuing to use this proprietary information in the future and result in a judgment or monetary damages being levied against us. We do not maintain non-competition agreements with all of our key personnel or with some of our key suppliers. If competitors independently develop or otherwise obtain access to our trade secrets, proprietary know-how or recipes, the appeal, and thus the value, of our brand portfolio could be reduced, negatively impacting our sales and growth potential.\nA failure of one or more of our key information technology systems, networks, processes, associated sites or service providers could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWe rely on information technology (IT) systems, networks, and services, including internet sites, data hosting and processing facilities and tools, hardware (including laptops and mobile devices), software and technical applications and platforms, some of which are managed, hosted, provided and/or used by third-parties or their vendors, to assist us in the management of our business. The various uses of these IT systems, networks and services include, but are not limited to: hosting our internal network and communication systems; ordering and managing materials from suppliers; supply/demand planning; production; shipping products to customers; hosting our branded websites and marketing products to consumers; collecting and storing customer, consumer, employee, investor, and other data; processing transactions; summarizing and reporting results of operations; hosting, processing, and sharing confidential and proprietary research, business plans, and financial information; complying with regulatory, legal or tax requirements; providing data security; and handling other processes necessary to manage our business.\nIncreased IT security threats and more sophisticated cyber-crime pose a potential risk to the security of our IT systems, networks, and services, as well as the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of our data. If the IT systems, networks, or service providers we rely upon fail to function properly, or if we suffer a loss or disclosure of business or other sensitive information, due to any number of causes, ranging from catastrophic events to power outages to security breaches, and our business continuity plans do not effectively address these failures on a timely basis, we may suffer interruptions in our ability to manage operations and reputational, competitive and/or business harm, which may adversely affect our business operations and/or financial condition. In addition, such events could result in unauthorized disclosure of material confidential information, and we may suffer financial and reputational damage because of lost or misappropriated confidential information belonging to us or to our partners, our employees, customers, suppliers or consumers. In any of these events, we could also be required to spend significant financial and other resources to remedy the damage caused by a security breach or to repair or replace networks and IT systems.\nOur failure to attract or retain key executive or employee talent could adversely affect our business.\nOur success depends upon the efforts and abilities of our senior management team, other key employees, and a high-quality employee base, as well as our ability to attract, motivate, reward, and retain them. If one of our executive officers or significant employees terminates her or his employment, we may not be able to replace their expertise, fully integrate new personnel or replicate the prior working relationships, and the loss of their services might significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives. Qualified individuals with the breadth of skills and experience in our industry that we require are in high demand, and we may incur significant costs to attract them. We do not maintain and do not intend to obtain key man insurance on the life of any executive or employee. Difficulties in hiring or retaining key executive or employee talent, or the unexpected loss of experienced employees could have an adverse impact our business performance. In addition, we could experience business disruption and/or increased costs related to organizational changes, reductions in workforce, or other cost-cutting measures.\nIf we fail to manage growth effectively or prepare for product scalability, it could have an adverse effect on our employee efficiency, product quality, working capital levels and results of operations.\nAny significant growth in the market for our products or our entry into new markets may require an expansion of our employee base for managerial, operational, financial, and other purposes. During any period of growth, we may face problems related to our operational and financial systems and controls, including quality control and delivery and service capacities. We would also need to continue to expand, train and manage our employee base. Continued future growth will impose significant added responsibilities upon the members of management to identify, recruit, maintain, integrate, and motivate new employees. Aside from increased difficulties in the management of human resources, we may also encounter working capital issues, as we will need increased liquidity to finance the marketing of the products we sell, and the hiring of additional employees. For effective growth management, we will be required to continue improving our operations, management, and financial systems and controls. Our failure to manage growth effectively may lead to operational and financial inefficiencies that will have a negative effect on our profitability. We cannot assure investors that we will be able to timely and effectively meet that demand and maintain the quality standards required by our existing and potential customers.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR INDUSTRY\nDemand for our products may be adversely affected by many factors, including changes in consumer preferences and trends.\nConsumer preferences may shift due to a variety of factors, including changes in demographic and social trends, public health initiatives, product innovations, changes in vacation or leisure, dining and beverage consumption patterns and a downturn in economic conditions, which may reduce consumers\u2019 willingness to purchase distilled spirits or cause a shift in consumer preferences toward beer, wine or non-alcoholic beverages. Our success depends in part on fulfilling available opportunities to meet consumer needs and anticipating changes in consumer preferences with successful new products and product innovations.\nA limited or general decline in consumption in one or more of our product categories could occur in the future due to a variety of factors, including:\n\u25cf a general decline in economic or geopolitical conditions;\n\u25cf concern about the health consequences of consuming beverage alcohol products and about drinking and driving;\n\u25cf a general decline in the consumption of beverage alcohol products in on-premises establishments, such as may result from smoking bans and stricter laws relating to driving while under the influence of alcohol;\n\u25cf consumer dietary preferences favoring lighter, lower calorie beverages such as diet soft drinks, sports drinks and water products;\n\u25cf increased federal, state, provincial and foreign excise or other taxes on beverage alcohol products and possible restrictions on beverage alcohol advertising and marketing;\n\u25cf increased regulation placing restrictions on the purchase or consumption of beverage alcohol products or increasing prices due to the imposition of duties or excise tax;\n\u25cf inflation; and\n\u25cf wars, pandemics, weather and natural or man-made disasters.\nIn addition, our continued success depends, in part, on our ability to develop new products to meet consumer needs and anticipate changes in consumer preferences. The launch and ongoing success of new products are inherently uncertain especially with regard to their appeal to consumers. The launch of a new product can give rise to a variety of costs and an unsuccessful launch, among other things, can affect consumer perception of existing brands and our reputation. Unsuccessful implementation or short-lived popularity of our product innovations may result in inventory write-offs and other costs.\nWe face substantial competition in our industry, and many factors may prevent us from competing successfully.\nWe compete on the basis of product taste and quality, brand image, price, service and ability to innovate in response to consumer preferences. The global spirits industry is highly competitive and is dominated by several large, well-funded international companies. Many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories and have substantially greater financial, sales, marketing and other resources than we do, as well as larger installed customer bases, greater name recognition and broader product offerings. Some of these competitors can devote greater resources to the development, promotion, sale and support of their products. As a result, it is possible that our competitors may either respond to industry conditions or consumer trends more rapidly or effectively or resort to price competition to sustain market share, which could adversely affect our sales and profitability.\nIn addition, the legalization of marijuana in any of the jurisdictions in which we sell our products may result in a reduction in sales. Studies have shown that sales of alcohol may decrease in jurisdictions where marijuana has been legalized (e.g. California, Colorado, Washington and Oregon). As a result, marijuana sales may adversely affect our sales and profitability.\nClass actions or other litigation relating to alcohol abuse or the misuse of alcohol could adversely affect our business.\nOur industry faces the possibility of class action or similar litigation alleging that the continued excessive use or abuse of beverage alcohol has caused death or serious health problems, or related to the labelling of our products. It is also possible that governments could assert that the use of alcohol has significantly increased government funded health care costs. Litigation or assertions of this type have adversely affected companies in the tobacco industry, and it is possible that we, as well as our suppliers, could be named in litigation of this type.\nAlso, lawsuits have been brought in a number of states alleging that beverage alcohol manufacturers and marketers have improperly targeted underage consumers in their advertising. Plaintiffs in these cases allege that the defendants\u2019 advertisements, marketing and promotions violate the consumer protection or deceptive trade practices statutes in each of these states and seek repayment of the family funds expended by the underage consumers. While we have not been named in these lawsuits, we could be named in similar lawsuits in the future. Any class action or other litigation asserted against us could be expensive and time-consuming to defend against, depleting our cash and diverting our personnel resources and, if the plaintiffs in such actions were to prevail, our business could be harmed significantly.\nRegulatory decisions and legal, regulatory and tax changes could limit our business activities, increase our operating costs and reduce our margins.\nOur business is subject to extensive government regulation. This may include regulations regarding production, distribution, marketing, advertising and labeling of beverage alcohol products. We are required to comply with these regulations and to maintain various permits and licenses. We are also required to conduct business only with holders of licenses to import, warehouse, transport, distribute and sell beverage alcohol products. We cannot assure you that these and other governmental regulations applicable to our industry will not change or become more stringent. Moreover, because these laws and regulations are subject to interpretation, we may not be able to predict when and to what extent liability may arise. Additionally, due to increasing public concern over alcohol-related societal problems, including driving while intoxicated, underage drinking, alcoholism and health consequences from the abuse of alcohol, various levels of government may seek to impose additional restrictions or limits on advertising or other marketing activities promoting beverage alcohol products. Failure to comply with any of the current or future regulations and requirements relating to our industry and products could result in monetary penalties, suspension or even revocation of our licenses and permits. Costs of compliance with changes in regulations could be significant and could harm our business, as we could find it necessary to raise our prices in order to maintain profit margins, which could lower the demand for our products and reduce our sales and profit potential.\nAlso, the distribution of beverage alcohol products is subject to extensive taxation (at both the federal and state government levels), and beverage alcohol products themselves are the subject of national import and excise duties in most countries around the world. An increase in taxation or in import or excise duties could also significantly harm our sales revenue and margins, both through the reduction of overall consumption and by encouraging consumers to switch to lower-taxed categories of beverage alcohol. Although we expect a significantly positive impact on our operating results from the enactment of the Craft Modernization and Tax Reform Act of 2017, which was part of the 2017 federal tax legislation that went into effect on January 1, 2018, resulting from the lowering of the federal excise tax on spirits for the first 100,000 proof gallons per year from $13.50 to $2.70 per gallon, there can be no assurance this revised tax rate will remain in effect after the initial two-year period.\nWe could face product liability or other related liabilities that increase our costs of operations and harm our reputation.\nAlthough we maintain liability insurance and will attempt to limit contractually our liability for damages arising from our products, these measures may not be sufficient for us to successfully avoid or limit liability. Our product liability insurance coverage is limited to $1 million per occurrence and $4 million in the aggregate and our general liability umbrella policy is capped at $2 million. Further, any contractual indemnification and insurance coverage we have from parties supplying our products is limited, as a practical matter, to the creditworthiness of the indemnifying party and the insured limits of any insurance provided by these suppliers. In any event, extensive product liability claims could be costly to defend and/or costly to resolve and could harm our reputation.\nContamination of our products and/or counterfeit or confusingly similar products could harm the image and integrity of, or decrease customer support for, our brands and decrease our sales.\nThe success of our brands depends upon the positive image that consumers have of them. Contamination, whether arising accidentally or through deliberate third-party action, or other events that harm the integrity or consumer support for our brands, could affect the demand for our products. Contaminants in raw materials purchased from third parties and used in the production of our products or defects in the distillation and fermentation processes could lead to low beverage quality as well as illness among, or injury to, consumers of our products and could result in reduced sales of the affected brand or all of our brands. Also, to the extent that third parties sell products that are either counterfeit versions of our brands or brands that look like our brands, consumers of our brands could confuse our products with products that they consider inferior. This could cause them to refrain from purchasing our brands in the future and in turn could impair our brand equity and adversely affect our sales and operations.\nAdverse public opinion about alcohol could reduce demand for our products.\nAnti-alcohol groups have, in the past, advocated successfully for more stringent labeling requirements, higher taxes and other regulations designed to discourage alcohol consumption. In addition, recent developments in the industry may compel us to identify the source and location of our distillate products, and notify the consumer of whether the product was distilled by us. More restrictive regulations, negative publicity regarding alcohol consumption and/or changes in consumer perceptions of the relative healthfulness or safety of beverage alcohol could decrease sales and consumption of alcohol and thus the demand for our products. This could, in turn, significantly decrease both our revenues and our revenue growth, causing a decline in our results of operations.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. Investors may find our common stock less attractive because we rely on these exemptions; which may result in a less active trading market for our common stock, making the market prices more volatile.\nOur common stock is thinly traded, and investors may be unable to sell some or all of their shares at the price they would like, or at all, and sales of large blocks of shares may depress the price of our common stock.\nOur common stock has historically been sporadically or \u201cthinly-traded,\u201d meaning that the number of persons interested in purchasing shares of our common stock at prevailing prices at any given time may be relatively small or nonexistent. As a consequence, there may be periods of several days or more when trading activity in shares of our common stock is minimal or non-existent, as compared to a seasoned issuer that has a large and steady volume of trading activity that will generally support continuous sales without an adverse effect on share price. This could lead to wide fluctuations in our share price. Investors may be unable to sell their common stock at or above their purchase price, which may result in substantial losses. Also, as a consequence of this lack of liquidity, the trading of relatively small quantities of shares by our stockholders may disproportionately influence the price of shares of our common stock in either direction. The price of shares of our common stock could, for example, decline precipitously in the event a large number of shares of our common shares are sold on the market without commensurate demand, as compared to a seasoned issuer that could better absorb those sales without adverse impact on its share price.\nOur failure to meet the continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market could result in a delisting of our common stock.\nIn August 2017, our shares of common stock began trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market. If we fail to satisfy the continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market, such as the corporate governance requirements or the minimum closing bid price requirement, Nasdaq may take steps to delist our common stock. Such a delisting would likely have a negative effect on the price of our common stock and would impair your ability to sell or purchase our common stock when you wish to do so. In the event of a delisting, we would take actions to restore our compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s listing requirements, but we can provide no assurance that any such action taken by us would allow our common stock to become listed again, stabilize the market price or improve the liquidity of our common stock, prevent our common stock from dropping below the Nasdaq minimum bid price requirement or prevent future non-compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s listing requirements.\nWhile our warrants are outstanding, it may be more difficult to raise additional equity capital.\nWe currently have outstanding publicly-traded warrants to purchase 1,380,000 shares of common stock (the \u201cPublic Warrants\u201d) that were issued in our August 2017 public offering. As of April 2, 2018, we also have an aggregate of 1,243,077 non-trading, privately-issued common stock purchase warrants (the \u201cPrivate Warrants\u201d). During the term that our Public Warrants and Private Warrants are outstanding, the holders of such warrants will be given the opportunity to profit from a rise in the market price of our common stock. We may find it more difficult to raise additional equity capital while the Public Warrants and/or Private Warrants are outstanding.\nA decline in the price of our common stock could affect our ability to raise working capital and adversely impact our ability to continue operations.\nA prolonged decline in the price of our common stock could result in a reduction in the liquidity of our common stock and a reduction in our ability to raise capital. A decline in the price of our common stock could be especially detrimental to our liquidity and our operations. Such reductions may force us to reallocate funds from other planned uses and may have a significant negative effect on our business plans and operations, including our ability to develop new services and continue our current operations. If our common stock price declines, we can offer no assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital or generate funds from operations sufficient to meet our obligations. If we are unable to raise sufficient capital in the future, we may not be able to have the resources to continue our normal operations.\nWe do not expect to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nFor the foreseeable future, it is anticipated that earnings, if any, that may be generated from our operations will be used to finance our operations and that cash dividends will not be paid to holders of common stock.\nOur Chairman and Chief Executive Officer owns a significant number of shares of our outstanding common stock, and as long as he does, he may be able to control the outcome of stockholder voting.\nGrover T. Wickersham, our chairman and chief executive officer, is the beneficial owner of approximately 8.3% of the outstanding shares of our common stock as of April 2, 2018, including shares he owns as the indirect beneficial owner (but for which he disclaims beneficial ownership), and excluding shares he (or the entities for which he is deemed to be the beneficial owner) has the right to acquire upon exercise of warrants and options that may be exercised in the future. Accordingly, as a result of his direct and indirect beneficial ownership, he may be able to exercise substantial control and directly influence our affairs and business, including any determination with respect to a change in control, future issuances of common stock or other securities, declaration of dividends on the common stock and the election of directors. Were all of the options and warrants exercised for which Mr. Wickersham is deemed to own, whether directly and indirectly, his influence over matters that are subject to a stockholder vote would significantly increase.\nWe have the ability to issue additional shares of our common stock and shares of preferred stock without asking for stockholder approval, which could cause your investment to be diluted.\nOur Articles of Incorporation authorizes the Board of Directors to issue up to 15,000,000 shares of common stock and up to 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock. The power of the Board of Directors to issue shares of common stock, preferred stock or warrants or options to purchase shares of common stock or preferred stock is generally not subject to stockholder approval. Accordingly, any additional issuance of our common stock, or preferred stock that may be convertible into common stock, may have the effect of diluting your investment, and the new securities may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our common stock.\nBy issuing preferred stock, we may be able to delay, defer, or prevent a change of control.\nOur Articles of Incorporation permits us to issue, without approval from our stockholders, a total of 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock. Our Board of Directors may determine the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions granted to, or imposed upon, the shares of preferred stock and to fix the number of shares constituting any series and the designation of such series. It is possible that our Board of Directors, in determining the rights, preferences and privileges to be granted when the preferred stock is issued, may include provisions that have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control, discouraging bids for our common stock at a premium over the market price, or that adversely affect the market price of and the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock.\nWe face risks related to compliance with corporate governance laws and financial reporting standard.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\u201cSarbanes-Oxley\u201d), as well as related rules and regulations implemented by the SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, require compliance with certain corporate governance practices and financial reporting standards for public companies. These laws, rules and regulations, including compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 relating to internal control over financial reporting (\u201cSOX 404\u201d), has materially increased our legal and financial compliance costs and made some activities more time-consuming, burdensome and expensive. Although we currently believe our internal control over financial reporting is effective, the effectiveness of our internal controls in future periods is subject to the risk that our controls may become inadequate or may not operate effectively. Any failure to comply with the requirements of SOX 404, our ability to remediate any material weaknesses that we may identify during our compliance program, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could harm our operating results, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations or result in material misstatements in our financial statements. Any such failure could also adversely affect the results of the periodic management evaluations of our internal controls and, in the case of a failure to remediate any material weaknesses that we may identify, would adversely affect the annual auditor attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting that are required under SOX 404. Inadequate internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock and we could be subject to regulatory sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources.\nSubstantial sales of our stock may impact the market price of our common stock.\nFuture sales of substantial amounts of our common stock, including shares that we may issue upon exercise of options and warrants, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Further, if we raise additional funds through the issuance of common stock or securities convertible into or exercisable for common stock, the percentage ownership of our stockholders will be reduced and the price of our common stock may fall.", "PERMNO": 16887, "SIC": 2085, "TIC": "EAST"}
