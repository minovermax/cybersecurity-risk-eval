RISK FACTORS.\n\ufeff\nIn addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following factors should be considered in evaluating the Company and its business. Our future operating results depend upon many factors and are subject to various risks and uncertainties. The known material risks and uncertainties which may cause our operating results to vary from anticipated results or which may negatively affect our operating results and profitability are as follows:\n\ufeff\nOur business depends heavily on the operating levels of our customers and the economic factors that affect them, including general economic conditions.\n\ufeff\nMany of the primary markets for the products and services we sell are subject to cyclical fluctuations that affect demand for goods and materials that our customers produce. Consequently, demand for our products and services has been and will continue to be influenced by most of the same economic factors that affect demand for and production of our customers\u2019 products.\n\ufeff\nWhen, as occurs in economic downturns, current or prospective customers reduce production levels because of lower demand or tight credit conditions, their need for our products and services diminishes. Selling prices and terms of sale come under pressure, adversely affecting the profitability and the durability of customer relationships. Credit losses increase as well. Volatile economic and credit conditions also make it more difficult for distributors, as well as customers and suppliers, to forecast and plan future business activities.\n\ufeff\nIn addition, as various sectors of our industrial customer base face increased foreign competition, and in fact lose business to foreign competitors or shift their operations overseas in an effort to reduce expenses, we may face increased difficulty in growing and maintaining our market share and growth prospects.\n\ufeff\nChanges in our customer and product mix, or adverse changes to the cost of goods we sell, could cause our gross margin percentage to fluctuate, or decrease.\n\ufeff\nFrom time to time, we have experienced changes in our customer mix and in our product mix. Changes in our customer mix have resulted from geographic expansion, daily selling activities within current geographic markets, and targeted selling activities to new customers. Changes in our product mix have resulted from marketing activities to existing customers and needs communicated to us from existing and prospective customers as well as from business acquisitions. As our large account customer program sales grow, we will face continued pressures on maintaining gross margin because these\ncustomers receive lower pricing due to their higher level of purchases from us. In addition, our continued expansion of our vending program and other eCommerce platforms has placed pressure on our gross margin. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our historical gross margins. In addition, we may also be subject to price increases from vendors that we may not be able to pass along to our customers.\n\ufeff\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry.\n\ufeff\nThe MRO supply industry, although consolidating, still remains a large, fragmented industry that is highly competitive. We face competition from traditional channels of distribution such as retail outlets, small dealerships, regional and national distributors utilizing direct sales forces, manufacturers of MRO supplies, large warehouse stores and larger direct mail distributors. We believe that sales of MRO supplies will become more concentrated over the next few years, which may make the industry more competitive. Our competitors challenge us with a greater variety of product offerings, greater financial resources, additional services, or a combination of these factors. In addition, we also face the risk of companies which operate primarily outside of our industry entering our marketplace.\n\ufeff\nOur industry is evolving at an accelerated pace. If we do not have the agility and flexibility to effectively respond to this accelerated pace of industry changes, our strategy could be put at risk resulting in a loss of market share. We also face substantial competition in the online distribution space that competes with price transparency. Increased competition from online retailers (particularly those major internet providers who can offer a wide range of products and rapid delivery), and the adoption by competitors of aggressive pricing strategies and sales methods, could cause us to lose market share or reduce our prices, adversely affecting our sales, margins and profitability.\n\ufeff\nOur industry is evolving and consolidating, which could adversely affect our business and financial results.\n\ufeff\nThe business of selling MRO supplies in North America is currently evolving and undergoing consolidation. This consolidation is being driven by customer needs. Customers are increasingly aware of the total costs of fulfillment, and of their need to have consistent sources of supply at multiple locations. Consistent sources of supply provide not just reliable product quantities, but also consistent pricing, quality and service capabilities. We believe these customer needs could result in fewer suppliers as the industry consolidates, and as the remaining suppliers become larger and capable of being a consistent source of supply.\n\ufeff\nTraditional MRO suppliers are attempting to consolidate the market through internal expansion, through acquisitions or mergers with other industrial suppliers, or through a combination of both. This consolidation allows suppliers to improve efficiency and spread fixed costs over a greater number of sales, and to achieve other benefits derived from economies of scale.\n\ufeff\nThe trend of our industry toward consolidation could cause the industry to become more competitive as greater economies of scale are achieved by competitors, or as competitors with new lower-cost business models are able to operate with lower prices and gross profit on products. These trends may adversely affect our sales, margins and profitability.\n\ufeff\nVolatility in commodity and energy prices may adversely affect operating margins.\n\ufeff\nIn times of commodity and energy price increases, we may be subject to price increases from our vendors and freight carriers that we may be unable to pass along to our customers. Raw material costs used in our vendors\u2019 products (steel, tungsten, etc.) and energy costs may increase, which may result in increased production costs for our vendors. The fuel costs of our independent freight companies have been volatile. Our vendors and independent freight carriers typically look to pass increased costs along to us through price increases. When we are forced to accept these price increases, we may not be able to pass them along to our customers, resulting in lower margins.\n\ufeff\nIn addition to increases in commodity and energy prices, decreases in those costs, particularly if severe, could also adversely impact us by creating deflation in selling prices, which could cause our gross profit margin to deteriorate, or by negatively impacting customers in certain industries, which could cause our sales to those customers to decline.\n\ufeff\nInflation impacts the costs at which we can procure products and our ability to increase prices at which we sell to customers over time. Prolonged periods of low inflation or deflation could adversely affect our ability to increase the prices at which we sell to customers.\n\ufeff\nAs a United States government contractor, we are subject to certain laws and regulations which may increase our costs of doing business and which subject us to certain compliance requirements and potential liabilities.\n\ufeff\nAs a supplier to the United States government, we must comply with certain laws and regulations, including the Trade Agreements Act, the Buy American Act and the Federal Acquisition Regulation, relating to the formation, administration and performance of United States government contracts. These laws and regulations affect how we do business with government customers and, in some instances, impose added compliance and other costs on our business. From time to time, we are subject to governmental or regulatory inquiries or audits relating to our compliance with these laws and regulations. A violation of specific laws and regulations could result in the imposition of fines and penalties or the termination of our United States government contracts and could harm our reputation and cause our business to suffer.\n\ufeff\nOur business is exposed to the credit risk of our customers which could adversely affect our operating results.\n\ufeff\nWe perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers\u2019 financial condition, and collateral is generally not required. We evaluate the collectability of accounts receivable based on numerous factors, including past transaction history with customers and their creditworthiness and we provide a reserve for accounts that we believe to be uncollectible. A significant deterioration in the economy could have an adverse effect on the servicing of these accounts receivable, which could result in longer payment cycles, increased collection costs and defaults.\n\ufeff\nThe risk of cancellation or rescheduling of orders may cause our operating results to fluctuate.\n\ufeff\nThe cancellation or rescheduling of orders may cause our operating results to fluctuate. Although we strive to maintain ongoing relationships with our customers, there is an ongoing risk that orders may be cancelled or rescheduled due to fluctuations in our customers\u2019 business needs or purchasing budgets, including changes in national and local government budgets. Additionally, although our customer base is diverse, ranging from individual machine shops to Fortune 100 companies and large governmental agencies, the cancellation or rescheduling of significant orders by larger customers may still have a material adverse effect on our operating results from time to time.\n\ufeff\nWork stoppages and other disruptions, including those due to extreme weather conditions, at transportation centers or shipping ports may adversely affect our ability to obtain inventory and make deliveries to our customers.\n\ufeff\nOur ability to provide same-day shipping and next-day delivery of our core metalworking and MRO products is an integral component of our overall business strategy. Disruptions at transportation centers or shipping ports due to labor stoppages or severe weather conditions affect both our ability to maintain core products in inventory and deliver products to our customers on a timely basis, which may in turn adversely affect our customer relationships and results of operations. In addition, severe weather conditions, including winter storms, could adversely affect demand for our products in particularly hard-hit regions and impact our sales.\n\ufeff\nDisruptions or breaches of our information systems, or violations of data privacy laws, could adversely affect us.\n\ufeff\nWe believe that our IT systems are an integral part of our business and growth strategies. We depend upon our IT systems to help process orders, to manage inventory and accounts receivable collections, to manage financial reporting, to purchase, sell and ship products efficiently and on a timely basis, to maintain cost-effective operations, to operate our websites and to help provide superior service to our customers. Our IT systems may be vulnerable to damage or disruption caused by circumstances beyond our control or anticipation, such as catastrophic events, power outages, natural disasters, computer system or network failures, computer viruses, and physical or electronic break-ins. In addition, our IT systems may be vulnerable to cyberattacks, which are rapidly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated. Despite our efforts to ensure the integrity of our IT systems, as cyber-attacks evolve and become more difficult to detect and successfully defend against, one or more cyber-attacks might defeat the measures that we take to anticipate, detect, avoid or mitigate these threats. These cyber-attacks and any unauthorized access or disclosure of our information could compromise and expose sensitive information and damage our reputation. Cyber-attacks could also cause us to incur significant remediation costs, disrupt our operations and divert management attention and key IT resources.\n\ufeff\nAny material cyber-attack or failure of our IT systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and operations, result in transaction errors, loss of data, processing inefficiencies, downtime, litigation, substantial remediation costs (including potential liability for stolen assets or information and the costs of repairing system damage), the loss of sales and customers, and damage our reputation. In addition, changes to our information systems could disrupt our business operations. Any one or more of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, our suppliers and customers also rely upon IT systems to operate their respective\nbusinesses. If any of them experience a cyber-attack or other cyber incident, this could adversely impact their operations, which may in turn impact or adversely affect our operations.\n\ufeff\nIn addition, regulatory authorities have increased their focus on how companies collect, process, use, store, share and transmit personal data. New privacy security laws and regulations, including the United Kingdom\u2019s Data Protection Act 2018 (DPA), the European Union General Data Protection Regulation 2016 (GDPR) that became effective May 2018, the California Consumer Protection Act, which will become effective on January 1, 2020 and other similar state privacy laws, pose increasingly complex compliance challenges, which may increase compliance costs, and any failure to comply with data privacy laws and regulations could result in significant penalties.\n\ufeff\nOur business depends on our ability to retain and to attract qualified sales and customer service personnel and metalworking specialists.\n\ufeff\nOur business depends on our ability to attract, train, and retain sales and customer service professionals and metalworking specialists. We greatly benefit from having associates who are familiar with the products we sell and their applications, as well as associates, and in particular metalworking specialists, who can provide technical support to our customers. Qualified individuals of the requisite caliber and number needed to fill these positions may be difficult to hire and retain in sufficient numbers. If we are unable to hire and retain associates capable of providing a high level of customer service and technical support, our operational capabilities and ability to provide differentiated services may be adversely affected.\n\ufeff\nThe loss of key suppliers or contractors or supply chain disruptions could adversely affect our operating results.\n\ufeff\nWe believe that our ability to offer a combination of well-known brand-name products and competitively priced exclusive brand products is an important factor in attracting and retaining customers. Our ability to offer a wide range of products and services is dependent on obtaining adequate product supply and services from our key suppliers and contractors. The loss of or a substantial decrease in the availability of products or services from key suppliers or contractors at competitive prices, or the loss of a key brand, could cause our revenues and profitability to decrease. In addition, supply interruptions could arise due to transportation disruptions, labor disputes or other factors beyond our control. Disruptions in our supply chain could result in a decrease in revenues and profitability.\n\ufeff\nTrade policies could make sourcing products from overseas more difficult and/or costlier as well as negatively affect the markets we sell into.\n\ufeff\nAny changes to trade policies, including the imposition of significant restrictions, quotas, duties or tariffs, whether because of amendments to or elimination of existing trade agreements, or the imposition of new or modified trade tariffs, could have an adverse effect on our business. For example, between July 2018 and May 2019, the U.S. government imposed tariffs ranging between 10% and 25% on specified product lists totaling approximately $250.0 billion of Chinese imports, with the U.S. government ultimately raising the tariff rate on all of the $250.0 billion in imports to 25%. In response, China imposed or proposed new or higher tariffs on U.S. products. The U.S. government also announced the imposition of a 15% tariff on an additional $300.0 billion of Chinese imports effective September 1, 2019 for certain specified products and December 15, 2019 for the remaining specified products. China has taken additional retaliatory actions, including an increase in tariffs applied to U.S. products effective September 1, 2019. The U.S. government had announced its intention to increase the tariff rate on approximately $250.0 billion in Chinese imports to 30% on October 15, 2019. China had also threatened further retaliatory actions, including additional tariff increases later in 2019. On October 11, 2019, following negotiations between the Trump Administration and China\u2019s trade delegation, the two sides agreed on the substance of a \u201cPhase One\u201d trade deal after which the U.S. announced it was suspending its plan to increase tariffs on $250.0 billion of Chinese imports from 25% to 30% in exchange for China\u2019s verbal agreement to substantially increase its purchase of U.S. agricultural goods and make some concessions on intellectual property issues. The exact terms of the Phase One deal remain vague and are supposed to be written out over the following weeks. According to U.S. Treasury Secretary Mnuchin, the aim is for President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping to sign a formal agreement at the APEC Summit in mid-November. Notably, the substance of Phase One currently covers only a limited scope of issues, and neither removes existing tariffs on Chinese goods nor cancels U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods set to go into effect in December 2019. It remains uncertain whether this informal, verbal agreement will ultimately lead to an official trade deal which removes the recently imposed tariffs altogether.\n\ufeff\nAdditionally, in November 2018, the U.S. reached an agreement with Canada and Mexico on the United States-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement (\u201cUSMCA\u201d), which is proposed to replace the existing North American Free Trade Agreement among those countries. Among other things, the USMCA, as proposed, includes revised country of origin rules and labor provisions for the protection of workers.\n\ufeff\nThese changes and other changes to trade policy and trade relationships could adversely affect our ability to secure sufficient products to service our customers and/or result in increased product costs that we may not be able to pass on to our customers, resulting in lower margins. Additionally, these changes could adversely affect our foreign sales.\n\ufeff\nOpening or expanding our customer fulfillment centers exposes us to risks of delays and may affect our operating results.\n\ufeff\nIn the future, as part of our long-term strategic planning, we may open new customer fulfillment centers to improve our efficiency, geographic distribution and market penetration. In addition, we intend to make, as we have in the past, capital improvements and operational enhancements to certain of our existing customer fulfillment centers. Moving or opening customer fulfillment centers and effecting such improvements requires a substantial capital investment, including expenditures for real estate and construction, and opening new customer fulfillment centers requires a substantial investment in inventory. In addition, the opening of new customer fulfillment centers or the expansion of existing customer fulfillment centers would have an adverse impact on operating expenses as a percentage of sales, inventory turnover and return on investment in the periods prior to and for some time following the commencement of operations of each new customer fulfillment center or the completion of such expansions.\n\ufeff\nAn interruption of operations at our headquarters or customer fulfillment centers could adversely impact our business.\nOur business depends on maintaining operations at our co-located headquarters and customer fulfillment centers. A serious, prolonged interruption due to power outage, telecommunications outage, terrorist attack, earthquake, hurricane, fire, flood or other natural disaster or other interruption could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.\n\ufeff\nOur success is dependent on certain key personnel.\n\ufeff\nOur success depends largely on the efforts and abilities of certain key senior management. The loss of the services of one or more of such key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. We do not maintain any key-man insurance policies with respect to any of our executive officers.\n\ufeff\nWe are subject to litigation risk due to the nature of our business, which may have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\ufeff\nFrom time to time, we are involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings that arise from business transactions. These may, for example, relate to product liability claims, commercial disputes, or employment matters. In addition, we could face claims over other matters, such as claims arising from our status as a government contractor, intellectual property matters, or corporate or securities law matters. The defense and ultimate outcome of lawsuits or other legal proceedings may result in higher operating expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\n\ufeff\nWe may encounter difficulties with acquisitions and other strategic transactions which could harm our business.\n\ufeff\nWe have completed several acquisitions and we expect to continue to pursue acquisitions and other strategic transactions, such as joint ventures, that we believe will either expand or complement our business in new or existing markets or further enhance the value and offerings we are able to provide to our existing or future potential customers.\n\ufeff\nAcquisitions and other strategic transactions involve numerous risks and challenges, including the following:\n\ufeff\n\u2022diversion of management\u2019s attention from the normal operation of our business;\n\u2022potential loss of key associates and customers of the acquired companies;\n\u2022difficulties managing and integrating operations in geographically dispersed locations;\n\u2022the potential for deficiencies in internal controls at acquired companies;\n\u2022increases in our expenses and working capital requirements, which reduce our return on invested capital;\n\u2022lack of experience operating in the geographic market or industry sector of the acquired business; and\n\u2022exposure to unanticipated liabilities of acquired companies.\n\ufeff\nTo integrate acquired businesses, we must implement our management information systems, operating systems and internal controls, and assimilate and manage the personnel of the acquired operations. The difficulties of this integration may be further complicated by geographic distances. The integration of acquired businesses may not be successful and could result in disruption to other parts of our business.\n\ufeff\nThe terms of our credit facilities and senior notes impose operating and financial restrictions on us, which may limit our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions.\n\ufeff\nWe currently have credit facilities and outstanding senior notes. For a description of these facilities and senior notes, please see Note 9 \u201cDebt and Capital Lease Obligations\u201d in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We are subject to various operating and financial covenants under the credit facilities and senior notes which restrict our ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, make particular types of investments, incur certain types of liens, engage in fundamental corporate changes, enter into transactions with affiliates or make substantial asset sales. Any failure to comply with these covenants may constitute a breach under the credit facilities and senior notes, which could result in the acceleration of all or a substantial portion of any outstanding indebtedness and termination of revolving credit commitments. Our inability to maintain our revolving credit facility could materially adversely affect our liquidity and our business.\n\ufeff\nUncertainty about the future of the London Interbank Offer Rate may adversely affect our business and financial results.\n\ufeff\nBorrowings under our credit facilities use the London Interbank Offering Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) as a benchmark for establishing the applicable interest rate. LIBOR is the subject of recent regulatory guidance and proposals for reform, which may cause LIBOR to cease to be used entirely or to perform differently than in the past. The consequences of these developments with respect to LIBOR cannot be entirely predicted but could result in an increase in the cost of our variable rate indebtedness causing a negative impact on our financial position, liquidity and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nWe are subject to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations.\n\ufeff\nWe are subject to federal, state, local, foreign and provincial environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. Fines and penalties may be imposed for non-compliance with applicable environmental, health and safety requirements and the failure to have or to comply with the terms and conditions of required permits. The failure by us to comply with applicable environmental, health and safety requirements could result in fines, penalties, enforcement actions, third-party claims for property damage and personal injury, requirements to clean up property or to pay for the costs of cleanup, or regulatory or judicial orders requiring corrective measures, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\n\ufeff\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets recorded as a result of our acquisitions could become impaired.\n\ufeff\nAs of August 31, 2019, our combined goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets amounted to $690.2 million. To the extent we do not generate sufficient cash flows to recover the net amount of any investments in goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets recorded, the investment could be considered impaired and subject to write-off. We expect to record further goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets as a result of future acquisitions we may complete. Future amortization of such assets or impairments, if any, of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets would adversely affect our results of operations in any given period.\n\ufeff\nOur common stock price may be volatile.\n\ufeff\nWe believe factors such as fluctuations in our operating results or the operating results of our competitors, changes in economic conditions in the market sectors in which our customers operate, notably the durable and non-durable goods manufacturing industry, which accounted for a substantial portion of our revenue for fiscal year 2019, fiscal year 2018 and fiscal year 2017, and changes in general market conditions, could cause the market price of our Class A common stock to fluctuate substantially.\n\ufeff\nOur principal shareholders exercise significant control over us.\n\ufeff\nWe have two classes of common stock. Our Class A common stock has one vote per share and our Class B common stock has 10 votes per share. As of October 1, 2019, the Chairman of our Board of Directors, his sister, certain of their family members including our President and Chief Executive Officer, and related trusts collectively owned 100% of the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock and approximately 2.3% of the outstanding shares of our Class A common stock, giving them control over approximately 70.0% of the combined voting power of our Class A common stock and our Class B common stock. Consequently, such shareholders will be able to elect all the directors of the Company and to determine the outcome of any matter submitted to a vote of the Company\u2019s shareholders for approval, including amendments to our certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated by-laws, any proposed merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all our assets and other corporate transactions. Because this concentrated control could discourage others from initiating any potential merger, takeover or other change of control transaction that may otherwise be beneficial to our shareholders, the market price of our Class A common stock could be adversely affected.\n\ufeff", "PERMNO": 82777, "SIC": 5084, "TIC": "MSM"}
