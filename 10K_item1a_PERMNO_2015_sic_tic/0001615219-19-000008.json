{"cik": "1615219", "company": "Flex Pharma, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-06", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nCertain factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and you should carefully consider them. Accordingly, in evaluating our business, we encourage you to consider the following discussion of risk factors, in its entirety, in addition to other information contained in this Annual Report as well as our other public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nThere is no assurance that our proposed merger with Salarius Pharmaceuticals, LLC, or Salarius, will be completed in a timely manner or at all. If the merger with Salarius is not consummated, our business could suffer materially, and our stock price could decline.\nThe consummation of the proposed merger between us and Salarius is subject to a number of closing conditions, including the approval by our stockholders of several merger-related matters and other customary closing conditions. The parties are targeting a closing of the transaction in the first half of 2019, however, there can be no assurance that the proposed merger will be consummated on their desired timeframe, or at all.\nIf the proposed merger between us and Salarius is not consummated, we may be subject to a number of material risks, and our business and stock price could be adversely affected, as follows:\n\u2022\nwe have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant expenses related to the proposed merger with Salarius even if the merger is not consummated;\n\u2022\nwe may be required to pay Salarius a termination fee of $350,000 and/or reimburse Salarius\u2019 expenses up to a maximum of $200,000, depending on the reason for the termination;\n\u2022\nthe market price of our common stock may decline to the extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that the proposed merger will be completed; and\n\u2022\nwe may not pursue an alternate merger transaction if the proposed merger with Salarius is not completed.\nIf the merger is not completed, our Board of Directors may decide to pursue a dissolution, liquidation or winding-up of the company. In such an event, the amount of cash available for distribution to our stockholders will depend heavily on the timing of such liquidation, distribution or winding-up as well as the amount of cash that will need to be reserved for commitments and contingent liabilities.\nThere can be no assurance that the merger will be completed. If the merger is not completed, our board of directors would likely decide to pursue a dissolution, liquidation or winding-up of the company. In such an event, the amount of cash available for distribution to our stockholders will depend heavily on the timing of such decision, as with the passage of time the amount of cash available for distribution will be reduced as we continue to fund our operations. In addition, if we dissolve, liquidate or wind-up, we would be required under Delaware corporate law to pay our outstanding obligations, as well as to make reasonable provision for contingent and unknown obligations, prior to making any distributions to our stockholders. Our commitments and contingent liabilities may include: (i) any pending litigation against us, and other various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business and (ii) payments to certain employees. As a result of this requirement, a portion of our assets may need to be reserved pending the resolution of such obligations. In addition, we may be subject to litigation or other claims related to our dissolution, liquidation or winding-up. If a dissolution, liquidation or winding-up were pursued, our board of directors, in consultation with our advisors, would need to evaluate these matters and make a determination about a reasonable amount to reserve. Accordingly, holders of our common stock could lose all or a significant portion of their investment in the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding up.\nIf we fail to continue to meet all applicable Nasdaq Capital Market requirements and Nasdaq determines to delist our common stock, the delisting could prevent the closing of the merger and adversely affect the market liquidity of our common stock and the market price of our common stock could decrease.\nOn August 13, 2018, we received a letter from the listing qualifications department of The Nasdaq Stock Market, noting that for the prior 30 consecutive business days the bid price of our common stock had closed below $1.00 per share, the minimum closing bid price required by the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(a)(1). In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we were provided a period of 180 calendar days, or until February 11, 2019, to regain compliance. In order to regain compliance with the minimum closing bid price rule, the closing bid price of our common stock must be at least $1.00 or higher for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days during the 180-day compliance period. On February 12, 2019, we received a letter from the listing qualifications department of The Nasdaq Stock Market, noting that our transfer from the Nasdaq Global Market to the Nasdaq Capital Market was approved and that we were granted an additional 180 period, or until August 12, 2019, to regain compliance with the minimum closing bid price requirement.\nIf we do not regain compliance with the minimum closing bid price requirement prior to the expiration of the 180-day compliance period, and if it appears to Nasdaq that we will not be able to cure the deficiency, or if we fail to comply with other listing requirements in the future, Nasdaq will provide us with a written notification that our securities are subject to delisting from Nasdaq. At that time, we may appeal the delisting determination to a Nasdaq hearings panel.\nOn September 27, 2018, we received a letter from the listing qualifications department of The Nasdaq Stock Market, noting that for the prior 30 consecutive business days the market value of our common stock was below $5 million, the minimum amount required by the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(b)(1)(C). In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(D), we were provided a period of 180 calendar days, or until March 26, 2019, to regain compliance. In order to regain compliance with the minimum market value rule, the market value of our common stock must meet or exceed $5 million for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days during the 180-day grace period. On November 26, 2018, we received a letter from Nasdaq notifying us that we regained compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(b)(1)(C). The letter noted that for the last 10 consecutive business days from the date of the letter, the market value of the our publicly held shares was $5 million or greater.\nThe failure to maintain our listing on Nasdaq could have an adverse effect on the market price and liquidity of our shares of common stock and reduce our ability to raise additional capital. In addition, if our common stock is delisted from Nasdaq and the trading price remains below $5.00 per share, trading in our common stock might also become subject to the requirements of certain rules promulgated under the Exchange Act, which require additional disclosure by broker-dealers in connection with any trade involving a stock defined as a \u201cpenny stock\u201d (generally, any equity security not listed on a national securities exchange or quoted on Nasdaq that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions).\nAs a result of the closure of our Phase 2 studies and the reductions in our workforce announced in June 2018, we have only four employees remaining as of the date of this filing. If we are unable to retain the remaining employees, our ability to consummate the planned merger transaction may be delayed or seriously jeopardized.\nOn June 13, 2018, we announced workforce reductions, and current headcount has been reduced to four employees. Our cash conservation activities may yield unintended consequences, such as attrition beyond the planned workforce reductions and reduced employee morale, which may cause the remaining employees to seek alternate employment. Competition among biotechnology companies for qualified employees is intense, and the ability to retain the remaining employees is critical to our ability to effectively manage our business and to consummate the planned merger transaction. Additional attrition could have a material adverse effect on our business and ability to consummate the merger. In addition, as a result of the reduction in our workforce, we face an increased risk of employment litigation.\nWe are an early-stage company with a limited commercial history and a history of net losses. We expect to incur net losses in the future and may never achieve sustained profitability or even revenue.\nWe are a biotechnology company that has announced an end to our Phase 2 clinical trials of FLX-787 due to oral tolerability concerns observed in the two studies. We currently have no foreseeable path to significant revenue with our current clinical assets. We have historically incurred substantial net losses. Since inception, we have incurred a significant loss. We incurred an accumulated net loss of $133.0 million from February 26, 2014, the date of our inception, to December 31, 2018. We expect our losses to continue. These losses have had, and will continue to\nhave, an adverse effect on our working capital, total assets and stockholders\u2019 equity. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with our business, we may never become profitable. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our inability to achieve and then maintain profitability would negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business to date has been almost entirely dependent on the clinical success of FLX-787. With the failure of FLX-787, we have no immediate prospects for significant revenue or profitability.\nDue to the early stage nature of our business and our limited marketing activities to date, with the failure of FLX-787 it is not likely we have any immediate prospects for significant revenue or profitability.\nThe loss of our key members of our executive management team could adversely affect our business.\nWe cannot make any assurances that any of the key remaining members of our management team will remain with us in the event the merger is not consummated. Accordingly, we may be unable to execute any reasonable salvage strategy or properly execute a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the company.\nDeclining general economic or business conditions may have a negative impact on our business.\nContinuing concerns over U.S. healthcare reform legislation and energy costs, geopolitical issues, such as the government shutdown or Brexit, the availability and cost of credit in the United States and other countries have in the past and may in the future contribute to increased volatility and diminished expectations for the global economy. These factors, if combined with low business and consumer confidence and high unemployment, could precipitate an economic slowdown and recession. If the economic climate deteriorates, our business, as well as the financial condition of our suppliers and our third-party suppliers, could be adversely affected, resulting in a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on our information technology and telecommunications systems, and any failure of these systems could harm our business.\nWe depend on information technology and telecommunications systems for significant aspects of our operations. These information technology and telecommunications systems support a variety of functions. Information technology and telecommunications systems are vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources, including telecommunications or network failures, malicious human acts and natural disasters. Moreover, despite network security and back-up measures, some of our systems are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses and similar disruptive and liability-creating problems. Despite the precautionary measures we have taken to prevent unanticipated problems that could affect our information technology and telecommunications systems, failures or significant downtime of our information technology or telecommunications systems or those used by our third-party service providers could prevent us from processing all manner of significant data, conducting research and development activities and managing the administrative aspects of our business.\nWe are required to comply with laws governing the transmission, security and privacy of health information that require significant compliance costs, and any failure to comply with these laws could result in material criminal and civil penalties.\nUnder the administrative simplification provisions of the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, (which we refer to as \u201cHIPAA\u201d), the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has issued regulations which establish uniform standards governing the conduct of certain electronic health care transactions and protecting the privacy and security of Protected Health Information, (which we refer to as \u201cPHI\u201d), used or disclosed by health care providers and other covered entities. Three principal regulations with which we are currently required to comply have been issued in final form under HIPAA: privacy regulations, security regulations and standards for electronic transactions.\nThe privacy regulations cover the use and disclosure of PHI by health care providers. It also sets forth certain rights that an individual has with respect to his or her PHI maintained by a health care provider, including the right to access or amend certain records containing PHI or to request restrictions on the use or disclosure of PHI. We have also implemented policies, procedures and standards to comply appropriately with the final HIPAA security regulations, which establish requirements for safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity and availability of PHI, which is electronically transmitted or electronically stored. The HIPAA privacy and security regulations establish a uniform federal \u201cfloor\u201d and do not supersede state laws that are more stringent or provide individuals with greater rights with respect to the privacy or security of, and access to, their records containing PHI. As a result, we are required to\ncomply with both HIPAA privacy regulations and varying state privacy and security laws. Almost all U.S. states now require notification to affected individuals and state authorities, as well as the media in certain cases, in the event of a breach of the security of personal information (including PHI in a few states), often with significant financial penalties for noncompliance.\nThe Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, (which we refer to as the \u201cHITECH Act\u201d), enacted pursuant to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, (which we refer to as \u201cARRA\u201d), made sweeping changes to the health information privacy and security regulations of HIPAA by expanding the scope and application of the statute. These changes include, among other things: (1) establishing an affirmative obligation to provide patient data breach notification in the event of the unauthorized acquisition, access, use or disclosure of unsecured PHI; (2) elaborating upon the standard for \u201cminimum necessary\u201d uses and disclosures of PHI by a covered entity; (3) restricting certain uses of PHI for marketing purposes (by expanding the definition of marketing activities requiring authorization); (4) prohibiting certain sales of PHI; (5) establishing an affirmative obligation to provide an accounting of disclosures made for payment, treatment and health care operations (up to three years made through an electronic health record); (6) requiring covered entities to agree to individuals\u2019 requests to restrict disclosure of PHI in certain circumstances; (7) applying the security regulations and certain provisions of the privacy regulations to business associates; and (8) modifying an individuals\u2019 right to access PHI in an electronic format. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services issued modifications to the HIPAA Regulations, effective March 26, 2013, implementing some of these changes including the obligation to provide patient data breach notifications, which subject the company to additional administrative requirements in the United States. With regard to the accounting of disclosures, the HITECH Act provides for removing the exception in the existing HIPAA privacy regulations\u2019 accounting of disclosures of PHI requirement for disclosures of PHI for payment, treatment, and health care operations purposes made through an electronic health record (within the past three years). The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services issued proposed regulations to implement this provision of the HITECH Act in May 2011, but those regulations have not been finalized.\nThe HITECH Act also implemented measures to strengthen enforcement of HIPAA and increased applicable penalties for HIPAA violations. Penalties are now tiered and range from $100 to $50,000 per violation with an annual cap for the same violations of $25,000 to $1,500,000. The Office for Civil Rights of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, (which we refer to as the \u201cOCR\u201d), has increased enforcement activities and has recently levied large penalties for violations. In addition, as mandated by the HITECH Act, OCR has begun an audit program to assess compliance by covered entities and their business associates with the HIPAA privacy and security rules and breach notification standards.\nWe seek to comply with HIPAA privacy regulations and state privacy laws. Given the complexity of HIPAA, the HITECH Act and state privacy restrictions, the possibility that the regulations may change, and the fact that the regulations are subject to changing and potentially conflicting interpretation, our ability to comply with HIPAA, the HITECH Act and state privacy requirements is uncertain, and the costs of compliance are significant. To the extent that we or our third-party billing company submit electronic health care claims and payment transactions that do not comply with the electronic data transmission standards established under HIPAA and the HITECH Act, payments to us may be delayed or denied. Additionally, the costs of complying with any changes to HIPAA, the HITECH Act and state privacy restrictions may have a negative impact on our operations. We could be subject to criminal penalties and civil sanctions for failing to comply with HIPAA, the HITECH Act and state privacy restrictions, which could result in the incurrence of significant monetary penalties.\nIf we ever again pursued clinic studies or placed a product or products in the market for use by patients, a host of federal and state healthcare regulations would apply to our business, which would create operational risk and potential liability.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Condition\nWe have incurred significant losses since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future.\nWe have generated limited revenue from sales of HOTSHOT and have generated no revenue from any of our drug product candidates. We have incurred net losses in each year since our inception on February 26, 2014, including a consolidated net loss of $21.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2018, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $133.0 million. Our prior losses, combined with expected future losses, have had and may continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders\u2019 equity and working capital.\nTo date, we have financed our operations with net proceeds from the private placement of our preferred stock and our initial public offering. The amount of our future net losses will depend, in part, on the rate of our future expenditures and our ability to generate revenue.\nThe net losses we incur may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, such that a period-to-period comparison of our results of operations may not be a good indication of our future performance. In any particular quarter or quarters, our operating results could be below the expectations of investors, which could cause our stock price to decline.\nIf the merger is not completed, we would need to raise substantial additional funding to the extent we operate our consumer business or resume our drug development efforts, which may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Failure to obtain this necessary capital when needed may force us to delay, limit or terminate our drug development efforts or other operations.\nIf the merger is not completed, we may require substantial additional capital to fund our research and development and expenses related to our consumer brand and HOTSHOT. We had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $9.8 million at December 31, 2018. Our current operating plan assumes limited research and development activities and that we will continue to sell HOTSHOT. In the event that the merger is not completed, we would likely pursue a liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the company, or may seek to complete an alternate strategic transaction or may elect to continue to market HOTSHOT and operate our consumer business. Based on our current operating plan, we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to allow us to fund our current operating plan for at least 12 months from the date the financial statements are issued.\nWe cannot predict to what extent we will resume drug development activities for FLX-787 or any other drug product candidate. If we resume drug development activities, only a small minority of all research and development programs ultimately result in commercially successful drugs. Clinical failure can occur at any stage of clinical development and clinical trials may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical or preclinical trials. In addition, data obtained from trials are susceptible to varying interpretations, and regulators may not interpret our data as favorably as we do, which may delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. Success in preclinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will generate the same results or otherwise provide adequate data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of a drug candidate. Further, even if we complete the development for a drug product candidate and gain marketing approvals from the FDA, and comparable foreign regulatory authorities in a timely manner, we cannot be sure that such drug product candidate will be commercially successful in the pharmaceutical market. If the results of clinical trials, the anticipated or actual timing of marketing approvals, or the market acceptance of any drug product candidate, if approved, do not meet the expectations of investors or public market analysts, the market price of our common stock would likely decline. Further, if we resume drug development activities, we will need substantial additional financing to complete the development of FLX-787 or any other drug product candidates we may develop.\nWe expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future. Our ability to achieve profitability in the future is dependent upon achieving a level of revenues adequate to support our cost structure. We may never achieve profitability, and unless and until we do, we will continue to need to raise additional capital. If we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the issuance of those securities could result in substantial dilution for our current stockholders and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our current stockholders, further diminishing current stockholders' ability to realize any value for their stock holdings. Furthermore, the issuance of additional securities, whether equity or debt, by us, or the possibility of such issuance, may cause the market price of our common stock to decline further and existing stockholders may not agree with our financing plans or the terms of such financings. There can be no assurances, however, that additional funding will be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nRisks Related to Our Consumer Business\nWe depend on third-party manufacturers and suppliers, including sole source manufacturers and suppliers, for HOTSHOT. We may not be able to maintain these relationships and could experience supply disruptions outside of our control.\nWe rely on a network of third-party manufacturers to supply materials and produce HOTSHOT. Our supply chain for sourcing raw materials and production is a multi-step endeavor. Third-party contract suppliers provide us with raw materials and our co-packer converts these raw materials into finished goods available for sale. Establishing and managing this supply chain requires a significant financial commitment and the creation and maintenance of\nnumerous third-party contractual relationships. Although we attempt to effectively manage the business relationships with companies in our supply chain, we do not have control over their operations. As a result of our reliance on these third-party manufacturers and suppliers, including a sole source co-packer and sole source suppliers of certain components of HOTSHOT, we could be subject to significant supply disruptions.\nWe currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on a sole source third-party co-packer to produce, bottle and package HOTSHOT and have entered into a production agreement with this co-packer. We rely on a third party as the sole source for certain of the raw materials in HOTSHOT and have entered into a supply agreement with this supplier. There can be no assurance any of our sole source third-party manufacturers and suppliers will meet our commercial demands in a timely manner or that we will be to identify and establish relationships with qualified additional or back-up suppliers and manufacturers. Any supply or manufacturing disruptions could disrupt the sales of our consumer product, which could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWe are dependent on a limited number of fulfillment and distribution partners. If we are unable to obtain shipments of product from our vendors and deliver merchandise to our customers in a timely and cost-effective manner, our business and results of operations would be harmed.\nWe cannot control all of the various factors that might affect our timely and cost-effective procurement of products from our vendors and delivery of products to our customers. We use third-party fulfillment partners to fulfill orders of HOTSHOT, including shipping HOTSHOT to and from warehouse and distribution facilities and shipping to customers. We are therefore subject to the risks, including increased fuel costs, security concerns, labor disputes, union organizing activity, and inclement weather, associated with our carriers\u2019 ability to provide product fulfillment and delivery services to meet our distribution and shipping needs. Failure to procure and deliver merchandise, either to our fulfillment partners or to our customers, in a timely and accurate manner would harm our reputation, our brand, our business, and our results of operations. In addition, any increase in fulfillment costs and expenses could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nOur employees, independent contractors, principal investigators, CROs, consultants, commercial partners and vendors may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including non-compliance with regulatory standards and requirements.\nWe are exposed to the risk of fraud or other misconduct by employees and independent contractors, such as principal investigators, CROs, manufacturers, consultants, commercial partners and vendors. Misconduct by these parties could include the disclosure of unauthorized activities to us or intentional or negligent failures to comply with FDA regulations, to provide accurate information to the FDA, to comply with manufacturing standards, to comply with federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws, to report financial information or data accurately. In particular, sales, marketing and other business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws intended to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws may restrict or prohibit a wide range of business activities, including, but not limited to certain activities related to research, manufacturing, distribution, pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Misconduct by employees and other third parties could also involve the improper use of individually identifiable information, including, without limitation, information obtained in the course of clinical studies and trials. In addition, federal procurement laws impose substantial penalties for misconduct in connection with government contracts and require certain contractors to maintain a code of business ethics and conduct.\nWe have adopted a code of business ethics and conduct, but it is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct by employees and other third parties, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent improper activities may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, disgorgement, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings and curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain customers and do so at an acceptable cost, we will be unable to generate significant revenue for HOTSHOT and achieve profitability.\nSince launch, we have promoted HOTSHOT as a product that is scientifically proven to prevent and treat muscle cramps. In an in-home study, the vast majority of endurance and non-endurance athletes survey reported that\nHOTSHOT was effective in helping reduce muscle soreness and muscle pain. Promoting and positioning HOTSHOT depends largely on the success of our marketing efforts and our ability to provide consistent, high quality customer experiences. We believe that, because we are a small company with low public brand awareness in a competitive market, achieving significant market awareness may require significant marketing expense. To promote our brand and HOTSHOT, we have incurred substantial expense in our marketing efforts both to attract and to retain customers.\nConsumer acceptance of HOTSHOT as a product to help prevent and treat muscle cramps and reportedly reduce muscle soreness and reduce muscle pain can be significantly influenced by customer reviews, social media, national media attention, the conduct and statements by athletes using or endorsing a product, other publicity about product use and the discretionary income available to consumers. Our promotional activities may not be effective in building our brand awareness and customer base to the extent necessary to generate sufficient revenue to become profitable.\nThe success of HOTSHOT also depends, in large part, on our ability to attract visitors to our website and convert them into customers in a cost-effective manner. If we are unable to attract customers in a cost-effective manner, we may not become profitable.\nEven if we are successful generating brand awareness, we may not build a critical mass of repeat customers that continue to purchase our consumer product. After their initial purchase, consumers may elect not to purchase our product for a variety of different reasons, including its taste, price or effectiveness or the customer's limited need. If consumers do not purchase HOTSHOT repetitively, then we will not generate significant revenue from our consumer product and achieve profitability.\nThe beverage market is subject to seasonal variations and we expect the impact of seasonality may be more significant for HOTSHOT than it is for other beverages. Given that our customers' exercise patterns may vary with the seasons, we expect HOTSHOT sales to be generally higher during the warmer months when athletes may be more inclined to exercise. Our business will be harmed if customers cease using HOTSHOT during periods of inactivity and do not begin purchasing HOTSHOT in their next training cycle.\nIf we cannot compete successfully for market share against other pharmaceutical companies, dietary supplement companies and consumer companies, we may not achieve sufficient product revenue and our business will suffer.\nHOTSHOT competes against both small and large companies developing and marketing dietary supplement and conventional beverages. We believe the principal elements of competition in the consumer product industry are price, taste, selection, brand recognition, brand loyalty, distribution channel offerings, the effectiveness of the product and discretionary income available to consumers. If our consumer product gains market acceptance, we are likely to experience increased competition as more participants enter the market. Certain of our competitors are larger than us and have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, greater brand recognition and greater resources for marketing, advertising and product promotion. They may be able to secure inventory from vendors on more favorable terms, operate with a lower cost structure or adopt more aggressive pricing policies. Our competitors may also be more effective and efficient in introducing new products. We may not be able to compete effectively, and our attempt to do so may require us to increase marketing and/or reduce our prices, which may result in lower margins. Failure to effectively compete could materially adversely affect our market share, financial condition and growth prospects.\nThe majority of our inventory is concentrated in one warehouse location operated by our third- party logistics partner, which exposes us to the risk of natural disasters or other force majeure events. Losses at this location could materially adversely affect our product distributions, sales and consumer satisfaction.\nThe majority of HOTSHOT inventory is concentrated in one warehouse location. Any significant disruption to the operation of the warehouse location for any reason, such as a power failure, equipment breakdown, workforce disruption, or natural or similar disasters, could materially adversely affect our product distribution, sales and consumer satisfaction.\nWe may incur product liability claims, which could increase our costs and/or materially adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe marketing of HOTSHOT entails an inherent risk of product liability. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities. Retailers and formulators of products designed for human consumption may be subject to product liability claims if the use of their products is alleged to have\nresulted in illness or injury or if their products include inadequate instructions or warnings. Our consumer products could contain spoiled or contaminated substances, and some of our products may contain ingredients that do not have long histories of human consumption. We could be subject to product liability claims, including among others, that our products were not effective in preventing or treating muscle cramps or other marketed product attributes or that our products include insufficient instructions for use or inadequate warnings concerning possible side effects or interactions with other substances. Any product liability claim against us could result in increased costs and adversely affect our reputation with our customers, which in turn could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nInsurance coverage, even where available, may not be sufficient to cover losses we may incur, which could increase our costs and lower our profits.\nOur business exposes us to the risk of liabilities arising out of our products and operations. For example, we may be liable for claims brought by users of our products or by employees, customers or other third parties for personal injury, loss, or property damage occurring in the course of our operations. We will seek to minimize these risks through various insurance policies from third-party insurance carriers. The insurance industry has become more selective in offering certain types of insurance, including product liability, product recall, cybersecurity and property casualty insurance. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain or maintain adequate amounts of such coverage or obtain comparable coverage on terms and conditions favorable to us, if at all. Further, we anticipate that any additional insurance coverage we may obtain will be subject to large individual claim deductibles, individual claim and aggregate policy limits and other terms and conditions. We cannot be sure that our insurance will be sufficient to cover our losses. Any losses that are not completely covered by our insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations, including preventing or limiting the commercialization of drug products and consumer products we develop, alone or with collaborators.\nUnfavorable publicity or consumer acceptance of HOTSHOT or of dietary supplements or conventional beverages, generally, could reduce our sales.\nWe expect to be dependent upon consumer acceptance of the safety, efficacy and quality of our products. Consumer acceptance of products can be significantly influenced by customer reviews, social media, scientific research or findings, national media attention, the conduct and statements by athletes endorsing a product, other publicity about product use and discretionary income available to consumers. A product may initially be received favorably, resulting in high sales associated with that product that may not be sustainable as consumer preferences change. Alternatively, skepticism of claims made by companies in the conventional beverage and dietary supplement industries may limit the number of individuals that believe our consumer products are effective in preventing muscle cramps or providing any other claimed benefit, which may negatively our ability to generate significant sales from our consumer products.\nFor instance, many consumers currently believe that hydration, stretching and sports drinks are sufficient to prevent EAMCs. To successfully market HOTSHOT, we will need to convince consumers that these treatments, alone, are insufficient in relieving or preventing muscle cramps. Changing consumer behavior patterns may take months or years to accomplish and there is no guarantee that we will be successful in doing so. There is no guarantee that consumers will be willing to use our consumer product, particularly in light of the fact that HOTSHOT is priced at a premium to many conventional beverages. If consumers are not willing to purchase HOTSHOT, our ability to generate significant revenue from the sale of HOTSHOT may be limited.\nScientific research or publicity could be unfavorable to the dietary supplement and conventional beverage industries or any of our particular products. Any research or publicity that is perceived by our consumers as less than favorable or that questions earlier favorable research or publicity could have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate revenue. Adverse publicity in the form of published scientific research, statements by regulatory authorities or otherwise, whether or not accurate, that associates consumption of our products or any other similar products with illness or other adverse events, or that questions the benefits of our or similar products, or that claims that such products are ineffective, could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations. Further, we have entered into endorsement agreements with professional athletes. Any misconduct by these athletes or negative statements about our product by these athletes may limit our ability to generate significant consumer product sales.\nIf we experience product recalls, we may incur significant and unexpected costs and damage to our reputation which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may be subject to product recalls, withdrawals or seizures if any of the products we sell are believed to cause injury or illness or if we are alleged to have violated governmental regulations in the labeling, promotion, sale or distribution of our products. A recall, withdrawal or seizure of any of our products could materially and adversely affect consumer confidence in our brands and lead to decreased demand for our products. In addition, a recall, withdrawal or seizure of any of our products would require significant management attention, would likely result in substantial and unexpected expenditures and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to maintain intellectual property protection, our competitive position could be harmed.\nOur ability to protect our proprietary discoveries and technologies affects our ability to monetize any of our remaining assets. Currently, we rely on a combination of issued U.S. patents, U.S. and foreign patent applications, copyrights, trademarks and trademark applications, confidentiality or non-disclosure agreements, material transfer agreements, licenses, work-for-hire agreements and invention assignment agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. We also maintain certain company know-how, trade secrets and technological innovations designed to provide us with a competitive advantage in the market place as trade secrets.\nTo the extent there is any remaining value in any of these intellectual property assets, it may be lost if we are unable to protect our intellectual property.\nWe may face intellectual property infringement claims that could be time-consuming and costly to defend and could result in our loss of significant rights and the assessment of treble damages.\nFrom time to time we may face intellectual property infringement, misappropriation, or invalidity/non-infringement claims from third parties. Some of these claims may lead to litigation. The outcome of any such litigation can never be guaranteed, and an adverse outcome could affect us negatively. For example, were a third party to succeed on an infringement claim against us, we may be required to pay substantial damages (including up to treble damages if such infringement were found to be willful). Potential damages could easily consume all or most of our remaining cash. In addition, we could face an injunction, barring us from conducting the allegedly infringing activity. The outcome of the litigation could require us to enter into a license agreement which may not be under acceptable, commercially reasonable, or practical terms or we may be precluded from obtaining a license at all.\nFinally, we could initiate claims to assert or defend our own intellectual property against third parties. If one or more of our patents were held to be invalid or not infringed, we might not be able to exclude others from offering similar or identical products or services. Any intellectual property litigation, irrespective of whether we are the plaintiff or the defendant, and regardless of the outcome, is expensive and time-consuming, and could divert our management\u2019s attention from our business and negatively affect our operating results or financial condition.\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile and fluctuate substantially, which could result in substantial losses for our stockholders.\nOur stock price has been and is likely in the future to be volatile. The stock market in general and the market for smaller clinical biotechnology companies in particular have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. As a result of this volatility, our stockholders may not be able to sell their common stock at or above the price they paid for it. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including:\n\u2022\nannouncements and market perceptions related to the merger;\n\u2022\nissuances of new equity securities pursuant to a future offering, including issuances of preferred stock or convertible debt;\n\u2022\nthe success of competitive products, services or technologies;\n\u2022\nregulatory or legal developments in the United States and other countries;\n\u2022\ndevelopments or disputes concerning patent applications, issued patents or other proprietary rights;\n\u2022\nthe recruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated changes in estimates as to financial results, development timelines or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nvariations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n\u2022\nchanges in the structure of health care payment systems;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic, industry and market conditions; and\n\u2022\nthe other factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of the Company more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our management.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may delay or prevent an acquisition or a change in management. These provisions include a classified board of directors, a prohibition on actions by written consent of our stockholders and the ability of the board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval. In addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, it is governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or DGCL, which prohibits our stockholders owning in excess of 15% of the outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us, subject to limited exceptions. Although we believe these provisions collectively will provide for an opportunity to receive higher bids by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors, they would apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove then current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of the board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of management.\nIf our shares become subject to the penny stock rules, it may be more difficult to sell our shares.\nThe SEC has adopted rules that regulate broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks. Penny stocks are generally equity securities with a price of less than $5.00 (other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or authorized for quotation on certain automated quotation systems, provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange or system). The OTC Bulletin Board does not meet such requirements. If the price of our common stock remains less than $5.00 and we are not listed on a national securities exchange, our common stock may be deemed a penny stock. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document containing specified information. In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to effecting any transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, a broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive: (i) the purchaser\u2019s written acknowledgment of the receipt of a risk disclosure statement; (ii) a written agreement to transactions involving penny stocks; and (iii) a signed and dated copy of a written suitability statement. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the trading activity in the secondary market for common stock, and therefore stockholders may have difficulty selling their shares.\nAn active trading market for our common stock may not develop.\nPrior to our initial public offering on January 28, 2015, there was no public market for our common stock. The listing of our common stock on The Nasdaq Capital Market does not assure that a meaningful, consistent and liquid trading market exists. Although our common stock is listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market, trading volume in our common stock has been limited and an active trading market for our shares may never develop or be sustained. If an active market for our common stock does not develop, it may be difficult for investors to sell their shares without depressing the market price for the shares or at all.\nFuture sales of our common stock, or the perception that future sales may occur, may cause the market price of our common stock to decline, even if our business is doing well.\nSales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales may occur, could materially and adversely affect the price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. We maintain a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC pursuant to which we may, from time to time, sell up to an aggregate of $125 million of our common stock, preferred stock, debt securities and warrants, although we have limited ability to use our shelf registration statement\non Form S-3. Sales of securities under the registration statement will result in dilution of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to fall.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d and the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, (which we refer to as the \u201cJOBS Act\u201d) and may remain an emerging growth company for up to five years. For so long as we remain an emerging growth company, we are permitted and intend to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. These exemptions include:\n\u2022\nbeing permitted to provide only two years of audited financial statements, in addition to any required unaudited interim financial statements, with correspondingly reduced \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d disclosure;\n\u2022\nnot being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting;\n\u2022\nnot being required to comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor\u2019s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements;\n\u2022\nreduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation; and\n\u2022\nexemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\nWe have taken advantage of reduced reporting burdens in our periodic disclosure reports. In particular, we have not included all of the executive compensation related information that would be required if we were not an emerging growth company. We cannot predict whether investors will find our common stock less attractive if we rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nSince the initial public offering on January 28, 2015, we have incurred significantly increased costs and our management has had to devote substantial time as a result of operating as a public company and our future costs are uncertain.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market or the Nasdaq Global Market and other applicable securities rules and regulations impose various requirements on public companies, including establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel have had to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives since becoming a public company. Moreover, these rules and regulations have increased our legal and financial compliance costs and have made certain activities more time-consuming and costlier.\nBecause we are still a relatively new public company and in the aftermath of the termination of our clinical studies, we cannot predict or estimate the costs we may incur in the future with respect to these compliance initiatives or the timing of such costs. In addition, these rules and regulations are often subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices.\nPursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, (which we refer to as \u201cSection 404\u201d), as an emerging growth company, we are not required to include an attestation report on internal control over financial reporting issued by our independent registered public accounting firm in our annual report. To achieve compliance with Section 404 within the prescribed period, we will be engaged in a process to document and evaluate our internal control over financial reporting, which is both costly and challenging. In this regard, we will need to continue to dedicate internal resources, potentially engage outside consultants and adopt a detailed work plan to assess and document the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting, continue steps to improve control processes as appropriate, validate through testing that controls are functioning as documented and implement a continuous reporting and improvement process for internal control over financial reporting. Despite our efforts, there is a risk\nthat we will not be able to conclude, within the prescribed timeframe or at all, that our internal control over financial reporting is effective as required by Section 404. If we identify one or more material weaknesses, it could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements.\nBecause we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our capital stock in the foreseeable future, if ever, capital appreciation, if any, will be our sole source of gain.\nWe do not anticipate paying future dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain all of our future earnings, if any, to finance the growth and development of our business. In addition, the terms of any future debt agreements may preclude us from paying dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, on the common stock will be our stockholders\u2019 sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us or increase the cost of acquiring us, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders or remove our current management.\nSome provisions of our charter documents and Delaware law may have anti-takeover effects that could discourage an acquisition of us by others, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nauthorizing the issuance of \"blank check\" preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval;\n\u2022\nlimiting the removal of directors by the stockholders;\n\u2022\ncreating a staggered board of directors;\n\u2022\nprohibiting stockholder action by written consent, thereby requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022\neliminating the ability of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders; and\n\u2022\nestablishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at stockholder meetings.\nThese provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management. In addition, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an interested stockholder, unless such transactions are approved by our board of directors. This provision could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control, whether or not it is desired by or beneficial to our stockholders. Further, other provisions of Delaware law may also discourage, delay or prevent someone from acquiring us or merging with us.", "PERMNO": 15177, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "SLRX"}
