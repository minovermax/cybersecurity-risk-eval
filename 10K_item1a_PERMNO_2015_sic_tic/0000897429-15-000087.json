The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks that may have a material adverse effect on the Company and the risks described herein are not listed in order of the likelihood that the risk might occur or the severity of the impact if the risk should occur. There can be no assurance that we have identified, assessed and appropriately addressed all risks affecting our business operations. Additional risks and uncertainties also could adversely affect our business and our results. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, consolidated financial condition or results of operations could be negatively affected, and the market price for our shares could decline. Further, to the extent that any of the information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K constitutes forward-looking statements, the risk factors set forth below also are cautionary statements, identifying important factors that could cause the Company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company. There can also be no assurance that the actual future results, performance, benefits, or achievements that we expect from our strategies, systems, initiatives, or products will occur.\nRisks Associated With Our Business Strategy.\nAs noted on page 3, our overall business strategy is focused on building and cultivating a portfolio of high performing retail brands serving women 35 years and older. If we cannot successfully execute our business strategy, our consolidated financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely impacted. There are numerous risks associated with this strategy including, but not limited to, the following:\nOur ability to effectively implement and manage our business strategy.\nOur long-term omni-channel business strategy is dependent upon a number of factors, including: testing of new retail concepts and products, effectively managing our store base, negotiating favorable lease terms, having the appropriate corporate resources to support our business strategies, sourcing levels of inventory in line with expected sales, hiring and training qualified employees, generating sufficient operating cash flows to fund expansion plans, and maintaining brand specific websites that offer the system functionality and security customers expect.\nOur ability to identify and develop new concepts, brand extensions and new markets.\nOne aspect of our business strategy involves the strategic acquisition or organic development and growth of new concepts, brand extensions and new markets. Each of these involves risks such as the failure to achieve the results that we expect, significant capital expenditures, diversion of management\u2019s attention from operational matters, difficulties integrating\noperations and personnel, difficulties associated with the retention of key personnel, customer acceptance, competition, product differentiation, and challenges to economies of scale in merchandise sourcing.\nOur ability to effectively manage the productivity of our stores, websites and catalogs.\nThere is no guarantee that any new store we open will have similar operating results to those of our existing stores. Depending on the brand, new stores may take three to four years to reach planned operating levels due to inefficiencies typically associated with new stores, including demands on operational, managerial and administrative resources, and some new stores may never reach planned operating levels. The failure of existing or new stores to perform as predicted could result in impairment of long-lived assets.\nIn addition, we maintain inventory levels for our stores, websites and catalogs that we anticipate will be in line with projected demand. Inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory write-downs or the sale of excess inventory at discounted or closeout prices. Conversely, if we underestimate consumer demand for our merchandise, particularly higher volume styles, or if our suppliers fail to supply quality products in a timely manner, we may experience inventory shortages, which might result in missed sales, negatively impact customer relationships, diminish brand loyalty and result in lost revenues.\nOur ability to effectively locate new and existing stores.\nWe have limited control over the availability or cost of appropriate locations within existing or new shopping centers or the success of individual shopping centers. Furthermore, factors beyond our control impact shopping centers, such as general economic conditions, weather conditions, consumer acceptance of new or existing shopping centers, regional demographic shifts, and consumer spending levels. Our store sales are dependent on a certain level of shopping center traffic and any large scale decline in shopping center traffic, whether because of a slowdown in the economy, a falloff in the popularity of shopping centers among our target customers, or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur ability to anticipate and remain current with fashion trends and successfully introduce new products.\nOur success is principally dependent upon our ability to gauge the fashion tastes of our customers and to provide a balanced assortment of merchandise that is on-trend and satisfies customer demand in a timely manner. The failure to anticipate, identify or react appropriately and in a timely manner to changes in fashion trends or demands, could lead to lower sales, missed opportunities, excess inventories and more frequent markdowns or inventory write-downs, as well as have a negative impact on our image and result in reduced brand loyalty.\nOur ability to successfully expand internationally.\nAs of January 31, 2015, we operated 5 WH|BM and 3 Chico's stores in Canada. In addition, our franchisee in Mexico operated 19 Chico's franchise locations in and around Mexico City, Mexico. We have limited prior international store or franchise experience, where we face numerous operational obstacles, including already established competitors and new and different employment and labor, trade, product safety, transportation and logistics, health care, tax, privacy, and environmental issues, among other things. Furthermore, consumer demand, behavior, tastes, and purchasing trends may differ from our domestic operations and, as a result, sale of our merchandise may not be successful, or the margins on those sales may not be in line with those we currently anticipate. Our consolidated results of operations and financial condition may also be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rate. Any difficulties that we encounter as we expand our geographical coverage may divert financial, operational and managerial resources from our existing operations.\nRisks Associated with General Economic Conditions.\nNumerous economic conditions, all of which are outside of our control, could negatively affect the level of consumer spending on the merchandise that we offer. If these economic conditions persist for a sustained period, our consolidated financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely impacted. These economic conditions include, but are not limited to, the following:\nConditions that lead to declines in consumer spending.\nThe following economic conditions are among the many that can lead to declines in consumer spending on our merchandise: threatened or actual government shut downs, higher unemployment levels, low levels of consumer credit, inflation, interest rates, recessionary pressures, increasing gas and other energy costs, taxation, decreasing housing prices,\nhigher durable and other consumer spending, volatility in the financial markets, and low consumer confidence in future economic conditions.\nFluctuations in costs of goods, energy and/or commodity costs.\nFluctuations in the price, availability and quality of fabrics and other raw materials used to manufacture our products, as well as the price for labor and transportation have contributed to, and may continue to contribute to, ongoing pricing pressures throughout our supply chain. The price and availability of such inputs to the manufacturing process may fluctuate significantly, depending on several factors, including commodity costs, such as higher cotton prices, energy costs, such as fuel, shipping costs, inflationary pressures from emerging markets, increased labor costs, weather conditions and currency fluctuations.\nImpairment charges.\nPeriodically, we review our long-lived assets for impairment whenever economic events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. We also review our goodwill and intangible assets for indicators of impairment. Significant negative industry or general economic trends, changes in customer demand for our product, disruptions to our business and unexpected significant changes or planned changes in our operating results or use of long-lived assets (such as boutique relocations or discontinuing use of certain boutique fixtures) may result in impairments to goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets.\nFluctuating comparable sales and overall operating results.\nOur comparable sales and overall operating results have fluctuated in the past and are expected to continue to fluctuate in the future. A variety of factors affect comparable sales and operating results, including changes in fashion trends, changes in our merchandise mix, customer acceptance of merchandise offerings, the volume of customer traffic in our stores and online, timing of marketing activities, calendar shifts of holiday periods, the periodic impact of a fifty-three week fiscal year, actions by competitors, new boutique openings, new competitor activity, weather conditions, and general economic conditions. In addition, our ability to address the challenges of sustained declining store traffic combined with a highly promotional retail environment may impact our comparable sales, operating results and ability to maintain or gain market share. Past comparable sales or operating results are not an indicator of future results.\nRisks Associated With Our Online and Catalog Operations.\nOur online and catalog operations are subject to numerous risks that could materially adversely impact our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. These risks include, but are not limited to, the following:\nOur websites rely on technology.\nWe sell merchandise over the Internet through each of our brands\u2019 websites. Our websites are heavily dependent on technology, which creates numerous risks including unanticipated operating problems, system failures, rapid technological change, failure of the systems that operate the websites, reliance on third party computer hardware and software providers, computer viruses, telecommunication failures, liability for online content, systems and data breaches, denial of service attacks, spamming, phishing attacks, computer hackers and other similar disruptions. Our success is dependent on our ability to implement and maintain brand specific websites that offer the system functionality and security customers expect.\nOur online and catalog operations rely on the U.S. Postal Service and other shipping vendors.\nWe use the U.S. Postal Service to mail millions of catalogs each year to educate our customers about our products, acquire new customers, drive customers to our boutiques and website and promote catalog sales. As a result, postal rate increases and paper and printing costs will affect the cost of our order fulfillment and catalog and promotional mailings. We rely on discounts from the basic postal rate structure, such as discounts for bulk mailings and sorting. The operational and financial difficulties of the U.S. Postal Service are well documented. Any significant and unanticipated increase in postage, reduction in postal service, or slow-down in postal delivery, or increases in paper and printing costs could impair our ability to deliver catalogs in a timely or economically efficient manner and also could adversely impact our earnings if we are unable to pass such increases directly on to our customers or if we are unable to implement more efficient printing, mailing, delivery and order fulfillment systems.\nWe also utilize additional shipping vendors, including Federal Express, to support our online operations. Any significant and unanticipated increase in shipping costs, reduction in service, or slow-down in delivery could impair our ability to deliver\nmerchandise in a timely or economically efficient manner and also could adversely impact our earnings if we are unable to pass such increases directly on to our customers or if we are unable to implement more efficient delivery and order fulfillment systems.\nRisks Associated with Our Information Technology Systems.\nWe rely on various information technology systems to manage our operations. Information technology systems are subject to numerous risks including unanticipated operating problems, system failures, rapid technological change, failure of the systems that operate as anticipated, reliance on third party computer hardware, network and software providers, computer viruses, telecommunication failures, data breaches, denial of service attacks, spamming, phishing attacks, computer hackers and other similar disruptions, any of which could materially adversely impact our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. Additional risks include, but are not limited to, the following:\nDisruptions in current systems or difficulties in integrating new systems.\nWe regularly maintain, upgrade, enhance or replace our information technology systems to support our business strategies and provide business continuity. Replacing legacy systems with successor systems, making changes to existing systems or acquiring new systems with new functionality have inherent risks including disruptions, delays, or difficulties that may impair the effectiveness of our information technology systems.\nCybersecurity.\nWe are subject to cybersecurity risks. Cybersecurity refers to the combination of technologies, processes, and procedures established to protect information technology systems and data from unauthorized access, attack, exfiltration, or damage. Our business involves the storage and/or transmission of customers\u2019 personal information, shopping preferences and credit card information, as well as confidential information regarding our business, employees and other third parties. While we have implemented measures reasonably designed to prevent security breaches and cyber incidents, our measures may not be effective and any security breach or cyber incident could result in the loss or misuse of critical data and could have a material adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, the storage and transmission of such data is regulated at the international, federal, state and local levels. Privacy and information security laws and regulation changes, and compliance with those changes, may result in cost increases due to system changes and the development of new administrative processes. If we or our employees fail to comply with these laws and regulations or experience a data security breach, our reputation could be damaged, possibly resulting in lost future business, and we could be subjected to fines, penalties, administrative orders and other legal risks as a result of a breach or non-compliance.\nRisks Associated With Our Sourcing and Distribution Strategies.\nOur sourcing and distribution strategies are subject to numerous risks that could materially adversely impact our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. These risks include, but are not limited to, the following:\nOur significant reliance on foreign sources of production.\nThe majority of our clothing and accessories are produced outside the United States. As a result, our business remains subject to the various risks of doing business in foreign markets and importing merchandise from abroad, such as: geo-political instability, the requirements of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws and regulations, imposition of new legislation relating to import quotas that may limit the quantity of goods that may be imported into the United States from countries in which we do business, imposition of new or increased duties, taxes, and other charges on imports, foreign exchange rate challenges and pressures presented by implementation of U.S. monetary policy, local business practice and political issues, including issues relating to compliance with our Terms of Commitment to Ethical Sourcing and domestic or international labor standards, transportation disruptions, natural disasters, delays in the delivery of cargo due to port security considerations or government funding, and seizure or detention of goods by U.S. Customs authorities. In particular, we continue to source a substantial portion of our merchandise from China. A change in the Chinese exchange rate, other policies affecting labor laws or the costs of goods in China could negatively impact our merchandise costs. Furthermore, delays in production or shipping product, whether due to work slow-downs, work stoppages, strikes, port congestion, labor disputes, product regulations and customs inspections or other factors, could negatively impact our financial performance.\nWe cannot predict whether or not any of the foreign countries in which our clothing and accessories are currently, or in the future may be produced, will be subject to import restrictions by the United States government, including the likelihood, type or effect of any trade retaliation. Trade restrictions, including increased tariffs, or more restrictive quotas, including\nsafeguard quotas, or anything similar, applicable to apparel items could affect the importation of apparel generally and, in that event, could increase the cost, or reduce the supply, of apparel available to us.\nOur suppliers\u2019 ability to provide quality goods in a timely manner.\nWe do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities and depend on independent third parties to manufacture our merchandise. We are subject to the risk that a key supplier may become unable to address our merchandising needs due to payment terms, cost of manufacturing, adequacy of manufacturing capacity, quality control, or timeliness of delivery. If we were unexpectedly required to change suppliers or if a key supplier was unable to supply acceptable merchandise in sufficient quantities on acceptable terms, we could experience a significant disruption in the supply of merchandise. We could also experience operational difficulties with our suppliers, such as reductions in the availability of production capacity, supply chain disruptions, errors in complying with merchandise specifications, insufficient quality control, shortages of fabrics or other raw materials, failures to meet production deadlines or increases in manufacturing costs.\nFurthermore, many of our suppliers rely on working capital financing to support their operations. Although the credit market has improved, lenders have still maintained tightened credit standards and terms. To the extent any of our suppliers are unable to obtain adequate credit or their borrowing costs increase, we may experience delays in obtaining merchandise, our suppliers increasing their prices or our suppliers modifying payment terms in a manner that is unfavorable to us.\nOur significant reliance upon one supplier.\nWe have no material long-term or exclusive contract with any apparel or accessory manufacturer or supplier. Our business depends on our network of suppliers and our continued good relations with them. Approximately 24% of total purchases in fiscal 2014 and 23% of total purchases in 2013 were made from one supplier. We cannot guarantee that this relationship will be maintained in the future or that the supplier will continue to be available to supply merchandise.\nOur suppliers\u2019 ability to implement acceptable labor practices.\nAlthough we have adopted our Terms of Commitment to Ethical Sourcing and use the services of third party audit firms to monitor compliance with these terms, we do not have absolute control over the ultimate actions or labor practices of our independent suppliers. As a result, we may do business with suppliers that are not as familiar with our supplier guidelines which may result in temporary noncompliance.\nThe violation of labor or other laws by any of our key independent suppliers or the divergence of an independent supplier\u2019s labor practices from those generally accepted by us as ethical could interrupt or otherwise disrupt the shipment of finished merchandise or damage our reputation.\nOur reliance on one location to distribute goods for our brands.\nThe distribution functions for all of our brands are handled from our DC in Winder, Georgia. Any significant interruption in the operation of the facilities at our Winder DC due to natural disasters, severe weather, accidents, system failures or other unforeseen causes could delay or impair our ability to distribute merchandise to our stores and/or fulfill online or catalog orders, which could cause sales to decline.\nOther Risks Affecting Our Business\nOur business is subject to numerous other risks that could materially adversely impact our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. These risks include, but are not limited to, the following:\nCompetition.\nWe compete with local, national and international department stores, specialty and discount boutique chains, independent retail boutiques, and catalog and online businesses that market and sell similar lines of merchandise. Many competitors are significantly larger and have greater financial, marketing and other resources and enjoy greater local, national and international name recognition. In addition to competing for sales, we compete for favorable store locations, lease terms and qualified employees. Increased competition could result in price reductions, increased marketing expenditures and loss of market share. In response to declining store traffic over the last several years, our competitors have lowered prices, engaged in more promotional activity and enhanced their online presence, which has resulted in heightened competition.\nCompliance with applicable laws and regulations.\nOur policies, procedures and internal controls are designed to help us comply with all applicable foreign and domestic laws, accounting and reporting requirements, regulations and tax requirements, including those imposed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the SEC and the New York Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d), as well as applicable employment laws. Any changes in regulations, the imposition of additional regulations or the enactment of any new legislation that affects employment and labor, trade, product safety, transportation and logistics, health care, tax, privacy, operations or environmental issues, among other things, may increase the complexity of the regulatory environment in which we operate and the related cost of compliance. Failure to comply with the various laws and regulations as well as changes in laws and regulations could have an adverse impact on our reputation, consolidated financial condition or results of operations.\nAdverse outcomes of litigation matters.\nWe are involved from time to time in litigation and other claims against our business. These matters arise primarily in the ordinary course of business but could raise complex, factual and legal issues, which are subject to multiple risks and uncertainties and could require significant management time. We believe that our current litigation matters will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated results of operations or financial condition. However, our assessment of current litigation could change in light of the discovery of facts with respect to legal actions pending against us, not presently known to us, or determinations by judges, juries or other finders of fact which do not accord with our evaluation of the possible liability or outcome of such litigation as well as additional litigation that is not currently pending.\nOur ability to retain or recruit key personnel.\nOur success and ability to properly manage our business depends to a significant extent upon our ability to attract, develop and retain qualified employees, including executive and senior management, and talented merchants. Competition for talented employees within our industry is intense. Recruiting and retaining such personnel and appropriate succession planning, particularly at the CEO and executive level, are important to our continued and sustained success.\nOur ability to achieve the results of our restructuring program.\nIn February 2015, we initiated a multi-year restructuring program, including the acceleration of domestic store closures and an organizational realignment, to ensure that resources are aligned with long-term growth initiatives, including omni-channel. The estimated costs and benefits associated with the restructuring program are preliminary and may vary materially based on various factors including: the timing in execution of the restructuring program, outcome of negotiations with landlords and other third parties, inventory levels, and changes in management\u2019s assumptions and projections. As a result of these events and circumstances, delays and unexpected costs may occur, which could result in our not realizing all, or any, of the anticipated benefits of the restructuring program.\nWar, terrorism or other catastrophes.\nIn the event of war, acts of terrorism or the threat of terrorist attacks, public health crises, or weather catastrophes, consumer spending could significantly decrease for a sustained period. In addition, local authorities or shopping center management could close in response to any immediate security concern, public health concern or weather catastrophe such as hurricanes, earthquakes, or tornadoes. Similarly, war, acts of terrorism, threats of terrorist attacks, or a weather catastrophe could severely and adversely affect our National Store Support Center (\u201cNSSC\u201d) campus, our Distribution Center, or our entire supply chain.\nOur ability to protect our brands\u2019 reputation and intellectual property.\nOur ability to protect our brands\u2019 reputation is an integral part of our general success strategy and is critical to the overall value of the brands. If we fail to maintain high standards for merchandise quality and integrity, such failures could jeopardize our brands\u2019 reputation. Damage to our reputation as a whole could also cause a loss of consumer and investor confidence.\nIn addition, our trademarks, copyrights, business intelligence, and other intellectual and proprietary rights are important to our success. Others may attempt to imitate our products or obtain or infringe upon our intellectual property rights. Other parties may also claim that some of our products infringe on their trademarks, copyrights, or other intellectual property rights.\nIn addition, the intellectual property laws and enforcement practices in many foreign countries can be substantially different from those in the United States. There are also inherent challenges with enforcing intellectual property rights on third party e-commerce websites, especially those based in foreign jurisdictions. We have taken steps to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights in these arenas, but cannot guarantee that such rights are not infringed. The intentional or unintentional infringement on our intellectual property rights by one of our suppliers, factories or any other person or entity, could tarnish or diminish the goodwill associated with our trademarks which may result in reputational harm.\nStock price volatility.\nThe market price of our common stock has fluctuated substantially in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Future announcements or management discussions concerning us or our competitors, sales and profitability results, quarterly variations in operating results or comparable sales, or changes in earnings estimates by analysts, among other factors, could cause the market price of the common stock to fluctuate substantially. In addition, stock markets, in general, have experienced extreme price and volume volatility in recent years. This volatility has had a substantial effect on the market prices of securities of many public companies for reasons frequently unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies.\nOur business could be impacted as a result of actions by activist shareholders or others.\nWe may be subject, from time to time, to legal and business challenges in the operation of our Company due to proxy contests, shareholder proposals, media campaigns and other such actions instituted by activist shareholders or others. Responding to such actions could be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our operations, may not align with our business strategies and could divert the attention of our Board of Directors and senior management from the pursuit of current business strategies. Perceived uncertainties as to our future direction as a result of shareholder activism or potential changes to the composition of the Board of Directors may lead to the perception of a change in the direction of the business or other instability and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners.", "PERMNO": 78963, "SIC": 5621, "TIC": "CHS"}
