{"cik": "1059262", "company": "SP Plus Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-06", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements. These risk factors may be important to understanding any statement in this Form 10-K or elsewhere. The following information should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Form 10-K.\nThe business, financial condition and operating results of the Company can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including but not limited to those described below. Any one or more of such factors could directly or indirectly cause the Company's actual results of operations and financial condition to vary materially from past or anticipated future results of operations and financial condition. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially and adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations and stock price.\nBecause of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company's financial condition and operating results, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\nCertain of our leases acquired in the Central Merger expose us to certain risks, including structural repair obligations.\nCertain of our leases acquired in the Central Merger include provisions allocating to us responsibility for the costs of certain structural and other repairs required to be made to the property, including repairs arising as a result of ordinary wear and tear. We will incur costs for structural repair obligations in 2015 and future years, although we are not yet able to estimate the full extent and amount of our liability for these repairs in any particular year or in the aggregate. Additionally, the applicable indemnity under the Merger Agreement may not cover all such obligations, and there will be timing differences between our payments to satisfy these obligations and our receipt of indemnification thereof, and some indemnification obligations may be satisfied by the selling stockholders of Central either through the surrender of shares of our common stock or payment in cash or some combination thereof. Accordingly, our expenditures to cover these structural and other repair obligations could have a material adverse impact on our operating results (including our gross profit derived from locations that we operate under leases) and cash flows for 2015 and future years. Any other increase in the cost of parking services could also reduce our gross profit derived from locations that we operate under leases.\nAdverse litigation judgments or settlements resulting from legal proceedings in which we may be involved in the normal course of business, and a dispute with Central's former stockholders, could affect our operations and financial condition.\nIn the normal course of business, we are from time to time involved in various legal proceedings. The outcome of these legal proceedings cannot be predicted. It is possible that an unfavorable outcome of some or all of the matters could cause us to incur substantial liabilities that may have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition and results of operations. Any significant adverse litigation, judgments or settlements could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, Central is subject to a number of ongoing legal proceedings, and we will incur substantial expenses defending such matters and may have judgments levied against us that are substantial and may not be covered by previously established reserves.\nWe have periodically given Central's former stockholders notice regarding indemnification matters since the closing date of the Merger and have made adjustments for known matters, although Central's former stockholders have not agreed to such adjustments nor made any elections with respect to using cash or stock as payment for any indemnified matters. Furthermore, following our notices of\nindemnification matters, the representative of Central's former stockholders has indicated that they may make additional inquiries and potentially raise issues with respect to the our indemnification claims, and that they may assert various claims of their own relating to the Merger Agreement. Under the Merger Agreement, all post-closing claims and disputes, including indemnification matters, are ultimately subject to resolution through binding arbitration or, in the case of a dispute as to the calculation of \"Net Debt Working Capital,\" resolution by an independent public accounting firm. We intend to pursue these dispute resolution processes, as applicable, in a timely manner, although our pursuit of these processes may be delayed by actions taken by representatives of Central's former stockholders. An unfavorable outcome could have an adverse impact to our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to intense competition that could constrain our ability to gain business, as well as our profitability.\nWe believe that competition in parking facility management and ancillary services is intense. The low cost of entry into the parking facility management business has led to a strongly competitive, fragmented market consisting primarily of a variety of entities ranging from single lot operators to large regional and national multi-facility operators, as well as municipal and other governmental entities that choose not to outsource their parking operations. Competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to changes in customer requirements, devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their services or develop technology that is as or more successful than our proprietary technology solutions that are designed to strengthen customer loyalty and optimize facility pricing and performance. We provide nearly all of our services under contracts, many of which are obtained through competitive bidding, and many of our competitors also have long-standing relationships with our clients. Providers of parking facility management services have traditionally competed on the basis of cost and quality of service. As we have worked to establish ourselves as principal members of the industry, we compete predominately on the basis of high levels of service and strong relationships. We may not be able to, or may choose not to, compete with certain competitors on the basis of price. As a result, a greater proportion of our clients may switch to other service providers or self-manage. Furthermore, these strong competitive pressures could impede our success in bidding for profitable business and our ability to increase prices even as costs rise, thereby reducing margins.\nOur management contracts and leases expose us to certain risks.\nThe loss or renewal on less favorable terms of a substantial number of management contracts or leases could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. A material reduction in the operating income associated with the integrated services we provide under management contracts and leases could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our management contracts are typically for a term of one to three years, although the contracts may often be terminated, without cause, on 30 days' notice or less, giving clients regular opportunities to attempt to negotiate a reduction in fees or other allocated costs. Any loss of a significant number of clients could in the aggregate materially adversely affect our operating results.\nWe are particularly exposed to increases in costs for locations that we operate under leases because we are generally responsible for all the operating expenses of our leased locations. During the first and fourth quarters of each year, seasonality impacts our performance with regard to moderating revenues, with the reduced levels of travel most clearly reflected in the parking activity associated with our airport and hotel businesses as well as increases in certain costs of parking services, such as snow removal, all of which negatively affects gross profit.\nWe are increasingly dependent on information technology, and potential disruption, cyber attacks, cyber terrorism and security breaches present risks that could harm our business.\nWe are increasingly centralized and dependent on automated information technology systems to manage and support a variety of business processes and activities. In addition, a portion of our business operations is conducted electronically, increasing the risk of attack or interception that could cause loss or misuse of data, system failures or disruption of operations. Improper activities by third parties, exploitation of encryption technology, new data-hacking tools and discoveries and other events or developments may result in a future compromise or breach of our networks, payment card terminals or other payment systems. In particular, the techniques used by criminals to obtain unauthorized access to sensitive data change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target; accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. Any significant breakdown, invasion, destruction or interruption of these systems could negatively impact our operations. In addition, there is a risk of business interruption, reputational damage and potential legal liability damages from leakage of confidential information. The occurrence of acts of cyber terrorism such as website defacement, denial of automated payment services, sabotage of our proprietary on-demand technology or the use of electronic social media to disseminate unfounded or otherwise harmful allegations to our reputation, could have a material adverse effect on our business. Any business interruptions or damage to our reputation could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. While we maintain insurance coverage that may, subject to policy terms and conditions, cover certain aspects of cyber risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses and would not remedy damage to our reputation.\nIn October 2014, a third-party vendor retained by our client that provides and maintains payment card systems in some of our parking facilities notified us that an unauthorized person had used a remote access tool to connect to some of its payment processing systems and that our customers' data was at risk. We retained a leading computer forensic firm to conduct an investigation and further determine the facts. After extensive analysis, we discovered evidence confirming that criminals used a remote access tool to install malware that searched for payment card data that was being routed through the computers that accept payments made at the parking facilities (the \"Data Breach\"). The malware has now been removed from servers that were attacked and it no longer presents a threat to customers using the impacted parking garages that we operate. We have received a small number of reports of fraudulent use of payment cards potentially connected to the data breach. We fulfilled all obligations for notifying our payment processors and impacted customers. We have also implemented additional security measures including forcing our vendors to use two-factor authentication for remote access.\nWe do not have control over security measures taken by third-party vendors hired by our clients to prevent unauthorized access to electronic and other confidential information. There can be no assurance that other third-party payment processing vendors will not suffer a similar attack in the future, that unauthorized parties will not gain access to personal financial information, or that any such incident will be discovered in a timely manner.\nWe have incurred substantial indebtedness that requires us to comply with certain financial and operating covenants under our credit facility and to make payments as they become due, and our failure to comply could cause amounts borrowed under the facility to become immediate due and payable or prevent us from borrowing under the facility.\nOn February 20, 2015, we entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (\"Restated Credit Facility), providing for $400.0 million in secured senior credit facility (\"Restated Senior Credit Facility) consisting of (i) a $200.0 million revolving credit facility and (ii) a $200.0 million term loan facility (which is subject to scheduled quarterly amortization) with Bank of America, Wells Fargo Bank and certain other financial institutions. The Restated Credit Facility matures on February 20, 2020, at which time any amounts outstanding will be due and payable in full. As of February 20, 2015, we had\n$200.0 million outstanding under the term loan facility and $147.3 million outstanding under the revolving credit facility, respectively. This level of indebtedness may:\n\u2022 require us to dedicate a significant percentage of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow to fund capital expenditures, pursue other acquisitions or investments in new technologies, make stock repurchases, pay dividends and for general corporate purposes;\n\u2022 increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic conditions, including increases in interest rates if the borrowings bear interest at variable rates or if such indebtedness is refinanced at a time when interest rates are higher; and\n\u2022 limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in or challenges relating to our business and industry, creating competitive disadvantages compared to other competitors with lower debt levels and borrowing costs.\nWe are required to comply with specified financial and operating covenants and to make scheduled payments of our term loan, which could limit our ability to operate our business as we otherwise might operate it. Our failure to comply with any of these covenants or to meet any payment obligations under the Restated Credit Facility could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, would result in any amounts outstanding, including any accrued interest and unpaid fees, becoming immediately due and payable.\nWe cannot assure you that cash flow from operations, combined with additional borrowings under the Restated Credit Facility and any future credit facility, will be available in an amount sufficient to enable us to repay our indebtedness, or to fund other liquidity needs. If the consolidated leverage ratio exceeds certain thresholds, the interest rate on indebtedness outstanding under our credit facility will be higher.\nWe may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, which could cause the related risks to intensify. We may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before their respective maturities. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness, including indebtedness under our Restated Credit Facility, on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we are unable to refinance our debt, we may default under the terms of our indebtedness, which could lead to an acceleration of the debt. We do not expect that we could repay all of our outstanding indebtedness if the repayment of such indebtedness was accelerated.\nWe must comply with public and private regulations that may impose significant costs on us.\nUnder various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, current or previous owners or operators of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on, under or in their properties. This applies to properties we either own or operate. These laws typically impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances. We may be potentially liable for such costs as a result of our operation of parking facilities. Additionally, we hold a partial ownership interest in four of these parking facilities acquired in the Central Merger, and Central previously owned a large number of properties that we did not acquire. We may now be liable for such costs as a result of such previous and current ownership. In addition, from time to time we are involved in environmental issues at certain locations or in connection with our operations. The cost of defending against claims of liability, or remediation of a contaminated property, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, several state and local laws have been passed in recent years that encourage car pooling and the use of mass transit. Laws and regulations that reduce the number of cars and vehicles being driven could adversely impact our business.\nIn connection with certain transportation services provided to our clients, including shuttle bus operations, we provide the vehicles and the drivers to operate these transportation services. The U.S.\nDepartment of Transportation and various state agencies exercise broad powers over these transportation services, including, licensing and authorizations, safety and insurance requirements. Our employee drivers must also comply with the safety and fitness regulations promulgated by the Department of Transportation, including those related to drug and alcohol testing and service hours. We may become subject to new and more restrictive federal and state regulations. Compliance with such regulations could hamper our ability to provide qualified drivers and increase our operating costs.\nWe are also subject to consumer credit laws and credit card industry rules and regulations relating to the processing of credit card transactions, including the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act and the Payment Card Data Security Standard. These laws and these industry standards impose substantial financial penalties for non-compliance.\nIn addition, we are subject to laws generally applicable to businesses, including but not limited to federal, state and local regulations relating to wage and hour matters, employee classification, mandatory healthcare benefits, unlawful workplace discrimination and whistle blowing. Any actual or alleged failure to comply with any regulation applicable to our business or any whistle-blowing claim, even if without merit, could result in costly litigation, regulatory action or otherwise harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe collect and remit sales/parking taxes and file tax returns for and on behalf of ourselves and our clients. We are affected by laws and regulations that may impose a direct assessment on us for failure to remit sales/parking taxes and filing of tax returns for ourselves and on behalf of our clients.\nDeterioration in economic conditions in general could reduce the demand for parking and ancillary services and, as a result, reduce our earnings and adversely affect our financial condition.\nAdverse changes in global, national and local economic conditions could have a negative impact on our business. In addition, our business operations tend to be concentrated in large urban areas. Many of our customers are workers who commute by car to their places of employment in these urban centers. Our business could be materially adversely affected to the extent that weak economic conditions or demographic factors have resulted in the elimination of jobs and high unemployment in these large urban areas. In addition, increased unemployment levels, the movement of white-collar jobs from urban centers to suburbs or out of North America entirely, increased office vacancies in urban areas, movement toward home office alternatives or lower consumer spending could reduce consumer demand for our services.\nAdverse changes in economic conditions could also lead to a decline in parking at airports and commercial facilities, including facilities owned by retail operators and hotels. In particular, reductions in parking at leased facilities can lower our profit because a decrease in revenue would be exacerbated by fixed costs that we must pay under our leases.\nIf adverse economic conditions reduce discretionary spending, business travel or other economic activity that fuels demand for our services, our earnings could be reduced. Adverse changes in local and national economic conditions could also depress prices for our services or cause clients to cancel their agreements to purchase our services.\nThe financial difficulties or bankruptcy of one or more of our major clients could adversely affect our results.\nFuture revenue and our ability to collect accounts receivable depend, in part, on the financial strength of our clients. We estimate an allowance for accounts we do not consider collectible, and this allowance adversely impacts profitability. In the event that our clients experience financial difficulty, become unable to obtain financing or seek bankruptcy protection, our profitability would be further impacted by our failure to collect accounts receivable in excess of the estimated allowance. Additionally, our future revenue\nwould be reduced by the loss of these clients or by the cancellation of leases or management contracts by clients in bankruptcy.\nAdditional funds would need to be reserved for future insurance losses if such losses are worse than expected.\nWe provide liability and worker's compensation insurance coverage consistent with our obligations to our clients under our various management contracts and leases. We are obligated to reimburse our insurance carriers for, or pay directly, each loss incurred up to the amount of a specified deductible or self-insured retention. The per-occurrence deductible is $0.25 million for our workers' compensation and garagekeepers legal liability policies and $0.5 million for our automobile liability policy. The per-occurrence self-insured retention for our general liability policy is $0.5 million. We also purchase property insurance that provides coverage for loss or damage to our property, and in some cases our clients' property, as well as business interruption coverage for lost operating income and certain associated expenses. The deductible applicable to any given loss under the property insurance policies varies based upon the insured values and the peril that causes the loss. The stop-loss limit applicable under the group health insurance we provide for eligible employees is $0.3 million per illness. Our financial statements reflect our funding of all such obligations based upon guidance and evaluation received from third-party insurance professionals. There can be no assurance, however, that the ultimate amount of our obligations will not exceed the amount presently funded or accrued, in which case we would need to set aside additional funds to reserve for any such excess. Changes in insurance reserves as a result of periodic evaluations of the liabilities can cause swings in operating results that may not be indicative of the operations of our ongoing business. Additionally, our obligations could increase if we receive a greater number of insurance claims, or if the severity of, or the administrative costs associated with, those claims generally increases. A material increase in insurance costs due to a change in the number or severity of claims, claim costs or premiums paid by us could have a material adverse effect on our operating income.\nLabor disputes could lead to loss of revenues or expense variations.\nAt December 31, 2014, approximately 32% of our employees were represented by labor unions and approximately 30% of our collective bargaining contracts are up for renewal in 2015, representing approximately 4% of our employees. In addition, at any given time, we may face a number of union organizing drives.\nWhen one or more of our major collective bargaining agreements becomes subject to renegotiation or when we face union organizing drives, we may disagree with the union on important issues that, in turn, could lead to a strike, work slowdown or other job actions. There can be no assurance that we will be able to renew existing labor union contracts on acceptable terms. In such cases, there are no assurances that we would be able to staff sufficient employees for our short-term needs. A strike, work slowdown or other job action could in some cases disrupt us from providing services, resulting in reduced revenues. If declines in client service occur or if our clients are targeted for sympathy strikes by other unionized workers, contract cancellations could result. The result of negotiating a first time agreement or renegotiating an existing collective bargaining agreement could result in a substantial increase in labor and benefits expenses that we may be unable to pass through to clients. In addition, potential legislation could make it significantly easier for union organizing drives to be successful and could give third-party arbitrators the ability to impose terms of collective bargaining agreements upon us and a labor union if we are unable to agree with such union on the terms of a collective bargaining agreement.\nIn addition, we make contributions to multiemployer benefit plans on behalf of certain employees covered by collective bargaining agreements and could be responsible for paying unfunded liabilities incurred by such benefit plans, which amount could be material.\nNegative or unexpected tax consequences could adversely affect our results of operations.\nAdverse changes in underlying profitability and financial outlook of our operations could lead to changes in valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets on our consolidated balance sheet, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. Additionally, changes in U.S. tax laws or state tax laws or our interpretation of existing laws in states where we have significant operations could have an adverse effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets and results of operations. We are also subject to tax audits by governmental authorities in the United States and Canada. Negative unexpected results from one or more such tax audits or our failure to sustain our reporting positions on examination could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and our effective tax rate.\nWe have investments in joint ventures and may be subject to certain financial and operating risks with our joint venture investments.\nWe have acquired or invested in a number of joint ventures, and may acquire or enter into joint ventures with additional companies. These transactions create risks such as: (i) additional operating losses and expenses in the businesses acquired or joint ventures for which we have made investments in, (ii) the dependence on the investee's accounting, financial reporting and similar systems, controls and processes of other entities whose financial performance is incorporated into our financial results due to our investment in that entity, (iii) potential unknown liabilities associated with a company we may acquire or in which we invest, (iv) our requirement or obligation to commit and provide additional capital, equity, or credit support as required by the joint venture agreements, (v) the joint venture partner may be unable to perform its obligations as a result of financial or other difficulties or be unable to provide for additional capital, equity or credit support as required by the joint venture agreements and (vi) disruption of our ongoing business, including loss of management focus on the business. As a result of future acquisitions or joint ventures for which we may invest in, we may need to issue additional equity securities, spend our cash, or incur debt and contingent liabilities, any of which could reduce our profitability and harm our business. In addition, valuations supporting our acquisitions or investments in joint ventures could change rapidly given the global economic environment and climate. We could determine that such valuations have experienced impairments other-than-temporary declines in fair value which could adversely impact our financial results.\nWeather conditions, including natural disasters, or acts of terrorism could disrupt our business and services.\nWeather conditions, including fluctuations in temperatures, hurricanes, snow or severe weather storms, earthquakes, drought, heavy flooding, natural disasters or acts of terrorism may result in reduced revenues and gross profit. Weather conditions, natural disasters and acts of terrorism may also cause economic dislocations throughout the country. Weather conditions, including natural disasters, could lead to reduced levels of travel and require increase in certain costs of parking services of which could negatively affect gross profit. In addition, terrorist attacks have resulted in, and may continue to result in, increased government regulation of airlines and airport facilities, including imposition of minimum distances between parking facilities and terminals, resulting in the elimination of currently managed parking facilities. We derive a significant percentage of our gross profit from parking facilities and parking related services in and around airports. The Federal Aviation Administration generally prohibits parking within 300 feet of airport terminals during periods of heightened security. While the prohibition is not currently in effect, there can be no assurance that this governmental prohibition will not again be reinstated. The existing regulations governing parking within 300 feet of airport terminals or future regulations may prevent us from using certain parking spaces. Reductions in the number of parking spaces and air travelers may reduce our revenue and cash flow for both our leased facilities and those facilities we operate under management contracts.\nBecause our business is affected by weather related trends, typically in the first and fourth quarters of each year, our results may fluctuate from period to period, which could make it difficult to evaluate our business.\nWeather conditions, including fluctuations in temperatures, snow or severe weather storms, heavy flooding, hurricanes or natural disasters, can negatively impact portions of our business. We periodically have experienced fluctuations in our quarterly results arising from a number of factors, including the following:\n\u2022 reduced levels of travel during and as a result of severe weather conditions, which is reflected in lower revenue from urban, airport and hotel parking; and\n\u2022 increased costs of parking services, such as snow removal.\nThese factors reduced our gross profit in the first quarters of 2014 and 2013 and could cause gross profit reductions in the future. As a result of these seasonal affects, our revenue and earnings in the second, third and fourth quarters tend to be higher than revenue and earnings in the first quarter. Accordingly, you should not consider our first quarter results as indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any full fiscal year. Fluctuations in our results could make it difficult to evaluate our business or cause instability in the market price of our common stock.\nState and municipal government clients may sell or enter into long-term leases of parking-related assets to our competitors.\nIn order to raise additional revenue, a number of state and municipal governments have either sold or entered into long-term leases of public assets or may be contemplating such transactions. The assets that are the subject of such transactions have included government-owned parking garages located in downtown commercial districts and parking operations at airports. The sale or long-term leasing of such government-owned parking assets to our competitors or clients of our competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to expand our business will be dependent upon the availability of adequate capital.\nThe rate of our expansion will depend in part on the availability of adequate capital, which in turn will depend in large part on cash flow generated by our business and the availability of equity and debt capital. In addition, our Restated Senior Credit Facility contains provisions that restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness and/or make substantial investments or acquisitions. As a result, we cannot assure you that we will be able to finance our current growth strategies.\nThe sureties for our performance bond program may elect not to provide us with new or renewal performance bonds for any reason.\nAs is customary in the industry, a surety provider can refuse to provide a bond principal with new or renewal surety bonds. If any existing or future surety provider refuses to provide us with surety bonds, either generally or because we are unwilling or unable to post collateral at levels sufficient to satisfy the surety's requirements, there can be no assurance that we would be able to find alternate providers on acceptable terms, or at all. Our inability to provide surety bonds could also result in the loss of existing contracts. Failure to find a provider of surety bonds, and our resulting inability to bid for new contracts or renew existing contracts, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nFederal health care reform legislation may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIn March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 were signed into law in the U.S. (collectively, the \"Health Care Reform Laws\").\nThe Health Care Reform Laws include a large number of health-related provisions, including requiring most individuals to have health insurance and establishing new regulations on health plans. Although the Health Care Reform Laws do not mandate that employers offer health insurance, penalties will be assessed on large employers who do not offer health insurance that meets certain affordability or benefit requirements. Effective January 1, 2014, we modified our group health insurance program and we now self-insure all eligible full-time employees and their family members up to a $0.3 million stop loss limit. Providing such additional health insurance benefits to our employees, or the payment of penalties if such coverage is not provided, could increase our health insurance-related expenses. If we are unable to raise the rates we charge our clients to cover these expenses, such increases in expense could reduce our operating profit.\nIn addition, under the Health Care Reform Laws, employers will have to file a significant amount of additional information with the Internal Revenue Service and will have to develop systems and processes to track requisite information. We will have to modify our current systems to do so, which could increase our general and administrative expenses.\nWe do not maintain insurance coverage for all possible risks.\nWe maintain a comprehensive portfolio of insurance policies to help protect us against loss or damage incurred from a wide variety of insurable risks. Each year, we review with our professional insurance advisers whether the insurance policies and associated coverages that we maintain are sufficient to adequately protect us from the various types of risk to which we are exposed in the ordinary course of business. That analysis takes into account various pertinent factors such as the likelihood that we would incur a material loss from any given risk, as well as the cost of obtaining insurance coverage against any such risk. There can be no assurance that we may not sustain a material loss for which we do not maintain any, or adequate, insurance coverage.", "PERMNO": 90194, "SIC": 7500, "TIC": "SP"}
