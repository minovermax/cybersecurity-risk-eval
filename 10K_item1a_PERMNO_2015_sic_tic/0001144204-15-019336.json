RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our common stock involves various risks which are particular to Cornerstone, its industry and its market area. Several risk factors regarding investing in our securities are discussed below. This listing should not be considered as all-inclusive. If any of the following risks were to occur, we may not be able to conduct our business as currently planned and our financial condition or operating results could be negatively impacted. These matters could cause the trading price of our securities to decline in future periods.\nIf our asset quality were to decline or if we experienced greater loan losses than anticipated, our earnings and overall financial condition would be adversely affected.\nOur assets are primarily comprised of loans. The risk of credit losses on loans varies with, among other things, general economic conditions, the type of loan being made, the creditworthiness of the borrower over the term of the loan and, in the case of a collateralized loan, the value and marketability of the collateral for the loan. While the risk of nonpayment of loans is inherent in banking, in recent years we have experienced higher nonpayment levels than anticipated, which has had a significant adverse effect on our earnings and overall financial condition. We have taken actions to prevent future problems, including the creation of a special asset committee to develop and review action plans for minimizing loan losses and the dedication of resources to assist in the collection and recovery process. The Bank has also established a loan review committee comprised of a majority of non-employee directors to periodically review the Bank\u2019s loan portfolio and identify and categorize problem credits. To minimize the likelihood of a substandard loan portfolio, we assess the credit worthiness of customers and perform collateral valuations. Management also maintains an allowance for loan losses based upon, among other things, historical experience and an evaluation of economic conditions and regular reviews of delinquencies and loan portfolio quality. Based upon such factors, management makes various assumptions and judgments about the ultimate collectability of the loan portfolio and provides an allowance for loan losses based upon a percentage of the outstanding balances and takes a charge against earnings with respect to specific loans when their ultimate collectability is considered questionable. If management\u2019s assumptions and judgments prove to be incorrect and the allowance for loan losses is inadequate to absorb losses, or if regulatory authorities require us to increase our allowance for loan losses as a part of their examination process, additional provision expense would be incurred and our earnings and capital could be significantly and adversely affected. Moreover, additions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic and real estate market conditions, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans and other factors, both within and outside of management\u2019s control. These additions may require increased provision expense which would negatively impact our results of operations.\nWe have high levels of foreclosed assets, primarily as a result of foreclosures.\nWe have continued to resolve non-performing real estate loans and as a result we continue to have high levels of foreclosed assets. Foreclosed real estate expense consists of three types of charges: maintenance costs, valuation adjustments due to new appraisal values and gains or losses on disposition. Although levels of foreclosed assets have decreased in 2014 compared to recent years and local real estate values have improved, these charges will likely continue to negatively affect our results of operations.\nLiquidity needs could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe rely on dividends from the Bank as our primary source of funds. However, in November 2009, following the conclusion of a joint examination of the Bank by the FDIC and the TDFI, the FDIC placed restrictions on the Bank\u2019s ability to pay cash dividends, requiring that the Bank first obtain a non-objection from the FDIC. Furthermore, the majority of the Bank\u2019s funds are comprised of customer deposits and loan repayments. While scheduled loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, they are subject to the ability of borrowers to repay the loans. The repayment of loans can be adversely affected by a number of factors, including changes in economic conditions, adverse trends or events affecting business industry groups, reductions in real estate values or markets, business closings or lay-offs, inclement weather, natural disasters and international instability. Additionally, deposit levels may be affected by a number of factors, including rates paid by competitors, general interest rate levels, returns available to customers on alternative investments and general economic conditions. Accordingly, we currently are, and may from time to time in the future be, required to rely on secondary sources of liquidity to meet withdrawal demands or otherwise fund operations. Alternative sources include advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank and federal funds lines of credit from correspondent banks. These sources might not be sufficient to meet future liquidity demands. We may be required to slow or discontinue loan growth, capital expenditures or other investments or liquidate assets if these alternative sources are not adequate.\nCompetition from financial institutions and other financial service providers may adversely affect our profitability.\nThe banking business is highly competitive and we experience competition in each of our markets from many other financial institutions. We compete with other commercial banks, credit unions, savings and loan associations, mortgage banking firms, consumer finance companies, securities brokerage firms, insurance companies, money market funds, and other mutual funds, as well as other community banks and super-regional and national financial institutions that operate offices in our primary market areas and elsewhere.\nAdditionally, we face competition from de novo community banks, including those with senior management who were previously affiliated with other local or regional banks or those controlled by investor groups with strong local business and community ties. These de novo community banks may offer higher deposit rates or lower cost loans in an effort to attract our customers, and may attempt to hire our management and employees.\nWe compete with these other financial institutions both in attracting deposits and in making loans. In addition, we have to attract our customer base from other existing financial institutions and from new residents. We expect competition to increase in the future as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and the continuing trend of consolidation in the financial services industry.\nOur success depends significantly upon economic conditions in the local markets where we operate.\nSubstantially all of our loan and deposit customers live, work and bank in the Chattanooga, Tennessee MSA. As a result, our success depends upon a sound local economy to provide opportunities for new business ventures, increased loan demand and the need for deposit services. Our profitability is impacted by these local factors as well as general economic conditions and interest rates. For example, our earnings may be negatively impacted by increases in unemployment rates or reductions in population, income levels, deposits and housing starts and home prices. In recent years, adverse economic conditions have inhibited our growth and diminished the ability of some of our customers to service their loan obligations. If economic conditions in our local markets deteriorate again, we could experience any of the following consequences, each of which could further adversely affect our business:\n\u00b7 demand for our products and services could decline;\n\u00b7 loan delinquencies could increase; and\n\u00b7 nonperforming assets and foreclosures could increase.\nA prolonged economic downturn could also negatively impact collateral values or cash flows of borrowing businesses, and as a result our primary source of repayment could be insufficient to service the debt. In addition, adverse consequences to us in the event of a prolonged economic downturn in our local markets could be compounded by the fact that many of our commercial and real estate loans are secured by real estate located in those market areas. Significant decline in real estate values in these market areas would mean that the collateral for many of our loans would provide less security. As a result, we would be more likely to suffer losses on defaulted loans because our ability to fully recover on defaulted loans by selling the real estate collateral would be diminished. Adverse economic conditions in our local markets, including sustained periods of increased payment delinquencies, foreclosures or losses in the State of Tennessee or the State of Georgia, could impair our ability to collect loans and could otherwise have a negative effect on our assets, revenues, results of operations and financial condition.\nCornerstone is required to obtain regulatory approval prior to the payment of dividends.\nCornerstone\u2019s Series A Convertible Preferred Stock requires annual dividend payments that equal ten percent of the original issue price of $25.00 per share. The dividends are scheduled to be paid at the end of each quarter. However, prior to the payment of the quarterly dividend Cornerstone must first obtain approval from the Federal Reserve Bank (\u201cFRB\u201d). Cornerstone provides information to the FRB which includes an evaluation of asset quality, earnings quarter and year to date and liquidity. Prior approval would also be required before common stock dividends could be paid.\nOur Series A Convertible Preferred Stock will reduce net income available to holders of our Common Stock and earnings per common share.\nThe cash dividends paid or accumulated on our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, and any future capital stock we may issue which is senior to our Common Stock, will reduce any net income available to holders of Common Stock and our earnings per common share. The preferred stock will also receive preferential treatment in the event of liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our Company. To date, we have received regulatory approval first and have made seventeen dividend payments on the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. However, because of the need for regulatory approval to pay future dividends on the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, dividends could accumulate and become quite substantial. The higher these accumulated dividends, the higher the preference payable in the event of liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our Company and the less likely the holders of our Common Stock will be able to realize any proceeds in such event.\nNegative developments in the financial services industry and U.S. and global capital and credit markets may lead to additional regulation and further deterioration of our results of operations and financial condition.\nNegative developments in the capital and credit markets in recent years have resulted in uncertainty in the financial markets. Financial institutions across the United States, including the Bank, have experienced deteriorating asset quality. Loan portfolios include impaired loans to businesses struggling to stay in operation or achieve adequate cash flow. Further, a decline in collateral values supporting these loans has also impacted the ability of a business or consumer to obtain loans or increased financial institutions losses in the event of foreclosure and liquidation. At the same time, financial institutions have become concerned about liquidity. This concern has increased the competition for deposits in our local market as well as wholesale funding options. These events have impacted our stock price, as well as the stock price of other bank holding companies. The potential impact of these events may be an expansion of existing or creation of new federal or state laws and regulations regarding lending and funding practices, liquidity standards and compliance issues. Continued negative developments below, as well as our ability to respond to these new operating and regulatory requirements, could further negatively impact our results of operations. The negative consequences could limit our ability to originate new loans or obtain adequate funding or increase costs associated with regulatory compliance. Ultimately, these changes could result in modifications to our existing or future strategic plans, capital requirements, compensation, financial performance and stock performance.\nRecently enacted legislation might not stabilize the U.S. financial system.\nThe U.S. Congress enacted the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (\u201cEESA\u201d) in response to the impact of the volatility and disruption in the capital and credit markets on the financial sector. The Treasury and the federal banking regulators implemented a number of programs under this legislation to address these conditions and the asset quality, capital and liquidity issues they have caused for certain financial institutions and to improve the general availability of credit for consumers and businesses. In addition, the U.S. Congress enacted the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (\u201cARRA\u201d) in an effort to save and create jobs, stimulate the U.S. economy and promote long-term growth and stability. The EESA and ARRA have been followed by numerous actions by the Federal Reserve, the U.S. Congress, the U.S. Treasury, the FDIC, the Commission and others to address the liquidity and credit crisis that followed the sub-prime meltdown. These measures include homeowner relief that encourages loan restructuring and modification; the establishment of significant liquidity and credit facilities for financial institutions and investment banks; the lowering of the federal funds rate; emergency action against short selling practices; a temporary guaranty program for money market funds; the establishment of a commercial paper funding facility to provide back-stop liquidity to commercial paper issuers; and coordinated international efforts to address illiquidity and other weaknesses in the banking sector. The purpose of these legislative and regulatory actions is to stabilize the U.S. financial system. The Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (\u201cTLGP\u201d), the EESA, the ARRA and the other regulatory initiatives described above may not have their desired effects. If the volatility in the markets continues and economic conditions fail to improve or worsen, our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or access to credit, as well as the trading price of our common stock, could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur loan portfolio includes residential construction and land development loans, which have a greater credit risk than residential mortgage loans.\nWe engage in residential construction and land development loans to developers. This type of lending is generally considered to have more complex credit risks than traditional single-family residential lending because the principal is concentrated in a limited number of loans with repayment dependent on the successful operation of the related real estate project. Consequently, these loans are more sensitive to the current adverse conditions in the real estate market and the general economy. These loans are generally less predictable and more difficult to evaluate and monitor and collateral may be difficult to dispose of in a market decline. Furthermore, during adverse general economic conditions, which were experienced in residential real estate construction nationwide, borrowers involved in the residential real estate construction and development business suffer above normal financial strain. As the residential real estate development and construction market in our markets previously deteriorated, our borrowers in this segment experienced difficulty repaying their obligations to us. If additional charge-offs or foreclosures relating to these loans are necessary in the future, our results of operations would be negatively impacted. Additionally, to the extent repayment is dependent upon the sale of newly constructed homes or lots, such sales are likely to be at lower prices or at a slower rate than was expected when the loan was made, which may result in such loans being placed on non-accrual status and subject to higher loss estimates even if the borrower keeps interest payments current. These adverse economic and real estate market conditions may lead to further increases in non-performing loans and other real estate owned, increased charge-offs from the disposition of non-performing assets, and increases in provision for loan losses, all of which would negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in interest rates could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in interest rates may affect our level of interest income, the primary component of our gross revenue, as well as the level of our interest expense. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, including general economic conditions and the policies of various governmental and regulatory authorities. Accordingly, changes in interest rates could decrease our net interest income. Changes in the level of interest rates also may negatively affect our ability to originate real estate loans, the value of our assets and the ability to realize gains from the sale of our assets, all of which ultimately affects earnings. Economic events prompted the Federal Reserve, beginning in September 2007, to reduce its federal funds rate. Due to the rapid decline in interest rates, we were unable to recalibrate our liabilities at the same rate at which loan rates declined. As a result, the net interest margin was impacted negatively during 2009. If the Federal Reserve\u2019s federal funds rate remains at extremely low levels or does not increase above our interest rate floors, our funding costs may increase which will negatively impact the net interest margin and our financial performance.\nWe may require additional capital which may not be able to be obtained or, if obtained, may cause significant dilution to current shareholders.\nWe may require capital from sources other than earnings generation. Such other sources may include an offering of equity-based securities, which could significantly dilute your investment in the event of conversion. We may need to pursue additional sources of capital, which may include additional equity investments, additional offerings of equity-based securities, borrowed funds or any combination of these sources. Our ability to access these alternative capital sources may be limited to the condition of the capital markets. Therefore, we may have difficulty rebuilding the Bank\u2019s capital reserves and we may provide new investors in the future certain rights, preferences and privileges senior to our current shareholders which may adversely impact our current shareholders.\nRecently enacted legislation could have a negative impact on our business.\nThe impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on the financial services industry will be broad, with enhanced regulatory oversight and compliance, including, among other things, (i) enhanced resolution authority of troubled and failing banks and their holding companies; (ii) increased capital and liquidity requirements; (iii) increased regulatory examination fees; (iv) changes to assessments to be paid to the FDIC for federal deposit insurance; and (v) numerous other provisions designed to improve supervision and oversight of, and strengthening safety and soundness for, the financial services sector. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act established a new framework for systemic risk and oversight in the industry which has resulted and will continue to result in sweeping changes in the regulation of financial institutions aimed at strengthening safety and soundness for the financial services sector.\nWe expect that many of the requirements called for in the Dodd-Frank Act will be implemented over time, and most will be subject to implementing regulations over the course of several years. Given the uncertainty associated with the manner in which the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act will be implemented by the various regulatory agencies and through regulations, the full extent of the impact such requirements will have on financial institutions\u2019 operations is unclear. The changes resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act may impact the profitability of our business activities, require changes to certain of our business practices, impose upon us more stringent capital, liquidity and leverage ratio requirements or otherwise adversely affect our business. These changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make necessary changes in order to comply with new statutory and regulatory requirements.\nWe are subject to federal and state regulations that may negatively impact our operations and financial performance.\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry and are subject to examination, supervision and comprehensive regulation by various federal and state agencies, including the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the TDFI. Many of the banking regulations we are governed by are intended to protect depositors, the public or the insurance funds maintained by the FDIC, not shareholders. Compliance with the numerous banking regulations is costly and requires investment in human and information technology resources. Certain of our activities, such as the payment of dividends, mergers and acquisitions, investments, loans and interest rates charged, interest rates paid on deposits and locations of offices, are impacted by these regulations. We are also subject to capitalization guidelines established by banking authorities, which require us to maintain adequate capital to support our growth. To be categorized as \u201cwell capitalized,\u201d an institution must maintain minimum total risk-based, Tier 1 risk-based and Tier 1 leverage ratios.\nThe laws and regulations applicable to the banking industry are subject to change at any time. We cannot predict the events that will result in regulatory changes nor their impact on the banking industry in general and us in particular. Because government regulation greatly affects the business and financial results of all commercial banks and bank holding companies, the cost of compliance could adversely affect our ability to operate profitably.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the related rules and regulations promulgated by the Commission have increased the scope, complexity and cost of corporate governance, reporting and disclosure practices. These regulations are applicable to us. We have experienced, and may continue to experience, increasing compliance costs as a result of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. These necessary costs are proportionately higher for a company of our size and will affect our profitability more than that of some of our larger competitors.\nU.S. Banking agencies have finalized revisions to their risk-based and leverage capital requirements consistent with agreements reached by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel III). The final rules establish tougher capital standards through more restrictive capital definitions, higher risk-weighted assets, additional capital buffers, and higher requirements for minimum capital ratios. These reforms could have a material negative impact on the profitability and returns on equity of U.S. banks, including the Bank.\nWe have a significant deferred tax asset that might not be fully realized.\nWe have net deferred tax assets of $1.8 million as of December 31, 2014. We did not establish a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2013 or December 31, 2014 because we believe that it is more likely than not that all of these assets will be realized. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, we estimated future taxable income based on management prepared forecasts. This process required significant judgment by management about matters that are by nature uncertain. If future events differ significantly from our current forecasts, we may need to establish a valuation allowance, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe rely heavily on the services of key personnel and the unexpected loss of any of those personnel could adversely affect our operations.\nWe are dependent on certain key officers who have important customer relationships or are instrumental to our lending, depository and bank operations. We believe that our future results will also depend upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified personnel.\nWe are subject to Tennessee\u2019s anti-takeover statutes and certain charter provisions that could decrease our chances of being acquired even if the acquisition is in the best interest of our shareholders.\nAs a Tennessee corporation, we are subject to various legislative acts that impose restrictions on and require compliance with procedures designed to protect shareholders against unfair or coercive mergers and acquisitions. These statutes may delay or prevent offers to acquire us and increase the difficulty of consummating any such offers, even if the acquisition would be in our shareholders\u2019 best interests. Our charter also contains provisions which may make it difficult for another entity to acquire us without the approval of a majority of the disinterested directors on our board of directors. Secondly, the amount of common stock owned by, and other compensation arrangements with, certain of our officers and directors may make it more difficult to obtain shareholder approval of potential takeovers that they oppose. Agreements with our senior management also provide for significant payments under certain circumstances following a change in control. These compensation arrangements, together with the common stock and option ownership of our board of directors and management, could make it difficult or expensive to obtain majority support for shareholder proposals or potential acquisition proposals that the board of directors and officers oppose.\nThe success and growth of our operations will depend on our ability to adapt to technological changes.\nThe banking industry and the ability to deliver financial services is becoming more dependent on technological advancement, such as the ability to process loan applications over the Internet, accept electronic signatures, provide process status updates instantly, reliable on-line banking capabilities and other customer expected conveniences that are cost efficient to our business processes. As these technologies are improved in the future, we may, in order to remain competitive, be required to make significant capital expenditures.\nIf we engage in business combination transactions, we may face risks associated with integration of operations or undiscovered losses or other problems.\nSuch negotiated acquisitions will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in acquisitions, including, among other things:\n\u2022\ncredit risk associated with the other bank\u2019s loans and leases and investments;\n\u2022\ndifficulty of integrating operations and personnel;\n\u2022\npotential disruption of the our ongoing business; and\n\u2022\npotential loss of key employees, customers and deposits of the other bank.\nA failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of our third party vendors and other service providers or other third parties, including as a result of cyber attacks, could disrupt our business, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, increase our costs, and cause losses.\nWe rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business. Information security risks for financial institutions have generally increased in recent years. Our operating systems and infrastructure must continue to be protected. Our operating systems and facilities may stop operating properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors, including electrical or telecommunication outages; natural disasters such as earthquakes, tornadoes, and floods; disease pandemics; events arising from local or larger scale political or social matters, including terrorist acts; and cyber attacks.\nOur technologies, systems and networks, those of third parties with whom we do business, and our customers\u2019 devices may become the target of cyber attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss, or destruction of confidential information. As threats of cyber attacks continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate information security vulnerabilities.\nAny of these events could result in client attrition, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, reputation damage, reimbursement or other compensation costs, and/or additional compliance costs, any of which could have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition.", "PERMNO": 15906, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "SMBK"}
