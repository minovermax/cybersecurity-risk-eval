Risk Factors\nOil, NGL and natural gas prices are volatile, and a decline in these prices would significantly affect our financial results and impede our growth. Additionally, our results are subject to commodity price fluctuations related to seasonal and market conditions and reservoir and production risks.\nOur revenue, profitability and cash flow depend substantially upon the prices of and demand for oil, NGLs and natural gas. The markets for these commodities are volatile, and even relatively modest drops in prices can significantly affect our financial results and impede our growth. In particular, declines in or depressed commodity prices may:\n\u25cf\nnegatively impact the value of our reserves because declines in oil, NGL and natural gas prices would reduce the value and amount of oil, NGLs and natural gas that we can produce economically;\n\u25cf\nreduce the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures, repayment of indebtedness and other corporate purposes;\n\u25cf\nresult in a decrease in the borrowing base under our Credit Facility due to a reduction in reserves or otherwise limit our ability to borrow money or raise additional capital; and\n\u25cf\nnegatively impact our ability to comply with the financial covenants under our Credit Facility, potentially resulting in a default under that indebtedness.\nFurther, oil, NGL and natural gas prices do not necessarily fluctuate in direct relation to each other, and prices fluctuate widely in response to a variety of factors beyond our control such as:\n\u25cf\ndomestic and foreign supply of oil, NGLs and natural gas;\n\u25cf\nprice and quantity of foreign imports of oil, NGLs and natural gas;\n\u25cf\nactions of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and state-controlled oil companies relating to oil price and production controls;\n\u25cf\nrestrictions on exportation of our oil, NGLs and natural gas;\n\u25cf\nconsumer demand;\n\u25cf\nthe impact of energy conservation efforts;\n\u25cf\nregional price differentials and quality differentials of oil, NGLs and natural gas;\n\u25cf\ndomestic and foreign governmental regulations, actions and taxes;\n\u25cf\npolitical conditions in or affecting other oil producing and natural gas producing countries, including current conflicts outside of the U.S.;\n\u25cf\nthe availability of refining capacity;\n\u25cf\nweather conditions and natural disasters;\n\u25cf\ntechnological advances affecting oil, NGL and natural gas production and consumption;\n\u25cf\noverall U.S. and global economic conditions;\n\u25cf\nprice and availability of alternative fuels;\n\u25cf\nseasonal variations in oil, NGL and natural gas prices;\n\u25cf\nvariations in levels of production; and\n\u25cf\nthe completion of large domestic or international exploration and production projects.\nThese factors and the volatility of the energy markets make it extremely difficult to predict future oil, NGL and natural gas price movements with any certainty. A further or extended decline in commodity prices will likely materially and adversely affect our future business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdverse economic and capital market conditions may significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs, access to capital and cost of capital.\nConcerns over inflation, the stability of sovereign debt levels, and volatility in the prices of securities have led to diminished expectations of the U.S. and foreign economies. These factors, combined with increased levels of unemployment and diminished liquidity and credit availability, prompted an unprecedented level of intervention by the U.S. federal government and other governments in recent years.\nIf the economic recovery in the U.S. or other large economies is slow or prolonged, our ability to access the capital markets may be restricted at a time when we desire, or need, to raise capital. In addition, volatility and disruption in the financial and credit markets may adversely affect the financial condition of lenders in our Credit Facility and/or the ability or willingness of other lenders to participate in our Credit Facility. These market conditions may adversely affect our liquidity by limiting our ability to access our Credit Facility.\nPotential deterioration in the credit markets, combined with a decline in commodity prices, may impact our capital expenditure level.\nWhile we seek to fund our capital expenditures primarily through cash flows from operating activities, we have in the past also drawn on unused capacity under our Credit Facility for capital expenditures. Borrowings under our Credit Facility are subject to the maintenance of a borrowing base, which is subject to semi-annual review and other adjustments. In the event that our borrowing base is reduced, outstanding borrowings in excess of the revised borrowing base will be due and payable immediately and we may not have the financial resources to make the mandatory prepayments. Our borrowing base is dependent on a number of factors, including our level of reserves, which may be adversely impacted by depressed or declining commodity prices. If our ability to borrow under our Credit Facility is impacted, we may be required to reduce our capital expenditures, which may in turn adversely affect our ability to carry out our business plan. Furthermore, if we lack the resources to dedicate sufficient capital expenditures to our existing oil and natural gas leases, we may be unable to produce adequate quantities of oil and natural gas to retain these leases and they may expire due to a lack of investment. The loss of leases could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and results of operations.\nDevelopment and exploration drilling activities do not ensure reserve replacement and thus our ability to generate revenue.\nDevelopment and exploration drilling and strategic acquisitions are the main methods of replacing reserves. However, development and exploration drilling operations may not result in any increases in reserves for various reasons. Our future oil, NGL and natural gas production depends on our success in finding or acquiring additional reserves. If we fail to replace reserves through drilling or acquisitions, our level of production and cash flows will be affected adversely. In general, production from oil, NGL and natural gas properties declines as reserves are depleted, with the rate of decline dependent on reservoir characteristics. Our total proved reserves decline as reserves are produced. Our ability to make the necessary capital investment to maintain or expand our asset base of oil, NGL and natural gas reserves would be impaired to the extent cash flow from operations is reduced and external sources of capital become limited or unavailable. We may not be successful in exploring for, developing or acquiring additional reserves.\nThe terms of our agreements governing our indebtedness contain a number of operating and financial covenants. If we are unable to comply with these covenants, the repayment of our indebtedness may be accelerated.\nWe are subject to a number of covenants in our Credit Facility and in the indentures governing our Senior Notes (the 5.625% Senior Notes due 2021, 5.875% Senior Notes due 2022 and 5.875% Senior Notes due 2024 are collectively referred to as our \u201cSenior Notes\u201d) that impose restrictions on us, including our ability to incur indebtedness and liens, make loans and investments, make capital expenditures, sell assets, engage in mergers, consolidations and acquisitions, enter into transactions with affiliates, enter into sale and leaseback transactions and pay dividends on our common stock. We are also required by the terms of our Credit Facility to comply with financial covenants. A more detailed description of our Credit Facility and the indentures governing our Senior Notes is included in Item 7. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d and the footnotes to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nA breach of any of the covenants imposed on us by the agreements governing our indebtedness, including the financial covenants in our Credit Facility, could result in a default under such indebtedness. In the event of a default, the lenders under our Credit Facility could terminate their commitments to us, and they could accelerate the repayment of all of our indebtedness. In such\ncase, we may not have sufficient funds to pay the total amount of accelerated obligations, and our lenders could proceed against the collateral securing the facilities, which is substantially all of our assets. Any acceleration in the repayment of our indebtedness or related foreclosure could adversely affect our business.\nOur exploration and development activities may not be commercially successful.\nExploration and development activities involve numerous risks, including the risk that no commercially productive quantities of oil, NGLs and natural gas will be discovered. In addition, the future cost and timing of drilling, completing and producing wells is often uncertain. Furthermore, drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or cancelled as a result of a variety of factors, including:\n\u25cf\nreductions in oil, NGL and natural gas prices, such as the recent decline in commodity prices;\n\u25cf\nunexpected drilling conditions;\n\u25cf\npressure or irregularities in formations;\n\u25cf\ndisruptions to production from producing wells related to hydraulic fracturing operations in nearby wells;\n\u25cf\ninterference between producing wells, as a result of, among other things, spacing between wells;\n\u25cf\nequipment failures, including corrosion of aging equipment, systems failures and extended downtime, or accidents;\n\u25cf\nunavailability or high cost of drilling rigs, equipment or labor;\n\u25cf\nlost or damaged oilfield development and services tools;\n\u25cf\nlimitations in midstream infrastructure or the lack of markets for oil, NGLs and natural gas;\n\u25cf\nunavailability or high cost of processing and transportation;\n\u25cf\nhuman error;\n\u25cf\ncommunity unrest;\n\u25cf\nsabotage, terrorism and border issues, including encounters with illegal aliens and drug smugglers;\n\u25cf\nadverse weather conditions, including severe droughts resulting in new restrictions on water usage;\n\u25cf\nenvironmental hazards, such as natural gas leaks, oil spills, pipeline ruptures and discharges of toxic gases;\n\u25cf\ndisputes regarding leases;\n\u25cf\ndisputes with mineral interest, surface or royalty owners and access constraints or limitations on surface use on or near our operating areas;\n\u25cf\ncompliance with environmental and other governmental regulations;\n\u25cf\npossible federal, state, regional and municipal regulatory moratoriums on new permits, delays in securing new permits, changes to existing permitting requirements without \u201cgrandfathering\u201d of existing permits and possible prohibition and limitations with regard to certain completion activities; and\n\u25cf\nincreases in severance taxes.\nOur decisions to purchase, explore, develop and exploit prospects or properties depend, in part, on data obtained through geological and geophysical analyses, production data and engineering studies, the results of which are uncertain. Even when used and properly interpreted, 3-D seismic data and visualization techniques only assist geoscientists in identifying potentially productive hydrocarbon traps and geohazards. They do not allow the interpreter to know conclusively if hydrocarbons are present or economic. In addition, the use of 3-D seismic and other advanced technologies requires greater pre-drilling expenditures than traditional drilling strategies. Because of these factors, we could incur losses as a result of exploratory drilling expenditures. Poor results from exploration activities could have a material adverse effect on our future financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nNumerous uncertainties are inherent in our estimates of oil, NGL and natural gas reserves and our estimated reserve quantities, and our present value calculations may not be accurate. Any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves.\nEstimates of proved oil, NGL and natural gas reserves and the future net cash flows attributable to those reserves are prepared by our engineers and audited by independent petroleum engineers and geologists. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil, NGL and natural gas reserves and cash flows attributable to such reserves, including factors\nbeyond our engineers\u2019 control. Reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil, NGLs and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner. The accuracy of an estimate of quantities of reserves, or of cash flows attributable to such reserves, is a function of the available data, assumptions regarding future oil, NGL and natural gas prices, expenditures for future development and exploration activities, engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. Additionally, reserves and future cash flows may be subject to material downward or upward revisions based upon production history, development and exploration activities and prices of oil, NGLs and natural gas. In addition, different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserves and cash flows based on the same available data. The present value of future net revenues from our proved reserves referred to in this report is not necessarily the actual current market value of our estimated oil, NGL and natural gas reserves. In accordance with SEC requirements, we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on an average price, calculated as the twelve-month first-day-of-the month historical average price for the twelve-month period prior to the end of the reporting period, and costs as of the date of the estimate. Our reserves as of December 31, 2014 were based on the trailing twelve-month first-day-of-the-month historical unweighted averages of West Texas Intermediate oil prices of $91.48 per Bbl, adjusted for basis and quality differentials, and Henry Hub natural gas prices of $4.35 per MMBtu, adjusted for basis and quality differentials. Actual future prices and costs fluctuate over time and may differ materially from those used in the present value estimate.\nThe timing of both the production and expenses from the development and production of oil, NGL and natural gas properties will affect both the timing of actual future net cash flows from our proved reserves and their present value. In addition, the 10% discount factor that we use to calculate the standardized measure of future net cash flows for reporting purposes in accordance with the SEC\u2019s rules may not necessarily be the most appropriate discount factor. The effective interest rate at various times and the risks associated with our business or the oil and natural gas industry, in general, will affect the appropriateness of the 10% discount factor in arriving at the standardized measure of future net cash flows.\nDownward revisions of reserves or lower oil and natural gas prices could result in impairments of our oil, NGL and natural gas properties.\nUnder the full cost method, we are subject to quarterly calculations of a \u201cceiling,\u201d or limitation, on the amount of our oil, NGL and natural gas properties that can be capitalized on our balance sheet. If the net capitalized costs of our oil, NGL and natural gas properties exceed the cost ceiling, we are subject to a ceiling test write-down of our estimated net reserves to the extent of such excess. If required, a write-down would reduce earnings and impact stockholders\u2019 equity in the period of occurrence and result in lower amortization expense in future periods. The discounted present value of our proved reserves is a major component of the ceiling calculation and represents the component that requires the most subjective judgment. The current ceiling calculation utilizes a trailing twelve-month first-day-of-the-month historical unweighted average price and does not allow us to re-evaluate the calculation subsequent to the end of the period if prices increase. It also dictates that costs in effect as of the last day of the quarter are held constant. The risk that we will be required to write down the carrying value of oil, NGL and natural gas properties increases when oil and natural gas prices are depressed or volatile. In addition, a write-down of proved oil, NGL and natural gas properties may occur if we experience substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves. It is possible that we may recognize revisions to our proved reserves in the future. Write-downs recorded in one period will not be reversed in a subsequent period even though higher oil and natural gas prices may have increased the ceiling applicable in the subsequent period.\nWe did not record any write-downs or impairments for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 or 2012. Given the recent decline in commodity prices, should oil and natural gas prices remain depressed or further decline, it is likely that write-downs will occur. See Item 7. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\u201d for further information.\nA widening of the difference between condensate and crude oil prices could negatively impact our revenue and the value of our reserves.\nA significant portion of our oil production (approximately 50% in 2014) and our proved oil reserves (approximately 58% as of December 31, 2014) is condensate. Condensate is common in our Eagle Ford assets and is priced unfavorably versus crude oil as a result of its higher API gravity. A significant widening of this differential could have a material, negative effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and future growth, as well as a negative impact on the value of our oil reserves and the volumes of oil that we can economically produce.\nChanges in governmental laws, regulations, and rules could materially affect our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial position and future growth.\nOur activities are subject to federal, state, regional and local laws and regulations. Some of the laws, regulations and rules contain provisions for significant fines and penalties for non-compliance. Changes in laws and regulations could affect our costs of operations, production levels, royalty obligations, price levels, environmental requirements and other aspects of our business,\nincluding our general profitability. We are unable to predict changes to existing laws and regulations. For example, on August 16, 2012, the EPA published final rules that extend NSPS and NESHAPs to certain exploration and production operations. This renewed focus could lead to additional federal and state regulations affecting the oil and natural gas industry. New regulations or changes to existing laws and regulations could materially affect our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial position and future growth.\nOur business requires a staff with technical expertise, specialized knowledge and training and a high degree of management experience.\nOur success is largely dependent upon our ability to attract and retain personnel with the skills and experience required for our business. An inability to sufficiently staff our operations or the loss of the services of one or more members of our senior management or of numerous employees with technical skills could have a negative effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and future growth.\nMarket conditions, including the current decline in oil, NGL and natural gas prices, or transportation impediments may hinder our access to oil, NGL and natural gas markets, delay our production and expose us to additional deficiency payments under our long-term transportation and processing agreements.\nMarket conditions, the unavailability of satisfactory oil, NGL and natural gas processing and transportation to available markets or the remote location of certain of our drilling operations may hinder our access to markets or delay our production. The availability of a ready market for our various products depends on a number of factors, including the demand for and supply of oil, NGLs and natural gas and the proximity of reserves to pipelines, terminals and trucking, railroad and/or barge transportation and processing facilities. Our ability to market our production also depends in substantial part on the availability and capacity of gathering systems, pipelines, terminals, other means of transportation and processing facilities. We may be required to shut in wells or delay production for lack of a market or because of inadequacy or unavailability of gathering systems, pipelines, or other means of transportation or processing facilities. The transportation of our production may be interrupted under the terms of our interruptible or short-term transportation agreements due to capacity constraints on the applicable system. The transportation of our production may also be interrupted under the terms of our firm long-term transportation, terminal and processing agreements due to operational upset, third-party force majeure or other events beyond our control. Further, any disruption of third-party facilities due to maintenance, repairs, debottlenecking, expansion projects, weather or other interruptions of service could negatively impact our ability to market and deliver our products. Our concentration of operations in the Eagle Ford and Permian Basin areas increases these risks and their potential impact upon us. If we experience any interruptions to the transportation and/or processing of our products, we may be unable to realize revenue from our wells until our production can be tied to a pipeline or gathering system, transported by truck, rail and/or barge, or processed, as applicable, into the particular products. This can result in considerable delays from the initial discovery of a reservoir to the actual production of the oil, NGLs and natural gas and ultimate realization of revenues. In addition, if the prices of oil, NGLs and natural gas decline further, the amount of oil, NGLs and natural gas that we can produce economically may decline. As a result, we may be unable to satisfy our commitments under our long-term transportation and processing agreements, which may expose us to additional volume deficiency payments.\nCompetition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense, and many of our competitors have resources that are greater than ours.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment for acquiring prospects and productive properties, marketing oil, NGLs and natural gas and securing equipment and trained personnel. Our competitors include major and large independent oil and natural gas companies that possess financial, technical and personnel resources substantially greater than our resources. Those companies may be able to develop and acquire more prospects and productive properties at a lower cost and more quickly than our financial or personnel resources permit. Our ability to acquire additional prospects and discover reserves in the future will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment. Larger competitors may be better able to withstand sustained periods of commodity price volatility, depressed commodity prices and unsuccessful drilling and absorb the burden of changes in laws and regulations more easily than we can, which would adversely affect our competitive position. We may not be able to compete successfully in the future in acquiring prospective reserves, developing reserves, marketing hydrocarbons, attracting and retaining quality personnel and raising additional capital.\nOur strategy as an onshore unconventional resource player has resulted in operations concentrated in two geographic areas, with the majority of operations in the Eagle Ford area, and increases our exposure to many of the risks enumerated herein, including a lack of diversification with respect to mineral interest, surface and/or royalty owners.\nCurrently, the majority of our assets and operations are in the Eagle Ford area, which provided approximately 85% of our total revenue for 2014, excluding the impact of derivative instruments, and it represents approximately 89% of our estimated total proved\nreserves as of December 31, 2014. This concentration increases the potential impact that many of the risks stated herein may have upon our ability to perform. For example, we have greater exposure to regulatory actions impacting Texas, natural disasters in the geographic area, competition for equipment, services and materials available in the area and access to infrastructure and markets.\nIn addition, because our operations are highly concentrated geographically, we contract with a limited number of mineral interest, surface and/or royalty owners. From time to time, disagreements with such interest owners may arise with respect to interpretations of agreements relating to our and their rights. Failure to satisfy our obligations under these agreements may adversely affect our rights under such agreements. To the extent these agreements relate to material properties, the loss of rights under such agreements could materially and adversely affect us.\nThe unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, personnel and oilfield services could adversely affect our ability to execute our exploration and development plans on a timely basis and within our budget.\nOur industry is cyclical and, from time to time, there is a shortage of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies or qualified personnel. During these periods, the costs and delivery times of rigs, equipment and supplies are substantially greater. In addition, the demand for, and wage rates of, qualified drilling rig crews rise as the number of active rigs in service increases. If the level of exploration and production increases in the future, the demand for and costs of oilfield services could increase, while the quality of these services may decline. If the unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies or qualified personnel were particularly severe in the Eagle Ford or Permian areas, we could be materially and adversely affected because our operations and properties are concentrated in these areas.\nOperating hazards, natural disasters or other interruptions of our operations could result in potential liabilities, which may not be fully covered by our insurance.\nThe oil and natural gas business involves certain operating hazards such as:\n\u25cf\nwell blowouts;\n\u25cf\ncratering;\n\u25cf\nexplosions;\n\u25cf\nuncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas or well fluids;\n\u25cf\nfires;\n\u25cf\nhurricanes, tropical storms and flooding;\n\u25cf\npollution;\n\u25cf\nreleases of toxic gas; and\n\u25cf\nsurface spillage and surface or ground water contamination.\nAny of these operating hazards could cause serious injuries, fatalities or property damage, which could expose us to liabilities. The payment of any of these liabilities could reduce, or even eliminate, the funds available for exploration, development, and acquisition or could result in a loss of our properties. We are not fully insured against all risks, including development and completion risks that are generally not recoverable from third parties or insurance. In addition, our insurance policies provide limited coverage for losses or liabilities relating to sudden and accidental pollution, but not for other types of pollution. Our insurance might be inadequate to cover our liabilities. Our energy package is written on reasonably standard terms and conditions that are generally available to the exploration and production industry. The insurance market in general and the energy insurance market in particular have been difficult markets over the past several years. Insurance costs could increase in the future as the insurance industry adjusts to difficult exposures and we may decrease coverage and retain more risk to mitigate future cost increases. If we incur substantial liability and the damages are not covered by insurance or are in excess of policy limits, or if we incur a liability for a risk at a time when we do not have liability insurance, then our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nOur current insurance policies provide some coverage for losses arising out of our completion operations. However, these policies may not cover fines, penalties or costs and expenses related to government-mandated clean-up activities, and total losses related to a spill, contamination or blowout during completion operations could exceed our per occurrence or aggregate policy limits. Furthermore, our current insurance policies do not provide coverage for ground water contamination due to any migration if not discoverable within a certain period, from fractured areas or from leaking associated with inadequate casing or cementing or defective and/or inadequate pipe and/or casing in the vertical sections of any of our shale wells that traverse aquifers in the locations of our\nproducing properties. Any losses that are not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nRegulation and competition of hydraulic fracturing services could impede our ability to develop our shale plays.\nHydraulic fracturing activities are required for all of our wells on our shale producing properties. Hydraulic fracturing involves pumping a mixture of water, sand and chemicals at high pressure into underground shale formations through steel pipe that is perforated at the location of the hydrocarbons. The high pressure creates small fractures that allow the oil, NGLs and natural gas to flow into the well bore for collection at the surface. While the majority of the proppant remains wedged underground to prop open the fractures, a percentage of the water and additives flows back from hydraulic fracturing operations. These fluids are then either recycled onsite or must be transported to and disposed of at sites that are approved and permitted by applicable regulatory authorities.\nThe practice of hydraulic fracturing formations to stimulate production of oil, NGLs and natural gas has come under increased scrutiny by the environmental community. Various federal, state and local initiatives are underway to regulate, or further investigate, the environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing. For example, in 2011, Texas adopted regulations requiring certain hydraulic fracturing disclosures. Although hydraulic fracturing has been largely exempt from the federal Safe Drinking Water Act since 2005, bills have been considered in Congress that would repeal this exemption. In addition, the White House Council on Environmental Quality is coordinating an administration-wide review of hydraulic fracturing practices, and a number of federal agencies are analyzing environmental issues associated with hydraulic fracturing. For example, the EPA has commenced a multi-year study of the potential environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing, the results of which are anticipated to be available in 2015.\nOn August 16, 2012 the EPA published final rules that extend New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPs) to certain exploration and production operations. The first compliance date was October 15, 2012 with a phase-in of some of the requirements over the next two years. The final rule requires the use of reduced emission completions or \u201cgreen completions\u201d on all hydraulically fractured natural gas wells constructed or refractured after January 1, 2015. The EPA received numerous requests for reconsideration of these rules from both industry and the environmental community, and court challenges to the rules were also filed. In response to some of these challenges, the EPA amended the rule to extend compliance dates for certain storage vessels, and it may issue additional revised rules in response to additional requests in the future.\nThe adoption of any future federal, state or local laws or regulations imposing additional permitting, disclosure or regulatory obligations related to, or otherwise restricting or increasing costs regarding the use of, hydraulic fracturing could make it more difficult to conduct drilling activity. As a result, such additional regulations could affect the volume of hydrocarbons we recover, and could increase the cycle times and costs to receive permits, delay or possibly preclude receipt of permits in certain areas, impact water usage and waste water disposal and require air emissions, water usage and chemical additives disclosures. Such regulations could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions and, if the use of hydraulic fracturing is limited or prohibited, could lead to our inability to access existing and new oil, NGL and natural gas reserves in the future.\nOur industry is experiencing a growing emphasis on the exploitation and development of shale resource plays which are dependent on hydraulic fracturing for economically successful development. We engage third-party contractors to provide hydraulic fracturing services and related services, equipment and supplies. The availability or high cost of high pressure pumping services (or hydraulic fracturing services), chemicals, proppant, water, and related services and equipment could limit our ability to execute our exploration and development plans on a timely basis and within our budget. Hydraulic fracturing in shale plays requires high pressure pumping service crews. A shortage of service crews or proppant, chemicals or water could materially and adversely affect our operations and the timeliness of executing our development plans within our budget.\nEnvironmental matters and costs can be significant.\nThe oil and natural gas business is subject to various federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to the discharge of materials into, and protection of, the environment. Such laws and regulations may impose liability on us for pollution clean-up, remediation, restoration and other liabilities arising from or related to our operations. Any noncompliance with these laws and regulations could subject us to material administrative, civil or criminal penalties or other liabilities. Additionally, our compliance with these laws may, from time to time, result in increased costs to our operations or decreased production. We also may be liable for environmental damages caused by the previous owners or operators of properties we have purchased or are currently operating. The cost of future compliance is uncertain and is subject to various factors, including future changes to laws and regulations. We have no assurance that future changes in or additions to the environmental laws and regulations will not have a significant impact on our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and future growth.\nOur operations are substantially dependent on the availability of water. Restrictions on our ability to obtain water may have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWater is an essential component for deep shale oil, NGL and natural gas development during both the drilling and hydraulic fracturing processes. Historically, we have been able to purchase water from local land owners for use in our operations. According to the Lower Colorado River Authority, from 2011 to 2013, Texas experienced some of the lowest inflows of water in recorded history. As a result of this severe drought, some local water districts have begun restricting the use of water subject to their jurisdiction for hydraulic fracturing to protect local water supply. If we are unable to obtain water to use in our operations from local sources, we may be unable to economically produce our reserves, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nPossible regulations related to global warming and climate change could have an adverse effect on our operations and the demand for oil, NGLs and natural gas.\nRecent scientific studies have suggested that emissions of certain gases, commonly referred to as \u201cgreenhouse gases,\u201d may be contributing to the warming of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. Methane, a primary component of natural gas, and carbon dioxide, a byproduct of the burning of refined oil products and natural gas, are examples of greenhouse gases. In recent years, the U.S. Congress has considered climate-related legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. In addition, at least 20 states have developed measures to regulate emissions of greenhouse gases, primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emissions inventories and/or regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs. The EPA has adopted regulations requiring reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from certain facilities, including oil and natural gas production facilities, and has adopted regulations imposing permitting requirements on certain large stationary sources. The EPA also is considering additional regulation of greenhouse gases, including regulations targeting methane emissions from the oil and natural gas sector. Passage of climate change legislation or additional regulatory initiatives by federal and state governments that regulate or restrict emissions of greenhouse gases (including methane or carbon dioxide) could have an adverse effect on our operations and the demand for oil, NGLs and natural gas.\nOur property acquisition strategy could fail or present unanticipated problems for our business in the future, which could adversely affect our ability to make property acquisitions and/or realize anticipated benefits of those acquisitions.\nOur growth strategy includes acquiring oil and natural gas properties. We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities or finance and complete any particular acquisition successfully. Furthermore, acquisitions involve a number of risks and challenges, including:\n\u25cf\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention;\n\u25cf\nability or impediments to conducting thorough due diligence activities;\n\u25cf\npotential lack of operating experience in the geographic market where the acquired properties are located;\n\u25cf\nan increase in our expenses and working capital requirements;\n\u25cf\nthe validity of our assumptions about reserves, future production, revenues, capital expenditures and operating costs, including synergies;\n\u25cf\na decrease in our liquidity by using a significant portion of our available cash or borrowing capacity under our Credit Facility to finance acquisitions;\n\u25cf\na significant increase in our interest expense or financial leverage if we incur additional debt to finance acquisitions;\n\u25cf\nthe assumption of unknown liabilities, losses or costs for which we are not indemnified or for which our indemnity is inadequate;\n\u25cf\nthe incurrence of other significant charges, such as impairment of oil and natural gas properties, asset devaluation or restructuring charges; and\n\u25cf\nthe inability to transition and integrate successfully or timely the businesses and/or assets we acquire.\nOur decision to acquire a property will depend in part on the evaluation of data obtained from production reports and engineering studies, geophysical and geological analyses, environmental compliance review and seismic and other information, the results of which are often inconclusive and subject to various interpretations.\nAlso, our reviews of acquired properties are inherently incomplete because it generally is not feasible to perform an in-depth review of the individual properties involved in each acquisition given time constraints imposed by sellers. Even a detailed review of\nrecords and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems, nor will it permit a buyer to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully access their deficiencies and potential. Inspections may not always be performed on every well, and environmental problems, such as groundwater contamination, are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken.\nDerivative transactions may limit our potential revenue or result in financial losses which would reduce our income.\nWe have entered into oil, NGL and natural gas price derivative contracts with respect to a portion of our expected production through 2016. These derivative contracts may limit our potential revenue if oil, NGL and natural gas prices were to rise over the price established by the contract. Such transactions may expose us to the risk of loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which our production is less than expected, there is a widening of price differentials between delivery points for our production and the delivery point assumed in the derivative contract, or the counterparties to our derivative contracts fail to perform under the contracts. Our current derivative instruments are with counterparties that are lenders under our Credit Facility. A default by any of our counterparties could negatively impact our financial performance.\nAlthough we have entered into hedges equating to a substantial portion of our 2015 projected equivalent production and a portion of our 2016 projected equivalent production, we may still be adversely affected by continuing and prolonged declines in the price of oil, NGLs and natural gas.\nTo mitigate our exposure to changes in commodity prices, management hedges oil, NGL and natural gas prices from time to time, primarily through the use of certain derivative instruments, including fixed price swaps, basis swaps and costless collars. Consistent with this policy, as of December 31, 2014, we have entered into a series of oil, NGL and natural gas fixed price swaps and costless collars for each year through 2016. However, to the extent that the price of oil remains at current levels or declines further, volumes of production that exceed the notional hedge volumes will be exposed to price volatility, and we may not be able to enter into additional hedges at the same level as our current hedges, either of which may materially and adversely affect our future business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act could have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of commodity price, interest rate and other risks associated with our business, resulting in our operations becoming more volatile and our cash flows less predictable.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act is a comprehensive financial reform legislation that establishes federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market. The legislation was signed into law by President Obama in 2010 and requires the CFTC, the SEC and other regulators to promulgate regulations implementing the new legislation. While many of the regulations are already in effect, the implementation process is still ongoing, and we cannot yet predict the ultimate effect of the regulations on our business.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act expanded the types of entities that are required to register with the CFTC and the SEC as a result of their activities in the derivatives markets or otherwise become specifically qualified to enter into derivatives contracts. We will be required to assess our activities in the derivatives markets, and to monitor such activities on an ongoing basis, to identify any potential change in our regulatory status.\nCFTC reporting and recordkeeping requirements are currently effective and could significantly increase operating costs and expose us to penalties for non-compliance. These additional recordkeeping and reporting requirements may require additional compliance resources and may also have a negative effect on market liquidity, which could negatively impact commodity prices and our ability to hedge our commercial price risk.\nIn its rulemaking under the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFTC is finalizing its regulations to set position limits for certain futures and option contracts in the major energy markets and for swaps that are their economic equivalents, although certain bona fide hedging transactions would be exempt from these position limits provided that various conditions are satisfied. Once finalized, the position limits rule and its companion rule on aggregation may have an impact on our ability to hedge our exposure to certain enumerated commodities.\nThe new legislation also requires that certain derivative instruments be centrally cleared and executed through an exchange or other approved trading platform, which may result in increased costs in the form of additional margin requirements imposed by clearing organizations. The CFTC has implemented final rules regarding mandatory clearing of certain interest rate swaps and index credit default swaps. Mandatory trading on designated contract markets or swap execution facilities of certain interest rate swaps and index credit default swaps also began in February 2014. The CFTC has not yet proposed any rules requiring the clearing of any other\nclasses of swaps, including physical commodity swaps. As the CFTC further designates swap contracts as required to be cleared and traded on a trading facility, the utility of the end-user exception will become even more important. Our ability to rely on the end-user exception may change the profitability of our trades or the efficiency of our hedging.\nRules promulgated under the Dodd-Frank Act further defined forward contracts as well as instances where forwards may become swaps. Because the CFTC is still in the process of interpreting its regulations, it is possible that some of the derivative and commodity contracts used in our business may be treated differently in the future. For example, the CFTC may further revise its definitions for spots, forwards, forwards with volumetric optionality, trade options, full requirements contracts and certain other contracts that may combine the elements of physical commodity trades and cash settlement, netting and book-outs. If these contracts were classified as swaps, the costs of entering into these contracts will likely increase.\nThe new legislation and any new regulations could significantly increase the cost of derivative contracts (including through restrictions on the types of collateral we are required to post), materially alter the terms of derivative contracts, reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks, reduce our ability to monetize or restructure existing derivative contracts, and increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties. If we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the legislation and regulations, our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable. Finally, if we fail to comply with applicable laws, rules or regulations, we may be subject to fines, cease-and-desist orders, civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions.\nIn addition to the Dodd-Frank Act, the European Union and other foreign regulators have adopted and are implementing local reforms generally comparable with the reforms under the Dodd-Frank Act. Implementation and enforcement of these regulatory provisions may reduce our ability to hedge our market risks with non-U.S. counterparties and may make our transactions involving cross-border swaps more expensive and burdensome. Additionally, the lack of regulatory equivalency across jurisdictions may increase compliance costs and make it more difficult to satisfy our regulatory obligations.\nFinally, under the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFTC is also directed generally to prevent price manipulation and fraud in physical commodities markets traded in interstate commerce, including physical energy and other commodities, as well as financial instruments, such as futures, options and swaps. Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFTC has adopted additional anti-market manipulation, anti-fraud and disruptive trading practices regulations that prohibit, among other things, fraud and price manipulation in the physical commodities, futures, options and swaps markets. Accordingly, the CFTC and the self-regulatory organizations (\u201cSROs\u201d), such as commodity futures exchanges, are continuing to develop their respective enforcement authorities and compliance priorities under the Dodd-Frank Act. Given the novelty of the regulations under the Dodd-Frank Act, it is difficult to predict how these new enforcement priorities of the CFTC and the SROs will impact our business. Should we violate the Commodity Exchange Act, as amended, the regulations promulgated by the CFTC, and any rules adopted by the SROs thereunder, we could be subject to CFTC enforcement action and material penalties and sanctions.\nThe impairment of financial institutions or counterparty credit default could adversely affect us.\nOur commodity derivative transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default by our counterparties. Deterioration in the credit markets may impact the credit ratings of our current and potential counterparties and affect their ability to fulfill their existing obligations to us and their willingness to enter into future transactions with us. We have significant exposure to our derivative counterparties where approximately 86% of our derivative fair value is derived from two counterparties as of December 31, 2014. Given current market conditions, the value of our derivative positions may provide a significant amount of cash flow. In addition, if any lender under our Credit Facility is unable to fund its commitment, our liquidity may be reduced by an amount up to the aggregate amount of such lender\u2019s commitment under our Credit Facility. Currently, no single lender in our Credit Facility has commitments representing more than 11% of our total commitments. However, if banks continue to consolidate, we may experience a more concentrated credit risk.\nCertain federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and development may be eliminated as a result of future legislation.\nAmong the changes contained in the President\u2019s Fiscal Year 2016 budget proposal, as released by the White House, is the elimination of certain U.S. federal income tax deductions and credits currently available to oil and natural gas exploration and production companies. Such proposed changes include, but are not limited to, (i) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas properties; (ii) the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs; (iii) the elimination of the deduction for certain U.S. production activities relating to oil and natural gas production; and (iv) an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. Recently, members of the U.S. Congress have considered, and in some cases proposed, these or similar changes to the existing federal income tax laws that affect oil and natural gas exploration\nand production companies. It is unclear, however, whether any such changes will be enacted or, if enacted, how soon such changes would be effective.\nThe passage of any legislation as a result of the budget proposal or any other similar change in U.S. federal income tax law could eliminate or postpone certain tax deductions that are currently available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and development, and any such change could negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCyber-attacks targeting our computer and telecommunications systems and infrastructure used by the oil and gas industry may materially impact our business and operations.\nComputers and telecommunication systems are used to conduct our exploration, development and production activities and have become an integral part of our business. We use these systems to analyze and store financial and operating data and to communicate within our company and with outside business partners. Cyber-attacks could compromise our computer and telecommunications systems and result in disruptions to our business operations, the loss or corruption of our data and proprietary information and communications interruptions. In addition, computers control oil and gas distribution systems globally and are necessary to deliver our production to market. A cyber-attack impacting these distribution systems, or the networks and infrastructure on which they rely, could damage critical production, distribution and/or storage assets, delay or prevent delivery to markets and make it difficult or impossible to accurately account for production and settle transactions. Our systems and procedures for protecting against such attacks and mitigating such risks may prove to be insufficient and such attacks could have an adverse impact on our business and operations.", "PERMNO": 91100, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "ROSE.3"}
