{"cik": "866829", "company": "HELIX ENERGY SOLUTIONS GROUP INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-02-22", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nShareholders should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information contained herein. We operate globally in challenging and highly competitive markets and thus our business is subject to a variety of risks. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing Helix. We are also subject to a variety of risks that affect many other companies generally, as well as additional risks and uncertainties not known to us or that, as of the date of this Annual Report, we believe are not as significant as the risks described below. You should be aware that the occurrence of the events described in these risk factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.\nOur business is adversely affected by low oil and gas prices, which occur from time to time in a cyclical oil and gas industry.\nOur services are substantially dependent upon the condition of the oil and gas industry, and in particular, the willingness of oil and gas companies to make capital and other expenditures for offshore exploration, development, drilling and production operations. Although our services are used for other operations during the entire life cycle of a well, when industry conditions are unfavorable such as the current environment, oil and gas companies will likely continue to reduce their budgets for expenditures on all types of operations, and will defer certain activities to the extent possible. The level of both capital and operating expenditures generally depends on the prevailing view of future oil and gas prices, which are influenced by numerous factors, including:\n\u2022\nworldwide economic activity and general economic and business conditions;\n\u2022\nsupply and demand for oil and natural gas, especially in the United States, Europe, China and India;\n\u2022\npolitical and economic uncertainty and geopolitical unrest, including regional conflicts and economic and political conditions in the Middle East and other oil-producing regions;\n\u2022\nactions taken by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (\u201cOPEC\u201d);\n\u2022\nthe availability and discovery rate of new oil and natural gas reserves in offshore areas;\n\u2022\nthe exploration and production of onshore shale oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nthe cost of offshore exploration for and production and transportation of oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nthe level of excess production capacity;\n\u2022\nthe ability of oil and gas companies to generate funds or otherwise obtain external capital for capital projects and production operations;\n\u2022\nthe sale and expiration dates of offshore leases in the United States and overseas;\n\u2022\ntechnological advances affecting energy exploration, production, transportation and consumption;\n\u2022\npotential acceleration of the development of alternative fuels;\n\u2022\nshifts in end-customer preferences toward fuel efficiency and the use of natural gas;\n\u2022\nweather conditions and natural disasters;\n\u2022\nenvironmental and other governmental regulations; and\n\u2022\ntax laws, regulations and policies.\nA prolonged period of low level of activity by offshore oil and gas operators may continue to adversely affect demand for our services and could lead to an even greater surplus of available vessels and therefore increasingly downward pressure on the rates we can charge for our services. In the short term, our customers, in reaction to negative market conditions, may continue to seek to renegotiate their contracts with us at lower rates, both during and at the expiration of the term of our contracts, to cancel earlier work and shift it to later periods, or to cancel their contracts with us even if cancellation involves their paying a cancellation fee. The extent of the impact of these conditions on our results of operations and cash flows depends on the length and severity of an unfavorable industry environment and the potential decreased demand for our services.\nThe majority of our current backlog is concentrated in a small number of long-term contracts.\nAlthough historically our service contracts were of relatively short duration, over the last several years we have been entering into longer term contracts, such as the five-year contract with BP for work in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, the four-year Petrobras contracts for well intervention services offshore Brazil and the seven-year contract for the HP I. As of December 31, 2018, the BP contract, the Petrobras contracts and the contract for the HP I represented approximately 90% of our total backlog. Due to the value at risk, any cancellation, termination or breach of those contracts would have a larger impact on our operating results and financial condition than shorter term contracts. The cancellation or termination of, or unwillingness to perform, these contracts could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur current backlog for our services may not be ultimately realized for various reasons, and our contracts may be terminated early.\nAs of December 31, 2018, backlog for our services supported by written agreements or contracts totaled $1.1 billion, of which $470 million is expected to be performed in 2019. We may incur capital costs (a substantial portion of which we expect to recover from these contracts), we may charter vessels for the purpose of performing these contracts, and/or we may forgo or not seek other contracting opportunities in light of these contracts.\nWe may not be able to perform under our contracts for various reasons giving our customers certain contractual rights under their contracts with us, which ultimately could include termination of a contract. In addition, our customers may seek to cancel, terminate, suspend or renegotiate our contracts in the event of our customers\u2019 diminished demand for our services due to industry conditions affecting our customers and their own revenues. Some of these contracts provide for a cancellation fee that is substantially less than the expected rates from the contracts. In addition, some of our customers could experience liquidity issues or could otherwise be unable or unwilling to perform under a contract, in which case a customer may repudiate or seek to cancel or renegotiate the contract. The repudiation or early cancellation or termination of our contracts by our customers, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur inability or failure to perform well operationally under our contracts could result in reduced revenues, contractual penalties, and/or ultimately, contract termination.\nOur equipment and services are very technical and the offshore environment poses its own challenges. Performing the work we do pursuant to the terms of our contracts can be difficult for various reasons, including equipment failure or reduced performance, human error, design flaws, weather, water currents or soil conditions. Failure to perform in accordance with contract specifications can result in reduced rates (or zero rates), contractual penalties, and ultimately, termination in the event of sustained non-performance. For example our services and charter agreements with Petrobras provide that Petrobras can assess fines based on a percentage of our daily operating rate for certain failures of equipment, vessels or personnel, and that ultimately Petrobras has the right to terminate its agreements with us should assessed penalties reach a certain level. Reduced revenues and/or contract termination because of our failure to perform operationally could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nA sustained period of unfavorable industry conditions could jeopardize our customers\u2019 and other counterparties\u2019 ability to perform their obligations.\nContinued uncertain industry conditions could jeopardize the ability of certain of our counterparties, including our customers, insurers and financial institutions, to perform their obligations. Although we assess the creditworthiness of our counterparties, a prolonged period of difficult industry conditions could lead to changes in a counterparty\u2019s liquidity and increase our exposure to credit risk and bad debts. In particular, our robotics business unit tends to do business with smaller customers that may not be capitalized to the same extent as larger operators. In addition, we may offer extended payment terms to our customers in order to secure contracts. These circumstances may lead to more frequent collection issues. Our financial results and liquidity could be adversely affected and we could incur losses.\nOur forward-looking statements assume that our lenders, insurers and other financial institutions will be able to fulfill their obligations under our various credit agreements, insurance policies and contracts. If any of our significant financial institutions were unable to perform under these agreements, and if we were unable to find suitable replacements at a reasonable cost, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted.\nTime chartering of vessels requires us to make ongoing payments regardless of utilization of and revenue generation from those vessels, and we may own vessels with ongoing costs that cannot be recouped if the vessels are not under contract.\nTypically, we charter our ROV support vessels under long-term time charter agreements. We also have entered into long-term charter agreements for the Siem Helix 1 and Siem Helix 2 vessels to perform work under our contracts with Petrobras. Should our contracts with customers be canceled, terminated or breached and/or we do not secure work for the chartered vessels, we are still required to make charter payments. Making those payments absent revenue generation could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, from time to time we may construct vessels and other assets for our fleet without first obtaining service contracts covering the cost of those assets. For example, our Q7000 vessel currently does not have any contracted backlog. Once constructed and in service, there are ongoing costs of owning these capital assets, including ongoing maintenance, limited manning, insurance and depreciation. Our failure to secure service contracts for vessels or other assets could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nFleet upgrade, modification, repair , dry dock and construction projects, and customer contractual acceptance of new vessels and equipment, are subject to risks, including delays, cost overruns, loss of revenue and failure to commence or maintain contracts.\nThe Q7000, our newbuild semi-submersible well intervention vessel, is under completion at the shipyard in Singapore, and equipment for the vessel is currently being installed. We also construct or make capital improvements to other pieces of equipment (such as the 15K IRS that we jointly constructed with OneSubsea). In addition, we incur significant upgrade, modification, refurbishment, repair and dry dock expenditures on our existing fleet from time to time. While some of these projects are planned, some are unplanned. Additionally, as vessels and equipment age, they are more likely to be subject to higher maintenance and repair activities. These projects are subject to risks of delay or cost overruns inherent in any large capital project.\nEstimated capital expenditures could materially exceed our planned capital expenditures. Moreover, our assets undergoing upgrades, modifications, refurbishment or repair may not earn a day rate during the period they are out of service. Any significant period of unplanned maintenance and repairs related to our vessels and other income-producing assets could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, delays in the delivery of vessels and other operating assets being constructed or undergoing upgrades, modifications, refurbishment, repair, or dry docks may result in delay in customer acceptance and/or contract commencement, resulting in a loss of revenue and cash flow to us, and may cause our customers to seek to terminate or shorten the terms of their contracts with us and/or seek delay damages under applicable late delivery clauses. In the event of termination of a contract due to late delivery, we may not be able to secure a replacement contract on favorable terms, if at all.\nBecause we have certain capital, debt and other obligations, a prolonged period of low demand and rates for our services could eventually lead to a material adverse effect on our liquidity.\nAlthough we continue to seek to reduce the level of our capital and other expenses and have raised capital by means of several securities offerings, in the event of a more prolonged period of the current industry environment, the failure of our customers to expend funds on our services or a longer period of lower rates for our services, coupled with certain fixed obligations that we have related to debt repayment, capital commitments, long-term time charter contracts for our vessels and certain other commitments related to ongoing operational activities, could eventually lead to a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial position.\nWe may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors.\nThe oilfield services business in which we operate is highly competitive. An oversupply of offshore drilling rigs coupled with a significant slowdown in industry activities results in increased competition from drilling rigs as well as substantially lower rates on work that is being performed. Several of our competitors are substantially larger and have greater financial and other resources to better withstand a prolonged period of difficult industry conditions. In order to compete for customers, these larger competitors may undercut us substantially by reducing rates to levels we are unable to withstand. If other companies relocate or acquire assets for operations in the regions in which we operate, levels of competition may increase further and our business could be adversely affected.\nOur indebtedness and the terms of our indebtedness could impair our financial condition and our ability to fulfill our debt obligations.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had $440.3 million of consolidated indebtedness outstanding. The level of indebtedness may have an adverse effect on our future operations, including:\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to refinance maturing debt or to obtain additional financing on satisfactory terms to fund our working capital requirements, capital expenditures, acquisitions, investments, debt service requirements and other general corporate requirements;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to a continued general economic downturn, competition and industry conditions, which could place us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less leveraged;\n\u2022\nincreasing our exposure to potential rising interest rates for the portion of our borrowings at variable interest rates;\n\u2022\nreducing the availability of our cash flows to fund our working capital requirements, capital expenditures, acquisitions, investments and other general corporate requirements because we will be required to use a substantial portion of our cash flows to service debt obligations;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to expand our business through capital expenditures or pursuit of acquisition opportunities due to negative covenants in senior secured credit facilities that place annual and aggregate limitations on the types and amounts of investments that we may make; and\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to use proceeds from asset sales for purposes other than debt repayment (except in certain circumstances where proceeds may be reinvested under criteria set forth in our credit agreements).\nA prolonged period of weak economic conditions and other events beyond our control may make it increasingly difficult to comply with our covenants and other restrictions in agreements governing our debt. If we fail to comply with these covenants and other restrictions, it could lead to reduced liquidity, an event of default, the possible acceleration of our repayment of outstanding debt and the exercise of certain remedies by the lenders, including foreclosure against our collateral. These conditions and events may limit our access to the credit markets if we need to replace our existing debt, which could lead to increased costs and less favorable terms, including shorter repayment schedules and higher fees and interest rates.\nLack of access to the financial markets could negatively impact our ability to operate our business and to execute our strategy.\nAccess to financing may be limited and uncertain, especially in times of economic weakness. If capital and credit markets are limited, we may be unable to refinance or we may incur increased costs and less favorable terms associated with refinancing of our maturing debt. Also, we may incur increased costs and less favorable terms associated with any additional financing that we may require for future operations. Limited access to the financial markets could adversely impact our ability to take advantage of business opportunities or react to changing economic and business conditions. Additionally, if capital and credit markets are limited, this could potentially result in our customers curtailing their capital and operating expenditure programs, which could result in a decrease in demand for our vessels and a reduction in fees and/or utilization. Certain of our customers could experience an inability to pay suppliers, including us, in the event they are unable to access financial markets as needed to fund their operations. Likewise, our suppliers may be unable to sustain their current level of operations, fulfill their commitments and/or fund future operations and obligations, each of which could adversely affect our operations. Continued lower levels of economic activity and weakness in the financial markets could also adversely affect our ability to implement our strategic objectives and dispose of non-core business assets.\nA further decline in the offshore energy services market could result in additional impairment charges.\nProlonged periods of low utilization and day rates could result in the recognition of impairment charges for our vessels and robotics assets if future cash flow estimates, based on information available to us at the time, indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable.\nOur North Sea business typically declines in winter, and bad weather in the Gulf of Mexico or North Sea can adversely affect our operations.\nMarine operations conducted in the North Sea are seasonal and depend, in part, on weather conditions. Historically, we have enjoyed our highest North Sea vessel utilization rates during the summer and fall when weather conditions are favorable for offshore operations. We typically have experienced our lowest utilization rates in the North Sea in the first quarter. As is common in the industry, we may bear the risk of delays caused by some adverse weather conditions. Accordingly, our results in any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of annual results or continuing trends.\nCertain areas in and near the Gulf of Mexico and North Sea experience unfavorable weather conditions including hurricanes and extreme storms on a relatively frequent basis. Substantially all of our facilities and assets offshore and along the Gulf of Mexico and the North Sea are susceptible to damage and/or total loss by these storms. Damage caused by high winds and turbulent seas could potentially cause us to curtail service operations for significant periods of time until damage can be assessed and repaired. Moreover, even if we do not experience direct damage from any of these weather events, we may experience disruptions in our operations because customers may curtail their offshore activities due to damage to their platforms, pipelines and other related facilities.\nThe operation of marine vessels is risky, and we do not have insurance coverage for all risks.\nVessel-based offshore services involve a high degree of operational risk. Hazards, such as vessels sinking, grounding, colliding and sustaining damage from severe weather conditions, are inherent in marine operations. These hazards can cause personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment, pollution or environmental damage, and suspension of operations. Damage arising from such occurrences may result in lawsuits asserting large claims. Insurance may not be sufficient or effective under all circumstances or against all hazards to which we may be subject. A successful liability claim for which we are not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Moreover, we cannot make assurances that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates that we consider reasonable. In some instances, certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. For example, insurance carriers require broad exclusions for losses due to war risk and terrorist acts, and limitations for wind storm damage. The current insurance on our vessels is in amounts approximating replacement value. In the event of property loss due to a catastrophic marine disaster, mechanical failure, collision or other event, insurance may not cover a substantial loss of revenue, increased costs and other liabilities, and therefore the loss of any of our assets could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur customers may be unable or unwilling to indemnify us.\nConsistent with standard industry practice, we typically obtain contractual indemnification from our customers whereby they agree to protect and indemnify us for liabilities resulting from various hazards associated with offshore operations. We can provide no assurance, however, that our customers will be willing or financially able to meet these indemnification obligations.\nOur oil and gas operations involve a high degree of operational risk, particularly risk of personal injury, damage, loss of equipment and environmental accidents.\nIn January 2019, we acquired certain currently producing oil and gas properties as part of our strategy to secure utilization for our vessels and other equipment. Engaging in oil and gas production and transportation operations subjects us to certain risks inherent in the operation of oil and gas wells, including but not limited to uncontrolled flows of oil, gas, brine or well fluids into the environment; blowouts; cratering; pipeline or other facility ruptures; mechanical difficulties or other equipment malfunction; fires, explosions or other physical damage; hurricanes, storms and other natural disasters and weather conditions; and pollution and other environmental damage; any of which could result in substantial losses to us. Although we maintain insurance against some of these risks we cannot insure against all possible losses. As a result, any damage or loss not covered by our insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nGovernment regulations may affect our business operations, including making our operations more difficult and/or costly.\nOur business is affected by changes in public policy and by federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the offshore oil and gas industry. Offshore oil and gas operations are affected by tax, environmental, safety, labor, cabotage and other laws, by changes in those laws, application or interpretation of existing laws, and changes in related administrative regulations or enforcement priorities. It is also possible that these laws and regulations may in the future add significantly to our capital and operating costs or those of our customers or otherwise directly or indirectly affect our operations. For instance, in January 2017 CBP proposed a modification or revocation of numerous prior letter rulings regarding the interpretation of the Jones Act, which would have significantly changed how foreign flag vessels could operate on the OCS. While CBP withdrew this proposal in May 2017, CBP, its parent agency, the Department of Homeland Security, or the U.S. Congress could revisit the issue. If a policy change occurred along the lines proposed by CBP in January 2017, such a new interpretation of the Jones Act could adversely impact the operations of non-coastwise qualified vessels working in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, and could potentially make it more difficult and/or costly to perform our offshore services in the area. Industry would undoubtedly challenge any such action to the extent that it seeks to limit the ability of non-coastwise qualified vessels from performing the operations they are currently permitted to perform, but such regulatory or legislative action could create the same uncertainty in the industry as the January 2017 CBP proposal did.\nTax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied. In 2017 the United States enacted significant tax reform, and certain provisions of the new law may adversely affect us. Certain members of the EU are undergoing significant changes to their tax systems, which may have an adverse effect on us. In addition, risks of substantial costs and liabilities related to environmental compliance issues are inherent in our operations. Our operations are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the generation, storage, handling, emission, transportation and discharge of materials into the environment. Permits are required for the operations of various facilities, and those permits are subject to revocation, modification and renewal. Government authorities have the power to enforce compliance with their regulations, and violations are subject to fines, injunctions or both. In some cases, those governmental requirements can impose liability for the entire cost of cleanup on any responsible party without regard to negligence or fault and impose liability on us for the conduct of others or conditions others have caused, or for our acts that complied with all applicable requirements when we performed them. It is possible that other developments, such as stricter environmental laws and regulations, and claims for damages to property or persons resulting from our operations, would result in substantial costs and liabilities. Our insurance policies and the contractual indemnity protection we seek to obtain from our customers may not be sufficient or effective to protect us under all circumstances or against all risk involving compliance with environmental laws and regulations.\nEnhanced regulations for deepwater offshore drilling may reduce the need for our services.\nExploration and development activities and the production and sale of oil and natural gas are subject to extensive federal, state, local and international regulations. To conduct deepwater drilling in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, an operator is required to comply with existing and newly developed regulations and enhanced safety standards. Before drilling may commence, the BSEE conducts many inspections of deepwater drilling operations for compliance with its regulations, including the testing of blowout preventers. Operators also are required to comply with the Safety and Environmental Management System regulations (\u201cSEMS\u201d) within the deadlines specified by the regulations, and ensure that their contractors have SEMS compliant safety and environmental policies and procedures. Additionally, each operator must demonstrate that it has containment resources that are\navailable promptly in the event of a deepwater blowout, regardless of the company or operator involved. It is expected that the BOEM and the BSEE will continue to issue further regulations regarding deepwater offshore drilling. Our business, a significant portion of which is in the Gulf of Mexico, provides development services to newly drilled wells, and therefore relies heavily on the industry\u2019s drilling of new oil and gas wells. If the issuance of permits is significantly delayed, or if other oil and gas operations are delayed or reduced due to increased costs of complying with regulations, demand for our services in the Gulf of Mexico may also decline. Moreover, if our assets are not redeployed to other locations where we can provide our services at a profitable rate, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows would be materially adversely affected.\nWe cannot predict with any certainty the substance or effect of any new or additional regulations in the United States or in other areas around the world. If the United States or other countries where our customers operate enact stricter restrictions on offshore drilling or further regulate offshore drilling and thereby increase costs and/or cause delays for our customers, and this results in decreased demand for or profitability of our services, our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nFailure to comply with anti-bribery laws could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nThe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d) and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom Bribery Act 2010 and Brazil\u2019s Clean Company Act, generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We operate in many parts of the world that have experienced corruption to some degree. We have a robust ethics and compliance program that is designed to deter or detect violations of applicable laws and regulations through the application of our anti-corruption policies and procedures, Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, training, internal controls, investigation and remediation activities, and other measures. However, our ethics and compliance program may not be fully effective in preventing all employees, contractors or intermediaries from violating or circumventing our compliance requirements or applicable laws and regulations. Failure to comply with anti-bribery laws could subject us to civil and criminal penalties, and such failure, and in some instances even the mere allegation of such failure, could create termination or other rights in connection with our existing contracts, negatively impact our ability to obtain future work, or lead to other sanctions, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows, and cause reputational damage. We could also face fines, sanctions and other penalties from authorities, including prohibition of our participating in or curtailment of business operations in certain jurisdictions and the seizure of vessels or other assets. Further, we may have competitors who are not subject to the same laws, which may provide them with a competitive advantage over us in securing business or gaining other preferential treatment.\nOur operations outside of the United States subject us to additional risks.\nOur operations outside of the United States are subject to risks inherent in foreign operations, including:\n\u2022\nthe loss of revenue, property and equipment from expropriation, nationalization, war, insurrection, acts of terrorism and other political risks;\n\u2022\nincreases in taxes and governmental royalties;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws and regulations affecting our operations, including changes in customs, assessments and procedures, and changes in similar laws and regulations that may affect our ability to move our assets in and out of foreign jurisdictions;\n\u2022\nrenegotiation or abrogation of contracts with governmental and quasi-governmental entities;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws and policies governing operations of foreign-based companies;\n\u2022\ncurrency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u2022\nglobal economic cycles;\n\u2022\nrestrictions or quotas on production and commodity sales;\n\u2022\nlimited market access; and\n\u2022\nother uncertainties arising out of foreign government sovereignty over our international operations.\nCertain countries have in place or are in the process of developing complex laws for foreign companies doing business in these countries, such as local content requirements. Some of these laws are difficult to interpret, making compliance uncertain, and others increase the cost of doing business, which may make it difficult for us in some cases to be competitive. In addition, laws and policies of the United States affecting foreign trade and taxation may adversely affect our international operations.\nOur international operations are exposed to currency devaluation and fluctuation risk.\nSince we are a global company, our international operations are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks on all contracts denominated in foreign currencies. For some of our international contracts, a portion of the revenue and local expenses is incurred in local currencies and we are at risk of changes in the exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and such currencies. In some instances, we receive payments in currencies that are not easily traded and may be illiquid. The reporting currency for our consolidated financial statements is the U.S. dollar. Certain of our assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses are denominated in other countries\u2019 currencies. Those assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses are translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rates to prepare our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and those other currencies affect the value of those items as reflected in our consolidated financial statements, even if their value remains unchanged in their original currency.\nThe loss of the services of one or more of our key employees, or our failure to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future, could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our financial results.\nOur industry has lost a significant number of experienced professionals over the years due to its cyclical nature, which is attributable, among other reasons, to the volatility in oil and gas prices. Many companies, including us, have had employee lay-offs as a result of reduced business activities in an industry downturn. Our continued success depends on the active participation of our key employees. The loss of our key people could adversely affect our operations. The delivery of our services also requires personnel with specialized skills and experience. As a result, our ability to remain productive and profitable will depend upon our ability to employ and retain skilled workers. For certain projects we may have competition for personnel with the requisite skill set, including from drilling companies.\nCybersecurity breaches or business system disruptions may adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on our information technology infrastructure and management information systems to operate and record almost every aspects of our business. Similar to other companies, we may be subject to cybersecurity breaches caused by, among other things, illegal hacking, computer viruses, phishing, malware, ransomware, or acts of vandalism or terrorism. Although we continue to refine our procedures, educate our employees and implement tools and security measures to protect against such cybersecurity risks, there can be no assurance that these measures will prevent or detect every type of attempt or attack. In addition, a cyberattack or security breach could go undetected for an extended period of time. A breach or failure of our information technology systems or networks, critical third-party systems on which we rely, or those of our customers or vendors, could result in an interruption in our operations, disruption to certain systems that are used to operate our vessels or ROVs; unplanned capital expenditures, unauthorized publication of our confidential business or proprietary information, unauthorized release of customer or employee data, theft or misappropriation of funds; violation of privacy or other laws, and exposure to litigation. Any such breach could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nCertain provisions of our corporate documents and Minnesota law may discourage a third party from making a takeover proposal.\nWe are authorized to fix, without any action by our shareholders, the rights and preferences on up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, including dividend, liquidation and voting rights. In addition, our by-laws divide the Board of Directors into three classes. We are also subject to certain anti-takeover provisions of the Minnesota Business Corporation Act. We also have employment arrangements with all of our executive officers that could require cash payments in the event of a \u201cchange of control.\u201d Any or all of the provisions or factors described above may discourage a takeover proposal or tender offer not approved by management and the Board of Directors and could result in shareholders who may wish to participate in such a proposal or tender offer receiving less for their shares than otherwise might be available in the event of a takeover attempt.", "PERMNO": 85168, "SIC": 1389, "TIC": "HLX"}
