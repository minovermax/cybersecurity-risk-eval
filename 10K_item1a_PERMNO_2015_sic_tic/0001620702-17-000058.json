Risk Factors.\nThe following pages discuss the principal risks we face. These include, but are not limited to, risks related to the Brookfield Transaction and arising from the bankruptcy of our controlling shareholder, SunEdison. Any of these risk factors could have a significant or negative effect on our businesses, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. They could also cause significant fluctuations and volatility in the trading price of our securities. Readers should not consider any descriptions of these factors to be a complete set of all potential risks and uncertainties that could affect us. These factors should be considered carefully together with the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the other reports and materials filed by us with the SEC. Furthermore, many of these risks are interrelated, and the occurrence of certain of them may in turn cause the emergence or exacerbate the effect of others. Such a combination could materially increase the severity of the impact of these risks on our businesses, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nRisks Related to the Brookfield Transaction\nThe Brookfield Transaction is subject to a number of conditions to closing, which may not be satisfied on a timely basis or at all.\nOn March 6, 2017, we entered into the Merger Agreement with affiliates of Brookfield pursuant to which a controlled subsidiary of Brookfield would acquire 100% of the outstanding equity interests in the Company. There can be no assurance that our entry into the Merger Agreement will result in the Brookfield Transaction being consummated, and speculation and uncertainty regarding the outcome of the Brookfield Transaction may adversely impact our business. Our Board has determined that the Merger Agreement is fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its stockholders and will submit the Merger Agreement to our stockholders for their consideration with the recommendation that our stockholders adopt and approve the Merger Agreement. The adoption and approval of the Merger Agreement requires (i) the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the total voting power of the outstanding shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock entitled to vote thereon and (ii) the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our Class A common stock entitled to vote thereon (excluding SunEdison, Brookfield and their respective affiliates or any person with whom any of them has formed a group). SunEdison holds a majority of the total voting power of our outstanding shares and has entered into a Voting and Support Agreement pursuant to which it has agreed to vote its shares of our Class A and Class B common stock in favor of the Merger Agreement, which was approved by the bankruptcy court overseeing the SunEdison Bankruptcy on June 7, 2017. However, there can be no assurance that the Merger Agreement will be approved by holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our Class A common stock entitled to vote thereon (excluding SunEdison, Brookfield and their respective affiliates or any person with whom any of them has formed a group). As described more fully under Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters, certain of our stockholders hold a significant number of shares of our Class A common stock and may possess the ability to significantly impact the outcome of the requisite \u201cmajority of the minority\u201d approval.\nConcurrently with the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement, SunEdison and the Company, along with certain of their respective subsidiaries, executed and delivered a Settlement Agreement, which generally resolves claims, disputes and other issues arising from the historical sponsor relationship between the Company and SunEdison, and which was approved by the bankruptcy court overseeing the SunEdison Bankruptcy on June 7, 2017. The Merger Agreement may be terminated at any time if the Settlement Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms.\nCompletion of the Brookfield Transaction under the Merger Agreement requires regulatory approvals from certain regulatory agencies, including energy regulatory agencies and antitrust authorities in South Africa, Brazil and Malaysia. In addition, completion of the Brookfield Transaction requires the settlement or termination of certain specified litigation involving the Company. While the Company has begun the process of notifying agencies and obtaining approvals and is continuing to take actions to obtain the required regulatory approvals prior to closing and to negotiate with the plaintiffs in the specified litigation, or, as appropriate, to confirm that approvals or settlement will not be required prior to closing, there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain the requisite regulatory approvals or settle or otherwise terminate the requisite litigation. Any condition, to the extent imposed, for obtaining any requisite regulatory approvals or the settlement or termination of the specified litigation could delay the completion of the Brookfield Transaction for a significant period of time or prevent it from occurring at all.\nThere is no assurance that the conditions to the completion of the Brookfield Transaction will be satisfied on a timely basis or at all. If the Brookfield Transaction is not consummated by December 6, 2017 (subject to a three-month extension under certain circumstances), the Merger Agreement may be terminated.\nIn addition, certain of our stockholders may file litigation seeking to enjoin or delay the completion of the Brookfield Transaction. We may be required to expend significant resources, including legal fees and the time and attention of our senior management, defending any such litigation. The completion of the Brookfield Transaction may be delayed pending the resolution of any such litigation and an adverse ruling in any such lawsuit may prevent the Brookfield Transaction from being consummated. We cannot assure you that a challenge to the Brookfield Transaction will not be made or that, if a challenge is made, it will not succeed.\nThe Merger Agreement contains provisions that limit the Company\u2019s ability to pursue alternatives to the Brookfield Transaction, which could discourage third parties from making a competing transaction proposal.\nThe Merger Agreement contains provisions that make it more difficult for us to sell our business to a party other than Brookfield during the period between the execution of the Merger Agreement and the closing of the Brookfield Transaction, which may discourage competing offers for a higher price or premium. These provisions include the general prohibition on our soliciting any alternative acquisition proposal or offer for a competing transaction, the requirement that we pay a termination fee of $30.0 million if the Merger Agreement is terminated in specified circumstances and the requirement that we submit the Merger Agreement to a vote of the Company\u2019s stockholders even if our Board changes its recommendation, subject to certain exceptions. Additionally, in certain circumstances if the Brookfield Transaction is not completed, we may be required to pay Brookfield an expense reimbursement fee of $8.0 million.\nThe pendency of the Brookfield Transaction and related uncertainty could cause disruptions in our business, which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results and the price of our Class A common stock.\nWe have important counterparties at every level of operations, including offtakers under our PPAs, corporate and project-level lenders, project-level minority equity investors, suppliers and other service providers. Uncertainty about the closing, timing and effect of the Brookfield Transaction may negatively affect our relationships with these counterparties due to concerns about the impact of the Brookfield Transaction on our business. These concerns may cause a counterparty to be more likely to reduce utilization of our services (or the provision of supplies or services to us) where the counterparty has flexibility in volume or duration or otherwise seek to change the terms on which it does business with us. These concerns may also cause our existing or potential new counterparties to be less likely to enter into new agreements or cause them to demand more expensive or onerous terms, credit support, collateral or other conditions. Damage to our relationships with our existing or potential new counterparties may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, including the price of our Class A common stock.\nIn addition, as a result of the announcement and pendency of the Brookfield Transaction, current and prospective employees could experience uncertainty about their future with the Company. These uncertainties may impair our ability to retain, recruit or motivate key personnel and other employees, negatively impact the productivity of our employees and result in an increase in retention costs.\nThe Merger Agreement contains provisions that limit our ability to take certain actions during the pendency of the Brookfield Transaction without the consent of Brookfield. These provisions include limitations on our ability to pursue strategic transactions, undertake project acquisitions, undertake certain financing transactions and capital expenditures, enter into material contracts, settle litigation with payments above certain thresholds, and other interim covenant restrictions. These limitations may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and prevent us from taking advantage of otherwise beneficial opportunities.\nAs a result of the announcement of the Brookfield Transaction, our Class A common stock has been trading within a narrow price range, which could limit possible returns on any new investment in our Class A common stock.\nBeginning with the first trading date following the announcement of the Brookfield Transaction, March 7, 2017, and continuing through June 13, 2017 our Class A common stock has traded within a narrow price range between $4.65 on April 18 and 19, 2017 and $5.10 on June 7, 2017. This constricted trading range is typical with respect to proposed transactions such as the Brookfield Transaction, where the trading market may perceive that the risk of one or more competing offers to purchase the Company is low and the likelihood of legal or regulatory impediments to the transaction is also low. There is a risk that our Class A common stock will continue to be impacted by the pendency of the Brookfield Transaction and may continue to trade within a narrow range until the closing of the Brookfield Transaction. Such a narrow trading range would likely limit the returns, if any, on any investment in our Class A common stock until the closing of the Brookfield Transaction or termination or expiration of the Merger Agreement.\nOur executive officers and directors may have interests that are different from, or in addition to, those of our stockholders generally.\nOur executive officers and directors may have interests in the Brookfield Transaction that are different from, or are in addition to, those of our stockholders generally. These interests include direct or indirect ownership of our Class A common stock and restricted stock units and, for executive officers, change of control and severance agreements. In addition, certain of our directors and executive officers are also directors or executive officers of TerraForm Power, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, \u201cTerraForm Power\u201d), which has also entered into a merger agreement with affiliates of Brookfield.\nRisks Related to a Failure to Complete the Brookfield Transaction. The following risk factors assume that we remain a stand-alone company except as otherwise noted.\nFailure to complete, or delays in completing, the Brookfield Transaction could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and prospects and the price of our Class A common stock.\nWe believe that the current trading price of our Class A common stock reflects some market assessment of the probability of the closing of the Brookfield Transaction. The loss of the right to receive the merger consideration payable to the holders of our Class A common stock in the event the Brookfield Transaction fails to be completed could negatively impact the price of our Class A common stock.\nIf we are unable to successfully complete the Brookfield Transaction, it would be necessary for the Company to reevaluate its strategic alternatives. Such reevaluation would likely result in a diversion of the Company\u2019s resources to focus on that reevaluation, including management\u2019s time and attention and increased legal and financial advisor fees and other costs.\nMoreover, a failure to complete the Brookfield Transaction would result in the Company operating without a sponsor for, at a minimum, the length of time required to reevaluate our strategic alternatives. Our business, including our growth strategy, was substantially dependent on our sponsor, including our sponsor\u2019s ability to obtain financing and generate sufficient cash to adequately fund its operations and on our sponsor\u2019s ability to fund the construction and development of projects to be dropped down to the Company pursuant to certain contractual arrangements. The Company would likely face difficulties strengthening its operations and acquiring new projects during the pendency of a reevaluation of strategic alternatives or period of stand-alone operations, and the Company\u2019s management and our Board may choose to prioritize stabilization of the Company\u2019s operations and determination of strategic alternatives over pursuing growth opportunities. If we are unable to complete the Brookfield Transaction, current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty and low morale about their future with the Company. This uncertainty may impair our ability to retain, recruit or motivate key personnel and other employees, negatively impact the productivity of our employees and result in an increase in retention costs.\nDepending on the circumstances surrounding the failure to complete the Brookfield Transaction, we may face increased exposure to litigation and attendant costs and we may be required to pay a termination fee of $30.0 million to Brookfield. Additionally, in certain circumstances if the Brookfield Transaction is not completed, we may be required to pay Brookfield an expense reimbursement fee of $8.0 million.\nIf we fail to complete the Brookfield Transaction, the Settlement Agreement entered into with SunEdison and certain of its affiliates in the SunEdison Bankruptcy may be terminated.\nConcurrently with the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement, SunEdison and the Company, along with certain of their respective subsidiaries, executed and delivered the Settlement Agreement, which generally resolves claims, disputes and other issues arising from the historical sponsor relationship between the Company and SunEdison. If the Merger Agreement is terminated, the Settlement Agreement may also be terminated by either party thereto. The Settlement Agreement provides for the resolution of the intercompany claims between the Company and SunEdison in connection with the SunEdison Bankruptcy in exchange for, among other things, a set allocation of the proceeds of the Brookfield Transaction being provided to SunEdison. This allocation results in a significant increase in the consideration payable to the holders of our Class A common stock and a decrease in the consideration payable to SunEdison as compared to the respective consideration they would receive on a pro rata, fully diluted basis. In the event the Settlement Agreement is terminated, there is no guarantee that the Company would be able to enter into a comparable transaction or that the Company would be able to negotiate settlement terms with equal or more favorable terms than those contained in the Settlement Agreement.\nMoreover, we believe that the resolution of the intercompany claims is a necessary prerequisite to the execution of any strategic alternative with a third party. The termination of the Settlement Agreement could negatively impact the Company\u2019s ability to engage in a change of control transaction with an alternative third party due to the uncertainty regarding the resolution of the intercompany claims in connection with the SunEdison Bankruptcy.\nIn the event that the Settlement Agreement is terminated, the Company would be forced to continue to litigate its claims in the SunEdison Bankruptcy case or renegotiate the terms of an alternative settlement agreement with SunEdison. Either option is likely to result in a drain on the Company\u2019s resources, including significant litigation costs and management\u2019s time and attention. Among the claims currently resolved by the Settlement Agreement which the Company would need to defend in the event that the Settlement Agreement is terminated are certain avoidance actions seeking to recapture payments made by SunEdison to the Company prior to SunEdison\u2019s bankruptcy filing. In the event of an unfavorable determination with respect to such claims, the Company could face significant liabilities payable to the SunEdison estate. If the Settlement Agreement is terminated, we will continue to be subject to certain risks associated with SunEdison as described more fully under \u201cRisks Related to our Relationship with SunEdison and the SunEdison Bankruptcy\u201d below.\nIf we fail to complete the Brookfield Transaction, there is no guarantee that SunEdison will be able to successfully exit its Chapter 11 bankruptcy or that SunEdison\u2019s interests in the Company, including its shares of our Class B common stock and Class B units in Global LLC, will be disposed of in a way that is favorable to the holders of the Company\u2019s Class A common stock.\nOn March 28, 2017, SunEdison submitted a disclosure statement pursuant to Section 1125 of the Bankruptcy Code for purposes of soliciting votes to accept or reject a Joint Plan of SunEdison, Inc., et al., pursuant to Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code (the \u201cPlan of Reorganization\u201d). Certain stakeholders in the bankruptcy estate of SunEdison may oppose the Plan of Reorganization and there is no assurance that the Plan of Reorganization will be approved by the requisite members of the bankruptcy estate of SunEdison or by the bankruptcy court overseeing the SunEdison Bankruptcy. SunEdison\u2019s proposed Plan of Reorganization in the SunEdison Bankruptcy case is predicated on the successful completion of the Brookfield Transaction. If we fail to complete the Brookfield Transaction, the Plan of Reorganization will not be successful and there is no guarantee that SunEdison will be able to successfully exit its Chapter 11 bankruptcy. In such an event, SunEdison\u2019s current Chapter 11 reorganization may be converted into a Chapter 7 liquidation. We continue to utilize SunEdison for certain limited business and operational services and, as such, a liquidation of SunEdison may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, if the Settlement Agreement is terminated and the Plan of Reorganization is not successfully implemented, SunEdison may seek bankruptcy court approval to transfer its shares of our Class B common stock and Class B units in Global LLC without exchanging them for shares of our Class A common stock and without seeking our approval. Such a disposition may be less favorable to our holders of Class A common stock than the Brookfield Transaction.\nRisks Related to our Relationship with SunEdison and the SunEdison Bankruptcy\nWe are transitioning away from our historical reliance on SunEdison for important corporate, project and other services, which involves management challenges and poses risks that may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have historically relied significantly on SunEdison for important corporate, project, and other services, including many management services under the Management Services Agreement (\"MSA\") (such as management, accounting, banking, treasury, administrative, regulatory and reporting functions; recommending and implementing business strategy; maintenance of books and records; calculation and payment of taxes; and preparation of audited and unaudited financial statements), as well as asset management and O&M services for most of our projects.\nSince the SunEdison Bankruptcy, we have been engaged in efforts to transition away from our historical reliance on SunEdison for corporate, project and other services, by seeking to identify alternative service providers and to establish and manage new relationships, as well as develop our own capabilities and resources in these areas. These efforts include creating a separate stand-alone organization, including, among other things, directly hiring employees and establishing our own accounting, information technology, human resources and other critical systems and infrastructure, and also include retaining third parties to provide O&M and asset management services for our power plants where we do not perform these services ourselves. However, our efforts in this regard, although designed to mitigate risks posed by the SunEdison Bankruptcy, involve a number of new risks and challenges that may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be unable to contract with substitute service providers on terms similar to those provided by SunEdison or at all. The fees of substitute service providers or the costs of performing all or a portion of the services ourselves are likely be substantially more than the fees that we currently pay under the MSA, which are equal to 2.5% of the Company\u2019s cash available for distribution to shareholders for each the years 2016, 2017 and 2018. In addition, in light of SunEdison\u2019s familiarity with our assets, a substitute service provider may not be able to provide the same level of service.\nWe may also be unable to perform the services ourselves, through hiring employees and migrating or establishing separate systems. Implementing any changes in connection with such transition may take longer than we expect, cost more than we expect, and divert management\u2019s attention from other aspects of our business. We may also incur substantial legal and\ncompliance costs in many of the jurisdictions where we operate. In addition, as we have limited experience in developing our own capabilities and resources, there is no assurance that we would ultimately be successful in our efforts in each of these areas, if at all, which could result in delays or disruptions in our business and operations.\nWe continue to rely on SunEdison for important accounting systems and services.\nPursuant to the terms of the MSA, SunEdison has historically provided the systems and personnel for our financial reporting and control processes (such as information technology, enterprise resources management and accounting systems) and we continue to rely on SunEdison for important accounting systems and services. As a result, our financial reporting and control processes continue to rely to a significant extent on SunEdison systems and personnel. We expect that this reliance will continue until the closing of the Brookfield Transaction.\nSunEdison has not performed as obligated under the MSA, in particular with respect to financial reporting and control matters. As discussed under Item 9A. Controls and Procedures below, these failures to perform have resulted in or contributed to material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. These material weaknesses and their remediation have resulted in significant consequences and costs, including fees to our external advisors and auditor, time and attention of our management, delays in our financial reporting and increased staffing. Our continued reliance on SunEdison for these important accounting systems and services may continue to result in these or other consequences and costs and have a material adverse effect on our internal control over financial reporting, the timing of our financial reporting, and our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWhile we anticipate that we will continue to rely on SunEdison for these financial reporting and control matters, we will continue to evaluate SunEdison\u2019s ability to perform these functions and the necessity of transferring control of these matters away from SunEdison. There can be no assurance that we would be able to successfully transfer these systems and services away from SunEdison or that such transfer would not result in increased costs or additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting.\nThe SunEdison Bankruptcy has resulted in project defaults that may entitle the related lenders to demand repayment, enforce their security interests or other remedies or restrict the ability of the project companies to make distributions.\nIn all six of our debt-financed projects, SunEdison is a party to a material project agreement, or is a guarantor thereof, such as being a party or guarantor to an asset management or O&M contract. The project level financing agreements for our remaining two levered power plants in India contain provisions that provide lenders with the right to accelerate debt maturity due to SunEdison\u2019s bankruptcy because SunEdison was an original sponsor of the project and/or party to certain material project agreements, such as O&M and EPC related contracts. In addition, for our three power plants in South Africa, the project level financing agreements contain events of default provisions triggered by the bankruptcy of SunEdison as a party to certain material project contracts, such as O&M and EPC related contracts.\nSuch defaults in our debt-financed projects, if not cured or waived, may entitle the related lenders to demand repayment or enforce their security interests or other remedies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Such defaults may also restrict the ability of the project companies to make distributions to us. We have received waivers and/or forbearance agreements with respect to certain of these defaults, and we are currently working with our project lenders to cure such defaults; however, no assurance can be given that such defaults will be cured in a timely manner or at all.\nHistorically, SunEdison has provided O&M and asset management services to many of our power plants under project level O&M and asset management agreements between the applicable project companies and local SunEdison affiliates. As part of our transition away from SunEdison as an O&M and asset management service provider, we have terminated all such agreements. Depending on the circumstances, we now manage our power plants ourselves or outsource our asset management and/or O&M functions in certain jurisdictions. We may not be able to adequately perform such services, or identify a qualified third-party service provider that is willing to perform such services on equal or better terms than those previously provided by SunEdison. If we are unable to adequately manage the power plants or secure third-party service providers, it could lead to defaults under the terms of project level debt contracts and other adverse consequences for our unlevered power plants. An inability to successfully manage these power plants or secure third-party service providers, and the resulting defaults and other consequences, or managing them at an excessively burdensome cost or securing third-party service providers on unfavorable terms or at higher costs, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nSunEdison was the construction contractor or module or tracker supplier for many of our power plants, and it is unlikely that we will be able to recover on any claims under those contracts or related warranties.\nSunEdison served as the prime construction contractor pursuant to engineering, procurement and construction contracts with our subsidiaries for most of our power plants acquired from SunEdison. These contracts are generally fixed price, turn-key construction contracts that include workmanship and other warranties with respect to the design and construction of the facilities that survive for a period of time after the completion of construction. These contracts or related contracts (including O&M agreements) also often include production or availability guarantees with respect to the output or availability of the facility that survive completion of construction. With respect to certain of our power plants, we also utilized SunEdison solar modules or tracker technology and obtained warranties from SunEdison, including material and workmanship warranties and output guarantees. Because of these relationships, we have existing warranty or contract claims and would likely in the future have such claims. If the Settlement Agreement becomes effective, it will permanently settle all such claims with SunEdison and we will not recover any amounts on these claims outside of the consideration received under the terms of the Settlement Agreement. Even if the Settlement Agreement does not become effective, the SunEdison Bankruptcy would reduce or eliminate our recoveries on claims under these agreements and warranties, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nSunEdison is a party to important agreements at the corporate and project levels, which have been adversely affected by the SunEdison Bankruptcy and will be terminated upon the effectiveness of the Settlement Agreement.\nAs detailed in other risk factors under \u201cRisks Related to our Relationship with SunEdison and the SunEdison Bankruptcy,\u201d we have a number of important agreements with SunEdison at the corporate and project levels. For example, SunEdison has an obligation pursuant to the Interest Payment Agreement to pay to the Company an aggregate amount equal to all of the scheduled interest on the Senior Notes up to $81.2 million in 2016, and up to an aggregate amount of $40.0 million in 2017, $30.0 million in 2018, $20.0 million in 2019 and $10.0 million in 2020, plus any interest due on any payment not remitted when due. The Settlement Agreement provides for the termination of these agreements and would result in the release of our intercompany claims against SunEdison in connection with such agreements.\nEven if the Settlement Agreement does not become effective, the SunEdison Bankruptcy has adversely affected our rights under these agreements in a number of respects. For example, the protection of the automatic stay, which arises upon the commencement of a bankruptcy case, prohibits us from terminating a contract with any of the debtor entities (which includes SunEdison) without the consent of the bankruptcy court. Similarly, the U.S. Bankruptcy Code invalidates certain clauses that permit a party to terminate an executory contract (a contract where both parties have performance remaining) based on the counterparty\u2019s financial condition, insolvency or commencement of bankruptcy proceedings. Legal proceedings to obtain relief from the automatic stay, to terminate agreements or to enforce rights under agreements can be time consuming, costly and uncertain as to outcome. SunEdison has agreed and could agree in the future to provisions in its debtor-in-possession (\"DIP\") financing that limit its ability to perform under agreements with us and that give the DIP lenders significant power over such performance.\nOur ability to recover for breach, failure to perform or rejection of contracts (particularly for prepetition claims) is likely to be limited, and may be eliminated, depending on the recoveries generally for SunEdison\u2019s creditors, due to competing claims with higher priority and the limited financial resources of SunEdison.\nThere is a risk that our assets and liabilities could be consolidated with those of SunEdison in the SunEdison Bankruptcy.\nWe believe that we have observed formalities and operating procedures to maintain our separate existence from SunEdison, that our assets and liabilities can be readily identified as distinct from those of SunEdison and that we do not rely substantially on SunEdison for funding or liquidity and will have sufficient liquidity to support our ongoing operations. Our contingency planning with respect to the SunEdison Bankruptcy has included and will include, among other things, establishing stand-alone information technology, accounting and other critical systems and infrastructure, directly hiring employees necessary to operate our business and establishing employee retention efforts, retaining replacement operation and maintenance and asset management services for our power plants from other providers where we do not perform these services ourselves and the pursuit of strategic alternatives.\nHowever, there is a risk that an interested party in the SunEdison Bankruptcy could request that the assets and liabilities of the Company be substantively consolidated with SunEdison and that the Company and/or its assets and liabilities be included in the SunEdison Bankruptcy. Substantive consolidation is an equitable remedy in bankruptcy that results in the pooling of assets and liabilities of the debtor and one or more of its affiliates solely for purposes of the bankruptcy case, including for purposes of distributions to creditors and voting on and treatment under a reorganization plan. While it has not\nbeen requested to date and we believe there is no basis for substantive consolidation in our circumstances, we cannot provide assurance that substantive consolidation will not be requested in the future or that the bankruptcy court would not consider it.\nTo the extent the bankruptcy court were to determine that substantive consolidation was appropriate under the facts and circumstances, then the assets and liabilities of any entity that was subject to the substantive consolidation order could be available to help satisfy the debt or contractual obligations of other entities. Bankruptcy courts have broad equitable powers, and as a result, outcomes in bankruptcy proceedings are inherently difficult to predict. Due to the significant liabilities of SunEdison, substantive consolidation of the Company with SunEdison and inclusion in the SunEdison Bankruptcy would impede our ability to satisfy our liabilities in the normal course of business and otherwise restrict our operations and capacity to function as a stand-alone enterprise. As a result of the foregoing, our financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016 and the related audit report include an explanatory note regarding the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe have expended and may continue to expend significant resources in connection with the SunEdison Bankruptcy.\nWe have expended significant resources on contingency planning and other matters, resulting from the SunEdison Bankruptcy. Our additional expenses include legal fees, consultant and financial advisor fees and related expenses, and it is likely that such expenses will continue during the duration of the SunEdison Bankruptcy, even following the approval of the Settlement Agreement by the bankruptcy court in the SunEdison Bankruptcy on June 7, 2017. We have also dedicated, and anticipate that we will continue to dedicate, significant internal resources and management time to addressing the consequences of the SunEdison Bankruptcy. This has reduced, and may continue to reduce, the internal time and resources available for other areas of our business and substantially increase our operating expenses.\nThe SunEdison Bankruptcy has subjected us to increased litigation risk, including claims seeking to avoid payments SunEdison made to us or transactions that we consummated with SunEdison in the period prior to the SunEdison Bankruptcy.\nThe SunEdison Bankruptcy has resulted in the Company being subject to litigation that will increase our exposure to litigation costs and divert substantial time and resources of our management. While SunEdison and the Company have entered into the Settlement Agreement, which provides for the settlement of intercompany claims in connection with the SunEdison Bankruptcy, and the bankruptcy court overseeing the SunEdison Bankruptcy approved the Settlement Agreement, there is no guarantee that the Settlement Agreement will become effective. Certain stakeholders in the bankruptcy estate of SunEdison may oppose the Plan of Reorganization and there is no assurance that the Plan of Reorganization will be approved by the requisite members of the bankruptcy estate of SunEdison or by the bankruptcy court.\nIn the event that the Settlement Agreement does not become effective, there is a risk that SunEdison or creditors acting on its behalf may bring avoidance actions against us to recover payments made to us by SunEdison or transactions that we consummated with SunEdison. On November 7, 2016, the unsecured creditors\u2019 committee in the SunEdison Bankruptcy filed a motion with the bankruptcy court seeking standing to assert against the Company, on behalf of SunEdison, avoidance claims arising from intercompany transactions between the Company and SunEdison. If the Settlement Agreement becomes effective, we expect this standing motion will be withdrawn. If the Settlement Agreement is terminated or if the standing motion is not withdrawn, the Company expects to vigorously contest this standing motion and, if standing is granted, the underlying avoidance claims.\nAdditionally, because our directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance policies covering the period through July 15, 2016, including a number of policies under which SunEdison is the named insured, are shared with SunEdison and TerraForm Power, the SunEdison Bankruptcy may limit our ability to utilize such insurance to, among other things, cover settlement costs, defense costs, and our indemnification obligations to our directors and officers. In November 2016, the unsecured creditors\u2019 committee in the SunEdison Bankruptcy filed a motion with the bankruptcy court in the SunEdison Bankruptcy seeking standing to file an action seeking a declaration that such directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance policies were property of SunEdison\u2019s bankruptcy estate, which would have the likely effect of limiting the Company\u2019s access to these policies. If we are required to make settlement payments, cover defense costs or make indemnification payments to our officers or directors in respect of matters covered by our directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance policies covering the period through July 15, 2016, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by the limited availability of directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance. Our directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance policies covering the period after July 15, 2016 are not shared with SunEdison, and we do not expect them to be affected by the SunEdison Bankruptcy.\nOur growth strategy was substantially dependent on SunEdison and the SunEdison Bankruptcy has had a negative impact on our growth and future growth.\nOur growth strategy was substantially dependent on SunEdison, including its ability to obtain financing and generate sufficient cash to adequately fund its operations, and on SunEdison\u2019s ability to fund the construction and development of Call Right Projects under the Project Investment Agreement and Support Agreement. SunEdison has breached the Project Investment Agreement, the India PSA, Support Agreement, and other agreements with respect to the Call Right Projects and we do not expect it to perform under any of them. The Settlement Agreement provides for the termination of these agreements and would result in the release of our intercompany claims against SunEdison in connection with such agreements. As a result, our growth prospects, including our ability to grow our dividend per share, have been, and may continue to be, negatively affected.\nThe SunEdison Bankruptcy may adversely affect our relationships with current or potential counterparties.\nWe have important counterparties at every level of operations, including offtakers under the PPAs, corporate and project level lenders, suppliers and service providers. The SunEdison Bankruptcy may damage our relationship with our counterparties due to concerns about the SunEdison Bankruptcy and its impact on our business. These concerns may cause counterparties to be less willing to grant waivers or forbearances if needed for other matters and more likely to enforce contractual provisions or reduce utilization of our services (or the provision of supplies or services) where the counterparty has flexibility in volume or duration. These concerns may also cause our existing or potential new counterparties to be less likely to enter into new agreements or to demand more expensive or onerous terms, credit support, security or other conditions. Damage to our existing or potential future counterparty relationships may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, including our ability to pursue growth.\nSunEdison is our controlling stockholder and exercises substantial influence over the Company; it may take actions that conflict with the interests of our other stockholders.\nSunEdison beneficially owns all of our outstanding Class B common stock. Each share of our outstanding Class B common stock entitles SunEdison to 100 votes on all matters presented to our stockholders. As a result of its ownership of our Class B common stock, SunEdison possesses approximately 98.2% of the combined voting power of our stockholders even though SunEdison only owns approximately 37.0% of total shares outstanding (inclusive of Class A common stock and Class B common stock). As a result of this ownership, SunEdison has a substantial influence on our affairs and its voting power will constitute a large percentage of any quorum of our stockholders voting on any matter requiring the approval of our stockholders. Such matters include the election of directors, the adoption of amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and approval of mergers or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. SunEdison has entered into a Voting and Support Agreement pursuant to which SunEdison has agreed to vote its shares of our Class A and Class B common stock in favor of the Brookfield Transaction. However, outside of the matters covered by the Voting and Support Agreement, SunEdison has no such contractual obligation. In the event that the Brookfield Transaction is not consummated, this concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company or discouraging others from making tender offers for our shares, which could depress the price per share a bidder might otherwise be willing to pay. In addition, SunEdison, for so long as it and its controlled affiliates possess a majority of the combined voting power, has the power, directly or indirectly, to appoint or remove all of our directors, including the members of our Conflicts Committee and all of our executive officers. SunEdison also has a right to specifically designate up to four directors to our Board until such time as SunEdison and its controlled affiliates cease to own shares representing a majority voting power in us. On November 20, 2015, SunEdison designated three directors to our board. On January 4, 2017, SunEdison designated a fourth director to our board. SunEdison has the right to remove and replace these directors at any time and for any reason. SunEdison may take actions that conflict with the interests of our other stockholders (including holders of our Class A common stock).\nIn connection with the SunEdison Bankruptcy, SunEdison has received final approval from the bankruptcy court for its DIP financing and related credit agreement. We expect SunEdison\u2019s DIP lenders will have significant influence over SunEdison\u2019s interactions with us during the SunEdison Bankruptcy due to the covenants in the DIP credit agreement. The DIP credit agreement also gives substantial authority, on behalf of management of SunEdison, over the restructuring and the relationship between SunEdison and us to the chief restructuring officer and chief executive officer of SunEdison. In connection with the SunEdison Bankruptcy, SunEdison will also be required to seek approval of the bankruptcy court prior to engaging in activities or transactions outside of the ordinary course of business, which activities or transactions could be challenged by parties in interest. The covenants in the DIP credit agreement or developments in the SunEdison Bankruptcy may lead SunEdison to take actions that conflict with the interests of the holders of our Class A common stock.\nOur organizational and ownership structure may create significant conflicts of interest that may be resolved in a manner that is not in our best interests or the best interests of holders of our Class A common stock and that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur organizational and ownership structure involves a number of relationships that may give rise to certain conflicts of interest between us and holders of our Class A common stock, on the one hand, and SunEdison, on the other hand. Historically, the personnel that manage our operations (other than our Chairman and Interim Chief Executive Officer, Peter Blackmore, our Chief Operating Officer, Tom Studebaker, and our Interim Chief Accounting Officer, David Rawden) have been employees of SunEdison and their services have been provided to the Company under the MSA or project level asset management, and O&M services agreements. SunEdison is a related party under the applicable securities laws governing related party transactions and may have interests which differ from our interests or those of holders of our Class A common stock. We have a Conflicts Committee to assist us in addressing conflicts of interest as they arise. SunEdison, for so long as it and its controlled affiliates possess a majority of our combined voting power, has the power, directly or indirectly, to appoint or remove all of our directors and committee members, including the members of our Conflicts Committee, and our executive officers. These powers have affected and may in the future affect the functioning of our Conflicts Committee. While a number of our executive officers, including our Chairman and Interim Chief Executive Officer, Peter Blackmore, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Rebecca Cranna, our Chief Operating Officer, Tom Studebaker, and our Interim Chief Accounting Officer, David Rawden, continue to serve in the same functions for TerraForm Power, most other officers and employees are employed by and are providing services exclusively to the Company.\nAny material transaction between us and SunEdison is subject to our related party transaction policy, which requires prior approval of such transaction by our Conflicts Committee. There are inherent limitations in the ability of our Conflicts Committee to help us manage conflicts of interest or perceived conflicts of interest and the various measures we have taken to address conflicts of interest, including our Conflicts Committee and our related party transaction approval policy, have not prevented stockholders from instituting stockholder derivative claims related to conflicts of interest. Regardless of the merits of these claims, we may be required to expend significant management time and financial resources in the defense thereof. Additionally, to the extent we fail to appropriately deal with conflicts of interest, or we are perceived to have failed to deal appropriately with any such conflicts, it could negatively impact our reputation and ability to raise additional funds and the willingness of counterparties to do business with us, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe 425 MW India Projects will not be completed and transferred to the Company in accordance with the India PSA, and we expect to suffer a loss as a result of our payment of the deposit for acquiring these projects.\nPursuant to the India PSA, the Company paid $231.0 million in cash to SunEdison Holdings Corporation in exchange for the 425 MW India Projects, which would be transferred to the Company upon satisfaction of certain conditions precedent. For additional information on these projects, see Item 15. Note 6 - Deposits for Acquisitions. During 2016, and beginning prior to the SunEdison Bankruptcy, the Company became aware that there was substantial risk that the 425 MW India Projects may not be completed and transferred to the Company in accordance with the India PSA.\nIn April 2016, the Company filed a verified complaint against SunEdison, SunEdison Holdings Corporation (collectively with SunEdison, the \u201cSunEdison Defendants\u201d), Ahmad Chatila, Martin Truong and Brian Wuebbels in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware (see Item 15. Note 18 - Commitments and Contingencies). The complaint asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty, breach of contract and unjust enrichment relating to the failure by SunEdison to transfer the equity interests in the 425 MW India Projects for which the Company paid $231.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. The complaint seeks various forms of relief, including a constructive trust upon the equity interests of SunEdison in the 425 MW India Projects, money damages from the defendants, restoration of the $231.0 million to the Company and such other relief as the court may deem just and proper. The claims against SunEdison have been stayed as a result of the SunEdison Bankruptcy. The individual defendants filed an answer to the complaint on June 30, 2016.\nThe Settlement Agreement includes a release by the Company of its claims against the SunEdison Defendants, including all of the Company\u2019s claims relating to the 425 MW India Projects, and if the Settlement Agreement becomes effective we will not recover any amounts on these claims outside of the consideration received under the terms of the Settlement Agreement. If the Settlement Agreement is terminated, the Company expects to continue to pursue its claims against the SunEdison Defendants. The Settlement Agreement does not include a release by the Company of its claims against the individual defendants with respect to their actions as directors and/or officers of the Company.\nThe $231.0 million paid by the Company in accordance with the India PSA is reported as a deposit for acquisitions on the Company's consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2016 and 2015. The Company determined that the deposit for acquisition of the 425 MW India Projects was impaired as of December 31, 2015, and recorded a provision for contingent loss\nof the full $231.0 million in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015. The Company also recorded a corresponding charge in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2015. The provision for contingent loss remained on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2016.\nAs described in Item 15. Note 4 - Acquisitions - Incomplete IPO Project Transfers and Dropdowns, the Third Party Sale Transaction is being conducted in connection with SunEdison\u2019s bankruptcy process and includes the 425 MW India portfolio.\nOur organizational and ownership structure is complex and has been, and continues to be, subject to increased scrutiny and negative publicity, particularly relating to changes in our senior management and Board, which may have a material adverse effect on, among other things, the value of our securities and our ability to conduct our business, as well as subject us to increased litigation risk.\nOur organizational and ownership structure is complex and has been subject to scrutiny, including inquiries from our stakeholders, litigation from stockholders and negative publicity. Negative publicity has included allegations of breaches of fiduciary duty by our Board and our executive officers, perceived conflicts of interest among us, our executive officers and our affiliates and criticism of our and our affiliates\u2019 business strategies. Our reputation may be closely related to that of SunEdison, and the reputation and public image of SunEdison has suffered as a result of its financial condition and the SunEdison Bankruptcy. Such negative publicity may have a material adverse effect on our business in a number of ways, including, among other things:\n\u2022\ncausing the trading value of our outstanding securities to diminish;\n\u2022\ndamaging our reputation and adversely affecting the willingness of counterparties to do business with us, including obtaining consents and approvals from counterparties;\n\u2022\nsubjecting us and our affiliates to increased risks of future litigation or affecting the course of our current litigation;\n\u2022\ndisrupting our ability to execute our and our affiliates\u2019 business plans, including in respect of potential transactions with our affiliates, and potentially reducing our cash available for distribution; and\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to raise capital and refinance existing obligations.\nSunEdison has pledged the shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock that it owns to its lenders under its credit facilities. If the lenders foreclose on these shares, there could be a material adverse effect on the market price of our shares of Class A common stock.\nSunEdison has pledged all of the shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock, and a corresponding amount of the Class B units of Global LLC as well as the IDRs, that SunEdison owns to SunEdison\u2019s lenders as security under its DIP financing and its first and second lien credit facilities and outstanding second lien secured notes. Foreclosure by the lenders under the first and second lien credit facilities and outstanding second lien secured notes likely will be stayed during the pendency of the SunEdison Bankruptcy. However, if SunEdison breaches certain covenants and obligations in its DIP financing, an event of default or maturity of the DIP financing could result and the lenders could exercise their right to accelerate all the debt under the DIP financing and foreclose on the pledged shares, units and IDRs. Foreclosures or transfers are subject to certain limitations in our governing documents; however, such limitations may not be enforceable against foreclosures or transfers occurring in connection with the SunEdison Bankruptcy, including foreclosures by the lenders under SunEdison\u2019s DIP financing.\nAny future sale of the shares of Class A common stock received that have been converted from Class B common stock upon foreclosure of the pledged securities or upon the sale or other disposition of SunEdison\u2019s Class B common stock could cause the market price of our Class A common stock to decline. SunEdison, through wholly owned subsidiaries, owns 61,343,054 Class B units of Global LLC, which are exchangeable (together with shares of our Class B common stock) for shares of our Class A common stock. Moreover, we may have limited ability to consent to or otherwise influence or control the ultimate purchaser or purchasers of the Class A common stock sold by SunEdison. A foreclosure on or sale of the shares of our Class B common stock and of Class B units of Global LLC\u2019s units held by SunEdison may result in a change of control. Among other potential implications, a change of control of the Company without the consent of our Revolver lenders would constitute an event of default under our Revolver and, pursuant to the indenture governing the Senior Notes, a change of control of the Company would require Global Operating LLC to offer to repurchase its outstanding Senior Notes at 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the repurchase date. Any such change of control may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAny such change of control may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCertain of our PPAs and non-recourse financing arrangements include provisions that would permit the counterparty to terminate the contract or accelerate maturity in the event SunEdison ceases, directly or indirectly, to control or own a certain percentage of our company.\nThe PPAs and non-recourse financing arrangements for our power plants in South Africa, and the financing agreements for our remaining two levered power plants in India, contain change in control provisions that provide the counterparty with a termination right or the ability to accelerate maturity in the event of a change of control without the counterparty\u2019s consent. These provisions would be triggered in the event SunEdison ceases to own, directly or indirectly, capital stock representing more than 50% of the voting power of all of our capital stock outstanding on such date, or, in some cases, if SunEdison ceases, directly or indirectly, to control or own a certain percentage of the equity, as applicable, in the applicable project company. As a result, if SunEdison ceases to control, or in some cases, own a certain percentage of the Company, whether as a result of the Brookfield Transaction, an alternative sale, foreclosure, reorganization, restructuring or other similar circumstance, in connection with the SunEdison Bankruptcy or otherwise, if appropriate consents or waivers are not obtained the counterparties could terminate such contracts or accelerate the maturity of such financing arrangements. The termination of any of our PPAs or the acceleration of the maturity of any of our non-recourse financing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf we incur material tax liabilities, distributions to holders of our Class A common stock may be reduced without any corresponding reduction in the amount of distributions paid to SunEdison or other holders of the IDRs, Class B units and Class B1 units.\nWe are entirely dependent upon distributions we receive from Global LLC in respect of the Class A units held by us for payment of our expenses and other liabilities. We must make provisions for the payment of our income tax liabilities, if any, before we can use the cash distributions we receive from Global LLC to make distributions to our Class A common stockholders. If we incur material tax liabilities, our distributions to holders of our Class A common stock may be reduced. However, the cash available to make distributions to the holders of the Class B units and IDRs issued by Global LLC (all of which are currently held by SunEdison), or to the holders of any Class B1 units that may be issued by Global LLC in connection with an IDR reset or otherwise, will not be reduced by the amount of our tax liabilities. As a result, if we incur material tax liabilities, distributions to holders of our Class A common stock may be reduced, without any corresponding reduction in the amount of distributions paid to SunEdison or other holders of the IDRs, Class B units and Class B1 units of Global LLC.\nOutside of the Settlement Agreement, our ability to terminate the MSA is limited.\nThe Settlement Agreement provides, among other things, for the termination of the MSA. In the event that the Settlement Agreement does not become effective for any reason, our ability to terminate the MSA early may be limited.\nThe MSA provides that we may terminate the agreement upon 30 days prior written notice to SunEdison upon the occurrence of any of the following: (i) SunEdison defaults in the performance or observance of any material term, condition or covenant contained therein in a manner that results in material harm to us and the default continues unremedied for a period of 30 days after written notice thereof is given to SunEdison; (ii) SunEdison engages in any act of fraud, misappropriation of funds or embezzlement that results in material harm to us; (iii) SunEdison is grossly negligent in the performance of its duties under the agreement and such negligence results in material harm to us; (iv) upon the happening of certain events relating to the bankruptcy or insolvency of SunEdison; (v) on such date as SunEdison and its affiliates no longer beneficially hold more than 50% of the voting power of our capital stock; and (vi) upon the date that SunEdison experiences a change in control. Furthermore, if we request an amendment to the scope of services provided by SunEdison under the MSA and we are not able to agree with SunEdison as to a change to the service fee resulting from a change in the scope of services within 180 days of the request, we will be able to terminate the agreement upon 30 days\u2019 prior notice to SunEdison.\nWe will not be able to terminate the agreement for any other reason, and the agreement continues in perpetuity until terminated in accordance with its terms. SunEdison has breached its obligations under the MSA, in particular with respect to financial reporting and internal control matters. However, the termination provisions upon a bankruptcy or insolvency of SunEdison are likely not enforceable, and during the pendency of the SunEdison Bankruptcy, the automatic stay may prevent us from terminating the agreement in accordance with its terms without authorization from the bankruptcy court. The MSA also includes non-compete provisions that prohibit us from engaging in certain activities competitive with SunEdison\u2019s development and construction business. The agreement provides that these non-compete provisions survive termination indefinitely. If SunEdison's performance does not meet the expectations of investors, the market price of our Class A common stock could suffer.\nAs described under the risk factor \u201cSunEdison is a party to important agreements at the corporate and project levels, which may be adversely affected by the SunEdison Bankruptcy,\u201d as a result of the SunEdison Bankruptcy, SunEdison has\nadversely affected our rights under a number of important agreements with SunEdison at the corporate and project levels in a number of respects.\nThe liability of SunEdison under the MSA is limited, and we have agreed to indemnify SunEdison against claims that it may face in connection with the MSA.\nIn the event the Brookfield Transaction is not completed or if the Settlement Agreement is terminated for any reason, we will continue to be subject to certain risks related to the MSA. Under the MSA, SunEdison will not assume any responsibility other than to provide or arrange for the provision of the services described in the MSA in good faith. In addition, under the MSA, the liability of SunEdison and its affiliates will be limited to the fullest extent permitted by law to conduct involving bad faith, fraud, willful misconduct or gross negligence or, in the case of a criminal matter, action that was known to have been unlawful. In addition, we have agreed to indemnify SunEdison to the fullest extent permitted by law from and against any claims, liabilities, losses, damages, costs or expenses incurred by an indemnified person or threatened in connection with our operations, investments and activities or in respect of or arising from the MSA or the services provided by SunEdison, except to the extent that the claims, liabilities, losses, damages, costs or expenses are determined to have resulted from the conduct in respect of which such persons have liability as described above. These protections may result in SunEdison tolerating greater risks when making decisions than otherwise would be the case. The indemnification arrangements in favor of SunEdison may also give rise to legal claims by SunEdison for indemnification from us that are adverse to us or holders of our Class A common stock.\nRisks Related to our Delayed Exchange Act Filings\nContinued delays in the filing of our periodic reports with the SEC, as well as further delays in the preparation of audited financial statements at the project level, could have a material adverse effect.\nWe are continuing our efforts to regain compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s continued listing requirements with respect to our delayed SEC periodic reports. However, due to the time and resources required to complete our delayed SEC periodic reports, including our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, and our Forms 10-Q for the first, second and third quarters of 2016, we experienced delays in our ongoing efforts to complete all steps and tasks necessary to finalize our financial statements and other disclosures required to be in this Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 and subsequent quarterly reports. There can be no assurance that our future periodic reports will not be delayed for similar reasons.\nOn March 20, 2017, we received an extension from Nasdaq until June 30, 2017 to regain compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s continued listing requirements with respect to our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, our Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2017 and our delinquency in holding our annual meeting during the year ended December 31, 2016. In the event the filing of the Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2017 or any future periodic report is delayed or if we are unable to hold our annual meeting before June 30, 2017, there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain extensions from Nasdaq to regain compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s continued listing requirements with respect to any such delayed periodic report or annual meeting. If we fail to obtain such extensions from Nasdaq, our Class A common stock would likely be delisted from the Nasdaq Global Select Market.\nThe indenture governing the Senior Notes requires the Company to file, or make publicly available, our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 and our Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2017 no later than 60 days following the date required by the SEC's rules and regulations (including extensions thereof), with a 90-day grace period upon written notice from the trustee or the requisite holders of the Senior Notes in accordance with the indenture governing the Senior Notes. If an event of default occurs under the indenture governing the Senior Notes, the trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of notes outstanding could accelerate the Senior Notes. The Company would likely not have sufficient liquidity to meet this obligation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and ability to pay dividends.\nThe delays in filing our Forms 10-K, our Forms 10-Q and related financial statements are likely to impair our ability to obtain financing and access the capital markets. For example, as a result of the delayed filing of our periodic reports with the SEC, we will not be eligible to register the offer and sale of our securities using a short-form registration statement on Form S-3 until we have timely filed all periodic reports required under the Exchange Act for one year. Should we wish to register the offer and sale of our securities to the public prior to the time that we regain eligibility to use Form S-3, our transaction costs and the amount of time required to complete financing transactions could increase. An inability to obtain financing is likely to have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow our business, acquire assets through acquisitions or optimize our portfolio and capital structure. Additionally, the delay in financial statements may reduce the comfort of the Board with approving the payment of dividends.\nAudited financial statements at the project level have also been delayed and may be delayed in the future. These delays have caused, or may cause in the future, defaults under the non-recourse financing agreements of five of our project companies. Any such defaults that are not cured or waived may entitle the lenders to the applicable project companies to demand repayment or enforce their security interests or other remedies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and ability to pay dividends. Such defaults are likely to also restrict the ability of the project companies to make distributions to us.\nRisks Related to our Business\nOur failure to achieve and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act as a public company could have a material adverse effect on our business and share price.\nPrior to completion of our IPO on August 5, 2015, we had not operated as a public company and did not have to independently comply with Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. As a public company, we are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting and to report any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and, beginning with our second annual report following our IPO (i.e., this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016), provide a management\u2019s report on internal control over financial reporting. Additionally, once we are no longer an emerging growth company, as defined by the JOBS Act, our independent registered public accounting firm will be required pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting on an annual basis. The rules governing the standards that must be met for our management to assess our internal control over financial reporting are complex and require significant documentation, testing and possible remediation.\nInternal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the entity\u2019s financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The existence of any material weakness would require management to devote significant time and incur significant expense to remediate any such material weaknesses and management may not be able to remediate any such material weaknesses in a timely manner.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we did not maintain an effective control environment attributable to certain identified material weaknesses and other control deficiencies. For additional information, see Item 9A - Controls and Procedures. These control deficiencies create a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement to the consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis, and therefore we concluded that the deficiencies represent material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, and our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2016.\nWe have developed and are in the process of implementing various measures in connection with our remediation of the material weaknesses identified in our ongoing efforts to improve our internal control over financial reporting. We cannot assure you that the measures we have taken to date, and are continuing to implement, will be sufficient to remediate the material weakness identified or avoid potential future material weaknesses.\nThe existence of material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting could result in errors in our financial statements that could require us to restate our financial statements, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and cause stockholders to lose confidence in our reported financial information, all of which could materially and adversely affect our business and stock price.\nOur ability to access the capital markets may be limited.\nOur ability to access the capital markets has been limited for reasons that are particular to the Company, including the SunEdison Bankruptcy, the delay in filing our periodic reports with the SEC, events of default under certain of our project level financing arrangements and other risks that we face. As a result of the negative impact on our business from these developments, we are currently unable to borrow additional funds and access the capital markets, including the project finance market for project level debt, on attractive terms. In some cases, these developments have affected the plans and perspectives of various market participants with whom we interact, including contractors, offtakers and financing providers; have contributed to increased uncertainty and have heightened some of the risks we face, including risks related to access to capital and liquidity; and have limited our ability to acquire additional power plants. If we are unable to raise adequate proceeds when needed to fund acquisitions or for other purposes, it would have an adverse effect on our projected cash available for distribution, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are involved in costly and time-consuming litigation and other regulatory proceedings, including the SunEdison Bankruptcy proceedings, which require significant attention from our management and involve a greater exposure to legal liability.\nWe have and continue to be involved in legal proceedings, administrative proceedings, claims and other litigation, including due to the SunEdison Bankruptcy proceedings, failed or terminated transactions and certain alleged conflicts of interest. In addition, we are named as defendants from time to time in other lawsuits and regulatory actions relating to our business, some of which may claim significant damages and we have initiated a lawsuit as a plaintiff against SunEdison and certain of its officers. SunEdison\u2019s controlling interests in the Company and the position of certain of our executive officers on the board of directors and in senior management of the Company have resulted in, and may increase the possibility of future claims of breaches of fiduciary duties including claims of conflicts of interest related to the Company. We may also be subject to litigation arising out of the SunEdison Bankruptcy, including actions to avoid payments made to us by SunEdison or transactions that we consummated with SunEdison.\nDue to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and regulatory proceedings, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings. Unfavorable outcomes or developments relating to these proceedings, or new proceeding involving similar allegations or otherwise, such as monetary damages or equitable remedies, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial position, results of operations or cash flows or limit our ability to engage in certain of our business activities. Settlement of claims could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, regardless of the outcome of any litigation or regulatory proceedings, such proceedings are often expensive, lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations and require significant attention from our management. We are currently, and may be subject in the future, to claims, lawsuits or arbitration proceedings related to matters in tort or under contracts, employment matters, securities class action lawsuits, shareholder derivative actions, breaches of fiduciary duty, conflicts of interest, tax authority examinations or other lawsuits, regulatory actions or government inquiries and investigations.\nIn the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We have become the target of such securities litigation (see Item 15. Note 18. Commitments and Contingencies), and we may become the target of additional litigation in the future, which could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. For example, certain of our stockholders may file litigation seeking to enjoin or delay the completion of the Brookfield Transaction. We may be required to expend significant resources, including legal fees and the time and attention of our senior management, defending any such litigation. The completion of the Brookfield Transaction may be delayed pending the resolution of any such litigation and an adverse ruling in any such lawsuit may prevent the Merger Agreement from being consummated.\nCurrent or future litigation or administrative proceedings relating to the operation of our power plants could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have and continue to be involved in legal proceedings, administrative proceedings, claims and other litigation relating to the operation of our power plants that arise in the ordinary course of business. Individuals and interest groups may sue to challenge the issuance of a permit for a power plant. A power plant may also be subject to legal proceedings or claims contesting the operation of the facility. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and regulatory proceedings, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings. Unfavorable outcomes or developments relating to these proceedings, such as judgments for monetary damages, injunctions or denial or revocation of permits, could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Settlement of claims could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, regardless of the outcome of any litigation or regulatory proceedings, such proceedings are often expensive, lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations and require significant attention from our management. As described in the risk factor \u201cThe SunEdison Bankruptcy has subjected us to increased litigation risk, including claims seeking to avoid payments SunEdison made to us or transactions that we consummated with SunEdison in the period prior to the SunEdison Bankruptcy,\u201d the SunEdison Bankruptcy also increases our risks in certain of these proceedings and in future litigation.\nWe may have conflicts of interest with TerraForm Power.\nActual, perceived and potential conflicts of interest may arise between us and TerraForm Power in a number of areas arising from, among other sources, current and potential shared systems, assets and services and common business opportunities, and may receive increased scrutiny as a result of overlaps among members of our management teams and boards of directors as well as the controlling interests in both companies of SunEdison.\nUntil recently, we and TerraForm Power generally had common boards of directors. Historically, we and TerraForm Power also shared common management as a result of the control of both companies by SunEdison. Four of the ten members of\nour Board currently serve on the 10-person board of directors of TerraForm Power. In addition, some of our executive officers serve as executive officers of TerraForm Power, including Peter Blackmore, our and TerraForm Power\u2019s Chairman and Interim Chief Executive Officer, and Rebecca Cranna, our and TerraForm Power\u2019s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our directors and executive officers that overlap with those of TerraForm Power owe fiduciary duties to both companies.\nAlthough conflicts between TerraForm Power and us were not expected to be significant when the companies were formed, as a result of various developments, including the Brookfield Transaction, the proposed merger and sponsorship transaction between TerraForm Power and affiliates of Brookfield and the SunEdison Bankruptcy, we have been and expect that we will continue to be presented with business decisions that will involve material interests of both companies. These decisions may relate to (i) business transactions in which both companies may have an interest, including the sharing of joint resources and service providers between the companies, (ii) the Brookfield Transaction, the proposed merger and sponsorship transaction between TerraForm Power and affiliates of Brookfield and any other decisions relating to the exploration of strategic alternatives that may involve both companies, (iii) the Settlement Agreement and any other decisions regarding the prosecution and settlement of the companies\u2019 claims against SunEdison and other third parties, and (iv) other actions we may take or not take in connection with the SunEdison Bankruptcy. In such circumstances the allocations of expected costs and benefits between us and TerraForm Power will necessarily give rise to conflicts of interest. Due to the overlapping nature of the management and boards of directors of the Company and TerraForm Power, effectively managing these actual, perceived and potential conflicts will require substantial attention, and we can provide no assurance that we will identify all relevant actual, perceived or potential conflicts or adequately address such conflicts. Further, while we will endeavor to appropriately identify and manage such conflicts, the Company, as well as its directors and executive officers, will be subject to increased risk of conflict of interest claims.\nIn addition, certain of our directors and executive officers own stock, options or restricted stock units in both companies, and these ownership interests could create actual, perceived or potential conflicts of interest when our common directors and officers are faced with decisions that could have different implications for us and TerraForm Power.\nBoard and management changes could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nDuring 2016, as a result of personnel decisions by SunEdison, the SunEdison Bankruptcy, our exploration of strategic alternatives and related developments, we have experienced a series of significant changes in the Board and our senior management. For additional information, see Item 1. Business - Recent Developments - Board of Directors and Management Changes.\nAs a result of these changes, we have experienced, and may continue to experience, disruption or difficulty in maintaining or developing our business. This could, in turn, impair our ability to execute our business strategy and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nCounterparties to our PPAs may not fulfill their obligations or may seek to terminate the PPAs early, which could result in a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nSubstantially all of the electric power generated by our current portfolio of power plants is sold under long-term PPAs with public utilities or government, commercial, or industrial end users. Payments by our offtake counterparty may be delayed, or our offtake counterparty may be unable or unwilling to make complete and timely payments. For example, the offtake counterparty of one of our wind power plants in India is delayed by approximately one year on its payments to the applicable project company. This offtake counterparty is currently making payments on overdue amounts but it may be unable or unwilling to do so in the future. In addition, certain offtake counterparties provide a substantial portion of our consolidated revenues. See Item 1. Business - Customer Concentration. If a PPA was terminated or if, for any reason, any purchaser of power under a PPA is unable or unwilling to fulfill its related contractual obligations or refuses to accept delivery of power generated thereunder and, if we are unable to enter into a new PPA on acceptable terms in a timely fashion or at all, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In the event of a delay in payment under any PPA, while we may be entitled to charge penalty interest for such delay, the delay in recovering the amounts due could nonetheless have a material adverse effect on the cash flows from, and cash available for distribution to shareholders generated by, the applicable power plants. The risk factors \u201cThe SunEdison Bankruptcy may adversely affect our relationships with current or potential counterparties\u201d and \u201cThe SunEdison Bankruptcy has resulted in project defaults that may entitle the related lenders to demand repayment, enforce their security interests or other remedies or restrict the ability of the project companies to make distributions\u201d above describe additional risks with respect to our counterparty relationships and PPAs due to the SunEdison Bankruptcy.\nThe PPAs for certain of our power plants are, and PPAs entered into with respect to our future power plants may be, subject to periodic price adjustments or require renegotiation of price terms over time. If the price terms under these PPAs fall below the initial price terms, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be materially and adversely affected.\nCertain of our PPAs or other long-term arrangements with our customers are or may be subject to price adjustments over time. For example, the PPAs for the Malaysian power plants and two Indian power plants in our portfolio provide for price term adjustments. In Malaysia, there can be adjustments to the feed-in tariffs on the total solar energy generated in a year if the Sustainable Energy Development Authority of Malaysia (\u201cSEDA\u201d) determines that the power plant has achieved cost parity (which occurs once displaced costs have increased to be equal to or greater than the feed-in tariff rate). In addition, if the total solar energy generated in a year exceeds the planned amount for that year, the rate paid for the excess energy may be a price lower than the initial feed-in tariff rate. In India, two of our PPAs in the state of Karnataka have a fixed price for the first ten years and have a reset in year 11, to be determined by the state electricity regulatory commission. As a result, we are unable to ascertain the rate that may occur in such cases. If the price under any of our PPAs is reduced below the initial feed-in tariff rate, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be materially and adversely affected.\nThere can be no assurance that the BioTherm transaction will be consummated on the timetable currently anticipated or at all.\nThere is no assurance that the BioTherm transaction will be consummated on the timetable currently contemplated or at all, or that regulatory authorities or project lenders will not attempt to impose additional terms or conditions, some of which may further delay our ability to close the BioTherm transaction on the timetable currently contemplated, prevent such closing altogether, or adversely affect the benefits we expect from such transaction. In order to consummate the BioTherm transaction, we and the seller must obtain consent from the project lenders in a timely manner. If these consents are not received, or they are not received on terms that satisfy the conditions set forth in the purchase agreement, then we and/or the seller may not be obligated to complete the BioTherm transaction. Also, we may not receive these consents in respect of the BioTherm transaction before the currently anticipated timing for closing such transaction. The failure to consummate the BioTherm transaction could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nCertain of the PPAs for the power plants that we own or may acquire in the future contain provisions that allow the offtake counterparty purchaser to terminate or buy out the power plant or require us to pay liquidated damages upon the occurrence of certain events. In addition, certain of our project financing agreements provide for acceleration upon the occurrence of such events. If these provisions are exercised, our cash available for distribution could materially decline.\nCertain of the PPAs associated with our power plants allow the offtake counterparty to terminate the PPA or receive liquidated damages in the event certain operating thresholds, performance measures or any other material terms of the PPA are breached or are not achieved within specified time periods. We are therefore subject to the risk of offtake counterparty termination or payment of damages based on such criteria. We cannot provide any assurance that PPAs containing such provisions will not be terminated or that we will not be required to pay liquidated damages with respect to power plants governed by PPAs containing such provisions. If any such PPA is terminated or any such power plant is bought out, we may not be able to enter into a replacement PPA or timely invest in a suitable replacement power plant. Any replacement PPA may be on terms less favorable to us than those in the terminated PPA, and any replacement power plant may possess economic characteristics less favorable to us than those of the power plant that was bought out. In the event a PPA is terminated, a power plant is bought out or we are required to pay liquidated damages under such provisions, it could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows until we are able to obtain a replacement PPA on similar terms, reinvest in a suitable replacement power plant or the payment of such liquidated damages ceases.\nAdditionally, certain of the project level financing agreements for power plants in our portfolio allow the lenders or investors to accelerate the repayment of the project level debt in the event that a PPA is terminated or if certain operating thresholds or performance measures are not achieved within specified time periods. We are therefore subject to the risk of lender or investor termination based on such criteria. In the event the project level debt for one or more of our power plants is accelerated under such provisions, it could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We cannot provide any assurance that financing agreements containing such provisions will not be terminated and repayments accelerated, or in the event of such termination or acceleration, that we will be able to enter into replacement financing arrangements on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nCertain of our PPAs do not include inflation-based price increases.\nCertain of the PPAs that have been entered into for our power plants and our pending BioTherm acquisition do not contain inflation-based price increase provisions. Certain of the countries in which we have operations, or that we may expand into in the future, have in the past experienced high inflation. To the extent that the countries in which we conduct our business\nexperience high rates of inflation, thereby increasing our operating costs in those countries, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenues to offset the effects of inflation, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCertain of our power plants depend on third-party service providers for O&M and/or asset management services, and we may not be able to control their work as effectively as if we performed these functions.\nWe contract with third-party service providers for O&M and/or asset management services for certain of our power plants, and we may contract with additional providers in the future to perform such services. Outsourcing these functions involves the risk that third parties may not perform to our standards, may not produce results in a timely manner or may fail to perform at all. Although we have not experienced any significant difficulties with our third-party service providers, it is possible that we could experience difficulties in the future. Certain of our power plants located in Brazil, India, South Africa and Uruguay utilize third-party service providers for O&M and/or asset management services. If these third-party service providers default on their contractual obligations to us it may: (i) cause us to default in our regulatory obligations; (ii) adversely impact the ongoing operation of our power plants; and/or (iii) temporarily reduce our capacity to generate power. Certain of our power plants may encounter difficulties in transitioning O&M and/or asset management services from the existing service provider to us or to a new third party provider, which may have a material adverse effect on the business results of our operations and performance.\nOur power plants are exposed to curtailment risks, which may reduce the return to us on those investments and adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nCertain of our power plants\u2019 generation of electricity may be curtailed without compensation due to transmission limitations or limitations on the electricity grid\u2019s ability to accommodate intermittent electricity generating sources, reducing our revenues and impairing our ability to capitalize fully on a particular assets potential.\nFor example, our Honiton wind power plants in China have experienced significant curtailment due to grid constraints, overcapacity, and falling consumer demand. Approximately 29% of potential power generation was curtailed in 2015, and approximately 40% of potential power generation was curtailed in 2016, compared to an original forecast of 21%. We expect the increased curtailment will be partially offset by enlisting eligible sites into a market trading program, which allows the power plants to sell a certain amount of power at a discounted rate. Additionally, our wind power plants in Brazil have a contracted capacity that is slightly lower than their installed capacity, as a result of which the power plants are curtailed during periods of high wind speeds in order not to surpass their contracted power. However, the loss of generation capacity due to such curtailment is generally low, and the excess of capacity generated by some turbines may be offset against the lost capacity from wind turbines that are out of service for maintenance or other reasons. There may also be extraordinary events affecting the transmission grid that may reduce the capacity of the grid, causing the curtailment of power generation. Solutions to ameliorate or eliminate curtailment with respect to our power plants may not be available or may not be effective or may be cost prohibitive to undertake and implement. Curtailment at levels above our expectations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows and our ability to pay dividends to holders of our Class A common stock.\nThere are substantial risks associated with the acquisition of renewable energy power plants.\nThe acquisition of renewable energy power plants is subject to substantial risk, including the failure to identify material problems during due diligence (for which we may not be indemnified post-closing), the risk of over-paying for assets (or not making acquisitions on an accretive basis), the ability to obtain or retain customers and, if the power plants are in new markets, the risks of entering markets where we have limited experience. While we perform due diligence on prospective acquisitions, we may not be able to discover all potential operational deficiencies in such power plants. As detailed in \u201cThe SunEdison Bankruptcy has resulted in project defaults that may entitle the related lenders to demand repayment, enforce their security interests or other remedies or restrict the ability of the project companies to make distributions\u201d above, the SunEdison Bankruptcy and its constrained liquidity further exposes us to risk in power plants where SunEdison was the EPC contractor or guarantor. For instance, we may learn of statutory liens asserted by subcontractors against power plants where SunEdison was the EPC contractor or guarantor, and our ability to recover against SunEdison in respect of payments made to such subcontractors to discharge those liens will likely be limited. In addition, our expectations for the operating performance of newly constructed power plants as well as those under construction are based on assumptions and estimates made without the benefit of operating history. However, the ability of these power plants to meet our performance expectations is subject to the risks inherent in newly constructed power plants and the construction of such facilities, including, but not limited to, degradation of equipment in excess of our expectations, system failures and outages. Future acquisitions may not perform as expected or the returns from such acquisitions may not support the financing utilized to acquire them or maintain them. Furthermore, integration and consolidation of acquisitions requires substantial human, financial and other resources and may\ndivert management\u2019s attention from our existing business concerns, disrupt our ongoing business or not be successfully integrated. As a result, the consummation of acquisitions may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may not be able to effectively identify or consummate future acquisitions on favorable terms, or at all. Additionally, even if we consummate acquisitions on terms that we believe are favorable, such acquisitions may in fact result in a decrease in cash available for distribution to holders of our Class A common stock. In addition, we may engage in asset dispositions or other transactions that result in a decrease in our cash available for distribution.\nFuture acquisition opportunities for power plants are limited. SunEdison failed to complete construction and transfer to us the Uruguay Projects, the Bora Bora Poly wind power project and the 425 MW India Projects. As a result of these failures, which stem in part from the SunEdison Bankruptcy, as well as SunEdison\u2019s failure to develop the Call Right Projects or any of the other projects in its development pipeline, we will not receive any additional power plants from SunEdison under the Project Investment Agreement, India PSA or Support Agreement. The Settlement Agreement provides for the termination of these agreements and would result in the release of our intercompany claims against SunEdison in connection with such agreements. Going forward, we will compete with other companies for future acquisition opportunities from third parties. This may increase our cost of making acquisitions or cause us to refrain from making acquisitions at all. Some of our competitors are much larger than us with substantially greater resources. These companies may be able to pay more for acquisitions and may be able to identify, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of assets than our resources permit.\nIf we are unable to identify and consummate future acquisitions, it will limit our ability to pay dividends to holders of our Class A common stock. In addition, as we continue to manage our liquidity profile, we may engage in asset dispositions, or incur additional project level debt, which may result in a decrease in our cash available for distribution.\nThe substantial decline of our stock price has significantly increased the difficulty of identifying acquisitions that we believe will be accretive to cash available for distribution per unit. Even if we consummate acquisitions that we believe will be accretive to cash available for distribution per unit, those acquisitions may in fact result in a decrease in cash available for distribution per unit as a result of incorrect assumptions in our evaluation of such acquisitions, unforeseen consequences or other external events beyond our control. Furthermore, if we consummate any future acquisitions, our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly, and stockholders will generally not have the opportunity to evaluate the economic, financial and other relevant information that we will consider in determining the application of these funds and other resources. As a result of the negative impact on our business from these developments, we no longer expect to achieve the growth rate in our dividend per Class A common share that we had been targeting. If our stock price continues to trade at current levels, we may not be able to consummate transactions that are accretive to cash available for distribution per unit or increase our dividend per share of Class A common stock.\nLaws, governmental regulations and policies supporting renewable energy, and specifically solar, wind (including tax incentives and feed-in tariffs), could change at any time, including as a result of new political leadership, and such changes may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRenewable energy power plants currently benefit from various national, provincial, state and local governmental incentives. Certain of the power plants in our portfolio rely on capital subsidies from government authorities in jurisdictions where such facilities are located. Governmental regulations and policies could be changed to provide for new rate programs that undermine the economic returns for both new and existing renewable energy power plants by charging additional, non-negotiable fixed or demand charges or other fees or reductions in the number of renewable energy power plants allowed under net metering policies. In addition, unanticipated events beyond our control, such as a change in law may require us to make improvements or other modifications to one or more of our facilities, which could have an adverse effect on our operating results. Our business could also be subject to new and burdensome interconnection processes, delays and upgrade costs or local permit and site restrictions.\nIn addition, we face risks related to potential changes in tax or other laws that may limit the benefits of solar, wind energy investment. For example, our solar power plants in Thailand currently benefit from a \u201ctax holiday\u201d granted by Thailand\u2019s Board of Investment. This incentive includes an eight-year tax holiday, customs duty exemptions and a number of other non-tax incentives. In the event that we fail to comply with the conditions of the Board of Investment certificate, there is a risk that the privileges granted therein may be revoked wholly or partially, which could result in, among other things, an increase in the rate of income tax applicable to our solar power plants in Thailand. In Brazil, certain tax benefits associated with inputs and equipment are available to construct renewable energy power plants. Most of these tax benefits have expiration dates that may or may not be extended. Also, discounts on grid tariffs available to renewable power generation projects may be revoked in the future. Without these benefits, the cost of constructing and operating renewable energy power plants would\nsignificantly increase. Government incentives provide significant support for renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind energy, and a decrease in these benefits could increase the costs of investment in solar and wind energy.\nIf any of the laws or governmental regulations or policies that support renewable energy, including solar and wind energy, change or are terminated, or if we are subject to new and burdensome laws or regulations, such changes may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, any changes to or termination of the regulations and governmental incentives discussed in detail under Item 1. Business - Government Incentives above may also significantly affect our business.\nOur ability to pay dividends is limited by the Merger Agreement.\nUnder the Merger Agreement, we are restricted from declaring or paying dividends prior to the consummation of the Brookfield Transaction. In the event that the Brookfield Transaction is not consummated and the Merger Agreement is terminated or expires, we will evaluate whether it is prudent to cause Global LLC to distribute an appropriate portion of cash to its unit holder in order to permit TerraForm Global, Inc. to pay dividends to its shareholders each quarter and to rely primarily upon external financing sources, including the issuance of debt and equity securities to fund our acquisitions and growth capital expenditures. There can be no assurance as to the size or timing of any dividend we may pay in the future.\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to operate our business, including restricting our ability to pay cash dividends or react to changes in the economy or our industry.\nWe have substantial debt outstanding, which could have important negative consequences on our financial condition, including:\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions and to the consequences of the SunEdison Bankruptcy and to our delayed financial statements;\n\u2022\nexposing us to the risk of a default on our outstanding debt;\n\u2022\nrequiring a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing our ability to pay dividends to holders of our Class A common stock or to use our cash flow to fund our operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to enter into or receive payments under long-term power sales which require credit support;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to fund operations or future acquisitions;\n\u2022\nrestricting our ability to make certain distributions with respect to our capital stock and the ability of our subsidiaries to make certain distributions to us, in light of restricted payment and other covenants in our financing agreements;\n\u2022\nexposing us to the risk of increased interest rates because certain of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest; and\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, including collateral postings, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes; and limiting our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who have less debt.\nThe Senior Notes contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to return capital to stockholders or otherwise engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interests. Covenant defaults may occur in the future under the indenture governing the Senior Notes in the event of further delays in the filing of our periodic reports with the SEC. There can be no assurance that we will be able to file our periodic reports (including our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 or any quarters thereafter) with the SEC within the periods currently required under the indenture governing the Senior Notes. A default on the Senior Notes would permit the trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of notes outstanding to accelerate the Senior Notes. The Company would likely not have sufficient liquidity to meet this obligation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and ability to pay dividends.\nOur existing agreements governing our non-recourse financing contain financial and other restrictive covenants that limit our project companies\u2019 ability to make distributions to us or otherwise engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interests. We expect any future project financings that we incur or assume will contain similar provisions. The non-recourse financing agreements generally prohibit distributions from the project entities to us unless certain specific conditions are met, including the satisfaction of certain financial ratios and the absence of defaults or events of default. Our inability to satisfy certain financial covenants or cure defaults or events of default may prevent cash distributions by the particular project companies to us, including defaults related to the SunEdison Bankruptcy or to delayed project level audits. The risks with respect to the SunEdison Bankruptcy on our project financings is further detailed in \u201cThe SunEdison Bankruptcy has resulted in\nproject defaults that may entitle the related lenders to demand repayment, enforce their security interests or other remedies or restrict the ability of the project companies to make distributions\u201d above.\nOur failure to obtain such waivers or forbearance agreements with respect to defaults or to comply with those and other covenants has resulted in (or could result in future) events of default which, if not cured or waived, may entitle the related lenders to demand repayment or enforce their security interests or other remedies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. If we are unable to make distributions from our project companies, it would likely have a material adverse effect on our ability to pay dividends to holders of our Class A common stock.\nIf our subsidiaries default on their obligations under their non-recourse indebtedness or voluntarily or involuntarily commence bankruptcy proceedings, we may be required to make payments to lenders to avoid such default or to prevent foreclosure on the collateral securing the non-recourse debt. If we are unable to or decide not to make such payments, we would lose certain of our power plants upon foreclosure.\nOur subsidiaries incur, and we expect will in the future incur, various types of non-recourse indebtedness. Non-recourse debt is repayable solely from the applicable power plant\u2019s revenues and is secured by the power plant\u2019s physical assets, major contracts, cash accounts and, in many cases, our ownership interest in the project company. Limited recourse debt is debt where we have provided a limited guarantee, and recourse debt is debt where we have provided a full guarantee, which means if our subsidiaries default on these obligations, we will be liable directly to those lenders, although in the case of limited recourse debt only to the extent of our limited recourse obligations. Currently, all of our project level indebtedness is non-recourse, however we may decide to make payments to prevent the lenders to these subsidiaries from foreclosing on the relevant collateral. Such a foreclosure could result in us losing our ownership interest in the subsidiary or in some or all of its assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. To prevent a foreclosure, we may be required to use amounts distributed by our other subsidiaries as well as other sources of available cash, reducing our cash available to execute our business plan and pay dividends to holders of our Class A common stock.\nOur ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations may be limited.\nOur primary business is to own and operate renewable energy power plants. We do not always expect to have sufficient amounts of cash on hand to operate our assets. As a result, we may need to arrange additional financing to fund a portion of our potential contingent liabilities and other aspects of our operations. Our ability to arrange additional financing, either at the corporate level or at a project level, is, and may continue to be, limited.\nOur ability to pursue additional financing is currently limited by the terms of the Merger Agreement. In the event that the Brookfield Transaction is terminated and we choose to pursue additional financing, our ability to raise such additional financing, as well as the costs of such financing, will be dependent on numerous factors, including:\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and capital market conditions;\n\u2022\ncredit availability from banks and other financial institutions;\n\u2022\ninvestor confidence in us, our partners and SunEdison, as our controlling stockholder;\n\u2022\nthe impact of the SunEdison Bankruptcy;\n\u2022\nthe impact of the failure to complete the Brookfield Transaction;\n\u2022\nuncertainty regarding the Company's future in the event that the Brookfield Transaction is terminated and the consequences of such uncertainty, including on our ability to secure financing on attractive terms or at all;\n\u2022\nour financial performance and the financial performance of our subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nour level of indebtedness and compliance with covenants in debt agreements;\n\u2022\nwhen we file our periodic reports with the SEC and complete project level financial statements;\n\u2022\nmaintenance of acceptable credit ratings or credit quality, including maintenance of the legal and tax structure of the project company upon which the credit ratings may depend;\n\u2022\nour cash flows; and\n\u2022\nprovisions of tax and securities laws that may impact raising capital.\nWe may not be successful in obtaining additional financing for these or other reasons. Furthermore, we may be unable to refinance or replace non-recourse financing arrangements or other credit facilities on favorable terms or at all upon the expiration or termination thereof. Our failure, or the failure of any of our power plants, to obtain additional capital or enter into new or replacement financing arrangements when due may constitute a default under such existing indebtedness and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCredit ratings downgrades have resulted in a negative perception of our creditworthiness, and will adversely affect our ability to raise additional financing.\nCredit ratings agencies have issued corporate and issuer credit ratings with respect to us and the Senior Notes. These ratings are used by investors (including debt investors) and other third parties in evaluating our credit risk. Credit ratings are continually revised. Our credit ratings have declined as a result of the SunEdison Bankruptcy and other risks that we face. This decline in our credit ratings will have a negative effect on our ability to raise additional equity or indebtedness in the capital markets or could adversely affect the trading prices of our Class A common stock or Senior Notes. These declines could also negatively impact the perception of our counterparties and other stakeholders regarding our ability to meet our obligations. These perceptions and concerns may also cause our existing or potential new counterparties to be less likely to enter into new agreements or to demand more expensive or onerous terms, credit support, security or conditions. Further declines in our credit ratings may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to generate revenue from certain solar and wind power plants depends on having interconnection arrangements and services.\nIf the interconnection or transmission agreement of a clean power generation asset we own or acquire is terminated for any reason, we may not be able to replace it with an interconnection or transmission arrangement on terms as favorable as the existing arrangement, or at all, or we may experience significant delays or costs in to securing a replacement. If a transmission network to which one or more of our existing power plants or a power plant we acquire is connected experiences \u201cdown time,\u201d the affected clean power generation asset may lose revenue and be exposed to non-performance penalties and claims from its customers. The owners of the network will not usually compensate electricity generators for lost income due to down time. These factors could materially affect our ability to forecast operations and negatively affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe cannot predict whether transmission facilities will be expanded in specific markets to accommodate competitive access to those markets. In addition, certain of our operating facilities\u2019 generation of electricity may be physically or economically curtailed without compensation due to transmission limitations, reducing our revenues and impairing our ability to capitalize fully on a particular facility\u2019s generating potential. Such curtailments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, economic congestion on the transmission grid (for instance, a positive price difference between the location where power is put on the grid by a clean power generation asset and the location where power is taken off the grid by the facility\u2019s customer) in certain of the power markets in which we operate may occur and we may be deemed responsible for those congestion costs. If we were liable for such congestion costs, our financial results could be adversely affected.\nWe face competition from traditional and renewable energy companies.\nThe solar and wind energy industries, and the broader clean energy industry, are highly competitive and continually evolving, as market participants strive to distinguish themselves within their markets and compete with large incumbent utilities and new market entrants. We believe that our primary competitors are the traditional incumbent utilities that supply energy to our potential customers under highly regulated rate and tariff structures. We compete with these traditional utilities primarily based on price, predictability of price and the ease with which customers can switch to electricity generated by our solar and wind power plants. If we cannot offer compelling value to our customers based on these factors, then our business will not grow. Traditional utilities generally have substantially greater financial, technical, operational and other resources than we do, and as a result may be able to devote more resources to the research, development, promotion and sale of their products or respond more quickly to evolving industry standards and changes in market conditions than we can. Traditional utilities could also offer other value-added products or services that could help them to compete with us even if the cost of electricity they offer is higher than ours. In addition, the source of a majority of traditional utilities\u2019 electricity is non-renewable, which may allow them to sell electricity more cheaply than electricity generated by our solar power plants, wind power plants, and other types of clean power generation assets we may acquire.\nWe also face competition in the energy efficiency evaluation and upgrades market and we expect to face competition in additional markets as we introduce new energy-related products and services. As the solar and wind industries grow and evolve, we will also face new competitors who are not currently in the market. Our failure to adapt to changing market conditions and to compete successfully with existing or new competitors will limit our growth and may have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects.\nThere are a limited number of purchasers of utility-scale quantities of electricity, which exposes us and our power plants to additional risk.\nSince the transmission and distribution of electricity is either monopolized or highly concentrated in most jurisdictions, there are a limited number of possible purchasers for utility-scale quantities of electricity in a given geographic location, including transmission grid operators, state and investor-owned power companies, public utility districts and cooperatives. As a result, there is a concentrated pool of potential buyers for electricity generated by our power plants, which may restrict our ability to negotiate favorable terms under new PPAs and could impact our ability to find new customers for the electricity generated by our power plants should this become necessary. Additionally, the PPAs in China, India and Thailand are in the standard form prescribed by the utilities, and accordingly we have limited or no ability to negotiate the terms of such PPAs. Furthermore, if the financial condition of these utilities and/or power purchasers deteriorated, climate change programs or other regulations to which they are currently subject and that compel them to source renewable energy supplies change, demand for electricity produced by our utility-scale facilities could be negatively impacted.\nIn addition, provisions in our power sale arrangements may provide for the curtailment of delivery of electricity for various operational reasons at no cost to the power purchaser, including preventing damage to transmission systems and for system emergencies, force majeure, safety, reliability, maintenance and other operational reasons. Such curtailment would reduce revenues earned by us at no cost to the purchaser including, in addition to certain of the general types noted above, events in which energy purchases would result in costs greater than those which the purchaser would incur if it did not make such purchases but instead generated an equivalent amount of energy (provided that such curtailment is due to operational reasons and does not occur solely as a consequence of purchaser\u2019s filed avoided energy cost being lower than the agreement rates or purchasing less expensive energy from another facility). If we cannot enter into power sale arrangements on terms favorable to us, or at all, or if the purchaser under our power sale arrangements were to exercise its curtailment or other rights to reduce purchases or payments under such arrangements, our revenues and our decisions regarding development of additional power plants may be adversely affected. The risks discussed above under \u201cThe SunEdison Bankruptcy may adversely affect our relationships with current or potential counterparties\u201d may be increased by our dependence on a limited number of purchasers.\nA significant deterioration in the financial performance of our commercial, industrial or government offtake counterparties could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe financial performance of our power plants depends in part upon the continued viability and financial stability of offtake counterparties in the utility, commercial, industrial and governmental sectors. If our utility, commercial, industrial or governmental offtake counterparties are materially and adversely affected by an economic downturn, increase in inflation or other factors, one or more of our largest customers could encounter financial difficulty, and possibly, bankruptcy. If one or more of our largest customers were to encounter financial difficulty or declare bankruptcy, they may reduce their PPA payments to us or stop them altogether.\nWe are exposed to foreign currency exchange risks because our power plants are located in foreign countries.\nWe generate substantially all of our revenues and incur a significant portion of our expenses in currencies other than U.S. dollars. Changes in economic or political conditions in any of the countries in which we operate could result in exchange rate movement, new currency or exchange controls or other restrictions being imposed on our operations or expropriation. Because our financial results are reported in U.S. dollars and we generate revenue and earnings in other currencies, the translation of those results into U.S. dollars can result in a significant increase or decrease in the amount of those revenues or earnings. To the extent that we are unable to match revenues received in foreign currencies with costs paid in the same currency, exchange rate fluctuations in any such currency could have an adverse effect on our profitability. Our debt service requirements are primarily in U.S. dollars even though substantially all of our cash flow is generated in foreign currencies, and therefore significant changes in the value of such foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar could have a negative effect on our financial condition and our ability to meet interest and principal payments on debts denominated in U.S. dollars. In addition to currency translation risks, we incur currency transaction risks whenever we or one of our facilities enters into a purchase or sales transaction using a currency other than the local currency of the transacting entity.\nGiven the volatility of exchange rates, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to effectively manage our currency transaction and/or translation risks. It is possible that volatility in currency exchange rates will have a negative effect on our financial condition or results of operations. We expect to experience economic losses and gains and negative and positive impacts on earnings as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, particularly as a result of changes in the value of the Brazilian real, Chinese yuan renminbi, Indian rupee, Malaysian ringgit, South African rand, Thai baht and other currencies.\nAdditionally, although substantially all of our revenues and a significant portion of our expenses are denominated in foreign currency, any dividends will be paid to holders of our Class A common stock in U.S. dollars. The amount of U.S. dollar\ndenominated dividends paid to our holders of our Class A common stock will therefore be exposed to currency exchange rate risk. Although we have entered into hedging arrangements to help mitigate some of this exchange rate risk, these arrangements may not be sufficient, and we may not be able to enter into hedging arrangements in the future on favorable terms. Changes in the foreign exchange rates could have a negative effect on our results of operations and may adversely affect the amount of cash dividends paid by us to holders of our Class A common stock.\nWhile we currently own only solar and wind power plants (and associated interconnecting transmission facilities), in the future we may decide to include other types of energy or transmission projects. To the extent that we expand our operations to include new business segments, our business operations may suffer from a lack of experience, which may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have limited experience in energy generation operations. As a result of this lack of experience, we may be prone to errors if we expand our power plants beyond solar and wind energy. With no direct training or experience in these areas, our management may not be fully aware of the many specific requirements related to working in industries beyond solar and wind energy generation. Additionally, we may be exposed to increased operating costs, unforeseen liabilities or risks, and regulatory and environmental concerns associated with entering new sectors of the renewable energy industry, which could have an adverse impact on our business as well as place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to more established non-solar and non-wind energy market participants. Our operations, earnings and ultimate financial success could suffer irreparable harm due to our management\u2019s lack of experience in these industries.\nOperation of power plants involves significant risks and hazards that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We may not have adequate insurance to cover these risks and hazards.\nThe ongoing operation of our facilities involves risks that include the breakdown or failure of equipment or processes or performance below expected levels of output or efficiency due to wear and tear, latent defect, design error or operator error or force majeure events, among other things. Operation of our facilities also involves risks that we will be unable to transport our product to our customers in an efficient manner due to a lack of transmission capacity. Unplanned outages of generating units, including extensions of scheduled outages, occur from time to time and are an inherent risk of our business. Unplanned outages typically increase our O&M expenses and may reduce our revenues as a result of generating and selling less power or require us to incur significant costs as a result of obtaining replacement power from third parties in the open market to satisfy our forward power sales obligations.\nOur inability to efficiently operate our power plants, manage capital expenditures and costs and generate earnings and cash flow from our asset-based businesses could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. While we maintain insurance, obtain warranties from vendors and obligate contractors to meet certain performance levels, the proceeds of such insurance, warranties or performance guarantees may not cover our lost revenues, increased expenses or liquidated damages payments should we experience equipment breakdown or non-performance by contractors or vendors.\nPower generation involves hazardous activities, including delivering electricity to transmission and distribution systems. In addition to natural risks such as earthquake, flood, lightning, hurricane, and wind, other hazards, such as fire, structural collapse and machinery failure are inherent risks in our operations. These and other hazards can cause significant personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property, plant and equipment and contamination of, or damage to, the environment and suspension of operations. The occurrence of any one of these events may result in our being named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting claims for substantial damages, including for environmental cleanup costs, personal injury and property damage and fines and/or penalties. Brazil, for example, has established strict liability and criminal liability for environmental and other damages related to the operation of electric power plants, while controlling case law often also establishes economic group liability. Any damages related to these occurrences could negatively impact our reputation, and governmental authorities could try to recover damages from the Company. We maintain an amount of insurance protection that we consider adequate but we cannot provide any assurance that our insurance will be sufficient or effective under all circumstances and against all hazards or liabilities to which we may be subject. Furthermore, our insurance coverage is subject to deductibles, caps, exclusions and other limitations. A loss for which we are not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Further, due to rising insurance costs and changes in the insurance markets, we cannot provide any assurance that our insurance coverage will continue to be available at all or at rates or on terms similar to those presently available. Any losses not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business is subject to substantial governmental regulation and may be adversely affected by changes in laws or regulations, as well as liability under, or any future inability to comply with, existing or future regulations or other legal requirements.\nOur business is subject to extensive national, provincial, state and local laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate. Compliance with the requirements under these various regulatory regimes may cause us to incur significant costs, and failure to comply with such requirements could result in the shutdown of the non-complying facility or, the imposition of liens, fines and/or civil or criminal liability.\nSubstantially all of our assets are also subject to the rules and regulations applicable to power generators generally. If we fail to comply with these mandatory reliability standards, we could be subject to sanctions, including substantial monetary penalties, increased compliance obligations and disconnection from the grid.\nLaws, governmental regulations and policies supporting renewable energy, and specifically solar and wind energy, could change at any time, including as a result of new political leadership, and such changes may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRenewable energy generation assets currently benefit from, or are affected by, various national, state and local governmental incentives and regulatory policies. If any of the laws or governmental regulations or policies that support renewable energy change, or if we are subject to new and burdensome laws or regulations, such changes may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have a limited operating history and as a result we may not operate on a profitable basis.\nWe have a relatively new portfolio of assets, including several power plants that have only recently commenced operations or that we expect will commence operations in the near future, and a limited operating history on which to base an evaluation of our business and prospects. Our prospects must be considered in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their early stages of operation, particularly in a rapidly evolving industry such as ours. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in addressing the risks we may encounter, and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nMaintenance, expansion and refurbishment of power plants involve significant risks that could result in unplanned power outages or reduced output.\nOur facilities may require periodic upgrading and improvement. Any unexpected operational or mechanical failure, including failure associated with breakdowns and forced outages, and any decreased operational or management performance, could reduce our power plants\u2019 generating capacity below expected levels, reducing our revenues and jeopardizing our ability to pay dividends to holders of our Class A common stock at forecasted levels or at all. Incomplete performance by SunEdison or other providers under O&M agreements may increase the risks of operational or mechanical failure of our facilities. Degradation of the performance of our power plants below levels provided for in the related PPAs may also reduce our revenues. Unanticipated capital expenditures associated with maintaining, upgrading or repairing our power plants may also reduce profitability.\nWe may also choose to refurbish or upgrade our power plants based on our assessment that such activity will provide adequate financial returns and key assumptions underpinning a decision to make such an investment may prove incorrect, including assumptions regarding construction costs, timing, available financing and future power prices. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nMoreover, spare parts for wind turbines and solar facilities and key pieces of equipment may be difficult to acquire or be unavailable to us. Sources of some significant spare parts and other equipment are located outside the jurisdictions in which we operate. In addition, with respect to wind power plants, from time to time we may use less well-known turbine suppliers, or may purchase wind turbines and spare parts with less established track records. If we were to experience a shortage of or inability to acquire critical spare parts we could incur significant delays in returning facilities to full operation, which could negatively impact our business financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nDevelopers of power plants depend on a limited number of suppliers of solar panels, inverters, module turbines, towers and other system components and turbines and other equipment associated with wind power plants. Any shortage, delay or component price change from these suppliers could result in construction or installation delays, which could affect the number of power plants we are able to acquire in the future.\nThere have been periods of industry-wide shortage of key components, including solar panels and wind turbines, in times of rapid industry growth. The manufacturing infrastructure for some of these components has a long lead time, requires\nsignificant capital investment and relies on the continued availability of key commodity materials, potentially resulting in an inability to meet demand for these components.\nIndia had previously considered an anti-dumping duty on solar cells and panels imported from China, Malaysia, Taiwan and the United States. While this has not been implemented, anti-dumping duties or other tariffs on solar cells or other components involved in the development of solar power plants could, in the future, be imposed in India or other jurisdictions where we operate. The imposition of such tariffs or duties could hinder or reduce future development of solar power plants in the affected markets and limit the number of solar power plants we are able to acquire in such markets.\nA shortage of key commodity materials could also lead to a reduction in the number of power plants that we may have the opportunity to acquire in the future, or delay or increase the costs of acquisitions.\nThe risks discussed above under \u201cThe SunEdison Bankruptcy may adversely affect our relationships with current or potential counterparties\u201d may be increased by our dependence on a limited number of suppliers.\nWe may incur unexpected expenses if the suppliers of components in our power plants default in their warranty obligations.\nThe solar panels, inverters, modules and other system components utilized in our solar power plants are generally covered by manufacturers\u2019 warranties, which typically range from 5 to 20 years. When purchasing wind turbines, the purchaser will enter into warranty agreements with the manufacturer which typically expire within two to five years after the turbine delivery date. In the event any such components fail to operate as required, we may be able to make a claim against the applicable warranty to cover all or a portion of the expense associated with the faulty component. However, these suppliers could cease operations and no longer honor the warranties, which would leave us to cover the expense associated with the faulty component. If we cannot make claims under warranties covering our power plants, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations and related compliance expenditures and liabilities.\nOur assets are subject to numerous and significant national, provincial, state, and local laws, and other requirements governing or relating to the environment. Our facilities could experience incidents, malfunctions and other unplanned events, such as spills of hazardous materials that may result in personal injury, penalties and property damage. In addition, certain environmental laws may result in liability, regardless of fault, concerning contamination at a range of properties, including properties currently or formerly owned, leased or operated by us and properties where we disposed of, or arranged for disposal of, waste and other hazardous materials. As such, the operation of our facilities carries an inherent risk of environmental liabilities, and may result in our involvement from time to time in administrative and judicial proceedings relating to such matters. While we have implemented environmental management programs designed to continually improve environmental, health and safety performance, we cannot assure you that such liabilities including significant required capital expenditures, as well as the costs for complying with environmental laws and regulations, will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nHarming of protected species can result in curtailment of wind power plant operations.\nThe operation of wind power plants can adversely affect endangered, threatened or otherwise protected animal species. Wind power plants, in particular, involve a risk that protected species will be harmed, as the turbine blades travel at a high rate of speed and may strike flying animals (such as birds or bats) that happen to travel into the path of spinning blades.\nOur wind power plants are known to strike and kill flying animals, and occasionally strike and kill endangered or protected species. As a result, we will observe all industry guidelines and governmentally recommended best practices to avoid harm to protected species, such as avoiding structures with perches, avoiding guy wires that may kill birds or bats in flight, or avoiding lighting that may attract protected species at night. In addition, we will attempt to reduce the attractiveness of a site to predatory birds by site maintenance (e.g., mowing, removal of animal and bird carcasses, etc.). Where possible, we will obtain permits for incidental take of protected species.\nTaking of protected species, even if unanticipated or if the species was not known to be present in the area prior to development of the plant, can result in enforcement actions and requirements to implement mitigation strategies, which may include habitat preservation efforts or curtailment of operations.\nRisks that are beyond our control, including but not limited to acts of terrorism or related acts of war, natural disasters, hostile cyber-intrusions, outbreak of infectious diseases, theft or other catastrophic events, could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur power plants, or those that we otherwise acquire in the future, may be targets of terrorist activities that could cause environmental repercussions and/or result in full or partial disruption of the facilities\u2019 ability to generate electricity. Hostile cyber-intrusions, including those targeting information systems as well as electronic control systems used at the facilities and for the related distribution systems, could severely disrupt business operations and result in loss of service to customers, as well as create significant expense to repair security breaches or system damage. Additionally, jurisdictions in which we operate have experienced political instability. Such events may negatively impact favorable regulatory frameworks and governmental incentives that currently support our power plants. If additional events such as these occur in the future, our results of operations may be negatively impacted.\nFurthermore, certain of our power plants are located in active earthquake zones. The occurrence of a natural disaster, such as an earthquake, hurricane, lightning, flood or localized extended outages of critical utilities or transportation systems, or any critical resource shortages, affecting us could cause a significant interruption in our business, damage or destroy our facilities or those of our suppliers or the manufacturing equipment or inventory of our suppliers.\nAdditionally, certain of our power plants and equipment are at risk for theft and damage. For example, we are at risk for copper wire theft, especially at our solar power plants, due to an increased demand for copper. Theft of copper wire or solar panels can cause significant disruption to our operations for a period of months and can lead to operating losses at those locations. Damage to wind turbine equipment may also occur, either through natural events such as lightning strikes that damage blades or in-ground electrical systems used to collect electricity from turbines, or through vandalism, such as gunshots into towers or other generating equipment. Such damage can cause disruption of operations for unspecified periods which may lead to operating losses at those locations.\nAny such acts, environmental repercussions or disruptions, outbreaks of infectious diseases resulting in quarantine or travel restrictions, natural disasters or theft incidents could result in a significant decrease in revenues or significant reconstruction, remediation or replacement costs, beyond what could be recovered through insurance policies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAny cyber-attack or other failure of the Company\u2019s communications and technology infrastructure and systems could have an adverse impact on the Company.\nThe Company relies on the secure storage, processing and transmission of electronic data and other information and technology systems, including software and hardware, for the efficient operation of its power plants. If the Company, its communications systems or computer hardware or software are impacted by a cyber-attack or cyber-intrusion, particularly or as part of a broader attack or intrusion by third parties, including computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber-terrorists, the Company\u2019s operations or capabilities could be interrupted or diminished and important information could be lost, deleted or stolen, which could have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s revenues and results of operations or which could cause the Company to incur unanticipated liabilities or costs and expenses to replace or enhance affected systems, including costs related to cyber-security for the Company\u2019s power plants.\nRisks Related to our International Operations\nWe operate in emerging markets and may expand our operations into countries where we currently have no presence, which subjects us to economic, social and political risks and uncertainties.\nOur portfolio consists of power plants located in Brazil, China, India, Malaysia, South Africa, Thailand, and Uruguay and we have a pending acquisition in South Africa. We may expand and diversify our existing portfolio by acquiring additional utility-scale and distributed clean generation assets located in other emerging markets in Asia, Africa and Latin America. Our operations in emerging markets involve a number of risks that are more prevalent than in developed markets. As a result, our activities are and will be subject to significant political and economic uncertainties that may adversely affect our operating financial performance. These uncertainties include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe risk of a change in renewable power pricing policies, possibly with retroactive effect;\n\u2022\npolitical, social and economic instability, including wars, acts of terrorism, political unrest, boycotts, sanctions and other business restrictions;\n\u2022\nmeasures restricting the ability of our facilities to access the grid to deliver electricity at certain times or at all;\n\u2022\nthe macroeconomic climate, including high rates of inflation, and levels of energy consumption in the countries where we have operations;\n\u2022\nthe comparative cost of other sources of energy;\n\u2022\nchanges in taxation policies and/or the regulatory environment in the countries in which we have operations, including reductions to renewable power incentive programs;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of currency controls and restrictions on repatriation of earnings and cash;\n\u2022\nforeign exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u2022\nhigh rates of inflation;\n\u2022\nprotectionist and other adverse public policies, including local content requirements, import/export tariffs, increased regulations or capital investment requirements;\n\u2022\nchanges to land use regulations and permitting requirements;\n\u2022\nlonger sales and payment cycles and great difficulty collecting accounts receivable;\n\u2022\ninability to obtain adequate financing on attractive terms and conditions;\n\u2022\nrisk of nationalization or other expropriation of private enterprises and land, including creeping regulation that reduces the value of our facilities or governmental incentives associated with renewable energy;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in timely identifying, attracting and retaining qualified technical and other personnel;\n\u2022\ndifficulty competing against competitors who may have greater financial resources and/or a more effective or established localized business presence;\n\u2022\ninternational business practices that may conflict with other customs or legal requirements to which we are subject, including anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws;\n\u2022\ndowngrading of the sovereign debt ratings of the countries in which we operate by an international rating agency;\n\u2022\ndifficulties with, and extra-normal costs of, recruiting and retaining local individuals skilled in international business operations;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in developing any necessary partnerships with local businesses on commercially acceptable terms; and\n\u2022\nbeing subject to the jurisdiction of courts other than those of the United States, including uncertainty of judicial processes and difficulty enforcing contractual agreements or judgments in foreign legal systems or incurring additional costs to do so.\nFor example, Thailand was assessed as a high political risk by AON Political Risk, a risk management, insurance and consulting firm. In May 2014, Thailand experienced a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat, following which martial law was enforced for nearly a year. A succession crisis could cause increased instability and unrest, and the government could repeal certain incentives each power plant receives under Board of Investment promotion. South Africa has recently experienced political unrest, which may continue or worsen and which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and investments in South Africa.\nIn Brazil, the economy has historically been characterized by unstable economic cycles, and the Brazilian government has exercised and continues to exercise substantial influence over many aspects of the economy. The Brazilian government has often changed monetary, taxation, credit, tariff and other policies to attempt to influence the course of the national economy. For example, the Brazilian government\u2019s actions to control inflation and other policies and regulations have often involved, among other measures, high interest rates, wage and price controls, currency devaluations, capital controls and limits on imports. Brazil\u2019s economic growth rate has declined in recent years and Brazil experienced a recession in 2015 together with increased inflation, and the recession has continued in 2016 and, so far, economic recovery has been slow in 2017. The weakening economic and political climate in Brazil has adversely affected consumer confidence and spending and the overall economic conditions in the country. Furthermore, there is currently an ongoing, high profile political corruption scandal in Brazil which has resulted in criminal charges being filed against various prominent business and political figures in Brazil. In addition, impeachment proceedings have been instituted against the president of Brazil on the grounds that the government has violated fiscal laws by using funds from state banks to cover budged shortfalls. On May 12, 2016, the president of Brazil was suspended for up to 180 days after the Brazilian Senate voted to begin an impeachment trial against her. The vice-president of Brazil took office on the same day with a new staff and is being pressured by public opinion to carry out structural reforms. On September 1, 2016, Brazilian Senate voted to permanently remove the president from office. The timing of any economic improvement in Brazil is uncertain and there can be no assurance that the economic or political conditions will not deteriorate further in the near term.\nThese uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, doing business in new international markets will require us to be able to respond to rapid changes in the particular market, legal, social and political conditions in these countries. We may not be able to timely develop and implement policies and strategies that will be effective in each international jurisdiction where we may decide to conduct business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nLand title in India can be uncertain and there is no assurance of clean title.\nThere is no central title registry for real property in India. Property records in India are generally maintained at the state and district level and are updated manually through physical records of all land-related documents and may not be available online for inspection or updated in a timely manner. This could result in property records investigations taking a significant amount of time or being inaccurate in certain respects, which may impact the ability to rely on them. Land records are often handwritten, in local languages and not legible, which makes it difficult to determine the content. In addition, land records are often in poor condition and are at times untraceable, which materially impedes the title investigation process. Further, improperly executed, unregistered or insufficiently stamped conveyance instruments in a property\u2019s chain of title, unregistered encumbrances in favor of third parties, rights of adverse possessors, ownership claims of family members of prior owners or third parties, or other defects that a purchaser may not be aware of, can affect the title to a property. As a result, potential disputes or claims regarding title to the land on which power plants are developed or used for operations, or will be constructed in the future, may arise.\nRisks associated with any changes in Brazil's current sector regulatory framework and to the conditions applicable to the authorization to explore and wind energy generation projects.\nThe Brazilian federal government has been implementing policies that have a comprehensive impact on the Brazilian energy sector and, in particular, the electricity sector. As part of the restructuring of the industry, Law No. 10,848/2004, known as the New Industry Model Law, introduced a new regulatory framework for the Brazilian electricity industry. This regulatory structure has undergone several changes over the past years, and may be subject to further changes depending on the increase or decrease of energy prices and the political situation in Brazil.\nAuthorizations for the exploration of wind power projects are granted by the federal government. However, such authorizations are temporary and may be revoked at any time by the competent authority on the grounds of public interest and upon prior law providing authorization; and the corresponding compensation may be lower than the investments made. These authorizations may be renewed at the government's discretion.\nNon-compliance with any regulatory provision in connection with the exploration of the wind power projects may subject the relevant project companies and/or subsidiaries to penalties by ANEEL, which may range from a warning to a penalty corresponding to a percentage of annual revenues (up to 2%) or even revocation of the authorization granted by such agency.\nRenewable power generation projects in Brazil, including the projects owned by the Company, are normally structured in separate special purpose vehicles in order to take advantage of regulatory incentives, which also result in more favorable tax treatment. Regulatory and tax authorities may challenge that structure in the future, which may increase the taxes that the Company is required to pay or otherwise cause an increase in costs.\nThe grid tariffs paid by our Brazilian projects are defined by ANEEL and may vary in the future. In February 2017, ANEEL issued new regulations providing for the inclusion of compensation to certain transmission companies in the calculation of grid tariffs, which could cause a substantial increase in grid tariffs.\nThe revenues from our Brazilian projects depend on the timely accounting and settling of the power market by the CCEE. When authorities issue new regulations or change existing regulations, negatively affected parties may file lawsuits and obtain injunctions staying the accounting and settling of power market transactions with respect to those parties, which could impact the payment of revenues to our Brazilian projects by the CCEE.\nCertain of our PPAs contain joint and several liability between holding companies and operational companies.\nIn Brazil, certain of our PPAs in the government regulated market have offtake counterparties that are special purpose entities under the control of the legal entities that participate in the government auctions. If such a special purpose entity fails to deliver the commitments under the government auction rules, the controlling entity that participated in the auction is jointly and severally liable for all obligations and liabilities arising from the government auction and the applicable PPA. Therefore, liability is not isolated to a specific power plant simply by operating the power plants under a separate legal entity. Significant potential liabilities could arise from: (i) the delay in any of the milestones for the implementation of the power plants; (ii) subject to certain related obligations, the delay in recovering the value or delivery of the performance bond; and (iii) the failure to satisfy all the qualification requirements under the applicable government auction rules and the applicable PPA. The failure to comply with government auction milestones may also trigger enforcement of bonds (participation and performance), payment of fines and suspension from participating in any public auction for up to two years. There is no limit on the amount and kind of losses and damages covered under the government auction rules and the applicable PPA. Therefore, damages could potentially include the loss of profits and consequential damages.\nChanging laws, rules and regulations and legal uncertainties in India may adversely affect our business and operations.\nThe business and operations of our power plants located in India are governed by various laws and regulations, such as the Electricity Act, 2003, National Electricity Policy, 2005 and National Tariff Policy, 2006, corporate, environmental and labor laws and other legislation enacted by the Indian government and the relevant state governments in India. The business and financial performance of our Indian operations could be adversely affected by any change in laws or interpretations of existing, or the promulgation of new laws, rules and regulations applicable to our Indian operations. For example, the Indian government recently adopted a new company law framework, which, among other things, imposed significant and new corporate governance requirements, accounting policies and audit matters and certain spending requirements for corporate social responsibility activities in the event a company\u2019s net worth or turnover meets the prescribed thresholds. The Indian government also recently adopted new legislation to facilitate the acquisition of land in India, which may affect our Indian subsidiaries, including provisions stipulating restrictions on acquisition of certain types of agricultural land and compensation, rehabilitation and resettlement of affected people residing on such acquired land. The Indian government is also undertaking an overhaul of the existing indirect tax regime with the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax (\u201cGST\u201d), which is likely to be implemented from July 1, 2017. While the generation and sale of electricity is not subject to GST, capital goods and services used in the energy sector will be subject to GST. Currently, tax concessions and exemptions, both at the central and state level, are available on specified goods and services which are used in the energy sector. However, the GST regime is generally intended to trim such exemptions and concessions, and so the effect on the renewable energy sector may be significant. There can be no assurance that the Indian government or any state government in India will not implement new regulations and policies that will require our Indian subsidiaries to obtain additional approvals and licenses or impose onerous requirements and conditions on their operations. Any such changes and the related uncertainties with respect to the implementation of regulations may have a material adverse effect on our Indian power plants and our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCredit market risks in the Indian renewable energy project financing sector\nA significant portion of finance to achieve India\u2019s renewable energy target will need to be from foreign investors and, in that context, a key concern is the requirement for a currency hedge to protect against the risk of devaluation. Currently market based currency hedging in India is very expensive.\nAnother key issue that affects credit markets is the Indian state offtaker risk. The distribution companies in the past have delayed payments to project developers, which has severely affected the viability of renewable energy projects . Consequently, a considerable number of projects have come under financial strain, with developers failing to meet their debt service obligations. Despite securing favorable orders from electricity regulatory commissions on tariff payments, distribution companies have continued to delay these tariff payments.\nFurther, the absence of attractive payment security mechanisms to support government power procurement increases offtaker risk. Under the PPAs entered into by the government entities, payment security mechanisms are either absent or not implemented, even if included in the PPA.\nWith the objective of improving the operational and financial efficiency of state-owned distribution companies, in 2015, the Indian government launched the Ujwal Discom Assurance Yojana (the UDAY scheme). The states participating in the UDAY scheme are required to assume over 75% of the debt of their distribution companies by way of a grant over a period of two years. Over 25 states in India have already signed up for UDAY scheme, with almost all the major distribution companies in the country covered. The Indian government has also been exploring innovative credit enhancement tools such as a partial credit guarantee mechanism to improve the credit rating of project companies, a payment security mechanism to address offtaker risk, and a U.S. dollar tariff regime to reduce the currency risk of renewable energy projects.\nAdditionally, the recently issued draft guidelines for procurement of power through competitive bidding route for both wind energy as well as solar energy have detailed provisions for payment security mechanisms, including issuance of letters of credit for unpaid bills and payment security fund by distribution companies in favor of the project developers. The procurer may also choose to provide legally enforceable state government guarantees. However, the final guidelines have not yet been issued for both sectors.\nGrid Curtailment Risk\nWith growing penetration of renewable energy in the main grid, risk of power evacuation is a critical concern for the industry in India. Unavailability of grid infrastructure, or in some cases the inability of existing assets to absorb the additional capacity leads to delays in commissioning or partial commissioning of projects. Even with the introduction of \u201cplug and play\u201d solar parks, the evacuation risk continues to be placed on the developer. Although the Government of India has started massive grid infrastructure upgradation drive to integrate and smoothen the renewable energy in the system, it is believed that the future\nrisk of curtailment of power due to grid congestion especially in high renewable penetration areas, can upset project cash flows and return expectations for the renewable energy projects.\nWe do not own a controlling equity interest in some of the power plants in our portfolio, and in the future we may acquire certain assets in which we have limited control, or no control, over management decisions. As a result, our ability to control management decisions and other significant matters at these power plants may be limited and our interests in such power plants may be subject to transfer or other related restrictions.\nWe do not own a controlling equity interest in our power plants in Malaysia, and we do not own 100% of the equity interests in our power plants in South Africa and Thailand and one power plant located in India, and we may not own a controlling equity interest in power plants in these and other countries, due to PPA restrictions or local law ownership requirements. In the future, we may acquire additional power plants in which we do not own a controlling equity interest. In such cases, we will seek to exert a degree of influence with respect to the management and operation of the power plants by negotiating to obtain positions on management committees or other governance rights. However, we may not always succeed in such negotiations.\nA third party owns a majority of the equity interests in our Malaysia power plants. Provisions of the charter documents of Fortune 11 provide us with the right to appoint all of the board of directors; however, with respect to Corporate Season and Silverstar, we have the right to appoint only half of the board of directors, and unanimous approval of the full board is required on certain matters. In South Africa, third parties own a minority interest in each of our power plants due to requirements under local law and the applicable PPAs. While a majority of the board of directors of each project company in South Africa is appointed by the Company, the unanimous approval of directors appointed by the minority shareholders is required for certain actions, including transactions between the project companies and affiliates of the Company. In Thailand, SunEdison continues to own a majority of the equity interests in the NPS Star and WXA power plants, while the Company holds a controlling voting interest, as well as substantially all of the economic interests, in these power plants. In India, a minority interest in our Brakes power plant is owned by a third party.\nWe may be dependent on our co-venturers to operate assets in which we do not own 100% of the equity interests. Our co-venturers may not have the level of experience, technical expertise, human resources management and other attributes necessary to operate these assets optimally. In addition, conflicts of interest may arise in the future between us and our stockholders, on the one hand, and our co-venturers, on the other hand. Further, disagreements or disputes between us and our co-venturers could result in litigation, which could increase our expenses and potentially limit the time and effort our officers and directors are able to devote to our business. The approval of co-venturers also may be required for us to receive distributions of funds from assets or to sell, pledge, transfer, assign or otherwise convey our interest in such assets. Alternatively, our co-venturers may have rights of first refusal or rights of first offer in the event of a proposed sale or transfer of our interests in such assets. These restrictions may limit the price or interest level for our interests in such assets, in the event we want to sell such interests.\nIn addition, we may seek to acquire assets in the future in which we own less than a majority of the related interests. In these investments, we may seek to exert a degree of influence with respect to the management and operation of assets in which we own less than a majority of the interests by negotiating to obtain positions on management committees or to receive certain limited governance rights, such as rights to veto significant actions. However, we may not always succeed in such negotiations, and we may be dependent on our co-venturers to operate such assets. Our co-venturers may not have the level of experience, technical expertise, human resources management and other attributes necessary to operate these assets optimally. In addition, conflicts of interest may arise in the future between us and our stockholders, on the one hand, and our co-venturers, on the other hand, where our co-venturers\u2019 business interests are inconsistent with our interests and those of our stockholders. Further, disagreements or disputes between us and our co-venturers could result in litigation, which could increase our expenses and potentially limit the time and effort our officers and directors are able to devote to our business.\nThe approval of co-venturers also may be required for us to receive distributions of funds from assets or to sell, pledge, transfer, assign or otherwise convey our interest in such assets. Alternatively, our co-venturers may have rights of first refusal or rights of first offer in the event of a proposed sale or transfer of our interests in such assets. These restrictions may limit the price or interest level for our interests in such assets, in the event we want to sell such interests.\nOur failure to comply with South Africa\u2019s renewable energy program could have a material adverse effect on South African power plants.\nSouth Africa\u2019s renewable energy program requires all renewable energy power plants to satisfy a number of social and economic development requirements that are complex and expensive to implement. Any failure to comply with these social and economic development requirements can result in annual penalties payable to the South African Department of Energy or, in\ncases of severe non-compliance, termination of the PPA. In general, these requirements relate to the attainment of black economic empowerment, local economic development, and socio-economic development objectives. In addition, South Africa\u2019s renewable energy program\u2019s economic development requirements fit within the broader framework of the South African government\u2019s empowerment program currently being implemented through the Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment Act and the Codes of Good Practice on Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (\u201cBEE\u201d). These laws recognize two distinct mechanisms for the achievement of BEE objectives-compliance with codes of good practice, which have already been issued, and compliance with industry-specific transformation charters. One component of BEE is achieving a certain percentage of shareholdings by historically disadvantaged South Africans in South African businesses. Other components include procuring goods and services from black-owned businesses or from businesses that have earned good BEE scores, making contributions to charitable organizations and to small and medium sized majority black-owned businesses and achieving certain levels of black South African employment. Compliance with the codes and applicable charters are not enforced through civil or criminal sanction, but compliance will have an effect on our ability to secure contracts in the public and private sectors. If we acquire additional power plants located in South Africa, but are unable to comply with the requirements of the renewable energy program or achieve applicable BEE objectives, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and cash available for distribution to shareholders.\nLabor disputes and the labor laws could have a material adverse effect on the operation and financial performance of South African power plants.\nAlthough there is a history of positive and constructive engagement with labor unions in South Africa in recent years, there have been periods during which the various stakeholders are unable to agree on dispute resolution processes resulting in significant labor disputes and disruptive labor activities. Although we expect to contract with third-parties for the O&M of our South African power plants and not hire local employees for such facilities, any such power plants will nonetheless be at risk of its operations being disrupted for indefinite periods due to labor strikes and other labor disputes related to the parties from whom we contract operating and maintenance services. Significant labor disruptions may have a material adverse effect on the operations and financial results and condition of our South African power plants.\nThe operating results of our power plants in China may be adversely affected by changes in governmental policies that currently subsidize renewable energy.\nThe Chinese government has enacted a series of financial incentives designed to promote the development of solar and wind facilities. Most importantly, the feed-in tariff program currently provides that solar power plants are eligible to receive increased tariffs in an amount in excess of the benchmark tariff received by local desulfurized coal-fired generating units. The amount of the tariff to be paid to the power plant is established by the government based on a number of factors that are designed to make the power plant economically viable. The operating results of a power plant would be adversely affected in the event the government reduced the tariff payable to one or more of our power plants. There can be no assurance that the Chinese government will not elect to reduce or eliminate the ongoing tariff payments to our power plants in China.\nPursuant to the Chinese government\u2019s Renewable Energy Law, all electrical power generated from clean and renewable energy sources is required to be purchased by the grid company provided that on-grid technical standards have been complied with and required approvals have been obtained. Nevertheless, solar and wind power plants have periodically experienced periods of curtailment by the grid company due to a lack of infrastructure and transmission capacity. Curtailment results in reduced tariff payments to the power plant as the facility is only entitled to receive payment for energy delivered to the grid companies. Our power plants in China have experienced and may continue to experience periodic reductions in revenue due to curtailments attributable to limitations on the electricity grids served by these power plants.\nChinese solar and wind power plants typically enter into a \u201cframework\u201d PPA with a power grid company with an initial term typically ranging from three to five years. These framework PPAs do not necessarily specify any volume or price obligations on the part of the offtake counterparty purchaser. The solar and wind facilities and the power grid company will further enter into short-term agreements under the framework PPA, which are subject to automatic annual renewals. The terms of these annual supplemental agreements are subject to change to the extent the government changes its tariff rate. As a result, our power plants in China will likely not have any long-term contractual protection on the price at which they may sell the power they generate or on the amount of power they may sell to the grid company. The Chinese government is under no obligation to keep the subsidized tariff rates in effect for the foreseeable future, and therefore the profitability of solar and wind facilities in China is subject to change with little or no advance notice.\nChanges in foreign withholding taxes could adversely affect our results of operations.\nDistributions of earnings and other payments, including interest, to us from our power plants may be subject to withholding taxes imposed by the jurisdiction in which the project companies are formed or operating.\nAny such withholding taxes will reduce the amount of after-tax cash we can receive. In addition, we are subject to risks that foreign countries may restrict distributions from the project companies or impose additional withholding taxes or otherwise tax our foreign income. If distributions are restricted, those withholding taxes are increased or additional foreign taxes are imposed, the amount of after-tax cash we receive will be further reduced. For additional discussion of risks related to taxation, see Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to Taxation.\nUnder renewable energy programs in certain of the countries in which we operate, renewable energy producers are required to contract with a single offtake counterparty resulting in concentrated counterparty risk.\nUnder South Africa\u2019s renewable energy program, for example, the only offtake counterparty of electricity produced by renewable energy producers is Eskom, which is the country\u2019s largest state-owned power utility that currently generates approximately 95% of South Africa\u2019s electricity. As a result, material counterparty credit risk resides in a single public utility and not multiple local utilities. In April 2017, Standard & Poor\u2019s and Fitch Ratings downgraded South Africa\u2019s credit rating to non-investment grade status. Eskom\u2019s credit ratings have declined in recent years and Standard & Poor\u2019s has downgraded Eskom\u2019s credit rating to a negative outlook. We can provide no assurances that its credit profile will not continue to deteriorate. Under its renewable energy program, the South African government guarantees the payment of Eskom\u2019s obligations under its PPAs with renewable energy producers in defined circumstances, and in 2014 the National Treasury of South Africa announced a support package for Eskom approved by the Cabinet of South Africa. We can provide no assurance that the South African government will be able to honor its guarantee of Eskom\u2019s obligations or that the support package approved by the National Treasury of South Africa will be sufficient in assisting Eskom in fulfilling its obligation under our PPAs. For more information, see Item 1. Business - Government Incentives - South Africa. If Eskom were to default on its performance of obligations under the applicable PPA for our South African power plants, and the South African government did not fulfill its guarantee, it may have a material adverse effect on the operations, financial results and condition of our South African power plants.\nOur international operations require us to comply with anti-corruption laws and regulations of the United States government and various non-U.S. jurisdictions.\nWe operate on a global basis with power plants, offices or activities on five continents. Doing business in multiple countries requires us and our subsidiaries to comply with the laws and regulations of the United States government and various non-U.S. jurisdictions. Our failure to comply with these rules and regulations may expose us to liabilities. These laws and regulations may apply to us, our subsidiaries, individual directors, officers, employees and agents, and those of SunEdison, and may restrict our operations, trade practices, investment decisions and partnering activities. In particular, our non-U.S. operations are subject to United States and foreign anti-corruption laws and regulations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (\u201cFCPA\u201d). The FCPA prohibits United States companies and their officers, directors, employees and agents acting on their behalf from corruptly offering, promising, authorizing or providing anything of value to foreign officials for the purposes of influencing official decisions or obtaining or retaining business or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment. The FCPA also requires companies to make and keep books, records and accounts that accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets and to maintain a system of adequate internal accounting controls. As part of our business, we deal with state-owned business enterprises, the employees and representatives of which may be considered foreign officials for purposes of the FCPA. Additionally, we may expose ourselves to FCPA or similar violations through new acquisitions if our due diligence processes are unable to uncover or detect existing violations of applicable anti-corruption laws. As a result, business dealings between our or SunEdison\u2019s employees and any such foreign official could expose the Company to the risk of violating anti-corruption laws even if such business practices may be customary or are not otherwise prohibited between the Company and a private third party. Violations of these legal requirements are punishable by criminal fines and imprisonment, civil penalties, disgorgement of profits, injunctions, debarment from government contracts as well as other remedial measures. We have established policies and procedures designed to assist us and our personnel in complying with applicable United States and non-U.S. laws and regulations; however, we cannot assure you that these policies and procedures will completely eliminate the risk of a violation of these legal requirements, and any such violation (inadvertent or otherwise) could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in local policies regarding high interest rates may affect the results of our operations.\nOur power plants are located in countries, such as Brazil, that have traditionally adopted a monetary policy that maintains high interest rates in order to offset inflation. These monetary policies can inhibit economic growth and reduce industrial power consumption. As a result, future investments in power generation may be limited due to lower market prices for electricity than currently expected.\nUnder Brazilian law, we are strictly liable for any damages resulting from inadequate supply of electricity to the grid, and our contracted insurance policies may not fully cover such damages.\nUnder Brazilian law, we are strictly liable for direct and indirect damages resulting from the operation of power generation plants, such as abrupt interruptions or disturbances arising from the generation, distribution or transmission systems. Accordingly, we may be held liable for such damages even if we were not at fault. As a result of the inherent uncertainty involved in these matters, we do not maintain any provisions in relation to potential damage, and these interruptions or disturbances may not be covered by our insurance policies or may exceed the coverage limits of such policies. Accordingly, if we are found liable of damages in a material amount, there could be a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations to a greater degree than those claims where we have recorded reserve provisions.\nNegative public or community response to renewable energy facilities could adversely affect construction of our facilities.\nNegative public or community response to solar, wind and other renewable energy facilities, could adversely affect our ability to acquire and operate our facilities. Our experience is that such opposition subsides over time after renewable energy facilities are completed and are operating, but there are cases where opposition, disputes and even litigation continue into the operating period and could lead to curtailment of a facility or other facility modifications.\nThe seasonality of our operations may affect our liquidity.\nWe will need to maintain sufficient financial liquidity to absorb the impact of seasonal variations in energy production or other significant events. Our principal sources of liquidity are cash generated from our operating activities, the cash retained by us for working capital purposes out of the gross proceeds of financing activities as well as our borrowing capacity under our Revolver, subject to the conditions required to draw under our Revolver. Our quarterly results of operations may fluctuate significantly for various reasons, mostly related to economic incentives and weather patterns.\nFor instance, the amount of electricity and revenues generated by our solar power plants is dependent in part on the amount of sunlight, or irradiation, where the assets are located. Due to shorter daylight hours in winter months which results in less irradiation, the generation produced by these facilities will vary depending on the season. The electricity produced and revenues generated by a wind power plant depend heavily on wind conditions, which are variable and difficult to predict. Operating results for wind power plants vary significantly from period to period depending on the wind conditions during the periods in question. Additionally, to the extent more of our power plants are located in the northern or southern hemisphere, overall generation of our entire asset portfolio could be impacted by seasonality. Further, time-of-day pricing factors vary seasonally which contributes to variability of revenues. In addition, in India, Malaysia and Thailand, the operation of power plants may be impacted by the monsoon season, which generally lasts from May through September. As a result, we expect our portfolio of power plants to generate the lowest amount of electricity during the third quarter of each year. We therefore expect our revenue and cash available for distribution to be lower during the third quarter of each year.\nIf we fail to adequately manage the fluctuations in the timing of our power plants, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially affected. The seasonality of our energy production may create increased demands on our working capital reserves and borrowing capacity under our Revolver during periods where cash generated from operating activities are lower. In the event that our working capital reserves and borrowing capacity under our Revolver are insufficient to meet our financial requirements, or in the event that the restrictive covenants in our Revolver restrict our access to such facilities, we may require additional equity or debt financing to maintain our solvency. Additional equity or debt financing may not be available when required or available on commercially favorable terms or on terms that are otherwise satisfactory to us, in which event there may be a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nThe production of wind energy depends heavily on suitable wind conditions. If wind conditions are unfavorable or below our estimates, our electricity production, and therefore our revenue, may be substantially below our expectations.\nThe electricity produced and revenues generated by a wind power plant depend heavily on wind conditions, which are variable and difficult to predict. Operating results for wind power plants vary significantly from period to period depending on the wind conditions during the periods in question. We have based our decisions about which sites to develop in part on the findings of long-term wind and other meteorological studies conducted in the proposed area, which measure the wind\u2019s speed, prevailing direction and seasonal variations. Actual wind conditions at these sites, however, may not conform to the measured data in these studies and may be affected by variations in weather patterns, including any potential impact of climate change. Therefore, the electricity generated by our wind power plants may not meet our anticipated production levels or the rated capacity of the turbines located there, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In some quarters the wind resources at our operating wind power plants, while within the range of our long-term estimates, have varied from the averages we expected. If the wind resources at a facility are below the average level we expect, our rate of return for the facility would be below our expectations and we would be adversely affected. Projections of wind resources also\nrely upon assumptions about turbine placement, interference between turbines and the effects of vegetation, land use and terrain, which involve uncertainty and require us to exercise considerable judgment. We or our consultants may make mistakes in conducting these wind and other meteorological studies. Any of these factors could cause our development sites to have less wind potential than we expected, or to cause us to develop our sites in ways that do not optimize their potential, which could cause the return on our investment in these wind power plants to be lower than expected.\nIf our wind energy assessments turn out to be wrong, our business could suffer a number of material adverse consequences, including:\n\u2022\nour energy production and sales may be significantly lower than we predict;\n\u2022\nour hedging arrangements may be ineffective or more costly;\n\u2022\nwe may not produce sufficient energy to meet our commitments to sell electricity and, as a result, we may have to buy electricity on the open market to cover our obligations or pay damages; and\n\u2022\nour wind power plants may not generate sufficient cash flow to make payments of principal and interest as they become due on the notes and our non-recourse debt, and we may have difficulty obtaining financing for future wind power plants.\nIf we are deemed to be an investment company, we may be required to institute burdensome compliance requirements and our activities may be restricted, which may make it difficult for us to complete strategic acquisitions or affect combinations.\nIf we are deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the \u201cInvestment Company Act\u201d), our business would be subject to applicable restrictions under the Investment Company Act, which could make it impractical for us to continue our business as contemplated.\nWe believe our company is not an investment company under Section 3(b)(1) of the Investment Company Act because we are primarily engaged in a non-investment company business, and we intend to conduct our operations so that we will not be deemed an investment company. However, if we were to be deemed an investment company, restrictions imposed by the Investment Company Act, including limitations on our capital structure and our ability to transact with affiliates, could make it impractical for us to continue our business as contemplated.\nRisks Inherent in an Investment in TerraForm Global, Inc.\nWe may not be able to pay comparable or growing cash dividends to holders of our Class A common stock in the future.\nThe amount of our cash available for distribution principally depends upon the amount of cash we generate from our operations, which will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on, among other things:\n\u2022\nthe adverse consequences of the SunEdison Bankruptcy, including our transition away from reliance on SunEdison for management, corporate and accounting services, employees, critical systems and information technology infrastructure and the operation and maintenance of our power plants and the failure of SunEdison to perform substantially as obligated under its agreements with us, including the Interest Payment Agreement;\n\u2022\nrisks related to the Brookfield Transaction described under \u201cRisks Related to the Brookfield Transaction.\u201d\n\u2022\nour ability to file our periodic reports with the SEC and complete project level financial statements in a timely manner;\n\u2022\ndefaults or potential defaults arising under the indenture governing the Senior Notes and in our project level financing agreements and the resulting impact on our power plants, litigation or other claims against us arising from the SunEdison Bankruptcy, and our relationships with key counterparties and the other risks described under \u201cRisks Related to our Relationship with SunEdison and the SunEdison Bankruptcy,\u201d\n\u2022\nrisks related to our failure to satisfy the requirements of Nasdaq, which could result in a delisting of our common stock;\n\u2022\nour ability to complete our pending acquisition within contemplated timetables, or at all;\n\u2022\nour ability to integrate acquired assets and realize the anticipated benefits of these acquired assets;\n\u2022\nthe willingness and ability of the counterparties to our offtake agreements to fulfill their obligations under such agreements;\n\u2022\nprice fluctuations and termination provisions related to our offtake agreements;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully identify, evaluate and consummate acquisitions;\n\u2022\ngovernment regulation, including compliance with regulatory and permit requirements and changes in market rules, rates, tariffs and environmental laws;\n\u2022\noperating and financial restrictions placed on us and our subsidiaries related to agreements governing our indebtedness and other agreements of certain of our subsidiaries generally;\n\u2022\nour ability to borrow additional funds and access the capital markets, as well as our substantial indebtedness and the possibility that we may incur additional indebtedness going forward;\n\u2022\nour ability to compete against traditional and renewable energy companies;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in foreign exchange rates;\n\u2022\nhazards customary to the power production industry and power generation operations such as unusual weather conditions, catastrophic weather-related or other damage to facilities, unscheduled generation outages, maintenance or repairs, interconnection problems or other developments, environmental incidents, or electric transmission constraints and the possibility that we may not have adequate insurance to cover losses as a result of such hazards;\n\u2022\nrestrictions contained in our debt agreements (including our project level financings and the indenture governing the Senior Notes);\n\u2022\nour ability to expand into new business segments or new geographies; and\n\u2022\nour ability to operate our businesses efficiently, manage capital expenditures and costs tightly, manage litigation, manage risks related to international operations and generate earnings and cash flow from our asset-based businesses in relation to our debt and other obligations.\nAs a result of all these factors, we cannot guarantee that we will have sufficient cash generated from operations to pay a specific level of cash dividends to holders of our Class A common stock. Furthermore, holders of our Class A common stock should be aware that the amount of cash available for distribution depends primarily on our cash flow, and is not solely a function of profitability, which is affected by non-cash items. We may incur other expenses or liabilities during a period that could significantly reduce or eliminate our cash available for distribution and, in turn, impair our ability to pay dividends to holders of our Class A common stock during the period. We are a holding company, and our ability to pay dividends on our Class A common stock is limited by restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to us, including restrictions under the terms of the agreements governing project level financing. Our project level financing agreements generally prohibit distributions to us unless certain specific conditions are met, including the absence of defaults and the satisfaction of financial ratios. The indenture governing the Senior Notes also restricts our ability to declare and pay dividends if an event of default has occurred and is continuing or if the payment of the dividend would result in an event of default. Further, the Merger Agreement restricts our ability to pay dividends during the pendency of the Brookfield Transaction.\nTo the extent we issue additional equity securities in connection with any acquisitions or growth capital expenditures, the payment of dividends on these additional equity securities may increase the risk that we will be unable to maintain or increase our dividend per share. There are no limitations in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (other than a specified number of authorized shares) on our ability to issue equity securities, including securities ranking senior to our common stock. The incurrence of bank borrowings or other debt by Global Operating LLC or by our project companies to finance our business may result in increased interest expense and the imposition of additional or more restrictive covenants which, in turn, may impact the cash distributions we distribute to holders of our Class A common stock.\nGlobal LLC\u2019s cash available for distribution will likely fluctuate from quarter to quarter, in some cases significantly, due to seasonality or wind and solar resource conditions. As a result, we may cause Global LLC to reduce the amount of cash it distributes to its members in a particular quarter to establish reserves to fund distributions to its members in future periods for which the cash distributions we would normally receive from Global LLC would otherwise be insufficient to fund our quarterly dividend. If we fail to cause Global LLC to establish sufficient reserves, we may not be able to declare a quarterly dividend or the amount of any such quarterly dividend may be limited with respect to a quarter adversely affected by seasonality.\nFinally, dividends to holders of our Class A common stock will be paid at the discretion of our Board. Our Board may decrease the level of or entirely discontinue payment of dividends.\nCapital controls could limit our ability to finance the acquisition of power plants and our ability to repatriate cash.\nCertain jurisdictions in which power plants in our portfolio are located or in which we expect to acquire power plants in the future impose capital controls that either restrict investment by foreign sources, restrict the transfer of capital to foreign recipients or both. For example, South Africa currently has an exchange control regime which includes restrictions on exporting capital from South Africa and which may accordingly place constraints on cash flows from the South African power plants. While exchange controls have been relaxed in recent years, South African companies remain subject to restrictions on their ability to raise and deploy capital outside of the Southern African Common Monetary Area. Similarly, companies incorporated in India are subject to regulatory restrictions on borrowing in foreign currencies and the granting of security interests in collateral. Such restrictions could limit our ability to raise financings on competitive terms and refinance existing indebtedness. Additionally, our ability to borrow money against the collateral located in India is subject to exchange control regulations in India and may require the prior approval of the Indian regulatory authorities.\nWe are a holding company and our only material asset is our interest in Global LLC, and we are accordingly dependent upon distributions from Global LLC and its subsidiaries to pay dividends, taxes and other expenses.\nTerraForm Global, Inc. is a holding company and has no material assets other than its ownership of membership interests in Global LLC, a holding company that has no material assets other than its interest in Global Operating LLC, whose sole material assets are the power plants that comprise our portfolio and the power plants that we subsequently acquire. TerraForm Global, Inc., Global LLC and Global Operating LLC have no independent means of generating revenue. We intend to cause Global Operating LLC\u2019s subsidiaries to make distributions to Global Operating LLC and, in turn, make distributions to Global LLC, and, Global LLC, in turn, to make distributions to TerraForm Global, Inc. in an amount sufficient to cover all applicable taxes payable and dividends, if any, declared by us. To the extent that we need funds to pay a quarterly cash dividend to holders of our Class A common stock or otherwise, and Global Operating LLC or Global LLC is restricted from making such distributions under applicable law or regulation or is otherwise unable to provide such funds (including as a result of Global Operating LLC\u2019s operating subsidiaries being unable to make distributions, such as due to defaults in project level financing agreements), it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition and limit our ability to pay dividends to holders of our Class A common stock.\nMarket interest rates may have an effect on the value of our Class A common stock.\nOne of the factors that influences the price of shares of our Class A common stock will be the effective dividend yield of such shares (i.e., the yield as a percentage of the then market price of our shares) relative to market interest rates. An increase in market interest rates, which are currently at low levels relative to historical rates, may lead prospective purchasers of shares of our Class A common stock to expect a higher dividend yield. If market interest rates increase and we are unable to increase our dividend in response, including due to an increase in borrowing costs, insufficient cash available for distribution or otherwise, investors may seek alternative investments with higher yield, which would result in selling pressure on, and a decrease in the market price of, our Class A common stock. As a result, the price of our Class A common stock may decrease as market interest rates increase.\nThe market price and marketability of our shares may from time to time be significantly affected by numerous factors beyond our control.\nThe market price of our shares may fluctuate significantly and many factors that are beyond our control may significantly affect the market price and marketability of our shares and may adversely affect our ability to raise capital through equity financings. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nprice and volume fluctuations in the stock markets generally;\n\u2022\nsignificant volatility in the market price and trading volume of securities of registered investment companies, business development companies or companies in our sectors, which may not be related to the operating performance of these companies;\n\u2022\nchanges in regulatory policies or tax law;\n\u2022\noperating performance of companies comparable to us; and\n\u2022\nloss of funding sources.\nWe are a \u201ccontrolled company,\u201d controlled by SunEdison, whose interest in our business may be different from ours or the holders of our Class A common stock.\nEach share of our Class B common stock entitles SunEdison or its controlled affiliates to 100 votes on matters presented to our stockholders generally. SunEdison currently owns all of our Class B common stock. Therefore, SunEdison currently controls a majority of the vote on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders, including the election of our directors, even though its ownership of our Class B common stock represents less than 50% of the outstanding Class A common stock and Class B common stock on a combined basis. For as long as SunEdison holds our Class B common stock, SunEdison will maintain this control. In addition, our exploration and evaluation of strategic alternatives may result, among other potential outcomes, in a transaction in which control (through Class B common stock or other similar interests) is transferred to a subsequent sponsor. As a result, we are and may continue to be considered a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d for the purposes of the Nasdaq Global Select Market listing requirements. As a \u201ccontrolled company,\u201d we are permitted to opt out of the Nasdaq Global Select Market listing requirements that require (i) a majority of the members of our Board to be independent, (ii) that we establish a compensation committee and a nominating and governance committee, each comprised entirely of independent directors, and (iii) an annual performance evaluation of the nominating and governance and compensation committees. We rely on exceptions with respect to establishing a nominating committee and annual performance evaluations of such committee.\nThe Nasdaq Global Select Market listing requirements are intended to ensure that directors who meet the independence standard are free of any conflicting interest that could influence their actions as directors. As further described\nabove the section \u201cRisks Related to our Relationship with SunEdison and the SunEdison Bankruptcy\u201d it is possible that the interests of SunEdison may in some circumstances conflict with our interests and the interests of holders of our Class A common stock. Should SunEdison\u2019s interests differ from those of other stockholders, the other stockholders may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance rules for publicly-listed companies. Our status as a controlled company could make our Class A common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price.\nIf the Brookfield Transaction is not consummated, provisions of our charter documents or Delaware law could delay or prevent an alternative acquisition of us, even if the acquisition would be beneficial to holders of our Class A common stock, and could make it more difficult for investors to change management.\nIf the Brookfield Transaction is not consummated, provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control that holders of our Class A common stock may consider favorable, including transactions in which such stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. This is because these provisions may prevent or frustrate attempts by stockholders to replace or remove members of our management. These provisions include:\n\u2022\na prohibition on stockholder action through written consent once SunEdison ceases to hold a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock;\n\u2022\na requirement that special meetings of stockholders be called upon a resolution approved by a majority of our directors then in office;\n\u2022\nthe right of SunEdison as the holder of our Class B common stock, to appoint up to four additional directors to our Board;\n\u2022\nadvance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations; and\n\u2022\nthe authority of the Board to issue preferred stock with such terms as the Board may determine.\nSection 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder (generally a person that together with its affiliates owns or within the last three years has owned 15% of voting stock) for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. As a result of these provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law, the price investors may be willing to pay in the future for shares of our Class A common stock may be limited.\nAdditionally, in order to ensure compliance with Section 203 of the Federal Power Act (\u201cFPA\u201d), our amended and restated certificate of incorporation prohibits any person from acquiring, without prior Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (\u201cFERC\u201d) authorization or the written consent of our Board, in purchases other than secondary market transactions (i) an amount of our Class A or Class B1 common stock that, after giving effect to such acquisition, would allow such purchaser together with its affiliates (as understood for purposes of FPA Section 203) to exercise 10% or more of the total voting power of the outstanding shares of our Class A, Class B and Class B1 common stock in the aggregate, or (ii) an amount of our Class A common stock or Class B1 common stock as otherwise determined by our Board sufficient to allow such purchaser together with its affiliates to exercise control over our company. Any acquisition of our Class A common stock or Class B1 common stock in violation of this prohibition shall not be effective to transfer record, beneficial, legal or any other ownership of such common stock, and the transferee shall not be entitled to any rights as a stockholder with respect to such common stock (including, without limitation, the right to vote or to receive dividends with respect thereto). Any acquisition of 10% or greater voting power or a change of control with respect to us or any of our solar and wind power plants could require prior authorization from FERC under Section 203 the FPA. Furthermore, a \u201cholding company\u201d (as defined in the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005, as amended (\u201cPUHCA\u201d)) and its \u201caffiliates\u201d (as defined in PUHCA) may be subject to restrictions on the acquisition of our Class A common stock or Class B1 common stock in secondary market transactions to which other acquirers are not subject. A purchaser of our securities which is a \u201cholding company\u201d or an \u201caffiliate\u201d or \u201cassociate company\u201d of such a \u201cholding company\u201d (as defined in PUHCA) should seek their own legal counsel to determine whether a given purchase of our securities may require prior FERC approval.\nInvestors may experience dilution of their ownership interest due to the future issuance of additional shares of our Class A common stock.\nWe are in a capital intensive business, and may not have sufficient funds to finance the growth of our business, future acquisitions or to support our projected capital expenditures. As a result, we may require additional funds from further equity or debt financings, including sales of preferred shares or convertible debt to complete future acquisitions, expansions and capital expenditures and pay the general and administrative costs of our business. In the future, we may issue our previously authorized and unissued securities, resulting in the dilution of the ownership interests of purchasers of our Class A common stock offered\nhereby. Under our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, we are authorized to issue 2,750,000,000 shares of Class A common stock, 200,000,000 shares of Class B common stock, 550,000,000 shares of Class B1 common stock and 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock with preferences and rights as determined by our Board. The potential issuance of additional shares of common stock or preferred stock or convertible debt may create downward pressure on the trading price of our Class A common stock. We may also issue additional shares of our Class A common stock or other securities that are convertible into or exercisable for our Class A common stock in future public offerings or private placements for capital raising purposes or for other business purposes, potentially at an offering price, conversion price or exercise price that is below the trading price of our Class A common stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about us, our business or our market, or if they change their recommendations regarding our Class A common stock adversely, the stock price and trading volume of our Class A common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our Class A common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about us, our business, our market or our competitors. If any of the analysts who may cover us change their recommendation regarding our Class A common stock adversely, or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors, the price of our Class A common stock would likely decline. If any analyst who may cover us were to cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause the stock price or trading volume of our Class A common stock to decline.\nFuture sales of our common stock or disposals or transfers by SunEdison of Class B common stock and Class B Units, including in connection with the SunEdison Bankruptcy, may cause the price of our Class A common stock to fall.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock could decline as a result of sales by investors, who hold restricted shares, into the market, or the perception that these sales could occur. The presence of additional shares of our Class A common stock trading in the public market may have a material adverse effect on the market price of our securities.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock may also decline as a result of SunEdison disposing or transferring some or all of our outstanding Class B common stock and Class B units, which disposals or transfers would reduce SunEdison\u2019s ownership interest in, and voting control over, us, as well as result in substantial dilution because of the resulting exchange of Class B units for Class A common stock. As further described in \u201cRisks Related to our Relationship with SunEdison and the SunEdison Bankruptcy,\u201d such disposals or transfers could occur in connection with the SunEdison Bankruptcy. These dispositions might also make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities at a time and price that we deem appropriate.\nSunEdison and certain of its affiliates and the private placement investors in the Company have certain demand and piggyback registration rights with respect to shares of our Class A common stock issuable upon the exchange of Class B units or Class B1 units of Global LLC. The presence of additional shares of our Class A common stock trading in the public market, as a result of the exercise of such registration rights may have a material adverse effect on the market price of our securities.\nThe Company is an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and has elected to comply with reduced public company reporting requirements, which could make the Company\u2019s Class A common stock less attractive to stockholders.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined by the JOBS Act. For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we have chosen to take advantage of exemptions from various public company reporting requirements. To the extent we do not currently take advantage of certain exemptions, we may in the future choose to do so. These exemptions include, but are not limited to, (i) being permitted to provide only two years of audited financial statements, in addition to any required unaudited interim financial statements, with correspondingly reduced \u201cManagement\u2019s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations\u201d disclosure; (ii) not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, (iii) reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports, proxy statements and registration statements, and (iv) exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We have elected to take advantage of certain of the reduced disclosure obligations regarding financial statements and executive compensation. In addition, Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have chosen to \u201copt in\u201d to such extended transition period election under Section 107(b). Therefore, we have elected to delay adoption of new or revised accounting standards and, as a result, we have chosen not to comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. As a result of our election, our financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of other public companies.\nWe could be an emerging growth company for up to five years after the first sale of our common equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act, which such fifth anniversary will occur in 2020. However, if certain events occur prior to the end of such five-year period, including if we become a \u201clarge accelerated filer,\u201d our annual gross revenues exceed $1.0 billion or we issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt in any three-year period, we would cease to be an emerging growth company prior to the end of such five-year period. We have taken advantage of certain of the reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in this filing and have elected to take advantage of other reduced burdens in future filings. As a result, the information that we provide to holders of our Class A common stock may be different than investors might receive from other public reporting companies in which you hold equity interests. We cannot predict if investors will find our Class A common stock less attractive as a result of our reliance on these exemptions. If some investors find our Class A common stock less attractive as a result of any choice we make to reduce disclosure, there may be a less active trading market for our Class A common stock and the price for our Class A common stock may be more volatile.\nRisks Related to Taxation\nOur future tax liability may be greater than expected if we do not generate Net Operating Losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d) sufficient to offset taxable income.\nWe expect to generate NOLs and NOL carryforwards that we can utilize to offset future taxable income. Based on our portfolio of assets that we expect will benefit from an accelerated tax depreciation schedule, and subject to tax obligations resulting from potential tax audits, we do not expect to pay significant United States federal income tax in the near term. However, in the event these losses are not generated as expected, are successfully challenged by the Internal Revenue Service(\u201cIRS\u201d) (in a tax audit or otherwise), or are subject to future limitations as a result of an \u201cownership change\u201d as discussed below, our ability to realize these future tax benefits may be limited. Any such reduction, limitation, or challenge may result in a material increase in our estimated future income tax liabilities and may negatively impact our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur ability to use NOLs to offset future income may be limited.\nOur ability to use existing NOL carryforwards and NOLs generated in the future could be substantially limited if we were to experience an \u201cownership change\u201d as defined under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. In general, an ownership change occurs if the aggregate stock ownership of certain stockholders (generally 5% stockholders, applying certain look-through and aggregation rules) increases by more than 50% over such stockholders\u2019 lowest percentage ownership over a rolling three-year period. If a corporation experiences an ownership change, its ability to use its pre-change NOL carryforwards and other pre-change deferred tax attributes to offset its post-change income and taxes may be limited. Future sales of our Class B common stock by SunEdison, as well as future issuances by us or trades of stock amount our other 5% stockholders, could contribute to a potential ownership change.\nA valuation allowance may be required for our deferred tax assets.\nOur expected NOLs will be reflected as a deferred tax asset as they are generated until utilized to offset income. Valuation allowances may need to be maintained for deferred tax assets that we estimate are more likely than not to be unrealizable, based on available evidence at the time the estimate is made. Valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be affected by changes to tax laws, statutory tax rates and future taxable income levels and based on input from our auditors, tax advisors or regulatory authorities. In the event that we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or a portion of our net deferred tax assets in the future, we would reduce such amounts through a charge to income tax expense in the period in which that determination was made, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations and our ability to maintain profitability. Moreover additional ownership changes may occur in connection with potential transactions that may result from our ongoing exploration and evaluation of strategic alternatives.\nInvestors may be subject to Indian taxes on income arising through the sale of our equity shares.\nSeveral of our power plants are located in India. Pursuant to the Indian Income Tax Act, 1961, as amended (the \u201cIndian Income Tax Act\u201d), income arising directly or indirectly through the sale of a capital asset, including any share or interest in a company or entity registered or incorporated outside of India, will be taxable in India if such share or interest derives its value, directly or indirectly, substantially from assets located in India. This tax is applicable whether or not the seller of such share or interest has a residence, place of business, business connection or any other presence in India. If it is determined that these Indian Income Tax Act provisions apply to shares of our Class A common stock, any transfer of such shares may be taxable in India, subject to the protections, if any, available under a double taxation agreement entered into by the Government of India with the country of which the transferor is a resident. The Indian Income Tax Act defines \u201csubstantially\u201d to require the fair market value of Indian assets to represent at least 50% of the value of all assets owned by the entity. Moreover, the Indian\nIncome Tax Act exempts from such tax, persons who have not owned over 5% of the stock of the entity in question directly or indirectly or do not hold right of control or management directly or indirectly of the entity in question at any time in the 12 months preceding the date of transfer. While we do not believe that the Indian assets represent more than 50% of the value of all assets owned by the entity, no assurance can be given that the Indian tax authorities will not challenge this position.", "PERMNO": 15523, "SIC": 4991, "TIC": "GLBL"}
