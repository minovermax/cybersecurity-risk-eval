{"cik": "912766", "company": "LAUREATE EDUCATION, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-02-28", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe following are certain risks that could affect our business and our results of operations. The risks identified below are not all encompassing but should be considered in establishing an opinion of our future operations.\nRisks Relating to Our Continuing Business\nWe are a multinational business with continuing operations in ten countries around the world, predominantly in Latin America, and are subject to complex business, economic, legal, political, tax and foreign currency risks, which risks may be difficult to adequately address.\nIn each of 2018, 2017 and 2016, over 80% of our revenues from continuing operations were generated from operations outside of the United States. Our continuing operations in four Latin American countries provided 73% of our revenues in 2018. We own or control 29 institutions and manage or have relationships with nine other licensed institutions in ten countries, each of which is subject to complex business, economic, legal, political, tax and foreign currency risks. We may have difficulty managing and administering an internationally dispersed business and we may need to expend additional funds to, among other things, staff key management positions, obtain additional information technology infrastructure and successfully implement relevant course and program offerings for a significant number of international markets, which may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditional challenges associated with the conduct of our business overseas that may materially adversely affect our operating results include:\n\u2022 the large size of our network and diverse range of institutions present numerous challenges, including difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations as a result of distance, language, legal and other differences;\n\u2022 our concentration in Latin America presents risks relating to regional economic pressures;\n\u2022 each of our institutions is subject to unique business risks and challenges including competitive pressures and diverse pricing environments at the local level;\n\u2022 difficulty maintaining quality standards consistent with our brands and with local accreditation requirements;\n\u2022 potential economic and political instability in the countries in which we operate, including student unrest;\n\u2022 fluctuations in exchange rates, possible currency devaluations, inflation and hyperinflation;\n\u2022 difficulty selecting, monitoring and controlling partners outside of the United States;\n\u2022 compliance with a wide variety of domestic and foreign laws and regulations;\n\u2022 expropriation of assets by governments;\n\u2022 political elections and changes in government policies;\n\u2022 difficulty protecting our intellectual property rights overseas due to, among other reasons, the uncertainty of laws and enforcement in certain countries relating to the protection of intellectual property rights;\n\u2022 lower levels of availability or use of the Internet, through which our online programs are delivered;\n\u2022 limitations on the repatriation and investment of funds and foreign currency exchange restrictions;\n\u2022 limitations on our ability to realize economic benefits from certain institutions that are organized as not-for-profit or non-stock entities and that we account for as variable interest entities; and\n\u2022 acts of terrorism, public health risks, crime and natural disasters, particularly in areas in which we have significant operations.\nOur success in growing our business will depend, in part, on the ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks related to operating in various countries. Any failure by us to effectively manage the challenges associated with the international expansion of our operations could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we cannot maintain student enrollments in our institutions and maintain tuition levels, our results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nOur strategy for growth and profitability depends, in part, upon maintaining and, subsequently, increasing student enrollments in our institutions and maintaining tuition levels. Attrition rates are often due to factors outside our control. Students sometimes face financial, personal or family constraints that require them to drop out of school. They also are affected by economic and social factors prevalent in their countries. In some markets in which we operate, transfers between universities are not common and, as a result, we are less likely to fill spaces of students who drop out. In addition, our ability to attract and retain students may require us to discount tuition from published levels, and may prevent us from increasing tuition levels at a rate consistent with inflation and increases in our costs. If we are unable to control the rate of student attrition, our overall enrollment levels are likely to decline or if we are unable to charge tuition rates that are both competitive and cover our rising expenses, our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. In addition, student enrollment may be negatively affected by our reputation and any negative publicity related to us.\nOur divestiture activities and the ongoing strategic shift in our business may disrupt our ongoing business, involve increased expenses and present risks not contemplated at the time of the transactions.\nWe are continuing to pursue our previously announced strategy of simplifying and focusing our business, including our announced plan to divest assets in Europe, Africa, Asia and Central America and create two scaled enterprises-one campus-based business primarily focused on emerging markets\nin Latin America, and one fully online platform in the U.S. These currently contemplated divestitures, along with past and any future divestitures, and the ongoing strategic shift in our business involve significant financial, operational and managerial risks and uncertainties, including:\n\u2022 inability to find potential buyers or otherwise complete transactions on favorable terms;\n\u2022 failure to effectively transfer liabilities, contracts, facilities and employees to buyers;\n\u2022 requirements that we indemnify buyers against certain liabilities and obligations;\n\u2022 the possibility that we will become subject to third-party claims arising out of a divestiture;\n\u2022 challenges in identifying and separating the intellectual property and data to be divested from the intellectual property and data that we wish to retain;\n\u2022 challenges in collecting the proceeds from any divestiture;\n\u2022 the possible need to restructure our capital and debt structure;\n\u2022 realization of our intended tax treatment of a divestiture;\n\u2022 inability to eliminate or reduce overhead and fixed costs associated with the divested assets or business and operate the retained business on a cost-effective and efficient basis;\n\u2022 disruption of our retained ongoing business and distraction of management; and\n\u2022 loss of key employees as a result of a contemplated or completed divestiture\nWe may not be successful in overcoming the above risks and uncertainties or any other problems encountered in connection with a divestiture, which may adversely affect our operations and financial results. In addition, there is no assurance that our currently contemplated divestitures-or future divestitures-will be completed at all or within our contemplated timeframe, or will be completed on terms sufficient to allow us to achieve the anticipated benefits from the divestitures.\nOur success depends substantially on the value of the local brands of each of our institutions as well as the Laureate International Universities network brand, which may be materially adversely affected by changes in current and prospective students' perception of our reputation and the use of social media.\nEach of our institutions has worked hard to establish the value of its individual brand. Brand value may be severely damaged, even by isolated incidents, particularly if the incidents receive considerable negative publicity. There has been a marked increase in use of social media platforms, including weblogs (blogs), social media websites, and other forms of Internet-based communications that allow individuals access to a broad audience of interested persons. We believe students and prospective employers value readily available information about our institutions and often act on such information without further investigation or authentication, and without regard to its accuracy. In addition, many of our institutions use the Laureate name in promoting their institutions and our success is dependent in large part upon our ability to maintain and enhance the value of the Laureate and Laureate International Universities brands. Social media platforms and devices immediately publish the content their subscribers and participants post, often without filters or checks on the accuracy of the content posted. Information concerning our company and our institutions may be posted on such platforms and devices at any time. Information posted may be materially adverse to our interests, it may be inaccurate, and it may harm our performance, prospects and business.\nOur reputation may be negatively influenced by the actions of other for-profit and private institutions.\nIn recent years, there have been a number of regulatory investigations and civil litigation matters targeting post-secondary for-profit education institutions in the United States and private higher education institutions in other countries, such as Chile. These investigations and lawsuits have alleged,\namong other things, deceptive trade practices, false claims against the United States and noncompliance with state and DOE regulations, and breach of the requirement that universities in Chile be operated as not-for-profit institutions. These allegations have attracted adverse media coverage and have been the subject of federal and state legislative hearings and investigations in the United States and in other countries. Allegations against the post-secondary for-profit and private education sectors may affect general public perceptions of for-profit and private educational institutions, including institutions in the Laureate International Universities network and us, in a negative manner. Adverse media coverage regarding other for-profit or private educational institutions or regarding us directly or indirectly could damage our reputation, reduce student demand for our programs, materially adversely affect our revenues and operating profit or result in increased regulatory scrutiny.\nGrowing our online academic programs could be difficult for us.\nThe expansion of our existing online programs and the creation of new online academic programs may not be accepted by students or employers, or by government regulators or accreditation agencies. In addition, our efforts may be materially adversely affected by increased competition in the online education market or because of problems with the performance or reliability of our online program infrastructure. There is also increasing development of online programs by traditional universities, both in the public and private sectors, which may have more consumer acceptance than programs we develop, because of lower pricing or perception of greater value of their degrees in the marketplace, which may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success depends, in part, on the effectiveness of our marketing and advertising programs in recruiting new students.\nIn order to maintain and increase our revenues and margins, we must continue to develop our admissions programs and attract new students in a cost-effective manner. The level of marketing and advertising and types of strategies used are affected by the specific geographic markets, regulatory compliance requirements and the specific individual nature of each institution and its students. The complexity of these marketing efforts contributes to their cost. If we are unable to advertise and market our institutions and programs successfully, our ability to attract and enroll new students could be materially adversely affected and, consequently, our financial performance could suffer. We use marketing tools such as the Internet, radio, television and print media advertising to promote our institutions and programs. Our representatives also make presentations at upper secondary schools. Additionally, we rely on the general reputation of our institutions and referrals from current students, alumni and employers as a source of new enrollment. As part of our marketing and advertising, we also subscribe to lead-generating databases in certain markets, the cost of which may increase. Among the factors that could prevent us from marketing and advertising our institutions and programs successfully are the failure of our marketing tools and strategies to appeal to prospective students, regulatory constraints on marketing, current student and/or employer dissatisfaction with our program offerings or results and diminished access to upper secondary campuses. In some of the countries in which we operate, enrollment growth in degree-granting, higher education institutions is slowing or is expected to slow. In order to maintain our growth, we will need to attract a larger percentage of students in existing markets and increase our addressable market by adding locations in new markets and rolling out new academic programs. Any failure to accomplish this may have a material adverse effect on our future growth.\nIf we do not effectively manage our growth and business, our results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nWe have expanded our business through the expansion of existing institutions and the acquisition of higher education institutions, and we may to do so in the future. Planned growth may require us to\nadd management personnel and upgrade our financial and management systems and controls and information technology infrastructure. There is no assurance that we will be able to maintain or accelerate the current growth rate, effectively manage expanding operations, build expansion capacity, integrate new institutions or achieve planned growth on a timely or profitable basis. If our revenue growth is less than projected, the costs incurred for these additions and upgrades could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to identify, acquire or establish control of, and integrate additional higher education institutions, or effectively integrate previously acquired institutions, which could materially adversely affect our growth.\nWe have previously relied on, and may in the future rely on, acquisitions as an element of our growth in targeted markets. However, there is no assurance that we will be able to continue to identify suitable acquisition candidates or that we will be able to acquire or establish control of any acquisition candidate on favorable terms, or at all. In addition, in many countries, the approval of a regulatory agency is needed to acquire or operate a higher education institution, which we may not be able to obtain. Furthermore, there is no assurance that any acquired institution can be integrated into our operations successfully or be operated profitably. Acquisitions involve a number of risks. If we do not make acquisitions or make fewer acquisitions than we have historically, or if our acquisitions are not managed successfully, our growth and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nOur institutions are subject to uncertain and varying laws and regulations, and any changes to these laws or regulations or their application to us may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nHigher education is regulated to varying degrees and in different ways in each of the countries in which we operate an institution. In general, our institutions must have licenses, approvals, authorizations, or accreditations from various governmental authorities and accrediting bodies. These licenses, approvals, authorizations, and accreditations must be renewed periodically, usually after an evaluation of the institution by the relevant governmental authorities or accrediting bodies. These periodic evaluations could result in limitations, restrictions, conditions, or withdrawal of such licenses, approvals, authorizations or accreditations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In some countries in which we operate, there is a trend toward making continued licensure or accreditation based on successful student outcomes, such as employment, which may be affected by many factors outside of our control. Once licensed, approved, authorized or accredited, some of our institutions may need approvals for new campuses or to add new degree programs.\nAll of these regulations and their applicable interpretations are subject to change. Moreover, regulatory agencies may scrutinize our institutions because they are owned or controlled by a U.S.-based for-profit corporation. Outside the United States, we may be particularly susceptible to such treatment because, in several of the countries in which we operate, our institutions are among the largest private institutions. Changes in applicable regulations may cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For a full description of the material laws and regulations affecting our higher education institutions in the United States, and the impact of these laws and regulations on the operations of those institutions, including the ability of those institutions to continue to access U.S. federal student aid funding sources, see \"-Risks relating to our highly regulated industry in the United States\" and \"Item 1 - Business-Industry Regulation-U.S. Regulation.\"\nChanges in laws governing student financing could affect the availability of government-sponsored financing programs for our non-U.S. students, such as the Cr\u00e9dito con Aval del Estado (the \"CAE Program\"), a government-sponsored student loan program in Chile, the Fundo de Financiamento\nEstudantil (\"FIES\"), a government-sponsored loan program in Brazil, and the Programa Universidade Para Todos (\"PROUNI\") in Brazil, all of which are offered by governments as a means of increasing student access to post-secondary education programs. If those programs are changed, or if our institutions or our students are no longer permitted to participate in those programs, or, in certain countries, if students who avail themselves of such programs do not graduate or subsequently default on their loans and we as a result become responsible for paying a significant portion of those loans, it could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For more information on the CAE Program, FIES and PROUNI, see \"Item 1 - Business-Industry Regulation-Brazilian Regulation\" and \"Item 1 - Business-Industry Regulation-Chilean Regulation.\"\nThe laws of the countries where we own or control institutions or may acquire ownership or control of institutions in the future must permit both private higher education institutions and foreign ownership or control of them. For political, economic or other reasons, a country could decide to change its laws or regulations to prohibit or limit private higher education institutions or foreign ownership or control or prohibit or limit our ability to enter into contracts or agreements with these institutions. If this change occurred, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and we could be forced to sell an institution at a price that could be lower than its fair market value or relinquish control of an institution. A forced sale or relinquishment of control could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nPolitical and regulatory developments in Chile may materially adversely affect us.\nOn January 24, 2018, a new Higher Education Law (the \"New Law\") was passed by the Chilean Congress. Among other things, the New Law prohibits conflicts of interests and related party transactions involving universities and their controlling parties, with certain exceptions, including the provision of services that are educational in nature or essential for the university's purposes. While we have modified some of our relationships with the Chilean universities in our network, and may need to make further modifications, we do not believe the New Law will change our relationship with our two tech/voc institutions in Chile that are for-profit entities. However, it is possible that the Chilean government will adopt additional laws that affect for-profit tech/voc institutions and their relationships with their owners.\nThe New Law established a Superintendency of Higher Education, with authority to regulate institutions of higher education and promulgate regulations and procedures implementing the New Law. While we await the promulgation of additional regulations by the Superintendent of Higher Education prior to the May 2019 implementation date stipulated under the New Law, we are continuing to evaluate the impact the New Law will have on our Chilean operations, including the extent to which it will affect existing contractual relationships that we maintain with the Chilean non-profit universities. Once the Superintendent issues the regulations, the Company and the Chilean universities may need to evaluate additional modifications to the existing contractual relationships. We also will review our accounting treatment of the Chilean non-profit universities to determine whether we can continue to consolidate them. Our continuing evaluation of the impact of the New Law may result in changes to our expectations due to changes in our interpretations of the law, assumptions used, and additional guidance that may be issued. There is no assurance that the New Law will not have additional material adverse effects on our financial condition or results of operations.\nWhile we believe that all of our institutions in Chile are operating in full compliance with Chilean law, we cannot predict the extent or outcome of any additional educational reforms that may be implemented in Chile. Depending upon how these reforms are defined and implemented, there could be a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Any additional significant disruption to our operations in Chile would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Similar reforms in other countries in which we operate could also have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRegulatory changes in Chile may reduce access to student financing for some of our students in Chile, which could reduce enrollments at our Chilean institutions.\nThe Chilean government and Congress, as well as participants in the Chilean higher education sector, are engaged in a policy debate about how to reform the student financing system including, but not limited to, discussion of reform to the CAE system, modifications to the availability of means-tested free tuition for various classes of students and other initiatives. This policy debate may or may not result in actual legislative action. We cannot predict the extent or outcome of any reforms or changes to the student financing system in Chile. Depending on how these reforms, if any, are defined and implemented, there could be an adverse effect on the ability of students in Chile to access government-sponsored higher education funding and on the ability of our institutions in Chile to attract and retain students, which could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have been subject in the recent past to investigations by Chilean regulators and could become subject to other investigations in the future.\nIn recent years, the not-for-profit universities in our network in Chile have been the subject of multiple investigations by various parts of the Chilean government, including the Chilean Congress, the Ministry of Education, the tax authorities and the public prosecutor, alleging various violations of Chilean law governing the non-profit status of universities. None of those investigations is currently active or has resulted in any material penalty to our institutions. While we believe that all of our institutions in Chile are operating in full compliance with Chilean law, we cannot predict what outcome may result from any future administrative processes or other investigations undertaken by the Chilean government, including by the newly appointed Superintendent of Higher Education under the New Law. Depending upon the outcome of any such processes or investigations, if any are instituted, there could be a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Any disruption to our operations in Chile would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur right to receive economic benefits from certain of the institutions that are organized as not-for-profit or non-stock entities, and that we account for as variable interest entities, may be limited.\nWe have obtained board and operating control and controlling financial interests in entities outside the United States that are educational institutions similar to U.S. not-for-profit, non-stock universities. Under applicable law, these institutions do not have recognized \"owners\" or shareholders, and generally cannot declare dividends or distribute their net assets to us. For accounting purposes, we have determined that these institutions are variable interest entities under GAAP and that we are the primary beneficiary of these variable interest entities. Maintenance of our interest in the variable interest entity institutions, and our ability to receive economic benefits from these entities, is based on a combination of (1) service agreements that other Laureate entities have with the VIE institutions, allowing the institutions to access the benefits of the Laureate International Universities network and allowing us to recognize economies of scale throughout the network, and (2) our ability to transfer our rights to govern the VIE institutions, or the entities that possess those rights, to other parties, which would yield a return if and when these rights are transferred. In limited circumstances, we may have rights to the residual assets in liquidation. Under the mutually agreed service agreements, we are paid at market rates for providing services to institutions such as access to content, support with curriculum design, professional development, student exchange, access to dual degree programs, affiliation and access to the Laureate International Universities network, and management, legal, tax, finance, accounting, treasury, use of real estate and other services. While we believe these arrangements conform to applicable law, the VIE institutions are subject to regulation by various agencies based on the requirements of local jurisdictions. These agencies, as well as local legislative bodies, review and\nupdate laws and regulations as they deem necessary or appropriate. We cannot predict the form of any laws that may be enacted, or regulations that ultimately may be adopted in the future, or what effects they might have on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. If local laws or regulations were to change, the VIE institutions were found to be in violation of existing local laws or regulations, or regulators were to question the financial sustainability of the VIE institutions and/or whether the contractual arrangements were at fair value, local government agencies could, among other actions:\n\u2022 revoke the business licenses and/or accreditations of the VIE institutions;\n\u2022 void or restrict related party transactions, such as the contractual arrangements between us and the VIE institutions;\n\u2022 impose fines that significantly impact business performance or other requirements with which the VIE institutions may not be able to comply;\n\u2022 require us to change the governance structures of the VIE institutions, such that we would no longer maintain control of the VIE institutions; or\n\u2022 disallow a transfer of our rights to govern the VIE institutions, or the entities that possess those rights, to a third party for consideration.\nIf we are unable to receive economic benefits from these institutions, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, if we are unable or limited in our ability to receive economic benefits from these institutions, we may be unable to consolidate the VIE institutions into our consolidated financial statements, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including possible write-offs of all or a portion of our investment in the affected VIEs and a reduction in operating income, or we may be limited in our ability to recognize all of the institutions' earnings in our consolidated statements of operations. See \"-Political and regulatory developments in Chile have materially adversely affected us and may continue to affect us.\"\nThe higher education market is very competitive, and we may not be able to compete effectively.\nHigher education markets around the world are highly fragmented and are very competitive and dynamic. Our institutions compete with traditional public and private colleges and universities and other proprietary institutions, including those that offer online professional-oriented programs. In each of the countries where we operate a private institution, our primary competitors are public and other private universities, some of which are larger, more widely known and have more established reputations than our institutions. Some of our competitors in both the public and private sectors may have greater financial and other resources than we have and have operated in their markets for many years. We also face potential competition from alternative education providers that prioritize open access education to students. A number of these providers have been formed recently to provide online curriculum from leading academics at little or no cost to the student. If this new modality is successful, it could disrupt the economics of the current education model (both for-profit and not-for-profit institutions). Other competitors may include large, well-capitalized companies that may pursue a strategy similar to ours of acquiring or establishing for-profit institutions. Public institutions receive substantial government subsidies, and public and private not-for-profit institutions have access to government and foundation grants, tax-deductible contributions and other financial resources generally not available to for-profit institutions. Accordingly, public and private not-for-profit institutions may have instructional and support resources superior to those in the for-profit sector, and public institutions can offer substantially lower tuition prices or other advantages that we cannot match.\nAny of these large, well-capitalized competitors may make it more difficult for us to acquire institutions as part of our strategy. They may also be able to charge lower tuitions or attract more students, which would adversely affect our growth and the profitability of our competing institutions. There is also an increased ability of traditional universities to offer online programs and we expect competition to increase as the online market matures. This may create greater pricing or operating pressure on us, which could have a material adverse effect on our institutions' enrollments, revenues and profit margins. We may not be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors and may face competitive pressures that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our graduates are unable to obtain professional licenses or certifications required for employment in their chosen fields of study, our reputation may suffer and we may face declining enrollments and revenues or be subject to student litigation.\nCertain of our students require or desire professional licenses or certifications after graduation to obtain employment in their chosen fields. Their success in obtaining such licensure depends on several factors, including the individual merits of the student, whether the institution and the program were approved by the relevant government or by a professional association, whether the program from which the student graduated meets all governmental requirements and whether the institution is accredited. If one or more governmental authorities refuses to recognize our graduates for professional licensure in the future based on factors relating to us or our programs, the potential growth of our programs would be negatively affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we could be exposed to litigation that would force us to incur legal and other expenses that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. See \"-Risks Relating to Our Highly Regulated Industry in the United States-The inability of our graduates to obtain licensure or other specialized outcomes in their chosen professional fields of study could reduce our enrollments and revenues, and potentially lead to litigation that could be costly to us.\"\nOur business may be materially adversely affected if we are not able to maintain or improve the content of our existing academic programs or to develop new programs on a timely basis and in a cost-effective manner.\nWe continually seek to maintain and improve the content of our existing academic programs and develop new programs in order to meet changing market needs. Revisions to our existing academic programs and the development of new programs may not be accepted by existing or prospective students or employers in all instances. If we cannot respond effectively to market changes, our business may be materially adversely affected. Even if we are able to develop acceptable new programs, we may not be able to introduce these new programs as quickly as students or employers require or as quickly as our competitors are able to introduce competing programs. Our efforts to introduce a new academic program may be conditioned or delayed by requirements to obtain foreign, federal, state and accrediting agency approvals. The development of new programs and courses, both conventional and online, is subject to requirements and limitations imposed by the governmental regulatory bodies of the various countries in which our institutions are located, including the U.S. Department of Education (\"DOE\"), state licensing agencies and the relevant accrediting bodies. The imposition of restrictions on the initiation of new educational programs by regulatory agencies may delay such expansion plans. If we do not respond adequately to changes in market requirements, our ability to attract and retain students could be impaired and our financial results could suffer.\nEstablishing new academic programs or modifying existing academic programs also may require us to make investments in specialized personnel and capital expenditures, increase marketing efforts and reallocate resources away from other uses. We may have limited experience with the subject matter of new programs and may need to modify our systems and strategy. If we are unable to increase the\nnumber of students, offer new programs in a cost-effective manner or otherwise manage effectively the operations of newly established academic programs, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nFailure to keep pace with changing market needs and technology could harm our ability to attract students.\nThe success of our institutions depends to a significant extent on the willingness of prospective employers to hire our students upon graduation. Increasingly, employers demand that their employees possess appropriate technological skills and also appropriate \"soft\" skills, such as communication, critical thinking and teamwork skills. These skills can evolve rapidly in a changing economic and technological environment. Accordingly, it is important that our educational programs evolve in response to those economic and technological changes. The expansion of existing academic programs and the development of new programs may not be accepted by current or prospective students or by the employers of our graduates. Students and faculty increasingly rely on personal communication devices and expect that we will be able to adapt our information technology platforms and our educational delivery methods to support these devices and any new technologies that may develop. Even if our institutions are able to develop acceptable new programs and adapt to new technologies, our institutions may not be able to begin offering those new programs and technologies as quickly as required by prospective students and employers or as quickly as our competitors begin offering similar programs. If we are unable to adequately respond to changes in market requirements due to regulatory or financial constraints, unusually rapid technological changes or other factors, our ability to attract and retain students could be impaired, the rates at which our graduates obtain jobs involving their fields of study could suffer and our results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nWe may have exposure to greater-than-anticipated tax liabilities.\nAs a multinational corporation, we are subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions.\nOur future income taxes could be materially adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory tax rates. In addition, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws, regulations and accounting principles, could have a material adverse effect on our future income taxes.\nThe determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment, and there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We have not recorded any deferred tax liabilities for undistributed foreign earnings either because of legal restrictions on distributions or because our historical strategy was to reinvest these earnings outside the United States. As circumstances change and if some or all of these undistributed foreign earnings are remitted to the United States, we may be required to recognize deferred tax liabilities on those amounts.\nAdditionally, in certain countries in which we operate, higher education institutions are either exempt from paying certain taxes, including income taxes, or pay taxes at significantly reduced rates. This includes certain of our higher education institutions that are organized as VIEs, similar to not-for-profit institutions in the United States. If we were to lose this favorable tax treatment, either because a VIE institution is converted into a for-profit shareholder-owned entity, or because of a change in local tax laws, our tax liabilities could increase materially.\nWe are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities. Any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition. We are also subject to non-income based taxes, such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, net worth, property and goods and services taxes, in both the United States and various foreign\njurisdictions. We are under regular audit by tax authorities with respect to these non-income based taxes and may have exposure to additional non-income based tax liabilities. Our acquisition activities have increased the volume and complexity of laws and regulations that we are subject to and with which we must comply.\nWe have identified certain contingencies, primarily tax-related, that we have assessed as being reasonably possible of loss, but not probable of loss, and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations if the outcomes are unfavorable. In most cases, we have received indemnifications from the former owners and/or noncontrolling interest holders of the acquired businesses for contingencies. In cases where we are not indemnified, the unrecorded contingencies are primarily in Brazil and, in the aggregate, we estimate that the reasonably possible loss for these unrecorded contingencies in Brazil could be up to approximately $45 million if the outcomes were unfavorable in all cases. If we are not able to recover amounts that are subject to indemnification, the loss for these contingencies could be greater.\nDuring 2010, we were notified by the Spanish Taxing Authorities (\"STA\") (in this case, by the Regional Inspection Office of the Special Madrid Tax Unit) that an audit of some of our Spanish subsidiaries was being initiated for 2006 and 2007. On June 29, 2012, the STA issued a final assessment to Iniciativas Culturales de Espa\u00f1a, S.L. (\"ICE\"), our Spanish holding company, for approximately EUR 11.1 million ($12.6 million at December 31, 2018), including interest, for those two years based on its rejection of the tax deductibility of financial expenses related to certain intercompany acquisitions and the application of the Spanish ETVE regime. On July 25, 2012, we filed a claim with the Regional Economic-Administrative Court challenging this assessment and, in the same month, we issued a cash-collateralized letter of credit for the assessment amount, in order to suspend the payment of the tax due. Further, in July 2013, we were notified by the STA (in this case, by the Central Inspection Office for Large Taxpayers) that an audit of ICE was also being initiated for 2008 through 2010. On October 19, 2015, the STA issued a final assessment to ICE for approximately EUR 17.2 million ($19.6 million at December 31, 2018), including interest, for those three years. We have appealed this assessment and, in order to suspend the payment of the tax assessment until the court decision, we issued a cash-collateralized letter of credit for the assessment amount plus interest and surcharges. We believe the assessments in this case are without merit and intend to defend vigorously against them. During the second quarter of 2016, we were notified by the STA that tax audits of the Spanish subsidiaries were also being initiated for 2011 and 2012, and in July 2017 the tax audit was extended to include 2013. Also during the second quarter of 2016, the Regional Administrative Court issued a decision against the Company on its appeal. The Company has further appealed at the Highest Administrative Court level, which appeal has been rejected. The Company has appealed both decisions to the National Court. In the first quarter of 2018, the Company made payments to the STA totaling EUR 29.6 million (approximately US $33.8 million at December 31, 2018) in order to reduce the amount of future interest that could be incurred as the appeals process continues. The payments were made using cash that collateralized the letters of credit discussed above.\nIn October of 2018, the STA issued a final assessment to ICE for the 2011 through 2013 period totaling approximately EUR 4.1 million (approximately US $4.7 million at December 31, 2018), including interest. As of December 31, 2018, the Company has posted a cash-collateralized letter of credit of approximately $5.7 million for the assessment, plus a surcharge.\nAlthough we believe our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially adversely affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made.\nOur reported revenues and earnings may be negatively affected by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and currency exchange rates.\nWe report revenues, costs and earnings in U.S. dollars, while our institutions generally collect tuition in the local currency. Exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the local currency in the countries where we operate institutions are likely to fluctuate from period to period. In 2018, approximately 81% of our revenues originated outside the United States. We translate revenues and other results denominated in foreign currencies into U.S. dollars for our consolidated financial statements. This translation is based on average exchange rates during a reporting period. In recent years, the U.S. dollar has strengthened against many international currencies, including the Brazilian real, euro and Mexican peso. As the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar strengthens, our reported international revenues and earnings are reduced because foreign currencies translate into fewer U.S. dollars. For the year ended December 31, 2018, a hypothetical 10% adverse change in average annual foreign currency exchange rates, excluding the impacts of our derivatives, would have decreased our operating income and our Adjusted EBITDA by $25.0 million and $65.0 million, respectively. For more information, see \"Item 7A - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk-Foreign Currency Exchange Risk.\"\nTo the extent that foreign revenues and expense transactions are not denominated in the local currency and/or to the extent foreign earnings are reinvested in a currency other than their functional currency, we are also subject to the risk of transaction losses. We occasionally enter into foreign exchange forward contracts or other hedging arrangements to reduce the earnings impact of non-functional currency denominated non-trade receivables and debt and to protect the U.S. dollar value of our assets and future cash flows with respect to exchange rate fluctuations. Given the volatility of exchange rates, there is no assurance that we will be able to effectively manage currency transaction and/or translation risks. Therefore, volatility in currency exchange rates may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCurrency exchange rates and our reported revenues and earnings may also be negatively affected by inflation or hyperinflation. If a country in which we operate is designated as a highly inflationary economy in the future under GAAP, the U.S. dollar would become the functional currency for our operations in that country. As a result, all gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of the financial results of operations in such country and other transactional foreign exchange gains and losses would be reflected in our earnings, which could result in volatility within our earnings, rather than as a component of our comprehensive income within stockholders' equity. Hyperinflation in any of the countries in which we operate may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles make up a significant portion of our total assets, and if we determine that goodwill or indefinite-lived intangibles become impaired in the future, net income and operating income in such years may be materially and adversely affected.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the net carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets totaled approximately $2,858.8 million. Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations. Due to the revaluation of our assets at the time of the LBO and acquisitions we have completed historically, goodwill makes up a significant portion of our total assets. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we periodically review goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles for impairment and any excess in carrying value over the estimated fair value is charged to the results of operations. Our review of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles at December 31, 2018 resulted in an aggregate reduction of $3.1 million in the value of such assets in our financial statements. Future reviews of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles could result in reductions. Any reduction in net income and operating income resulting from the write down or impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles could adversely affect our financial results. If\neconomic or industry conditions deteriorate or if market valuations decline, including with respect to our Class A common stock, we may be required to impair goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles in future periods.\nWe experience seasonal fluctuations in our results of operations.\nMost of the institutions in our network have a summer break, during which classes are generally not in session and minimal revenues are recognized. In addition to the timing of summer breaks, holidays such as Easter also have an impact on our academic calendar. Operating expenses, however, do not fully correlate to the enrollment and revenue cycles, as the institutions continue to incur expenses during summer breaks. Given the geographic diversity of our institutions and differences in timing of summer breaks, our second and fourth quarters are stronger revenue quarters as the majority of our institutions are in session for most of these respective quarters. Our first and third fiscal quarters are weaker revenue quarters because the majority of our institutions have summer breaks for some portion of one of these two quarters. Because a significant portion of our expenses do not vary proportionately with the fluctuations in our revenues, our results in a particular fiscal quarter may not indicate accurately the results we will achieve in a subsequent quarter or for the full fiscal year.\nConnectivity constraints or technology system disruptions to our computer networks could have a material adverse effect on our ability to attract and retain students.\nWe run the online operations of our institutions on different platforms, which are in various stages of development. The performance and reliability of these online operations are critical to the reputation of our institutions and our ability to attract and retain students. Any computer system error or failure, or a sudden and significant increase in traffic on our institutions' computer networks may result in the unavailability of these computer networks. In addition, any significant failure of our computer networks could disrupt our on-campus operations. Individual, sustained or repeated occurrences could significantly damage the reputation of our institutions' operations and result in a loss of potential or existing students. Additionally, the computer systems and operations of our institutions are vulnerable to interruption or malfunction due to events beyond our control, including natural disasters and other catastrophic events and network and telecommunications failures. The disaster recovery plans and backup systems that we have in place may not be effective in addressing a natural disaster or catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or information technology and infrastructure systems. As a result of any of these events, we may not be able to conduct normal business operations and may be required to incur significant expenses in order to resume normal business operations. As a result, our revenues and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nWe rely on computer systems for financial reporting and other operations and any disruptions in our systems would materially adversely affect us.\nWe rely on computer systems to support our financial reporting capabilities, including our SSOs, and other operations. As with any computer systems, unforeseen issues may arise that could affect our ability to receive adequate, accurate and timely financial information, which in turn could inhibit effective and timely decisions. Furthermore, it is possible that our information systems could experience a complete or partial shutdown. If such a shutdown occurred, it could materially adversely affect our ability to report our financial results in a timely manner or to otherwise operate our business.\nWe are subject to privacy and information security laws and regulations due to our collection and use of personal information, and any violations of those laws or regulations, or any breach, theft or loss of that information, could materially adversely affect our reputation and operations.\nPossession and use of personal information in our operations subjects us to risks and costs that could harm our business. Our institutions collect, use and retain large amounts of personal information regarding our students and their families, including social security numbers, tax return information, personal and family financial data and credit card numbers. We also collect and maintain personal information of our employees in the ordinary course of our business. In addition, we collect and maintain other types of information, such as leads, that may include personal information of our business contacts in the ordinary course of our business. Our computer networks and the networks of certain of our vendors that hold and manage confidential information on our behalf may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer hackers, computer viruses, cyber-attacks and other security threats. Confidential information also may become available to third parties inadvertently when we integrate or convert computer networks into our network following an acquisition of an institution or in connection with upgrades from time to time.\nDue to the sensitive nature of the information contained on our networks, such as students' grades, our networks may be targeted by hackers. A user who circumvents security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations. Although we use security and business controls to limit access and use of personal information, a third party may be able to circumvent those security and business controls, which could result in a breach of student or employee privacy. In addition, errors in the storage, use or transmission of personal information could result in a breach of student or employee privacy. As a result, we may be required to expend significant resources to protect against the threat of these security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by these breaches.\nFurthermore, we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations globally regarding privacy, data protection, and data security, including those related to the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer, and security of personal data. For example, the European Union's newly adopted privacy and data security regulation, the General Data Protection Regulation (the \"GDPR\"), that went into effect in May 2018, imposes more stringent requirements in how we collect and process personal data and provides for significantly greater penalties for noncompliance (including possible fines of up to 4% of total company revenue). Countries in other regions, including Latin America, have passed or are considering similar privacy regulations, resulting in additional compliance burdens and uncertainty as to how some of these laws will be interpreted. We have invested, and expect to continue to invest, significant resources to comply with the GDPR and other privacy laws and regulations.\nA breach, theft or loss of personal information regarding our students and their families, our employees, or other persons that is held by us or our vendors, or a violation of the laws and regulations governing privacy in one or more of the countries in which we operate, could result in significant penalties or legal liability, reputational damage, and/or remediation and compliance costs, which could be substantial and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may lose the right to license certain intellectual property which is integral to our online course offerings.\nWith our mandate that all of our institutions offer a certain percentage of online course offerings, we rely heavily upon the licensing of third-party materials, including e-textbooks and graphic, video and audio media, which are incorporated into our globally offered course content. Our institutions contract with large vendors which offer volumes of such course content. We could lose the right to license some percentage or all of those third-party materials for several reasons, including our licensors' infringement of third-party materials, going out of business, or terminating our content licenses for one or more business reasons. We rely on the negotiation of extensive licensing rights to mitigate this eventuality\nand contract with known, reliable vendors. If we lose the right to a significant percentage of such content, our course offerings and programs could be negatively affected because those materials must be removed from our course offerings, resulting in significant cost to us to revise the affected courses and a poor educational experience for our students, which could negatively affect our reputation, and our financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nWe may infringe the intellectual property rights of one or more of our third-party licensors.\nAll of our institutions offer a certain percentage of online course offerings. The educational content contained in such online course offerings is inherently more susceptible to infringement than campus-based learning materials because it is easier to make many digital copies of an online text, picture, video or audio file than it is to reproduce hard-copy materials. Also, intellectual property laws can vary from country to country, resulting in additional risk of infringement when licensing the same materials in multiple countries. Our institutions take reasonable precautions to ensure that all course content offerings used by them are properly licensed and distributed; however, there is no guarantee that all of our course content offerings are properly licensed. Additionally, we create universally applicable course and program offerings that are licensed throughout our institutions, meaning that a single act of infringement could adversely affect multiple institutions around the world. Intellectual property infringement by us and our institutions can result in damaged vendor relationships, legal proceedings, loss of course content, and reputational loss, which could negatively affect our reputation, and our financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nStudent protests and strikes may disrupt our ability to hold classes as well as our ability to attract and retain students, which could materially adversely affect our operations.\nPolitical, social and economic developments in the countries in which we operate may cause protests and disturbances against conditions in those countries, including policies relating to the operation and funding of higher education institutions. These disturbances may involve protests on university campuses, including the occupation of university buildings and the disruption of classes. We are unable to predict whether students at institutions in the Laureate International Universities network will engage in various forms of protest in the future. Should we sustain student strikes, protests or occupations in the future, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and on our overall financial condition. Further, we may need to make additional investments in security infrastructure and personnel on our campuses in order to prevent future student protests from disrupting the ability of our institutions to hold classes. If we are required to make substantial additional investments in security, or if we are unable to identify security enhancements that would prevent future disruptions of classes, that could cause an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we may need to pay overtime compensation to certain of our faculty and staff, which may increase our overall costs.\nWe may be unable to operate one or more of our institutions or suffer liability or loss due to a natural or other disaster.\nOur institutions are vulnerable to natural or other disasters, including fires, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes and other events beyond our control. A number of our institutions are located in areas such as Mexico and Peru that are prone to damage from major weather events, which may be substantial. For example, in 2017, Peru's normally arid regions experienced historic, torrential rainfall and subsequent flooding. At least one of our campuses located there suffered flood-related damage. There, as elsewhere in the country, flood-related damage caused a range of disruptions, including in our case a delay in the regularly scheduled start of classes for the semester, which caused revenue disruptions. A number of our institutions are also located in areas, such as Chile, Mexico and Peru, that are prone to earthquake damage. Also in 2017, a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck Mexico causing a temporary\nsuspension of activities at several UVM and UNITEC campuses located in the affected states of Mexico City, Puebla, Veracruz, Morelos, Chiapas and Estado de M\u00e9xico. UVM and UNITEC temporarily suspended all activities on 21 campuses at the request of the Ministry of Education. The temporary suspension lasted 12 days on average and we incurred significant direct costs for repairs due to the earthquake. It is possible that one or more of our institutions would be unable to operate for an extended period of time in the event of a hurricane, earthquake or other disaster which does substantial damage to the area in which an institution is located. The failure of one or more of our institutions to operate for a substantial period of time could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In the event of a major natural or other disaster, we could also experience loss of life of students, faculty members and administrative staff, or liability for damages or injuries.\nWe may be unable to recruit, train and retain qualified and experienced faculty and administrative staff at our institutions.\nOur success and ability to grow depend on the ability to hire and retain large numbers of talented people. The process of hiring employees with the combination of skills and attributes required to implement our business strategy can be difficult and time-consuming. Our faculty members in particular are key to the success of our institutions. Our rapid global expansion has presented challenges for recruiting talented people with the right experience and skills for our needs. We face competition in attracting and retaining faculty members who possess the necessary experience and accreditation to teach at our institutions. As we expand and add personnel, it may be difficult to maintain consistency in the quality of our faculty and administrative staff. If we are unable to, or are perceived to be unable to, attract and retain experienced and qualified faculty, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nHigh crime levels in certain countries and regions in which we operate institutions may have an impact on our ability to attract and retain students and may increase our operating expenses.\nMany of our institutions are located in countries and regions that have high rates of violent crime, drug trafficking and vandalism. If we are unable to maintain adequate security levels on our campuses, and to work with local authorities to maintain adequate security in the areas adjacent to our campuses, we may not be able to continue to attract and retain students, or we may have to close a campus either temporarily or permanently. For example, in 2014 we closed a small campus of one of our universities in Mexico because of threats from a local drug cartel. In addition, high crime rates may require us to make additional investments in security infrastructure and personnel, which may cause us to increase our tuition rates in order to maintain operating margins. Certain security measures may materially adversely affect the campus experience by making access by students more cumbersome, which may be viewed negatively by some of our existing or prospective students. If we are not able to attract and retain students because of our inability to provide them with a safe environment, or if we are required to make substantial additional investments in security, that could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to upgrade our campuses, they may become less attractive to parents and students and we may fail to grow our business.\nAll of our institutions require periodic upgrades to remain attractive to parents and students. Upgrading the facilities at our institutions could be difficult for a number of reasons, including the following:\n\u2022 our properties may not have the capacity or configuration to accommodate proposed renovations;\n\u2022 construction and other costs may be prohibitive;\n\u2022 we may fail to obtain regulatory approvals;\n\u2022 it may be difficult and expensive to comply with local building and fire codes, especially as to properties that we acquired as part of past acquisitions;\n\u2022 we may be unable to finance construction and other costs; and\n\u2022 we may not be able to negotiate reasonable terms with our landlords or developers or complete the work within acceptable timeframes.\nOur failure to upgrade the facilities of our institutions could lead to lower enrollment and could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to attract and retain the key talent needed for us to timely achieve our business objectives, our business and results of operations could be harmed.\nThe marketplace for senior executive management candidates is very competitive. Our growth may be adversely affected if we are unable to attract and retain such key employees. Turnover of senior management can adversely affect our stock price, our results of operations and our client relationships, and can make recruiting for future management positions more difficult. Competition for senior leadership may increase our compensation expenses, which may negatively affect our profitability.\nLitigation may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is subject to the risk of litigation by employees, students, suppliers, competitors, minority partners, counterparties in transactions in which we purchase or sell assets, stockholders, government agencies or others through private actions, class actions, administrative proceedings, regulatory actions or other litigation, some of which may take place in jurisdictions where local parties may have certain advantages over foreign parties. The outcome of litigation, particularly class action lawsuits, regulatory actions and intellectual property claims, is difficult to assess or quantify. Plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts, or may assert criminal charges, and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to these lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. In addition, certain of these lawsuits, if decided adversely to us or settled by us, may result in liability material to our financial statements as a whole or may negatively affect our operating results if changes to our business operation are required. The cost to defend future litigation may be significant. There also may be adverse publicity associated with litigation that could negatively affect customer perception of our business, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable. As a result, litigation may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. See \"Item 3 - Legal Proceedings.\"\nWe are subject to anti-corruption laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \"FCPA\"), as well as trade compliance and economic sanctions laws and regulations. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us to civil and criminal penalties, harm our reputation and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDoing business on a worldwide basis requires us to comply with the laws and regulations of numerous jurisdictions. These laws and regulations place restrictions on our operations and business practices. In particular, we are subject to the FCPA, which generally prohibits companies and their intermediaries from providing anything of value to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or securing any improper business advantage, along with various other anti-corruption laws. As a result of doing business in foreign countries and with foreign partners, we are exposed to a heightened risk of violating anti-corruption laws. Although we have implemented\npolicies and procedures designed to ensure that we, our employees and other intermediaries comply with the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws to which we are subject, there is no assurance that such policies or procedures will work effectively all of the time or protect us against liability under the FCPA or other laws for actions taken by our employees and other intermediaries with respect to our business or any businesses that we may acquire. We cannot assure you that all of our local partners will comply with these laws, in which case we could be held liable for actions taken inside or outside of the United States, even though our partners may not be subject to these laws. Our continued international expansion, and any development of new partnerships and joint venture relationships worldwide, increase the risk of FCPA violations in the future.\nViolations of anti-corruption laws, export control laws and regulations, and economic sanctions laws and regulations are punishable by civil penalties, including fines, as well as criminal fines and imprisonment. If we fail to comply with the FCPA or other laws governing the conduct of international operations, we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties and other remedial measures, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Any investigation of any potential violations of the FCPA or other anti-corruption laws, export control laws and regulations, and economic sanctions laws and regulations by the United States or foreign authorities could also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity, regardless of the outcome of the investigation.\nWe have in the past had material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting.\nIn 2018, we remediated each of the four material weaknesses that were previously identified and were disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. See \"Item 9A. Controls and Procedures-Remediation of Material Weaknesses.\"\nHowever, we may in the future discover areas of our internal financial and accounting controls and procedures that need improvement. Our internal control over financial reporting will not prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, regardless of how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system's objectives will be met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud will be detected.\nIf we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in a timely manner, or if we are unable to maintain proper and effective internal controls, we may not be able to produce timely and accurate financial statements, and we or our independent registered public accounting firm may conclude that our internal controls over financial reporting are not effective or our independent registered public accounting firm may not be able to provide us with an unqualified opinion as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. If that were to happen, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could lead to a decline in the market price of our Class A common stock and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the stock exchange on which our Class A common stock is listed, the SEC or other regulatory authorities.\nAdditionally, the existence of any material weakness could require management to devote significant time and incur significant expense to remediate any such material weakness and management may not be able to remediate any such material weakness in a timely manner. The existence of any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting could also result in errors in our financial statements that could require us to restate our financial statements, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and cause the holders of our Class A common stock to lose confidence in our reported financial information, all of which could materially adversely affect our business and share price.\nRisks Relating to Our Highly Regulated Industry in the United States\nFailure of each of our U.S. Institutions to comply with extensive regulatory requirements could result in significant monetary liabilities, fines and penalties, restrictions on our operations, limitations on our growth, or loss of access to federal student loans and grants for our students, on which we are substantially dependent.\nOur U.S. Institutions are subject to extensive regulatory requirements, including at the federal, state, and accrediting agency levels. Many students at our U.S. Institutions rely on the availability of federal student financial aid programs, known as Title IV programs, which are administered by the DOE, to finance their cost of attending our institutions. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, Walden University and NewSchool of Architecture and Design derived approximately 76% and 36% of their revenues (calculated on a cash basis) from Title IV program funds.\nTo participate in Title IV programs, our U.S. Institutions must be authorized by the appropriate state education agency or agencies, be accredited by an accrediting agency recognized by the DOE, and be certified as an eligible institution by the DOE. As a result, our U.S. Institutions are subject to extensive regulation and review by these agencies and commissions, including our educational programs, instructional and administrative staff, administrative procedures, marketing, student recruiting and admissions, and financial operations. These regulations also affect our ability to acquire or open additional institutions, add new educational programs, substantially change existing programs or change our corporate or ownership structure. The agencies and commissions that regulate our operations periodically revise their requirements and modify their interpretations of existing requirements. Regulatory requirements are not always precise and clear, and regulatory agencies may sometimes disagree with the way we interpret or apply these requirements. If we misinterpret or are found to have not complied with any of these regulatory requirements, our U.S. Institutions could suffer financial penalties, limitations on their operations, loss of accreditation, termination of or limitations on their ability to grant degrees and certificates, or limitations on or termination of their eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, each of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if we are charged with regulatory violations, our reputation could be damaged, which could have a negative impact on our enrollments and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We cannot predict with certainty how all of these regulatory requirements will be applied, or whether we will be able to comply with all of the applicable requirements in the future.\nIf any of our U.S. Institutions were to lose its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, we would experience a material and adverse decline in revenues, financial condition, results of operations, and future growth prospects. Furthermore, the affected U.S. Institution would be unable to continue its business as it is currently conducted, which could have a material adverse effect on the institution's ability to continue as a going concern.\nIf any of the U.S. education regulatory agencies or commissions that regulate us do not approve or delay any required approvals of transactions involving a change of control, our ability to operate or participate in Title IV programs may be impaired.\nIf we or one of our U.S. Institutions experiences a change of ownership or control under the standards of the DOE, any applicable accrediting agency, any applicable state educational licensing agency, or any specialized accrediting agency, we must notify or seek approval of each such agency or commission. These agencies do not have uniform criteria for what constitutes a change of ownership or control. Transactions or events that typically constitute a change of ownership or control include significant acquisitions or dispositions of shares of the voting stock of an institution or its parent company, and significant changes in the composition of the board of directors of an institution or its parent company. The occurrence of some of these transactions or events may be beyond our control. Our failure to obtain, or a delay in receiving, approval of any change of control from the DOE or any\napplicable accrediting agency or state educational licensing agency, could impair our U.S. Institutions' ability to operate or participate in Title IV programs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Failure to obtain, or a delay in receiving, approval of any change of control from any state in which our U.S. Institutions are currently licensed or authorized, or from any applicable accrediting agency, could require us to suspend our activities in that state or suspend offering applicable programs until we receive the required approval, or could otherwise impair our operations.\nOur failure to obtain any required approval of any transactions from the DOE, the institutional accrediting agencies, or the pertinent state educational agencies could result in one or more of our U.S. Institutions losing continued eligibility to participate in the Title IV programs, accreditation or state licensure, which could have a material adverse effect on our U.S. business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCongress may revise the laws governing Title IV programs or reduce funding for those and other student financial assistance programs, and the DOE may revise its regulations administering Title IV programs, any of which could reduce our enrollment and revenues and increase costs of operations.\nThe U.S. Higher Education Act (the \"HEA\") is a federal law that governs Title IV programs. The U.S. Congress must authorize and appropriate funding for Title IV programs under the HEA and can change the laws governing Title IV programs at any time. Congress reauthorizes the Higher Education Act, which governs federal financial assistance for higher education, approximately every five to eight years. However, the HEA was most recently reauthorized in August 2008. Congress is considering the reauthorization of the HEA and is expected to conduct hearings examining various issues relating to the HEA, such as accreditation reform, Title IV disbursement and institutional accountability. It is possible there will be new HEA reauthorization bills and oversight hearings in this Congress. We cannot predict the timing and terms of any eventual HEA reauthorization, including any potential changes to institutional participation, student eligibility requirements or funding levels for particular Title IV programs, which terms may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Apart from Title IV programs, eligible veterans and military personnel may receive educational benefits for the pursuit of higher education.\nWe cannot predict with certainty the future funding levels for Title IV programs, or for programs providing educational benefits to veterans and military personnel, or the nature of any future revisions to the law or regulations related to these programs. Because a significant percentage of the revenues of our U.S. Institutions is and is expected to be derived from Title IV programs, any action by the U.S. Congress that significantly reduces Title IV program funding or the ability of our U.S. students to participate in Title IV programs, could have a material adverse effect on the enrollments, business, financial condition and results of operations of our postsecondary educational institutions in the United States (our U.S. Institutions).\nIn recent years, the U.S. Department of Education (\"DOE\") has proposed or promulgated a substantial number of new regulations that impact our U.S. Institutions, including, but not limited to, borrower defenses to repayment, state authorization, financial responsibility, and gainful employment. For additional information regarding these regulations, see: \"-The DOE may adopt regulations governing federal student loan debt forgiveness that could result in liability for amounts based on borrower defenses or affect the DOE's assessment of our institutional capability\"; \"-If any of our U.S. Institutions fails to obtain or maintain any of its state authorizations in states where such authorization is required or fail to comply with the laws and regulations of such states, that institution may not be able to operate or enroll students in that state, and may not be able to award Title IV program funds to students\"; \"-If any of our U.S. Institutions do not meet specific financial responsibility standards established by the DOE, that institution may be required to post a letter of credit or accept other limitations to continue participating in Title IV programs, or that institution could lose its eligibility to\nparticipate in Title IV programs\"; and \"-We or certain of our educational programs at our U.S. Institutions may lose eligibility to participate in Title IV programs if any of our U.S. Institutions or certain of their educational programs cannot satisfy the DOE's 'gainful employment' requirements.\" Any of these new or proposed regulations could have a material adverse effect on enrollments, business, financial condition, and results of operations of our U.S. Institutions.\nOn July 31, 2018, the DOE published a notice in the Federal Register announcing its intention to establish a negotiated rulemaking committee to draft proposed regulations regarding topics such as distance education, accreditation, innovation, competency-based programs, faith-based institutions and TEACH grants. The first two of the three scheduled negotiated rulemaking committee meetings took place in January and February 2019 and the last one is scheduled to take place in March 2019. We cannot predict with certainty when these new regulations would be finalized or effective nor the impact such new regulations could have on our business, financial conditions or results of operations.\nThe DOE may adopt regulations governing federal student loan debt forgiveness that could result in liability for amounts based on borrower defenses or affect the DOE's assessment of our institutional capability.\nUnder the DOE's current regulations, a William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program (the \"Direct Loan Program\") borrower may assert as a defense to repayment any \"act or omission of the school attended by the student that would give rise to a cause of action against the school under applicable State law.\" On November 1, 2016, the DOE published a rule that, among other provisions, established new standards and processes for determining whether a Direct Loan Program borrower has a defense to repayment (\"DTR\") on a loan due to acts or omissions by the institution at which the loan was used by the borrower for educational expenses (the \"2016 DTR regulations\"). The 2016 DTR regulations were to take effect on July 1, 2017. On June 15, 2017, the DOE announced an indefinite delay to its implementation of the 2016 DTR regulations, and on June 16, 2017 published a notice of intent to establish a negotiated rulemaking committee to develop proposed revisions to the rule.\nAmong other topics, the 2016 DTR regulations established permissible borrower defense claims for discharge, procedural rules under which claims would be adjudicated, time limits for borrowers' claims, and guidelines for recoupment by the DOE of discharged loan amounts from institutions of higher education. They also prohibited schools from using any pre-dispute arbitration agreements, prohibited schools from prohibiting relief in the form of class actions by student borrowers, and invalidated clauses imposing requirements that students pursue an internal dispute resolution process before contacting authorities regarding concerns about an institution. For proprietary institutions, the 2016 DTR regulations described the threshold for loan repayment rates that would require specific disclosures to current and prospective students and the applicable loan repayment rate methodology. The 2016 DTR regulations also established new financial responsibility and administrative capacity requirements for both not-for-profit and for-profit institutions participating in the Title IV programs. Under the 2016 DTR regulations, certain events would automatically trigger a letter of credit, and the DOE retained discretion to impose a letter of credit upon the occurrence of other events.\nThe DOE held negotiated rulemaking sessions in early 2018 regarding the DTR regulations. The DOE and negotiators failed to reach consensus on revised DTR regulations. On July 31, 2018, the DOE published in the Federal Register a proposed rule which would replace most substantive provisions of the 2016 DTR regulations, with a 30-day public comment period. The DOE did not issue a final rule by November 1, 2018, however it is possible the DOE may implement these revised rules or seek to further revise these rules prior to implementation.\nOn July 6, 2017, the attorneys general of 18 states and the District of Columbia filed suit against the DOE claiming that its delay of the 2016 DTR regulations violated applicable law, including the Administrative Procedure Act. Through a series of orders dated September 12 and 17, and October 12, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia held that procedural delays by the DOE in\nimplementing the 2016 DTR regulations were improper and required that the 2016 DTR regulations be reinstated as of October 16, 2018.\nWe cannot state with any certainty the impact that complying with the 2016 DTR regulations might have on our business. If we are required to repay the DOE for any successful DTR claims by students who attended our U.S. Institutions, or if we are required to obtain additional letters of credit or increase our current letter of credit, it could materially affect our business, financial conditions and results of operations.\nOur U.S. Institutions must periodically seek recertification to participate in Title IV programs and, if the DOE does not recertify the institutions to continue participating in Title IV programs, our students would lose their access to Title IV program funds, or the institutions could be recertified but required to accept significant limitations as a condition of continued participation in Title IV programs.\nDOE certification to participate in Title IV programs lasts a maximum of six years, and institutions are required to seek recertification from the DOE on a regular basis to continue their participation in Title IV programs. An institution must also apply for recertification by the DOE if it undergoes a change in control, as defined by DOE regulations, and may be subject to similar review if it expands its operations or educational programs in certain ways. Generally, the recertification process includes a review by the DOE of the institution's educational programs and locations, administrative capability, financial responsibility and other oversight categories. The DOE could limit, suspend or terminate an institution's participation in Title IV programs for violations of the HEA or Title IV regulations. As discussed in more detail under \"Item 1 - Business-Industry Regulation-U.S. Regulation,\" each of our U.S. Institutions currently participates in the Title IV programs pursuant to the DOE's provisional form of certification.\nIf the DOE does not renew or withdraws any of our U.S. Institutions' certifications to participate in Title IV programs at any time, students in the affected institution(s) would no longer be able to receive Title IV program funds. Similarly, the DOE could renew our U.S. Institutions' certifications, but restrict or delay Title IV funding, limit the number of students to whom it could disburse such funds or impose other restrictions. In addition, the DOE may take emergency action to suspend any of our U.S. Institutions' certifications without advance notice if it receives reliable information that an institution is violating Title IV requirements and it determines that immediate action is necessary to prevent misuse of Title IV funds. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our U.S. Institutions' enrollments and our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur U.S. Institutions would lose their ability to participate in Title IV programs if they fail to maintain their institutional accreditation, and our student enrollments could decline if we fail to maintain any of our accreditations or approvals.\nAn institution must be accredited by an accrediting agency recognized by the DOE to participate in Title IV programs. Each of our U.S. Institutions is so accredited, and such accreditation is subject to renewal or review periodically or when necessary. If any of our U.S. Institutions fails to satisfy any of its respective accrediting commission's standards, that institution could lose its accreditation by its respective accrediting commission, which would cause the institution to lose eligibility to participate in Title IV programs and experience a significant decline in total student enrollments. In addition, many of our U.S. Institutions' individual educational programs are accredited by specialized accrediting commissions or approved by specialized state agencies. If any of our U.S. Institutions fails to satisfy the standards of any of those specialized accrediting commissions or state agencies, the institution could lose the specialized accreditation or approval for the affected programs, which could result in materially reduced student enrollments in those programs and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if an accrediting body of one of our U.S.\nInstitutions loses recognition by the DOE, that institution could lose its ability to participate in Title IV programs.\nIf any of our U.S. Institutions fails to obtain or maintain any of its state authorizations in states where such authorization is required or fail to comply with the laws and regulations of such states, that institution may not be able to operate or enroll students in that state, and may not be able to award Title IV program funds to students.\nThe DOE requires that an educational institution be authorized in each state where it physically operates in order to participate in Title IV programs. The level of regulatory oversight varies substantially from state to state. Our campus-based U.S. Institutions are authorized by applicable state educational licensing agencies to operate and to grant degrees or diplomas, which authorizations are required for students at these institutions to be eligible to receive funding under Title IV programs. If any of our U.S. Institutions fails to continuously satisfy applicable standards for maintaining its state authorization in a state in which that institution is physically located, that institution could lose its authorization from the applicable state educational agency to offer educational programs and could be forced to cease operations in that state. Such a loss of authorization would also cause that institution's location in the state to lose eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to extensive laws and regulations by the states in which we are authorized or licensed to operate. State laws typically establish standards for instruction, qualifications of faculty, administrative procedures, marketing, recruiting, financial operations and other operational matters. State laws and regulations are subject to change and may limit our ability to offer educational programs and to award degrees and may limit the ability of our students to sit for certification exams in their chosen fields of study. In addition, as mentioned above, attorneys general in several states have become more active in enforcing state consumer protection laws. In addition, we may be subject to litigation by private parties alleging that we violated state laws regarding the educational programs we provide and their operations. For more information on these lawsuits, see \"Item 3 - Legal Proceedings.\"\nMany states also have sought to assert jurisdiction, whether through adoption of new laws and regulations or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations, over out-of-state educational institutions offering online degree programs that have no physical location or other presence in the state but that have some activity in the state, such as enrolling or offering educational services to students who reside in the state, employing faculty who reside in the state or advertising to or recruiting prospective students in the state. State regulatory requirements for online education are inconsistent between states and not well developed in many jurisdictions. As such, these requirements change frequently and, in some instances, are not clear or are left to the discretion of state employees or agents. State regulatory agencies may sometimes disagree with the way we have interpreted or applied these requirements. Any misinterpretation by us of these regulatory requirements or adverse changes in regulations or interpretations of these regulations by state licensing agencies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur online educational programs offered by our U.S. Institutions and the constantly changing regulatory environment require us to continually evaluate our state regulatory compliance activities. We review the licensure or authorization requirements of other states to determine whether our activities in those states constitute a presence or otherwise require licensure or authorization by the respective state education agencies. Therefore, in addition to the states where we maintain physical facilities, we have obtained, or are in the process of obtaining, approvals or exemptions that we believe are necessary in connection with our activities that may constitute a presence in such other states requiring licensure or authorization by the state educational agency based on the laws, rules or regulations of that state. Some of our approvals are pending or are in the renewal process.\nIn recent years, regional state compacts have created the National Council for State Authorization Reciprocity Agreements (\"NC-SARA\"), which is a voluntary agreement among member states and U.S. territories that establishes comparable national standards for interstate offering of postsecondary distance-education courses and programs. As of the date of this filing, all states except California participate in NC-SARA. NC-SARA requires each participating institution to have a federal composite score as measured by the DOE at the parent level of a 1.5 (or a 1.0 with justification acceptable to the state). Neither of our U.S. Institutions participates in NC-SARA because Laureate has a composite score of below 1.0. Accordingly, our U.S. Institutions must apply for and comply with each state's authorization requirements. Many states have established or are proposing legislation to create new or different criteria for authorization of \"non-SARA\" institutions, including requiring them to post bonds and/or meet composite score requirements. If our U.S. Institutions do not meet these requirements, they may not enroll students in that state, which could have a material impact on our business.\nAdditionally, the DOE is currently reviewing its state authorization requirements pertaining to distance education. On December 19, 2016, the DOE published final regulations regarding state authorization for programs offered through distance education and state authorization for foreign locations of institutions. Among other provisions, these final regulations require that an institution participating in the Title IV federal student aid programs and offering post-secondary education through distance education be authorized by each state in which the institution enrolls students, if such authorization is required by the state, as well as required each institution to document and make certain disclosures regarding the state process for resolving complaints for programs offered through distance education or correspondence. The DOE would recognize, although not specifically require, authorization through participation in a state authorization reciprocity agreement, if the agreement does not prevent a state from enforcing its own laws. These regulations were meant to take effect on July 1, 2018, but the DOE announced a delay and has since begun a new rulemaking process in January of 2019 that includes a review of these regulations. We cannot predict with certainty when these new regulations would be finalized or effective.\nAny failure to comply with state requirements for our campuses or our distance education programs, or any new or modified regulations at the federal or state level, could result in our inability to enroll students or receive Title IV funds for students in those states and could result in restrictions on our growth and enrollments. If any of our U.S. Institutions fails to comply with state licensure or authorization requirements, we could be subject to various sanctions, including restrictions on recruiting students, providing educational programs and other activities in that state, and fines and penalties. Additionally, new laws, regulations or interpretations related to providing online educational programs and services could increase our cost of doing business and affect our ability to recruit students in particular states, which could, in turn, negatively affect enrollments and revenues and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe inability of our graduates to obtain licensure or other specialized outcomes in their chosen professional fields of study could reduce our enrollments and revenues, and potentially lead to litigation that could be costly to us.\nCertain of our graduates seek professional licensure or other specialized outcomes in their chosen fields following graduation. Their success in obtaining these outcomes depends on several factors, including the individual merits of the learner, but also may depend on whether the institution or its programs were approved by the state or by a professional association, whether the program from which the learner graduated meets all state requirements and whether the institution is accredited. In addition, professional associations may refuse to certify specialized outcomes for our learners. The state requirements for licensure are subject to change, as are the professional certification standards, and we may not immediately become aware of changes that may impact our learners in certain instances. Also, the final gainful employment regulations require an institution to certify to the DOE that its\neducational programs subject to the gainful employment requirements, which include all programs offered by our U.S. Institutions, meet the applicable requirements for graduates to be professionally or occupationally certified in the state in which the institution is located. In the event that one or more states refuses to recognize our learners for professional licensure, and/or professional associations refuse to certify specialized outcomes for our learners, based on factors relating to our institution or programs, the potential growth of our programs would be negatively affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, we could be exposed to litigation that would force us to incur legal and other expenses that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIncreased regulatory and enforcement effort of consumer protection laws could be a catalyst for legislative or regulatory restrictions, investigations, enforcement actions and claims that could, individually or in the aggregate, materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn recent years, the proprietary education industry has experienced broad-based, intensifying scrutiny in the form of increased investigations and enforcement actions. Attorneys general and educational authorizing agencies in several states, as well as the FTC and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau have become more active in enforcing consumer protection laws, especially related to recruiting practices and the financing of education at proprietary educational institutions.\nIn addition, the DOE has specific rules prohibiting substantial misrepresentations to students, members of the public, accrediting agencies and state licensing agencies, as well as the DOE. In the event that the DOE determines that an institution engaged in a substantial misrepresentation, it can revoke the institution's program participation agreement, impose limitations on the institution's participation in Title IV programs, deny participation applications on behalf of the institution, or seek to fine, suspend or terminate the institution's participation in Title IV programs. These regulations provide grounds for private litigants to seek to enforce the expanded regulations through False Claims Act litigation.\nIn the event that any of our past or current business practices are found to violate applicable consumer protection laws, or if we are found to have made misrepresentations to our current or prospective students about our educational programs, we could be subject to monetary fines or penalties and possible limitations on the manner in which we conduct our business, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. To the extent that more states or government agencies commence investigations, act in concert, or direct their focus on our U.S. Institutions, the cost of responding to these inquiries and investigations could increase significantly, and the potential impact on our business would be substantially greater.\nIf any of our U.S. Institutions do not comply with the DOE's \"administrative capability\" standards, we could suffer financial penalties, be required to accept other limitations to continue participating in Title IV programs or lose our eligibility to participate in Title IV programs.\nDOE regulations specify extensive criteria an institution must satisfy to establish that it has the requisite \"administrative capability\" to participate in Title IV programs. These criteria require, among other things, that we comply with all applicable Title IV program regulations; have capable and sufficient personnel to administer the federal student financial aid programs; not have student loan cohort default rates in excess of specified levels; have acceptable methods of defining and measuring the satisfactory academic progress of our students; have various procedures in place for safeguarding federal funds; not be, and not have any principal or affiliate who is, debarred or suspended from federal contracting or engaging in activity that is cause for debarment or suspension; provide financial aid counseling to our students; refer to the DOE's Office of Inspector General any credible information indicating that any applicant, student, employee or agent of the institution has been\nengaged in any fraud or other illegal conduct involving Title IV programs; submit in a timely manner all reports and financial statements required by Title IV regulations; and not otherwise appear to lack administrative capability. If an institution fails to satisfy any of these criteria or comply with any other DOE regulations, the DOE may change the institution's method of receiving Title IV program funds, which in some cases may result in a significant delay in the institution's receipt of those funds; place the institution on provisional certification status; or commence a proceeding to impose a fine or to limit, suspend or terminate the participation of the institution in Title IV programs. Thus, if any of our U.S. Institutions were found not to have satisfied the DOE's \"administrative capability\" requirements, we could be limited in our access to, or lose, Title IV program funding, which could significantly reduce our enrollments and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe could also be subject to fines or penalties related to findings cited in our regulatory compliance reviews. For more information, see \"-Government, regulatory agencies, accrediting bodies and third parties may conduct compliance reviews, bring claims or initiate litigation against us.\"\nIf any of our U.S. Institutions do not meet specific financial responsibility standards established by the DOE, that institution may be required to post a letter of credit or accept other limitations to continue participating in Title IV programs, or that institution could lose its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs.\nTo participate in Title IV programs, our U.S. Institutions must satisfy specific measures of financial responsibility prescribed by the DOE, or post a letter of credit in favor of the DOE and possibly accept other conditions on its participation in Title IV programs. These financial responsibility tests are applied on an annual basis based on an institution's audited financial statements, and may be applied at other times, such as if an institution undergoes a change in control. The DOE may also apply such measures of financial responsibility to an eligible institution's operating company and ownership entities and, if such measures are not satisfied by the operating company or ownership entities, require the institution to post a letter of credit in favor of the DOE and possibly accept other conditions on its participation in Title IV programs. The operating restrictions that may be placed on an institution that does not meet the quantitative standards of financial responsibility include changes to the method of receiving Title IV program funds, which in some cases may result in a significant delay in the institution's receipt of those funds. Limitations on, or termination of, our participation in Title IV programs as a result of our failure to demonstrate financial responsibility would limit our students' access to Title IV program funds, which could significantly reduce enrollments and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs described in more detail under \"Item 1 - Business-Industry Regulation-U.S. Regulation\" in our 2018 Form 10-K, the DOE annually assesses our U.S. Institutions' financial responsibility through a composite score determination based on the Laureate consolidated audited financial statements and not at the individual institutional level. Based on Laureate's composite score for its fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, the DOE determined that it, and consequently, Walden University and NewSchool of Architecture and Design, failed to meet the standards of financial responsibility. As a result, in a letter sent to Laureate on November 20, 2018, the Department required Laureate to increase its existing letter of credit to $139,002,398 (15% of the Title IV program funds that Walden University and the other institutions that Laureate owned in the U.S. at that time received during the most recently completed fiscal year), continued the institutions on Heightened Cash Monitoring 1 and required Laureate to continue to comply with additional notification and reporting requirements, including submitting bi-weekly cash flow statements for Laureate and monthly student rosters of the institutions, which has been a requirement since April 2018.\nOn November 1, 2016, as part of its defense to repayment rulemaking, the DOE issued a rule to revise its general standards of financial responsibility to include various actions and events that would require institutions to provide the DOE with irrevocable letters of credit upon the occurrence of\ncertain triggering events. Due to litigation, the 2016 DTR regulations were reinstated as of October 16, 2018. For additional information regarding this rule and current rulemaking, see \"Risk Factors-Risks Relating to Our Highly Regulated Industry in the United States-The DOE may adopt regulations governing federal student loan debt forgiveness that could result in liability for amounts based on borrower defenses or affect the DOE's assessment of our institutional capability,\" in our Form 10-K. If we are required to repay the DOE for any successful DTR claims by students who attended our U.S. Institutions, or we are required to obtain additional letters of credit or increase our current letter of credit, it could materially affect our business, financial conditions and results of operations.\nIn addition, an institution participating in Title IV programs must calculate the amount of unearned Title IV program funds that it has disbursed to students who withdraw from their educational programs before completing such programs and must return those unearned funds to the appropriate lender or the DOE in a timely manner, generally within 45 days of the date the institution determines that the student has withdrawn. If any of our U.S. Institutions does not properly calculate and timely return the unearned funds for a sufficient percentage of students, that institution may have to post a letter of credit in favor of the DOE equal to 25% of Title IV program funds that should have been returned for such students in the prior fiscal year. Additionally, if any of our U.S. Institutions does not correctly calculate and timely return unearned Title IV program funds, that institution may be liable for repayment of Title IV funds and related interest and may be fined, sanctioned, or otherwise subject to adverse actions by the DOE, including termination of that institution's participation in Title IV programs. Any of these adverse actions could increase our cost of regulatory compliance and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe DOE may change our U.S. Institutions' method of receiving Title IV program funds, which could materially adversely affect our liquidity.\nThe DOE can impose sanctions for violating the statutory and regulatory requirements of Title IV programs, including transferring one or more of our U.S. Institutions from the advance method or the heightened cash monitoring level one method of Title IV payment, each of which permits an institution to receive Title IV funds before or concurrently with disbursing them to students, to the heightened cash monitoring level two method of payment or to the reimbursement method of payment, each of which may significantly delay an institution's receipt of Title IV funds until student eligibility has been verified by the DOE. Any such delay in our U.S. Institutions' receipt of Title IV program funds may materially adversely affect our cash flows and we may require additional working capital or third-party funding to finance our operations.\nOur U.S. Institutions may lose eligibility to participate in Title IV programs if the percentage of our U.S. Institutions revenues derived from Title IV programs is too high.\nA provision of the HEA commonly referred to as the \"90/10 Rule\" provides that a for-profit educational institution loses its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs if, under a complex regulatory formula that requires cash basis accounting and other adjustments to the calculation of revenues, the institution derives more than 90% of its revenues from Title IV program funds for any two consecutive fiscal years. If any of our U.S. Institutions were to violate the 90/10 Rule, that institution would become ineligible to participate in Title IV programs as of the first day of the fiscal year following the second consecutive fiscal year in which the institution exceeded the 90% threshold and would be unable to regain eligibility for two fiscal years thereafter. In addition, an institution that derives more than 90% of its revenue (on a cash basis) from Title IV programs for any single fiscal year will be placed on provisional certification for at least two fiscal years and may be subject to additional conditions or sanctions imposed by the DOE. Using the DOE's formula under the \"90/10 Rule,\" Walden University and NSAD derived approximately 76% and 36% of their revenues (calculated on a cash basis), respectively, from Title IV program funds for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.\nWalden University's ratio could increase in the future. Congressional increases in students' Title IV grant and loan limits may result in an increase in the revenues we receive from Title IV programs. In recent years, legislation has been introduced in Congress that would revise the 90/10 Rule to consider educational benefits for veterans and military personnel from the Department of Veteran Affairs and Department of Defense, respectively, in the same manner as Title IV funds for purposes of the rule, to prohibit institutions from participating in Title IV programs for one year if they derive more than 90% of their total revenues (calculated on a cash basis) from the Title IV programs and these other federal programs in a single fiscal year rather than the current rule of two consecutive fiscal years, and to revise the 90/10 Rule to an 85/15 rule. We cannot predict whether, or the extent to which, any of these proposed revisions could be enacted into law. In addition, reductions in state appropriations in a number of areas, including with respect to the amount of financial assistance provided to post-secondary students, could further increase our U.S. Institutions' percentages of revenues derived from Title IV program funds. The employment circumstances of our students or their parents could also increase reliance on Title IV program funds. If Walden University becomes ineligible to participate in Title IV programs as a result of noncompliance with the 90/10 Rule, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny of our U.S. Institutions may lose eligibility to participate in Title IV programs if their respective student loan default rates are too high.\nAn educational institution may lose eligibility to participate in Title IV programs if, for three consecutive years, 30% or more of its students who were required to begin repayment on their federal student loans in the relevant fiscal year default on their payment by the end of the next federal fiscal year. In addition, an institution may lose its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs if the default rate as determined by the DOE of its students exceeds 40% for any single year. The Department of Education generally publishes official cohort default rates annually in September for the repayment period that ended the prior September 30.\nNewSchool of Architecture and Design's official cohort default rates for the 2015, 2014 and 2013 federal fiscal years were 7.4%, 5.2% and 5.1%, respectively. Walden University's official cohort default rates for the 2015, 2014 and 2013 federal fiscal years were 7.3%, 7.5% and 6.7%, respectively. The average national student loan default rates published by the DOE for all institutions that participated in the federal student aid programs for 2015, 2014 and 2013 were 10.8%, 11.5% and 11.3%, respectively, and for all proprietary institutions that participated in the federal student aid programs for 2015, 2014 and 2013 were 15.6%, 15.5% and 15.0%, respectively.\nWhile we believe neither of our institutions is in danger of exceeding the regulatory default rate thresholds for other Title IV programs, we cannot provide any assurance that this will continue to be the case. Any increase in interest rates on federal loans, as well as declines in income or job losses for our students, could contribute to higher default rates on student loans. Exceeding the student loan default rate thresholds and losing eligibility to participate in Title IV programs would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any future changes in the formula for calculating student loan default rates, economic conditions or other factors that cause our default rates to increase, could place our U.S. Institutions in danger of losing their eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe could be subject to sanctions or other adverse legal actions if any of our U.S. Institutions were to pay impermissible commissions, bonuses or other incentive payments to individuals involved in or with responsibility for certain recruiting, admission or financial aid activities.\nUnder the HEA an institution participating in Title IV programs may not pay any commission, bonus or other incentive payments to any person involved in student recruitment or admissions or\nawarding of Title IV program funds, if such payments are based in any part, directly or indirectly, on success in enrolling students or obtaining student financial aid. Failure to comply could result in monetary penalties and/or sanctions imposed by the DOE, which could result in lower enrollments, revenue, and net operating income. The law and regulations governing this requirement do not establish clear criteria for compliance in all circumstances, creating uncertainty about what constitutes incentive compensation and which employees are covered by the regulation, rendering development of effective and compliant performance metrics more difficult to establish.\nIn addition, in recent years, several for-profit education companies have been faced with whistleblower lawsuits under the Federal False Claims Act, known as \"qui tam\" cases, by current or former employees alleging violations of the prohibition against incentive compensation. If the DOE were to determine that we or any of our U.S. Institutions violated the prohibition regarding impermissible commissions, or if we were to be found liable in a False Claims action alleging a violation of this law, or if any third parties we have engaged were to violate this law, we could be fined or sanctioned by the DOE, or subjected to other monetary liability or penalties that could be substantial, including the possibility of treble damages under a False Claims action, any of which could harm our reputation, impose significant costs and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe or certain of our educational programs at our U.S. Institutions may lose eligibility to participate in Title IV programs if any of our U.S. Institutions or certain of their educational programs cannot satisfy the DOE's \"gainful employment\" requirements.\nUnder the HEA, proprietary schools generally are eligible to participate in Title IV programs in respect of educational programs that lead to \"gainful employment in a recognized occupation.\" Historically, the concept of \"gainful employment\" has not been defined in detail. On October 30, 2014, the DOE published regulations to define \"gainful employment,\" which became effective on July 1, 2015. The regulations define this concept using two ratios, one based on annual debt-to-annual earnings (\"DTE\") and another based on annual debt-to-discretionary income (\"DTI\") ratio. Under the regulations, an educational program with a DTE ratio at or below 8% or a DTI ratio at or below 20% is considered \"passing.\" An educational program with a DTE ratio greater than 8% but less than or equal to 12% or a DTI ratio greater than 20% but less than or equal to 30% is considered to be \"in the zone.\" An educational program with a DTE ratio greater than 12% and a DTI ratio greater than 30% is considered \"failing.\" An educational program will cease to be eligible for students to receive Title IV program funds if its DTE and DTI ratios are failing in two out of any three consecutive award years or if both of those rates are failing or in the zone for four consecutive award years. The regulations also require an institution to provide warnings to current and prospective students in programs which may lose Title IV eligibility at the end of an award or fiscal year. For more information, see \"Item 1 - Business-Industry Regulation-U.S. Regulation-Regulation of Federal Student Financial Aid Programs-Gainful Employment.\"\nIn January 2017, the DOE issued final DTE rates to institutions. Of the programs currently offered by NewSchool of Architecture and Design and Walden University, three programs are in the zone. Additionally, the regulations require an institution to certify to the DOE that its educational programs subject to the gainful employment requirements, which include all programs offered by our U.S. Institutions, meet the applicable requirements for graduates to be professionally or occupationally licensed or certified in the state in which the institution is located. The regulations also include requirements for the reporting of student and program data by institutions to the DOE and expand the disclosure requirements that have been in effect since July 1, 2011.\nThe DOE decided to review its gainful employment regulations by negotiated rulemaking in early 2018, but failed to meet consensus on the DOE's proposed regulatory changes. On August 14, 2018, the DOE released a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking which would rescind its gainful employment\nregulations and related requirements. Comments were due September 13, 2018. The DOE did not meet the master calendar deadline of November 1 to issue a new regulation to rescind the gainful employment requirements, and therefore it is not clear when any new such regulation to repeal these regulations will become effective. While the DOE has required institutions to continue to report data to the DOE, it has not issued new GE metrics for institutions and has delayed certain disclosure requirements. We cannot predict with any certainty the outcome of the DOE's proposal to rescind the gainful employment regulations or the extent to which it ultimately proposes gainful employment regulations that differ from the current regulations.\nThe failure of any program or programs offered by any of our U.S. Institutions to satisfy any gainful employment regulations could render that program or programs ineligible for Title IV program funds and we may choose to cease offering the program or programs. Additionally, any gainful employment data released by the DOE about our U.S. Institutions or warnings provided under the regulations could influence current students not to continue their studies, discourage prospective students from enrolling in our programs or negatively impact our reputation. Due to GE certification requirements, it is possible that several programs offered by our schools may be adversely affected by the regulations due to lack of specialized program accreditation, licensure or certification or in the states in which such institutions are based. We also could be required to make changes to certain programs in the future in order to comply with the rule or to avoid the uncertainty associated with such compliance. Any of these factors could reduce enrollments, impact tuition prices, and have a material adverse effect on our U.S. Institutions' business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to maintain adequate systems and processes to detect and prevent fraudulent activity in student enrollment and financial aid, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nHigher educational institutions are susceptible to an increased risk of fraudulent activity by outside parties with respect to student enrollment and student financial aid programs. The DOE's regulations require institutions that participate in Title IV programs to refer to the Office of Inspector General credible information indicating that any applicant, employee, third-party servicer or agent of the institution that acts in a capacity that involves administration of the Title IV programs has been engaged in any fraud or other illegal conduct involving Title IV programs. We cannot be certain that our systems and processes will always be adequate in the face of increasingly sophisticated and ever-changing fraud schemes. The potential for outside parties to perpetrate fraud in connection with the award and disbursement of Title IV program funds, including as a result of identity theft, may be heightened due to our U.S. Institutions offering various educational programs via distance education. Any significant failure by one or more of our U.S. Institutions to adequately detect fraudulent activity related to student enrollment and financial aid could result in loss of accreditation at the discretion of the institutions' accrediting agency, which would result in the institution losing eligibility for Title IV programs, or in direct action by the DOE to limit or terminate the institution's Title IV program participation. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGovernment, regulatory agencies, accrediting bodies and third parties may conduct compliance reviews, bring claims or initiate litigation against us.\nBecause we operate in a highly regulated industry, we may be subject to compliance reviews and claims of noncompliance and lawsuits by government agencies, regulatory agencies and third parties, including claims brought by third parties on behalf of the federal government. See also \"-We could be subject to sanctions if any of our U.S. Institutions fails to correctly calculate and timely return Title IV program funds for students who withdraw before completing their educational program.\"\nOn September 8, 2016, as part of a program review that the Minnesota Office of Higher Education (\"MOHE\") is conducting of Walden University's doctoral programs, MOHE sent to Walden\nUniversity an information request regarding its doctoral programs and complaints filed by doctoral students, to which we have responded. We cannot predict the timing or outcome of this matter. However, if MOHE makes an adverse determination, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Higher Learning Commission conducted an on-site mid-cycle review of Walden University on May 1, 2017. The Higher Learning Commission determined that Walden University met the accreditation criteria, with the exception of two, for which it is requiring the school to submit follow-up reports. Specifically, Walden University was required to submit an interim report by May 2018 regarding its progress in addressing the \"material weakness\" (pertaining to Laureate's control over information technology systems) as identified by its auditors in its December 31, 2016 financial statements, and must submit a second interim report by May 2019 regarding retention and graduation rate improvements to doctoral programs.\nIf the results of these or other reviews or proceedings are unfavorable to us, or if we are unable to defend successfully against lawsuits or claims, we may be required to pay money damages or be subject to fines, limitations, loss of eligibility for Title IV program funding at our U.S. Institutions, injunctions or other penalties. We may also lose or have limitations imposed on our accreditations, licensing or Title IV program participation, be required to pay monetary damages or be limited in our ability to open new institutions or add new program offerings. Even if we adequately address issues raised by an agency review or successfully defend a lawsuit or claim, we may have to divert significant financial and management resources from our ongoing business operations to address issues raised by those reviews or to defend against those lawsuits or claims. Additionally, we may experience adverse collateral consequences, including declines in the number of students enrolling at our institutions and the willingness of third parties to deal with us or our institutions, as a result of any negative publicity associated with such reviews, claims or litigation. Claims and lawsuits brought against us may damage our reputation or cause us to incur expenses, even if such claims and lawsuits are without merit, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Relating to Our Indebtedness\nThe fact that we have substantial debt could materially adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations and limit our ability to pursue our strategy or to react to changes in the economy or our industry.\nWe have substantial debt. As of December 31, 2018, we had outstanding: (a) a senior secured credit facility (the \"Senior Secured Credit Facilities\") consisting of (1) a multi-currency revolving credit facility scheduled to mature in April 2022 and (2) a senior secured term loan facility scheduled to mature in April 2024 (the \"2024 Term Loan\"); (b) senior notes consisting of Senior Notes due 2025; and (c) other long term indebtedness, consisting of capital lease obligations, notes payable, seller notes and borrowings against certain lines of credit. Our debt could have important negative consequences to our business, including:\n\u2022 increasing the difficulty of our ability to make payments on our outstanding debt;\n\u2022 increasing our vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions because our debt payment obligations may limit our ability to use our cash to respond to or defend against changes in the industry or the economy;\n\u2022 requiring a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, therefore reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities or to pay dividends;\n\u2022 limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes;\n\u2022 limiting our ability to pursue our strategy;\n\u2022 limiting our ability to adjust to changing market conditions; and\n\u2022 placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who are less highly leveraged.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, subject to the restrictions contained in the senior secured credit agreement governing our Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the indenture governing our outstanding Senior Notes due 2025. If new indebtedness is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we now face could intensify.\nOur debt agreements contain, and future debt agreements may contain, restrictions that may limit our flexibility in operating our business.\nThe senior secured credit agreement governing our Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the indenture governing our outstanding Senior Notes due 2025 contain various covenants that may limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. These covenants limit our and our restricted subsidiaries' ability to, among other things:\n\u2022 pay dividends and make certain distributions, investments and other restricted payments;\n\u2022 incur additional indebtedness, issue disqualified stock or issue certain preferred shares;\n\u2022 sell assets;\n\u2022 enter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022 create certain liens or encumbrances;\n\u2022 preserve our corporate existence;\n\u2022 merge, consolidate, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets; and\n\u2022 designate our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries.\nIn addition, the senior secured credit agreement governing our Senior Secured Credit Facilities provides for compliance with the Consolidated Senior Secured Debt to Consolidated EBITDA Ratio, as defined in the senior secured credit agreement, solely with respect to the revolving line of credit facility, which is tested quarterly. The maximum ratio, as defined, was 4.5x at September 30, 2017, and 3.75x and 3.5x at December 31, 2017 and 2018, respectively. As of December 31, 2018, we satisfied certain conditions under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities; therefore, we were not subject to this leverage ratio covenant as of December 31, 2018.\nThe senior secured credit agreement governing our Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the indenture governing our outstanding Senior Notes due 2025 also include cross-default provisions applicable to other agreements. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the agreement governing such indebtedness, including as a result of cross-default provisions. In addition, failure to make payments or observe certain covenants on the indebtedness of our subsidiaries may cause a cross default on our Senior Secured Credit Facilities and our outstanding Senior Notes due 2025. Upon our failure to maintain compliance with these covenants, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit. If the lenders under such indebtedness accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient assets to repay those borrowings, as well as our other indebtedness. We have pledged a significant portion of our assets as collateral under our Senior\nSecured Credit Facilities. If we were unable to repay those amounts, the lenders under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness.\nWe rely on contractual arrangements and other payments, advances and transfers of funds from our operating subsidiaries to meet our debt service and other obligations.\nWe conduct all of our operations through certain of our subsidiaries, and we have no significant assets other than cash of $11.1 million as of December 31, 2018 held at corporate entities and the capital stock or other control rights of our subsidiaries. As a result, we rely on payments from contractual arrangements, such as intellectual property royalty, network fee and management services agreements. In addition, we also rely upon intercompany loan repayments and other payments from our operating subsidiaries to meet any existing or future debt service and other obligations, a substantial portion of which are denominated in U.S. dollars. The ability of our operating subsidiaries to pay dividends or to make distributions or other payments to their parent companies or directly to us will depend on their respective operating results and may be restricted by, among other things, the laws of their respective jurisdictions of organization, regulatory requirements, agreements entered into by those operating subsidiaries and the covenants of any existing or future outstanding indebtedness that we or our subsidiaries may incur. For example, our VIE institutions generally are not permitted to pay dividends. Further, because most of our income is generated by our operating subsidiaries in non-U.S. dollar denominated currencies, our ability to service our U.S. dollar denominated debt obligations may be affected by any strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to the functional currencies of our operating subsidiaries.\nDisruptions of the credit and equity markets worldwide may impede or prevent our access to the capital markets for additional funding to expand our business and may affect the availability or cost of borrowing under our existing senior secured credit facilities.\nThe credit and equity markets of both mature and developing economies have historically experienced extraordinary volatility, asset erosion and uncertainty, leading to governmental intervention in the banking sector in the United States and abroad. If these market disruptions occur in the future, we may not be able to access the capital markets to obtain funding needed to refinance our existing indebtedness or expand our business. In addition, changes in the capital or other legal requirements applicable to commercial lenders may affect the availability or increase the cost of borrowing under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities. If we are unable to obtain needed capital on terms acceptable to us, we may need to limit our growth initiatives or take other actions that materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur variable rate debt exposes us to interest rate risk which could materially adversely affect our cash flow.\nBorrowings under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities and certain local credit facilities bear interest at variable rates and other debt we incur also could be variable-rate debt. If market interest rates increase, variable-rate debt will create higher debt service requirements, which could materially adversely affect our cash flow. If these rates were to increase significantly, the risks related to our substantial debt would intensify. While we have and may in the future enter into agreements limiting our exposure to higher interest rates, any such agreements may not offer complete protection from this risk. Based on our outstanding variable-rate debt as of December 31, 2018, after factoring in the impact of derivatives, an increase of 1% in interest rates would result in an increase in interest expense of approximately $17.6 million on an annual basis.\nIn addition, borrowings under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities carry an interest rate based on LIBOR. On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. It is unclear whether new methods\nof calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions, is considering replacing U.S. dollar LIBOR with a newly-created index, calculated by reference to short-term repurchase agreements backed by U.S. Treasury securities, called the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\"). The first publication of SOFR was released by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in April 2018. Whether SOFR will become a widely-accepted benchmark in place of LIBOR, however, remains in question. As such, the future of LIBOR and potential alternatives thereto are uncertain at this time. If LIBOR ceases to exist, we may need to renegotiate our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, which extend beyond 2021, to replace LIBOR with the new standard that is established. The potential effects of the foregoing on our cost of capital cannot yet be determined.\nRisks Relating to Investing in Our Class A Common Stock\nOur status as a public benefit corporation and a Certified B Corporation may not result in the benefits that we anticipate.\nWe are a public benefit corporation under Delaware law. As a public benefit corporation we are required to balance the financial interests of our stockholders with the best interests of those stakeholders materially affected by our conduct, including particularly those affected by the specific benefit purpose relating to education set forth in our certificate of incorporation. In addition, there is no assurance that the expected positive impact from being a public benefit corporation will be realized. Accordingly, being a public benefit corporation and complying with our related obligations could negatively impact our ability to provide the highest possible return to our stockholders.\nAs a public benefit corporation, we are required to publicly disclose a report at least biennially on our overall public benefit performance and on our assessment of our success in achieving our specific public benefit purpose. If we are not timely or are unable to provide this report, or if the report is not viewed favorably by parties doing business with us or regulators or others reviewing our credentials, our reputation and status as a public benefit corporation may be harmed.\nWhile not required by Delaware law or the terms of our certificate of incorporation, we have elected to have our social and environmental performance, accountability and transparency assessed against the proprietary criteria established by an independent non-profit organization. As a result of this assessment, we have been designated as a \"Certified B CorporationTM,\" which refers to companies that are certified as meeting certain levels of social and environmental performance, accountability and transparency. The standards for Certified B Corporation certification are set by an independent organization and may change over time. See \"Item 1 - Business-Certified B Corporation.\" Our reputation could be harmed if we lose our status as a Certified B Corporation, whether by our choice or by our failure to continue to meet the certification requirements, if that failure or change were to create a perception that we are more focused on financial performance and are no longer as committed to the values shared by Certified B Corporations. Likewise, our reputation could be harmed if our publicly reported Certified B Corporation score declines.\nAs a public benefit corporation, our focus on a specific public benefit purpose and producing a positive effect for society may negatively influence our financial performance.\nAs a public benefit corporation, we may take actions that we believe will benefit our students and the surrounding communities, even if those actions do not maximize our short- or medium-term financial results. While we believe that this designation and obligation will benefit the Company given the importance to our long-term success of our commitment to education, it could cause our board of directors to make decisions and take actions not in keeping with the short-term or more narrow\ninterests of our stockholders. Any longer-term benefits may not materialize within the timeframe we expect or at all and may have an immediate negative effect. For example:\n\u2022 we may choose to revise our policies in ways that we believe will be beneficial to our students and their communities in the long term, even though the changes may be costly in the short- or medium-term;\n\u2022 we may take actions, such as modernizing campuses to provide students with the latest technology, even though these actions may be more costly than other alternatives;\n\u2022 in exiting a market that is not meeting our goals, we may choose to \"teach out\" the existing student body over several years rather than lose an institution; even though this could be substantially more expensive;\n\u2022 we may be influenced to pursue programs and services to demonstrate our commitment to our students and communities even though there is no immediate return to our stockholders; or\n\u2022 in responding to a possible proposal to acquire the Company, our board of directors may be influenced by the interests of our employees, students, teachers and others whose interests may be different from the interests of our stockholders.\nWe may be unable or slow to realize the long-term benefits we expect from actions taken to benefit our students and communities in which we operate, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline.\nThe price of our Class A common stock has been and may continue to be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment as a result.\nWe completed our IPO in February 2017. Since our IPO, the price of our Class A common stock, as reported by the Nasdaq Global Select Market, has ranged from a low of $10.46 on November 15, 2017 to a high of $18.96 on June 28, 2017. The trading price of our Class A common stock may continue to fluctuate and is dependent upon a number of factors, including those described in this \"Item 1A - Risk Factors\" section, many of which are beyond our control and may not be related to our operating performance. These fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of your investment in our Class A common stock as you may be unable to sell your shares at or above the price you paid, or at all. Factors that could cause fluctuations in the trading price of our Class A common stock include the following:\n\u2022 quarterly variations in our results of operations;\n\u2022 results of operations that vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors;\n\u2022 results of operations that vary from those of our competitors;\n\u2022 changes in expectations as to our future financial performance, including financial estimates by securities analysts and investors;\n\u2022 our or our competitors' introduction of new institutions, new programs, concepts or pricing policies;\n\u2022 announcements by us, our competitors or our vendors of significant acquisitions, joint marketing relationships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u2022 changes in laws or conditions in the education industry, the financial markets or the economy as a whole;\n\u2022 failure of any of our institutions to secure or maintain accreditation or licensure;\n\u2022 announcements of regulatory or other investigations, adverse regulatory action by any regulatory body including those overseas or the DOE, state agencies or accrediting agencies, regulatory scrutiny of our operations or operations of our competitors or lawsuits filed against us or our competitors;\n\u2022 announcements by third parties of significant claims or proceedings against us;\n\u2022 the size of our public float;\n\u2022 changes in senior management or key personnel;\n\u2022 changes in our dividend policy;\n\u2022 adverse resolution of new or pending litigation against us;\n\u2022 the occurrence of any event described in \"Item 1A - Risk Factors\";\n\u2022 issuances, exchanges or sales, or expected issuances, exchanges or sales of our capital stock; and\n\u2022 general domestic and international economic conditions.\nIn the past, following periods of market volatility, stockholders have instituted securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. If we were to become involved in securities litigation, it could have a substantial cost and divert resources and the attention of our management team from our business regardless of the outcome of such litigation.\nIn addition, price volatility may be greater if the public float and trading volume of our Class A common stock is low. As a result, you may suffer a loss on your investment.\nIf we or our existing investors sell or announce an intention to sell additional shares of our Class A common stock, the market price of our Class A common stock could decline.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of Class A common stock in the market, or the perception that such sales could occur. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to raise capital through future sales of equity securities at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate, or at all.\nAs of December 31, 2018, 116,864,948 shares of our Class B common stock were outstanding. Such amount excludes 979,125 shares of Class B common stock issuable upon the exercise of outstanding vested stock options under the 2007 Stock Incentive Plan (the \"2007 Plan\"), 5,906,256 shares of Class B common stock issuable upon the exercise of outstanding vested stock options under the 2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the \"2013 Plan\"), 42,089 shares of Class B common stock subject to outstanding unvested stock options under the 2013 Plan, 2,995,333 shares of Class A common stock and/or Class B common stock reserved for future issuance under the 2013 Plan, and 7,432 shares of Class B common stock reserved for future issuance under the Laureate Education, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan (the \"Deferred Compensation Plan\"). All of our outstanding shares of Class B common stock became eligible for sale on August 5, 2017. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our Class B common stock, which will automatically convert into Class A common stock upon sale, could cause the market price of our Class A common stock to decline.\nBecause we have no current plans to pay cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future, and our debt arrangements place certain restrictions on our ability to do so, you may not receive any return on investment unless you sell your Class A common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it.\nWe may retain future earnings, if any, for future operation, expansion and debt repayment and have no current plans to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. Any decision to declare and\npay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. In addition, our ability to pay dividends may be limited by covenants of any existing and future outstanding indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur, including our Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the indenture governing our outstanding notes. In addition, we are permitted under the terms of our debt instruments to incur additional indebtedness, which may restrict or prevent us from paying dividends on our common stock. Furthermore, our ability to declare and pay dividends may be limited by instruments governing future outstanding indebtedness we may incur. As a result, you may not receive any return on an investment in our Class A common stock unless you sell your Class A common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it.\nThe dual class structure of our common stock as contained in our certificate of incorporation has the effect of concentrating voting control with those stockholders who held our stock prior to our initial public offering, including Wengen and our executive officers, employees and directors and their affiliates, and limiting your ability to influence corporate matters.\nEach share of our Class B common stock has ten votes per share, and each share of our Class A common stock has one vote per share. As of February 15, 2019, stockholders who hold shares of Class B common stock, including Wengen, and our executive officers, employees and directors and their affiliates, together hold approximately 92% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock, and therefore have significant influence over the management affairs of the Company and control over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or its assets, for the foreseeable future. Because of the 10-to-1 voting ratio between our Class B and Class A common stock, the holders of our Class B common stock collectively will continue to control a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock even when the shares of Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the outstanding shares of our Class A and Class B common stock.\nThe Wengen Investors have control over our decisions to enter into any corporate transaction and the ability to prevent any transaction that requires stockholder approval regardless of whether others believe that the transaction is in our best interests. So long as the Wengen Investors continue to have an indirect interest in a majority of our outstanding Class B common stock, they have the ability to control the vote in any election of directors. This concentrated control limits your ability to influence corporate matters. The interests of the Wengen Investors and other holders of Class B common stock may not coincide with the interests of holders of the Class A common stock. In addition, in connection with the completion of our IPO, we entered into a new Wengen Securityholders' Agreement dated as of February 6, 2017, by and among Wengen, Laureate and the other parties thereto (as amended and restated from time to time, the \"Wengen Securityholders' Agreement\"), pursuant to which certain of the Wengen Investors have certain rights to appoint directors to our board of directors and its committees.\nIn addition, the Wengen Investors are in the business of making or advising on investments in companies and may hold, and may from time to time in the future acquire, interests in or provide advice to businesses that directly or indirectly compete with certain portions of our business or are suppliers or customers of ours.\nWe are a \"controlled company\" within the meaning of the Nasdaq rules and, as a result, qualify for, and rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements. Holders of our securities do not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to such requirements.\nWengen controls a majority of the voting power of our outstanding common stock. As a result, we are a \"controlled company\" within the meaning of the Nasdaq corporate governance standards. Under\nthese rules, a company of which more than 50% of the voting power is held by an individual, group or another company is a \"controlled company\" and may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance requirements, including:\n\u2022 the requirement that a majority of the board of directors consist of independent directors;\n\u2022 the requirement that we have a nominating/corporate governance committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee's purpose and responsibilities;\n\u2022 the requirement that we have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee's purpose and responsibilities; and\n\u2022 the requirement for an annual performance evaluation of the nominating/corporate governance and compensation committees.\nWe currently utilize these exemptions and intend to continue to do so. As a result, we do not have a majority of independent directors, our nominating and corporate governance committee and our compensation committee do not consist entirely of independent directors and such committees are not subject to annual performance evaluations. Accordingly, for so long as we are a \"controlled company,\" you will not have the same protections afforded to holders of securities of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of Nasdaq.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the Delaware General Corporation Law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us and could discourage a takeover and adversely affect the holders of our Class A common stock.\nProvisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control of the Company, even if such change in control would be beneficial to the holders of our Class A common stock. These provisions include:\n\u2022 the dual class structure of our common stock;\n\u2022 authorizing the issuance of \"blank check\" preferred stock that could be issued by our board of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a takeover attempt;\n\u2022 prohibiting the use of cumulative voting for the election of directors;\n\u2022 as a public benefit corporation, requiring a two-thirds majority vote of the outstanding stock to effect a non-cash merger with an entity that is not a public benefit corporation with an identical public benefit;\n\u2022 limiting the ability of stockholders to call special meetings or amend our bylaws;\n\u2022 following the conversion of all of our Class B common stock into Class A common stock, requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders; and\n\u2022 establishing advance notice and duration of ownership requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\nThese provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and cause us to take other corporate actions you desire. In addition, because our board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions could in turn affect any attempt by our stockholders to replace current members of our management team.\nWe may issue additional shares of preferred stock in the future, which could make it difficult for another company to acquire us or could otherwise adversely affect holders of our Class A common stock, which could depress the price of our Class A common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue one or more additional series of preferred stock. Our board of directors has the authority to determine the preferences, limitations and relative rights of any additional shares of preferred stock and to fix the number of shares constituting any series and the designation of such series, without any further vote or action by our stockholders. Additional series of preferred stock could be issued with voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to the rights of our Class A common stock. The potential issuance of an additional series of preferred stock may delay or prevent a change in control of us, discourage bids for our Class A common stock at a premium to the market price, and materially adversely affect the market price and the voting and other rights of the holders of our Class A common stock.\nIf we do not maintain adequate coverage of our Class A common stock by securities analysts or if they publish unfavorable commentary about us or our industry or downgrade our Class A common stock, the trading price of our Class A common stock could decline.\nThe trading price for our Class A common stock could be affected by any research or reports that securities analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who cover us or our business downgrade their evaluations of our Class A common stock, the price of our Class A common stock could decline. We may be unable to maintain adequate research coverage, and if one or more analysts cease coverage of our company, we could lose visibility in the market for our Class A common stock, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline.", "PERMNO": 16591, "SIC": 8200, "TIC": "LAUR"}
