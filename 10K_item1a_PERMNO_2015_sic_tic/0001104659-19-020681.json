RISK FACTORS.\nOur business is challenged by a changing environment that involves many known and unknown risks and uncertainties. The risks described below discuss factors that have affected and/or could affect us in the future. There may be others. We may be affected by risks that are currently unknown to us or are immaterial at this time. If any such events did occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected in a material manner. Our future results may also be impacted by other risk factors listed from time to time in our future filings with the SEC, including, but not limited to, our Annual Reports on Form 10-K and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. As the most significant portion of our consolidated entity is represented by the power industry services reportable business segment, the risk factor discussions included below are focused on that business. However, as a large number of these same risks exist for our other reportable segments, (1) industrial fabrication and field services, and (2) telecommunications infrastructure services, a review and assessment of the following risk factors should be performed with that in mind.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nFuture revenues and earnings are dependent on the award of new contracts which we do not directly control.\nThe majority of the Company\u2019s consolidated revenues related to performance by the power industry services segment which provided 76%, 91% and 87% of consolidated revenues for Fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Due primarily to the favorable operating results of GPS, the major business component of this segment, we have generated consolidated net income for over ten fiscal years in a row. This reportable business segment contributed approximately $46 million to income from operations for Fiscal 2019. As described in the risks presented below, our ability to maintain profitable operations depends on many factors including the ability of the power industry services business to continue to obtain significant new EPC projects and to complete its projects successfully. Although revenues for the power industry services reporting segment decreased by 55% for Fiscal 2019 to $368 million, GPS has added two new EPC projects to project backlog and our overall backlog amount increased to $1.1 billion as of January 31, 2019 from $379 million at the beginning of Fiscal 2019. We have not received a full notice to proceed on these two new EPC projects and there is always a possibility that one or more of these projects will not be built. Should we fail to replace major projects that were completed by GPS in Fiscal 2019 with other new projects, we will not grow and future revenues and profits may be adversely affected.\nOur dependence on a few customers could adversely affect us.\nThe size of the energy plant construction projects of our power industry services segment frequently results in a limited number of projects contributing a substantial portion of our consolidated revenues each year. For Fiscal 2019, the Company\u2019s most significant customer relationships included four power industry service customers which together accounted for 51% of consolidated revenues. For Fiscal 2018, the Company\u2019s most significant customer relationships included four power industry service customers which together accounted for 84% of consolidated revenues. For Fiscal 2017, the Company\u2019s most significant customer relationships included five power industry service customers which together represented 79% of consolidated revenues, respectively. Should we fail to obtain the award of any one new major project that we expect, substantial portions of future consolidated revenues, future revenues and profits may be adversely affected.\nOur dependence on large construction contracts may result in uneven financial results.\nOur power industry service activities in any one fiscal reporting period are concentrated on a limited number of large construction projects for which we recognize revenues over time as we transfer control of the project asset to the customer. To a substantial extent, our contract revenues are based on the amounts of costs incurred. As the timing of equipment purchases, subcontractor services and other contract events may not be evenly distributed over the terms of our contracts, the amount of total contract costs may vary from quarter to quarter, creating uneven amounts of quarterly and/or annual consolidated revenues. In addition, the timing of contract commencements and completions may exacerbate the uneven pattern. As a result of the foregoing, future reported amounts of consolidated revenues, cash flow from operations, net income and earnings per share may vary in an uneven pattern and may not be indicative of the operating results expected for any other fiscal period, thus rendering consecutive quarter comparisons of our consolidated operating results a less meaningful way to assess the growth of our business.\nActual results could differ from the assumptions and estimates used to prepare our financial statements.\nTo prepare consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the US, we are required to make estimates, assumptions and judgments as of the date of such financial statements, which affect the reported values of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. For example, we have recognized revenues over the life of a contract based on the proportion of costs incurred to date compared to the total costs estimated to be incurred for the entire project. We review and make necessary revisions to such costs on a monthly basis. In addition, contract results may be impacted by our estimates of the amounts of change orders that we expect to receive and our assessment of any contract disputes that may arise.\nUnder our past accounting procedures, we measured and recognized a large portion of our revenues under the percentage-of-completion accounting methodology. Under the new accounting rules governing revenue recognition, which we adopted on February 1, 2018 (see Note 1 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements), we recognize revenues over time as performance obligations are completed. In most cases, such progress will be measured in a manner similar to past accounting practices using a cost-to-cost method. This methodology will continue to allow us to recognize revenues over the life of a contract by comparing the amount of the costs incurred to date against the total amount of costs expected to be incurred, and using the resulting percentage to update the recorded amounts of project-to-date revenues. As in the past, the effects on revenues of changes to the amounts of contract values and estimated costs typically will be recorded as catch-up adjustments when the amounts are known and can be reasonably estimated. These revisions can occur at any time and could be material. Given the uncertainties associated with the types of customer contracts that we are awarded, it is possible for contract values and actual costs to vary from estimates previously made, which may result in reductions or reversals of previously recorded revenues and profits.\nOther areas requiring significant estimates by our management include:\n\u00b7 the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with business combinations;\n\u00b7 the assessment of the value of goodwill and recoverability of other purchased intangible assets;\n\u00b7 provisions for income taxes, the accounting for uncertain income tax positions and valuation allowances associated with deferred income tax assets;\n\u00b7 the determination of the fair value of stock-based incentive awards;\n\u00b7 the identification of the primary beneficiary of entities in which we may have variable interests; and\n\u00b7 accruals for estimated liabilities, including warranties and losses and expenses related to legal matters.\nOur actual business and financial results could differ from our estimates, which may impact future profits.\nProject backlog may be an uncertain indicator of future revenues as its realization may be subject to unexpected adjustments, delays and cancellations.\nAt January 31, 2019, the value of our project backlog was $1.1 billion. Project cancellations or scope modifications may occur that could reduce the amount of our project backlog and the associated revenues and profits that we actually earn. Projects awarded to us may remain included in our backlog for extended periods of time as customers experience delays in project schedules. Should any unexpected delay, suspension or termination of the work under such contracts occur, our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. For example, in March 2018, GPS entered into an EPC services contract to build a 475 MW natural gas-fired power plant that was added to project backlog. However, due to customer delays, contract activities have not yet started. We cannot guarantee that future revenues projected by us based on our project backlog at January 31, 2019 or forecasted project awards will be realized or will result in profitable operating results.\nIf financing for new energy plants is unavailable or too expensive, construction of such plants may not occur.\nHistorically, natural gas-fired power plants have been constructed typically by large utility companies. However, to a large extent, the construction of new energy plants is conducted by independent power producers including private equity groups. This type of project owner may be challenged in obtaining financing necessary to complete the project. Should debt financing for the construction of new energy facilities not be available or become cost prohibitive, equity investors may not be able to invest in such projects, thereby adversely affecting the likelihood that we will obtain contracts to construct such plants. Since December 2016, the Federal Reserve has increased the target federal funds rate eight times totaling 2.00% to a current range between 2.25% and 2.50%, though it is not expected to have further raises during 2019. Increased rates indicate that the Federal Reserve wants to slow the pace of economic growth by increasing the cost of borrowing. Increased borrowing costs could reduce the rate of return on a planned power plant project and result in it not being built.\nUnsuccessful efforts to develop energy plant projects could result in write-offs and the loss of future business.\nThe development of a power plant construction project is expensive with a total cost that could approximate or exceed $10 million. The commercial developers of power projects may form single purpose entities, such as limited liability companies, limited partnerships or joint ventures, to perform the development activities, which are often funded by outside sources. We periodically see business opportunities where we consider providing financial support to the ownership of a new project, at least during the development phase, in order to improve the probability of an EPC contract being awarded to us.\nWorking with unaffiliated power project development firms, we have been successful by lending funds to single purpose entities formed to develop a natural gas-fired power plant. Each involvement resulted in repayment of the loans to us and, more critically, the award to us of the EPC contacts for the construction of the corresponding plant. In addition, the completed developments resulted in the payment to us of success fees.\nAt present, we are providing support to the development efforts for certain new gas-fired power plant projects including funding provided under development loans. There can be no assurances that we will benefit from the successful development of these projects or others that may arise in the future. The failure of owners to complete the development of power plants in the future would result in the loss of future potential construction business and could result in write-off adjustments related to the balance of any project development costs or amounts lent to potential project owners. Further, our failure to obtain the opportunity to support future power plant development projects and the potential to build the associated power plants could be detrimental to a growing and profitable power industry services business. During Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2017, we recorded minor provisions for uncollectible accounts, which related primarily to outstanding loans made by us to energy project owners as the likelihood of the projects successfully being developed diminished significantly. Larger adjustments related to future developmental projects could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for a future reporting period.\nFuture bonding requirements may adversely affect our ability to compete for new energy plant construction projects.\nOur construction contracts frequently require that we obtain payment and performance bonds from surety companies on behalf of project owners as a condition to the award of such contracts. Historically, we have had a strong bonding capacity. However, under standard terms in the surety market, surety companies issue bonds on a project-by-project basis and can decline to issue bonds at any time or require the posting of additional collateral as a condition to issuing any bonds. Not all of our projects require bonding. As of January 31, 2019, the estimated cost of future work covered by outstanding performance bonds was not significant due to the low level of construction activity at that date. However, as of January 31, 2019, there were bonds outstanding in the aggregate amount of approximately $147 million covering other risks including our warranty obligation related to four EPC services projects completed by GPS during Fiscal 2019.\nMarket conditions, changes in our performance or financial position, changes in our surety\u2019s assessment of its own operating and financial risk or larger future projects could cause our surety company to decline to issue, or substantially reduce the amount of bonds for our work and could increase our bonding costs. These actions can be taken on short notice. If our surety company were to limit or eliminate our access to new bonds, our alternatives would include seeking bonding capacity from other surety companies, joint venturing with other construction firms, increasing business with clients that do not require bonds and posting other forms of collateral for project performance, such as letters of credit, or cash. We may be unable to make alternative arrangements in a timely manner, on acceptable terms, or at all. Accordingly, if we were to experience an interruption, reduction or other alteration in the availability of bonding capacity, we may be unable to compete for or work on certain projects.\nRisks Related to Our Market\nSoft demand for electrical power may cause deterioration in our financial outlook.\nFor the first time in 12 years, the total annual amount of electricity generated by utility-scale facilities in the US surpassed the total amount generated in the peak power generation year of 2007. For calendar year 2018, the total amount of electricity generation was approximately 100.5% of the level for 2007. Prior to 2018, total electric power generation from all sources had decreased over three years. Power demand gains related to economic growth and population increases have been offset by the effects of private electricity generation and energy efficient devices. The recently published government reference-case outlook forecasts an annual increase in power generation for 2019 and average increases of less than 1% per year through 2050. Further softening of future demand growth for electrical power in the US could result in the delay, curtailment or cancellation of future gas-fired power plant projects, thus decreasing the overall demand for our EPC services and adversely impacting the financial outlook for our power industry services business.\nReductions in the power businesses of turbine manufacturers may signal a decline in our market.\nTwo of the world\u2019s leading natural gas turbine manufacturers are General Electric Company (\u201cGE\u201d) and Siemens AG (\u201cSiemens\u201d). A little over one year ago, GE announced that it was reducing the workforce of its power unit by 18%, citing its misjudgment of the market as volumes dropped in the coal and gas-fired power sectors. Siemens also has cut employment in its power, gas and drives business and recently reported a quarterly profit reduction, blaming the decline on weak demand in its power and gas division. Further, it claimed that the declining market for fossil power generation is not a temporary slump.\nIn reaction to the business declines, the turbine manufacturers may employ more aggressive business development strategies, such as offering turnkey solutions to power project owners, particularly in overseas markets, that may adversely affect the number of new power plant construction opportunities for us. More significantly, if the declines of the power businesses of the these leading gas turbine manufacturers do not reverse, the reductions may be clear indications that the past pace of the construction of new gas-fired power plants has slowed for an indefinite length of time with unfavorable potential future effects on our business. Should the number of new gas-fired power plants scheduled for construction in the future decline, our business would likely suffer reductions in revenues, profits and cash flows.\nIntense global competition for engineering, procurement and construction contracts could reduce our market share.\nThe competitive landscape in the EPC services market for natural gas-fired power plants changed significantly during Fiscal 2019. Several significant competitors announced that they are exiting the market for a variety of reasons. However, the competitive market remains dynamic, and competitors include, among others, Kiewit Corporation, Bechtel Corporation, McDermott International, Inc. and Black & Veatch Corporation. These and other competitors are multi-billion dollar companies with thousands of employees. Competing effectively in our market requires substantial financial resources, the availability of skilled personnel and equipment when needed and the effective use of technology. Competition also places downward pressure on our contract prices and profit margins and may force us to accept contractual terms and conditions that are not normal or customary, thereby increasing the risk that we may have losses on such contracts. Intense competition is expected to continue in our market, presenting us with significant challenges to our achieving strong growth rates and acceptable profit margins. If we are unable to meet these competitive challenges and replace completed projects with new projects with desirable margins, we could lose market share to our competitors and experience an overall reduction in future revenues and profits.\nThe decline in electricity capacity market prices may discourage future investment in new gas-fired power plant development.\nRegional electricity transmission organizations in the US (i.e., PJM, NYISO, ISO-NE, etc.) and the National Grid in the UK conduct auctions in order to guarantee that sufficient electrical power generation capacity will be available to satisfy forecasted demands for power. These auctions are typically held annually covering the capacity needs predicted for three years in the future. The results for PJM\u2019s most recent Capacity Auction (May 2018) included a general clearing price that increased by more than 82% from the corresponding price in the previous year, but was still 15% below the price three years ago. With the exception of the most recent auction, decreased capacity pricing reflects increased participation by new generation capacity resources mostly represented by new or updated gas-fired power plants. Preliminary results for the UK\u2019s most recent capacity auction were published in March 2018; the final clearing capacity price was less than 50% of the price for the previous year. In addition, the electricity generation units clearing the auction did not include any new gas-fired power plants. If future capacity auction clearing prices were to resume their fall in the US and future auction results in the UK remain unfavorable, power plant developers in these countries may be discouraged from commencing the development and construction of new power plants which would adversely impact our business.\nCapacity payments to power plant owners in the UK may be suspended indefinitely which could delay APC\u2019s completion of a major project and limit future investment in new gas-fired power plant development.\nCapacity payments are made to certain power plant owners in order to assure the availability of power in the event that unexpected spikes in the demand for electricity occur. These payments represent an important revenue stream for these power plants that provide grid reliability; otherwise, the plants may not be built. However, on November 15, 2018, the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union (\u201cECJ\u201d) ruled in favor of Tempus Energy and against the European Commission, annulling the Commission\u2019s decision not to raise objections to the structure of the capacity market operating in the UK. The UK\u2019s Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (\u201cBEIS\u201d) was forced to suspend capacity payments to power plant owners as the ECJ judgement ended the legality of granting state aid through the capacity market. In addition, the next capacity auction in the UK was cancelled. Lending urgency to this matter is that the UK has stated its desire to close all coal-fired power plants by 2025.\nBEIS is attempting to reobtain state aid approval but the successful completion of this effort could take up to a year or more. This ruling directly impacts the planning and development of new power plants in the UK which will likely result in fewer future construction opportunities for APC until this matter is resolved. In addition, APC\u2019s active InterGen Spalding OCGT Expansion Project is scheduled to be a recipient of capacity payments once it becomes operational. Construction has continued as scheduled, but there is a remote risk that the project owner may halt construction activity in the future before the power plant is completed. APC\u2019s other major project, the TeesREP Biomass Power Station, is not impacted by this ruling.\nIf the pace of future shutdown of existing coal-fired power plants slows or future policy changes encourage nuclear power-plant operations, the demand for our construction services could decline.\nThe overall growth of our power business has been substantially based on the number of combined cycle gas-fired power plants built by us, as many coal-fired plants have been shut down and the enthusiasm for nuclear-powered electricity generation has waned in the US. From 2007 to 2016, 524 coal units representing 55.7 gigawatts of electricity generating capacity were retired. In 2017, 27 coal-fired power plants totaling 22 gigawatts were identified for early closure or conversion. Announcements of the closure of additional significant coal-fired power plants were made in 2018, as the demand for coal as a power source has been adversely affected primarily by the inexpensive supply of natural gas. In addition, almost 5 gigawatts of nuclear capacity has been retired over the last six years. The future of nuclear power plant construction was further clouded with the bankruptcy of Westinghouse, one of the few major nuclear providers of fuel, services, technology, plant design and equipment. In 2017, this event lead to the abandonment of the partially completed reactors at the V.C. Summer nuclear power generation plant in South Carolina as the project owners announced a reluctance to saddle customers with increasing costs. Just one nuclear power plant in the US is under construction today (the Vogtle plant units 3 and 4). The pace of these changes has been energized by environmental activism, environmental regulations targeting coal-fired power plants and public fear of nuclear power plants.\nHowever, the policies and actions of the federal government may present risks to our power industry services business. In August 2018, the administration of President Trump moved to formally replace the Clean Power Plan, an environmental regulation intended by the prior administration to be the single-most important step America has ever taken to fight climate change. The new proposal, called the Affordable Clean Energy Rule, would be more favorable to the coal industry by allowing individual states greater authority to make their own plans for regulating greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired power plants. The administration may continue to reduce or eliminate environmental rules and regulations aimed at curbing greenhouse gas emissions and may support coal and nuclear-fired power plants for the sake of grid resilience. Recently, a bipartisan group of US Senators introduced a wide-ranging bill which seeks to define and establish the role that advanced nuclear reactors will have in our nation\u2019s future power mix. Should the federal government weaken or eliminate anti-pollution regulations or adopt policies that advance support for the operation of nuclear power plants, power plant operators may slow the rate of coal-fired and nuclear-powered electricity generation plant shutdowns, thereby reducing the number of future gas-fired power plant construction opportunities for us in the future.\nOur revenues and profitability may be adversely affected by a reduced level of activity in the hydrocarbon industry.\nChanges in oil or natural gas prices or activities in the hydrocarbon industry could adversely affect the demand for our services. The availability of natural gas in great supply has caused, in part, low prices for natural gas in the US. Future predictions of power generation are based in large part on the belief that natural gas supplies will remain plentiful resulting in a relatively stable and low price for natural gas in the foreseeable future. However, future natural gas prices that are too low may result in cutbacks in exploration, extraction and production activities which may lead to reductions in future supplies of natural gas and increased prices. On the other hand, a meaningful rise in natural gas prices, which increase could be caused by the significant exporting of liquefied natural gas, may adversely impact the favorable economic factors for project owners as they consider the construction of natural gas-fired power plants in the future. Any reduction in the number of future power plant project construction or improvement opportunities could adversely affect our power industry service business.\nThe continuous rise in renewables could reduce the number of future gas-fired power plant projects.\nFor the last three years, electricity generation in the US provided by utility-scale wind and solar photovoltaic facilities has increased. Together, such power facilities generated approximately 6.5%, 7.6% and 8.2% of the total amount of electricity generated by utility-scale power facilities in 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively. In the reference case of the most recent government energy forecast, which was published in January 2019, electricity from all renewable power sources is expected to increase by more than 130% by 2050, with wind and solar generation leading the increase. Impetus for this growth has been provided by various factors including laws and regulations that discourage new fossil-fuel burning power plants, environmental activism, income tax advantages that promote the growth of wind and solar power and the decline in the amount of renewable power plant component and power storage costs.\nShould the pace of development for renewable energy facilities, including wind and solar power plants, accelerate at faster rates than forecast, the number of future natural gas-fired construction project opportunities for us may fall. Even though we have successfully built utility-scale wind and solar farms in the past, the performance of such projects has not been a core business focus for us and such a trend could have adverse effects on our future revenues, profits and cash flows.\nUncertain economic and political conditions may increase the difficulty of forecasting future domestic business levels.\nCertain regulatory and political conditions in the US may make it more difficult for our customers, our subcontractors and suppliers and us to predict accurately future business levels and to plan future business activities. For example, changes to policies have resulted in uncertainty regarding the future of global trade due to actual and threatened trade restrictions in the US as well as possible retaliatory trade measures that may be implemented by other countries. The availability of construction and manufacturing materials, such as steel, aluminum and lumber, at predictable and reasonable prices when we need them is crucial to the ability of GPS and TRC to complete projects profitably, particularly those performed under fixed-price contract basis. We cannot predict the outcome of these changing trade policies or other unanticipated regulatory or political conditions or their ultimate effects on our ability to manage our businesses profitably.\nUnexpected and adverse changes in the foreign countries in which we operate could result in project disruptions, increased cost and potential losses.\nOur business is also subject to international economic and political conditions that change for reasons which are beyond our control. Such changes may have unfavorable consequences for us. As of January 31, 2019, approximately 41% of our remaining unsatisfied performance obligations (\u201cRUPO\u201d) related to projects located outside the US which indicates that a meaningful portion of our consolidated revenues for Fiscal 2020 and perhaps beyond may be provided by international projects. Operating in the international marketplace, which for us exists primarily in the Republic of Ireland and the UK, may expose us to a number of risks including:\n\u00b7 abrupt changes in domestic and/or foreign government policies, laws, treaties (including those impacting trade), regulations or leadership;\n\u00b7 embargoes or other trade restrictions, including sanctions;\n\u00b7 restrictions on currency movement;\n\u00b7 tax or tariff increases;\n\u00b7 currency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u00b7 changes in labor conditions and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations; and\n\u00b7 other social, political and economic instability.\nThe ultimate impacts of the UK\u2019s decision to exit from the European Economic Union (\u201cBrexit\u201d) are likely unknown. Concerns at the time about the potential effects of Brexit caused us, in part, to assess the goodwill of APC for impairment during Fiscal 2017 and record a loss.\nOur level of exposure to these risks will vary on each project, depending on the location of the project and the particular stage of each such project. To the extent that our international business is affected by unexpected and adverse foreign economic changes, including trade retaliation from certain countries, we may experience project disruptions and losses which could significantly reduce our consolidated revenues and profits.\nRisks Related to the Regulatory Environment\nFuture construction projects may depend on the continuing acceptability of the hydraulic fracturing process in certain states.\nThe viability of the gas-fired power plants that we build is based substantially on the availability of inexpensive natural gas supplies provided through the use of hydraulic fracturing (\u201cfracking\u201d) combined with horizontal drilling techniques. Certain technological advancements led to the widespread use of fracking and horizontal drilling in recent years enabling drillers to reach natural gas and oil deposits previously trapped within shale rock formations deep under the earth\u2019s surface. The new supplies are transforming the oil and gas industry in the US. In particular, the new supplies of natural gas have lowered the price of natural gas in the US and reduced its volatility, making the operation of natural gas-fired power plants more economically appealing. However, the process of fracking uses large volumes of highly pressurized water to break-up the shale rock formations and to free the trapped natural gas and oil. This process is controversial due to concerns about the disposal of the waste water, the possible contamination of nearby water supplies and the risk of potential seismic events.\nAs a result, not all states permit the use of fracking. Should future evidence confirm the concerns, or should a major contamination or seismic episode occur in the future, the use of fracking may be suspended, limited, or curtailed by state and/or federal authorities. As a result, the supply of inexpensive natural gas may not be available in the future and the economic viability of gas-fired power plants may be jeopardized. A reduction in the pace of the construction of new gas-fired power plants would have a significantly adverse effect on our future operating results.\nWe may be affected by regulatory responses to the fear of climate change.\nGrowing concerns about climate change caused by greenhouse gas emissions may result in the imposition of additional environmental regulations on the operators of fossil-fuel burning power plants. Legislation, international protocols or new regulations and other restrictions on emissions promulgated by government agencies could affect those entities, including our customers in some cases, who are involved in the exploration, production or refining of fossil fuels or emit greenhouse gases through the combustion of fossil fuels. Concerns about global warming, climate change and other conditions provided motivation for the recent release of the Green New Deal Resolution by progressive members of the US Congress which is supported by numerous environmental groups. The resolution pushes for transitioning the US to use 100% renewable, zero-emission energy sources and implementing the \u201csocial cost of carbon\u201d within 10 years.\nWe cannot predict when or whether any of these various proposals may be enacted or what their effect will be on or customers or on us. Such policy changes could increase the costs of natural gas-fired power plant projects for our customers or decrease the cost of competing renewable power projects through subsidies or other means, thereby, in some cases, ruining the economic or regulatory viability of a future gas-fired power plant development project. The impact could be a reduction of the need for our services, which would in turn have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe inability of power project developers to receive or to avoid delay in receiving the applicable regulatory approvals relating to new power plants may result in lost or postponed revenues for us.\nThe commencement and/or execution of many of the projects performed by our power industry services reporting segment are subject to numerous regulatory permitting processes. Applications for the variety of clean air, water purity and construction permits may be opposed by individuals or environmental groups, resulting in delays and possible denial of the permits. There are no assurances that our project-owner customers will obtain the necessary permits for these projects, or that the necessary permits will be obtained in order to allow construction work to proceed as scheduled. Failure to commence or complete construction work as anticipated could have material adverse impacts on our future revenues, profits and cash flows.\nThe viability of new natural gas-fired power plants depend on the availability of nearby sources of natural gas for fuel which may require the construction of new pipelines for the delivery of gas to a power plant location. A planned plant may also depend on the erection of transmission lines for the delivery of the newly generated electricity to the grid. Concerns about climate change have also resulted in increased environmental activism that represents opposition to the regulatory approval of any fossil-fuel energy project. During 2017 and 2018, we saw approval delays and public opposition to new oil and gas pipelines develop as hurdles for the developers of gas-fired power plants and other fossil fuel facilities. The slowdown in permitting processes is due, at least in part, to the increase in environmental activism that has garnered media attention and public skepticism about new projects. In particular, pipeline projects are delayed by onsite protest demonstrations, indecision by local officials and lawsuits. Approval difficulties may jeopardize projects that are needed to bring supplies of natural gas to proposed gas-fired power plant sites or electricity to the grid thereby increasing the risk of gas-fired power plant delays or cancellations.\nWe could be subject to compliance with environmental laws and regulations that would add costs to our business.\nOur operations are subject to compliance with federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to discharges to air, water and land, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste, and the cleanup of properties affected by hazardous substances. Certain environmental laws impose substantial penalties for non-compliance and others, such as the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, impose strict, retroactive, and joint and several liability upon persons responsible for releases of hazardous substances. We continually evaluate whether we must take additional steps to ensure compliance with environmental laws, however, there can be no assurance that these requirements will not change and that compliance will not adversely affect our operations in the future.\nWork stoppages, union negotiations and other labor problems could adversely affect us.\nCurrently, our two large construction contracts in the UK and, in the past, several EPC service contracts in the US resulted in the hiring of employees represented by labor unions. We do make sincere efforts to maintain favorable relationships and conduct good-faith negotiations with union officials. However, there can be no assurances that such efforts will eliminate the possibilities of unfavorable situations in the future. A lengthy strike or the occurrence of other work stoppages or slowdowns at any of our current or future construction project sites could have an adverse effect on us, resulting in cost overruns and schedule delays that could be significant. In addition, it is possible that labor incidents result in negative publicity for us thereby damaging our business reputation and perhaps harming our prospects for the receipt of future construction contract awards in certain locales.\nRisks Related to Our Operational Execution\nWe may experience reduced profits or incur losses under fixed price contracts if costs increase above estimates.\nPrimarily, our business is performed under long-term, fixed price contracts at prices that reflect our estimates of corresponding costs and schedules. Inaccuracies in these estimates may lead to cost overruns that may not be paid by our project owner customers. If we fail to accurately estimate the resources required and time necessary to complete these types of contracts, or if we fail to complete these contracts within the costs and timeframes to which we have agreed, there could be material impacts on our financial results as well as our business reputation.\nFactors that could result in contract cost overruns, project delays or other problems for us may include:\n\u00b7 delays in the scheduled deliveries of machinery and equipment ordered by a project owner;\n\u00b7 difficulties or delays in our obtaining permits, rights of way or approvals;\n\u00b7 unanticipated technical problems, including design or engineering issues;\n\u00b7 inadequate project execution tools for recording, tracking, forecasting and controlling future costs and schedules;\n\u00b7 unforeseen increases in the costs of labor, warranties, raw materials, components, equipment or our failure or inability to obtain resources when needed;\n\u00b7 reliance on historical cost and/or execution data that is not representative of current conditions;\n\u00b7 delays or productivity issues caused by weather conditions, or other forces majeure;\n\u00b7 incorrect assumptions related to labor productivity, scheduling estimates or future economic conditions, including the impacts of inflation on fixed-price contracts; and\n\u00b7 modifications to projects that create unanticipated costs or delays.\nThese risks tend to be exacerbated for longer-term contracts because there is increased risk that the circumstances under which we based our original cost estimates or project schedules will change with a resulting increase in costs or delays in achieving scheduled milestones. In such events, our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted. We try to mitigate these risks by reflecting in our overall cost estimates the reasonable possibility that a number of different and potentially unfavorable outcomes might occur. If certain risk scenarios transpire and a cost overrun occurs on a project, it is possible that our overall cost estimate can absorb the cost overrun. There are no assurances that our estimates will be sufficient. If not, our misjudgments may lead to decreased profits or losses. In some cases, as certain risk scenarios are eliminated or our concerns regarding certain potential cost and/or schedule issues diminish, we may estimate that the likelihood of an unforeseen cost overrun has reduced and, accordingly, we may increase the estimated gross margin on the project by decreasing the remaining overall cost estimate.\nIf we guarantee the timely completion or the performance of a project, we could incur additional costs to fulfill such obligations.\nIn many of our fixed price long-term contracts, we guarantee that we will complete a project by a scheduled date. We sometimes provide that the project, when completed, will also achieve certain performance standards. Subsequently, we may fail to complete the project on time or equipment that we install may not meet guaranteed performance standards. In those cases, we may be held responsible for costs incurred by the customer resulting from any delay or any modification to the plant made in order to achieve the performance standards, generally in the form of contractually agreed-upon liquidated damages or obligations to re-perform substandard work. If we are required to pay such costs, the total costs of the project would likely exceed our original estimate, and we could experience reduced profits or a loss related to the applicable project.\nWe may be involved in litigation, liability claims and contract disputes which could reduce our profits and cash flows.\nWe engage in engineering and construction activities for large and complex energy plant facilities where design, construction or systems failures can result in substantial injury or damage to third parties. In addition, the nature of our business results in project owners, subcontractors and vendors occasionally presenting claims against us for recovery of costs that they incurred in excess of what they expected to incur, or for which they believe they are not contractually liable. In other cases, project owners may withhold retention and/or contract payments, for which they believe they do not contractually owe us or based on their interpretation of the contract, or even terminate the contract. We have been, are, and may be in the future, named as a defendant in legal proceedings where parties may make a claim for damages or other remedies with respect to our projects or other matters (see Legal Proceedings in Item 3 below). These claims generally arise in the normal course of our business. In addition, from time to time, we and/or certain of our current or former directors, officers or employees may be named as parties to other types of lawsuits.\nLitigation can involve complex factual and legal questions, and proceedings may occur over several years. As a result, it is typically not possible to predict the likely outcome of legal actions with certainty, but it is likely that any significant lawsuit or other claim against us that involves lengthy legal maneuvering may have a material adverse effect on us regardless of the outcome. Any claim that is successfully asserted against us could result in our payment of significant sums for damages and other losses. Even if we were to prevail, any litigation may be costly and time-consuming, and would likely divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations over multi-year periods. Either outcome may result in adverse effects on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn accordance with customary industry practices, we maintain insurance coverage against some, but not all, potential losses in order to protect against the risks we face. When it is determined that we have liability, we may not be covered by insurance or, if covered, the dollar amount of any liability may exceed our policy limits or self-insurance reserves. Further, we may elect not to carry insurance related to particular risks if our management believes that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. In addition, we cannot insure fully against pollution and environmental risks. Our management liability insurance policies are on a \u201cclaims-made\u201d basis covering only claims actually made during the policy period currently in effect. In addition, even where insurance is maintained for such exposures, the policies have deductibles resulting in our assuming exposure for a layer of coverage with respect to any such claims. Any liability not covered by our insurance, in excess of our insurance limits and self-insurance reserves or, if covered by insurance but subject to a high deductible, could result in a significant loss for us, which claims may reduce our future profits and cash available for operations.\nOur failure to recover adequately on claims against project owners could have a material effect on our financial results.\nIn the future, we may bring claims against project owners for additional costs exceeding the contract price or for amounts not included in the original contract price. For example, in January 2019, we filed a lawsuit against a project owner for breach of contract and failure to remedy various conditions which have negatively effected the schedule and costs associated with the construction of a gas-fired power plant. These types of claims occur due to matters such as owner-caused delays or changes from the initial project scope, both of which may result in additional costs. At times, these claims can be the subject of lengthy arbitration or litigation proceedings, and it is difficult to accurately predict when these claims will be fully resolved. When these types of events occur and unresolved claims are pending, we have used existing liquidity to cover cost overruns pending the resolution of the relevant claims. A failure to promptly recover on these types of claims could have a negative impact on our liquidity and profitability in the future.\nThe shortage of skilled craft labor may negatively impact our ability to execute on our long-term construction contracts.\nIncreased infrastructure spending and general economic expansion has increased the demand for employees with the types of skills we desire. There is a risk that our construction project schedules become unachievable or that labor expenses will increase unexpectedly as a result of a shortage in the supply of skilled personnel available to us. Labor shortages, productivity decreases or increased labor costs could impair our ability to maintain our business or grow our revenues. The inability to hire and retain qualified skilled employees in the future, including workers in the construction crafts, could negatively impact our ability to complete our long-term construction contracts successfully.\nOur dependence upon third parties to complete many of our contracts may adversely affect our performance under current and future construction contracts.\nCertain of the work performed under our energy plant construction contracts is actually performed by third-party subcontractors we hire. We also rely on third-party manufacturers or suppliers to provide much of the equipment and most of the materials (such as copper, concrete and steel) needed to complete our construction projects. If we are unable to hire qualified subcontractors or find qualified equipment manufacturers or suppliers, our ability to successfully complete a project could be adversely impacted. If the price we are required to pay for subcontractors or equipment and supplies exceeds the corresponding amount that we have estimated, we may suffer a loss on the contract. If a supplier, manufacturer or subcontractor fails to provide supplies, equipment or services as required under a negotiated contract for any reason, we may be required to self-perform unexpected work or obtain these supplies, equipment or services on an expedited basis or at a higher price than anticipated from a substitute source, which could impact contract profitability in an adverse manner. Unresolved disputes with a subcontractor or supplier regarding the scope of work or performance may escalate, resulting in arbitration proceedings or legal actions (see Legal Proceedings in Item 3 below). Unfavorable outcomes of such disputes may also impact contract profitability in an adverse manner. In addition, if a subcontractor fails to pay its subcontractors, suppliers or employees, liens may be placed on our project requiring us to incur the costs of reimbursing such parties in order to have the liens removed or to commence litigation.\nIf we are unable to collect amounts billed to project owners as scheduled, our cash flows may be adversely affected.\nMany of our contracts require us to satisfy specified design, engineering, procurement or construction milestones in order to receive payment for work completed or equipment or supplies procured prior to achievement of the applicable contract milestone. As a result, under these types of arrangements, we may incur significant costs or perform significant amounts of services prior to receipt of payment. If the project owner determines not to proceed with the completion of the project, terminates the contract, delays in making payment of billed amounts or defaults on its payment obligations, we may face delays or other difficulties in collecting payment of amounts due to us for the costs previously incurred or for the amounts previously expended to purchase equipment or supplies. The lawsuit that we filed in January 2019 as discussed above, among other recoveries, seeks to compel a project owner to make payments to us for overdue outstanding invoices that were billed in accordance with the corresponding EPC contract. Such problems may impact the planned cash flows of affected projects and result in unanticipated reductions in the amounts of future cash flows from operations.\nFailure to maintain safe work sites could result in significant losses as we work on projects that are inherently dangerous.\nWe often work on large-scale and complex projects, sometimes in geographically remote locations. Our project sites can place our employees and others near large and/or mechanized equipment, high voltage electrical equipment, moving vehicles, dangerous processes or highly regulated materials, and in challenging environments. Safety is a primary focus of our business and is critical to our reputation. Often, we are responsible for safety on the project sites where we work. Many of our customers require that we meet certain safety criteria to be eligible to bid on contracts. Further, regulatory changes implemented by OSHA or similar government agencies could impose additional costs on us. We maintain programs with the primary purpose of implementing effective health, safety and environmental procedures throughout our Company. If we fail to implement appropriate safety procedures and/or if our procedures fail, our employees or others may suffer injuries. The failure to comply with such procedures, client contracts or applicable regulations could subject us to losses and liability, and adversely impact our ability to obtain projects in the future.\nFuture acquisitions and/or investments may not occur which could limit the growth of our business, and the integration of acquired companies may not be successful.\nWe are a holding company with no operations other than our investments in GPS, APC, TRC and SMC. We want to make additional acquisitions and/or investments that would provide positive cash flow to us and value to our stockholders. However, additional companies meeting these criteria and that provide products and/or services in growth industries and that are available for purchase at attractive prices are difficult to find. Discussions with the principal(s) of potential acquisition targets may be protracted and ultimately terminated for a variety of reasons. Further, due diligence investigations of attractive target companies may uncover unfavorable data, and the negotiation and consummation of acquisition agreements may not be successful.\nWe cannot readily predict the timing or size of any future acquisitions or the capital we will need for these transactions. However, it is likely that any potential future acquisition or strategic investment transaction would require the use of cash and/or shares of our common stock as components of the purchase price. Using cash for acquisitions may limit our financial flexibility and make us more likely to seek additional capital through future debt or equity financings. Our ability to obtain\nsuch additional financing in the future may depend upon prevailing capital market conditions, the strength of our future operating results and financial condition as well as conditions in our business, and the amount of outside financing sought by us. These factors may affect our efforts to arrange additional financing on terms that are acceptable to us. Our ability to use shares of our common stock as future acquisition consideration may be limited by a variety of factors, including the future market price of shares of our common stock and a potential seller\u2019s assessment of the liquidity of our common stock. If adequate funds or the use of our common stock are not available to us, or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of desirable acquisitions or other investment opportunities that would benefit our business.\nEven if we do complete acquisitions in the future, acquired companies may fail to achieve the results we anticipate including the expected gross profit percentages. In addition, we may not be able to successfully integrate such acquired companies with our other operations without substantial costs, delays or other operational or financial problems including:\n\u00b7 diversion of management\u2019s attention from other important operational matters;\n\u00b7 difficulties integrating the operations and personnel of acquired companies;\n\u00b7 inability to retain key personnel of acquired companies;\n\u00b7 risks associated with unanticipated events or liabilities;\n\u00b7 the potential disruptions to our current business;\n\u00b7 unforeseen difficulties in the maintenance of uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies, including an effective system of internal control over financial reporting; and\n\u00b7 impairment losses related to acquired goodwill and other intangible assets.\nAs discussed in Note 7 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, circumstances have caused us to record impairment losses related to the goodwill of TRC in the amounts of $1.5 million and $0.6 million during Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018, respectively, and the goodwill of APC in the amount of $2.0 million during Fiscal 2017. The failure of either TRC or APC to achieve sustained profitable operating results could adversely affect our future consolidated operating results, including gross profits, gross profit percentages and cash flows from operations.\nIf one of our acquired companies suffers performance problems, our company reputation could be materially and adversely affected. Future acquisitions could result in issuances of equity securities that would reduce our stockholders\u2019 ownership interests, the issuance of sizable amounts of debt and the incurrence of contingent liabilities. In summary, integrating acquired companies involves a number of special risks. Our failure to overcome such risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and future results of operations. Further, we may conclude that the divestiture of a troubled business will satisfy the best interests of our stockholders. Any divesting transaction could result in a material loss for us.\nWe rely on information systems to conduct our business, and failure to protect these systems against security breaches could adversely affect our business and results of operations. If these systems fail or become unavailable for any significant period of time, our business could be harmed.\nOur computer systems face the threat of unauthorized access, computer hackers, viruses, malicious code, cyber-attacks, phishing and other security incursions and system disruptions, including attempts to improperly access our confidential and proprietary information as well as the confidential and proprietary information of our customers and other business partners. A party who circumvents our security measures, or those of our clients, contractors or other vendors, could misappropriate confidential or proprietary information, improperly manipulate data, or cause damage or interruptions to systems.\nVarious privacy and security laws in the US and abroad, including the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) in the European Union (the \u201cEU\u201d), require us to protect sensitive and confidential information and data from disclosure and we are bound by our client and other contracts, as well as our own business practices, to protect confidential and proprietary information and data (whether it be ours or a third party\u2019s information entrusted to us) from disclosure. We believe that we have deployed industry-accepted security measures and technology to securely maintain confidential and proprietary information retained on our information systems, including compliance with GDPR, specifically at APC. However, these measures and technology may not adequately prevent unanticipated security breaches. There can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent these threats. Further, as these security threats continue to evolve, we may be required to devote additional resources to protect, prevent, detect and respond against such threats.\nWe do believe that our business represents a low value target for cyber-terrorists as we are not a company in the high technology space and we do not maintain large files of sensitive or confidential personal information. However, we do maintain a cyber security insurance policy to help protect ourselves from various types of losses relating to cyber breaches. We are fortunate to report that we are unaware of any meaningful security breaches at any of our business locations.\nNonetheless, the efficient operation of our business is dependent on computer hardware and software systems. We are heavily reliant on computer, information and communications technology and related systems, some of which are hosted by third party providers, in order to operate effectively. We may experience system availability disruptions that may or may not occur as the result of planned procedures. Unplanned interruptions may include natural disasters, power loss, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins and similar cyber security intrusions as discussed above. Any of these or other events could delay or prevent necessary operations (including the processing of transactions and the reporting of financial results). While we believe that our reasonable safeguards will protect us from serious disruptions in the availability of our information technology assets, these safeguards may not be sufficient. We may also be required to expend significant resources to protect against or alleviate damage caused by systems interruptions and delays. We do evaluate the need to upgrade and/or replace our systems and network infrastructure to protect our computing environment, to stay current on vendor-supported products, to improve the efficiency of our systems and for other business reasons. The implementation of new systems and information technology could adversely impact our operations by imposing substantial capital expenditures, demands on management time and risks of delays or difficulties in transitioning to new systems. The unavailability of the information systems or the failure of the systems to perform as anticipated for any reason could disrupt our business and could result in decreased performance and increased overhead costs, causing our business to suffer.\nAny significant interruption or failure of our information systems or any significant breach of information security could damage our reputation, result in litigation and regulatory fines and penalties, or have other material adverse effects on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nChanges in our effective tax rate and tax positions may vary.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the US and several foreign jurisdictions and significant judgment is required in order to determine our worldwide provision for income taxes for each quarterly and annual reporting period. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our tax estimates and tax positions could be materially affected by many factors including the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation, the introduction of new tax accounting standards, legislation, regulations and related interpretations, our global mix of earnings, the realization of deferred tax assets, changes in uncertain tax positions and changes in our tax strategies.\nWe are periodically audited by income tax authorities. Currently, the Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) is conducting an examination of our federal consolidated tax return for Fiscal 2016. As a result of conclusions reached by the IRS examiner, we recorded an additional federal income tax benefit of $1.7 million in Fiscal 2019 related to the pre-acquisition net operating losses of an acquired company that are available for utilization for years through January 31, 2021. The IRS has represented to us that no other adjustment items were noted during the examination. Amended income tax returns for Fiscal 2016 were filed in January 2019 to reflect the amount of the increased benefit available to us due to the research and development credit for the year. With the filing of the amended federal tax return for Fiscal 2016, the statute of limitations was automatically extended and allows for the current examination to encompass the research and development credit.\nA change in tax laws, treaties or regulations, or their interpretation, in any country in which we operate could result in a higher tax rate on our pre-tax earnings. The results of current or future income tax return audits could result in unfavorable adjustments to the amounts of income taxes previously recorded and/or paid. Any such future event or determination related to income taxes could have a material impact on our net earnings and cash flows from operations.\nDuring Fiscal 2019, we completed a detailed review of the activities of our engineering staff on major EPC services projects in order to identify and quantify the amounts of research and development credits that may be available to reduce prior year income taxes. This study focused on project costs incurred during the three-year period ended January 31, 2018. Based on the results of the study, management identified and estimated significant amounts of income tax benefits that were not previously recognized in our operating results for any prior year reporting period. We recorded an aggregate income tax benefit in the amount of $16.6 million related to the research and development credits during Fiscal 2019 which represented a favorable effect on dilutive earnings per share of $1.06 for the year.\nWe evaluated our income tax positions using the more-likely-than-not threshold in order to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized. We do not anticipate any significant changes to the income tax benefit recorded; however, the IRS is conducting an examination, as noted above, and, if previously recognized tax positions no longer meet the more-likely-than-not threshold, the related benefit amounts will be derecognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results.\nForeign currency risks could have an adverse impact on our revenues, earnings, net assets and backlog.\nCertain of the contracts of APC subject us to foreign currency risk, particularly when project revenues are denominated in a currency different than the contract costs. In addition, our cash balances, though predominately held in US dollars, may consist of different currencies at various points in time in order to execute our projects globally and meet transactional requirements. In the future, we may attempt to minimize our exposure to foreign currency risk by obtaining contract provisions that protect us from foreign currency fluctuations and/or by using derivatives as hedging instruments. However, these actions may not always eliminate all foreign currency risk and, as a result, our profitability on certain projects could be adversely affected.\nRevenues, costs and earnings of foreign subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the US dollar are translated into dollars for consolidated reporting purposes. Our monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are subject to currency fluctuations when measured period to period for financial reporting purposes. In addition, the US dollar value of APC\u2019s project backlog may from time to time increase or decrease due to foreign currency volatility. The future amounts of revenues and earnings of foreign subsidiaries could be affected by foreign currency volatility. If the dollar depreciates against a foreign subsidiary\u2019s non-US dollar functional currency, we will report greater consolidated revenues, earnings, net assets and backlog amounts in dollars than we would if the dollar appreciates against the same foreign currency or if there is no change in the exchange rate. During Fiscal 2019, the US dollar appreciated against the Euro, which is the functional currency of APC. There can be no assurance that the dollar will not appreciate against the Euro to a greater extent in future reporting periods which would reduce the amounts of APC\u2019s revenues, earnings and net assets included in our consolidated financial statements, and the reported amount of our project backlog.\nIn addition, given the uncertainty and unknown impacts, Brexit adversely impacted global markets, including currencies, and resulted in the weakening of the British pound against other currencies. A weaker British pound compared to the US dollar during a reporting period causes local currency results of our UK contracts, denominated in the British pound, to be translated into fewer dollars. Volatility in exchange rates may continue as the UK negotiates its exit from the EU. In the longer term, any impact from Brexit on our international operations will depend, in part, on the outcome of tariff, trade, regulatory and other negotiations and could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe could be adversely affected by violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws.\nThe US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the UK Bribery Act of 2010 and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to officials or others for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws. We may operate in parts of the world that have experienced corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. We train our personnel concerning anti-bribery laws and issues, and we also inform our partners, subcontractors, suppliers and others who work for us or on our behalf that they must comply with anti-bribery law requirements. We also have procedures and controls in place to monitor compliance.\nWe cannot assure that our internal controls and procedures always will protect us from the possible reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or others. If we are found to be liable for anti-bribery law violations (either due to our own acts or our inadvertence, or due to the acts or inadvertence of others including our partners, subcontractors or suppliers), we could suffer from criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions, including contract cancellations or debarment, and loss of reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Litigation or investigations relating to alleged or suspected violations of anti-bribery laws, even if such litigation or investigations demonstrate ultimately that we did not violate anti-bribery laws, could be costly and could divert management\u2019s attention away from other aspects of our business.\nOur continued success requires us to retain and hire talented personnel.\nOur future success is substantially dependent on the continued service and performance of the members of our current executive team and the senior management members of our businesses, including William F. Griffin, the chief executive officer and co-founder of GPS, and John Roberts, the chief executive officer and founder of TRC. We cannot be certain that any such individual will continue in such capacity or continue to perform at a high level for any particular period of time. Our ability to operate productively and profitably, particularly in the power industry, may be limited by the loss of key personnel or our inability to attract, employ, retain and train skilled personnel necessary to meet our future requirements. We cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain experienced management teams and adequately skilled groups of employees necessary to execute our long-term construction contracts successfully and to support our future growth strategy. The loss of key personnel, or the inability to hire and retain qualified employees in the future, could negatively impact our ability to manage our business.\nRisks Related to an Investment in Our Securities\nOur acquisition strategy may result in dilution to our stockholders.\nWe may make future acquisitions of other businesses that require the use of cash and issuances of common stock. To the extent that we intend to use cash for any acquisition, we may be required to raise additional equity and/or obtain debt financing. Equity financing may result in dilution for our then current stockholders. Stock issuances and financing, if obtained, may not be on terms favorable to us and could result in substantial dilution to our stockholders at the time(s) of these transactions.\nFuture stock option exercises may dilute the ownership of the Company\u2019s current stockholders.\nThe average of the monthly closing prices for our common stock for the year ended January 31, 2019 was $40.82 per share. During the year ended January 31, 2019, the exercise of stock options by our employees and directors resulted in the issuance of 6,150 shares of our common stock at a weighted average purchase price of $17.19 per share. As of January 31, 2019, there were outstanding options to purchase 1,140,000 shares of our common stock at a weighted average purchase price of $44.01 per share, including 426,500 shares related to in-the-money stock options exercisable at a weighted average price of $29.33 per share. Future exercises of options to purchase shares of common stock at prices below prevailing market prices for such stock may result in ownership dilution for current stockholders.\nOur officers, directors and certain unaffiliated stockholders have substantial control over the Company.\nAs of January 31, 2019, our executive officers and directors as a group owned approximately 8.1% of our voting shares including an aggregate of 543,998 shares of common stock that may be purchased upon the exercise of stock options held by our executive officers and directors (and deemed exercisable at January 31, 2019), a total of 327,411 shares of common stock beneficially owned by Rainer H. Bosselmann (our chairman of the board and chief executive officer) and a total of 286,150 shares beneficially owned by William F. Griffin, (a co-founder and the current chief executive officer of GPS and member of our board of directors). An additional 1.8% of the outstanding shares are controlled by Allen & Company entities (\u201cAllen\u201d). One of our independent directors is an officer of Allen. In addition, four other stockholders owned approximately 28.1% of our shares in total as of December 31, 2018. These groups of stockholders may have significant influence over corporate actions such as the election of directors, amendments to our certificate of incorporation, the consummation of any merger, the sale of all or substantially all of our assets or other actions requiring stockholder approval.\nWe may not pay cash dividends in the future.\nOur board of directors evaluates our ongoing operational and financial performance in order to determine what role strategically aligned dividends should play in creating shareholder value. Due primarily to the continued strong performance of GPS and the associated cash flows, we paid four regular quarterly dividends of $0.25 per share for a total of $1.00 per share during Fiscal 2019, a regular dividend of $1.00 per share during Fiscal 2018, regular and special cash dividends of $0.70 and $0.30 per share, respectively, for a total of $1.00 per share during Fiscal 2017, a regular cash dividend in the amount of $0.70 per share during Fiscal 2016, and we paid special cash dividends during earlier years. However, there can be no assurance that the evaluations of our board of directors will result in the payment of cash dividends in the future.\nAs our common stock is thinly traded at times, the stock price may be volatile and investors may have difficulty disposing of their investments at prevailing market prices.\nOur common stock is listed for trading on the NYSE stock exchange and trades under the symbol AGX. Despite the listing on this national stock exchange, our common stock may trade thinly and sporadically at times and no assurances can be given that a larger market will ever develop, or if developed, that it will be maintained.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation and Delaware law could deter takeover attempts.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation and Delaware law could delay, prevent, or make more difficult a merger, tender offer or proxy contest involving us. Among other things, our board of directors may issue up to 500,000 shares of our preferred stock and may determine the price, rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions, including voting and conversion rights, of these shares. The issuance of preferred stock by us could adversely affect the rights of holders of common stock by, among other factors, establishing dividend rights, liquidation rights and voting rights that are superior to the rights of the holders of the common stock. In addition, Delaware law limits transactions between us and persons that acquire significant amounts of our stock without approval of our board of directors.", "PERMNO": 64785, "SIC": 8711, "TIC": "AGX"}
