{"cik": "1066194", "company": "EGAIN Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-09-14", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORS\nThe risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial also may affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nOur business is influenced by a range of factors that are beyond our control and that we have no comparative advantage in forecasting. These include:\n\u00b7\ngeneral economic and business conditions;\n\u00b7\ncurrency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u00b7\nthe overall demand for enterprise software and services;\n\u00b7\ncustomer acceptance of cloud-based solutions;\n\u00b7\ngovernmental budgetary constraints or shifts in government spending priorities; and\n\u00b7\ngeneral political developments.\nThe global economic climate continues to influence our business such as, a general tightening in the credit markets, lower levels of liquidity, increases in the rates of default and bankruptcy, and extreme volatility in credit, equity and fixed income markets. These macroeconomic developments negatively affected, and could continue to negatively affect, our business, operating results or financial condition which, in turn, could adversely affect our stock price. A general weakening of, and related declining corporate confidence in, the global economy or the curtailment in government or corporate spending could cause current or potential customers to reduce their technology budgets or be unable to fund software or services purchases, which could cause customers to delay, decrease or cancel purchases of our products and services or cause customers not to pay us or to delay paying us for previously purchased products and services.\nOur hybrid revenue model may affect our operating results.\nWe have a hybrid delivery model meaning that we offer our solutions on a subscription or perpetual license basis to our customers. For perpetual license transactions, the license revenue amount is generally recognized in the quarter delivery\nand acceptance of our software takes place. Whereas, for subscription transactions, the revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the contract, which is typically 12 to 36 months. As a result, our total revenue may increase or decrease in future quarters as a result of the timing and mix of license and subscriptions transactions. This could be exacerbated as more customers select our subscription solution over our perpetual licensed solution; causing us to increase the amount of revenue recognized ratably over the life of the contract therefore resulting in a decrease in our total revenue in the short-term.\nOur revenue and operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future, and because we recognize revenue from subscriptions over a period of time, downturns in revenue may not be immediately reflected in our operating results.\nBecause we recognize recurring revenue and maintenance revenue ratably over the terms of the related subscription agreements and maintenance support agreements, most of our revenue each quarter results from recognition of deferred revenue related to agreements entered into during previous quarters. Consequently, declines in new or renewed subscription agreements and maintenance agreements that occur in one quarter will largely be felt in future quarters, both because we may be unable to generate sufficient new revenue to offset the decline and because we may be unable to adjust our operating costs and capital expenditures to align with the changes in revenue. Our subscription model makes it more difficult for us to increase our revenue rapidly in any period, because revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription term. Furthermore, although our business model is primarily focused on recurring revenue, we anticipate continuing to recognize license revenue, particularly with international customers. License revenue is difficult to forecast and is likely to fluctuate due to many factors that are beyond our control including transition of license customers to recurring revenue models. Accordingly, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations should not be relied upon as definitive indicators of future performance.\nOther factors that may cause our revenue and operating results to fluctuate include:\n\u00b7 timing of customer budget cycles;\n\u00b7 the priority our customers place on our products compared to other business investments;\n\u00b7 size, timing and contract terms of new customer contracts, and unpredictable and often lengthy sales cycles;\n\u00b7 reduced renewals;\n\u00b7 competitive factors, including new product introductions, upgrades and discounted pricing or special payment terms offered by our competitors, as well as strategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions, divestitures, spin-offs, joint ventures, strategic investments or changes in business strategy;\n\u00b7 technical difficulties, errors or service interruptions in our solutions that may cause customer dissatisfaction with solutions;\n\u00b7 consolidation among our customers, which may alter their buying patterns, or business failures that may reduce demand for our solutions;\n\u00b7 operating expenses associated with expansion of our sales force or business, and our product development efforts;\n\u00b7 cost, timing and management efforts related to the introduction of new features to our solutions;\n\u00b7 our ability to obtain, maintain and protect our intellectual property rights and adequately safeguard the information imported to our solutions or otherwise provided to us by our customers; and\n\u00b7 extraordinary expenses such as impairment charges, litigation or other payments related to settlement of dispute.\nAny of these developments may adversely affect our revenue, operating results and financial condition. Furthermore, we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. In such cases, we may be required to defer revenue recognition on sales to affected\ncustomers. In the future, we may have to record additional reserves or write-offs, or defer revenue on sales transactions, which could negatively impact our financial results.\nIf we are unable to increase the profitability of our recurring revenue products and services, experience significant customer attrition, or if we are required to defer recognition of revenue, our operating results could be adversely affected.\nWe have invested, and expect to continue to invest, substantial resources to expand, market, and implement and refine our recurring revenue products and services offerings. Our business model shift to recurring revenues, and our cloud services in particular, has generally generated much lower gross margins than our traditional perpetual license sales. If we are unable to increase the volume of our cloud business to offset the lower margins, we may not be able to achieve sustained profitability.\nIn order to sustain or increase our recent operating profitability, we must improve gross margins in our recurring revenue product and services offerings. Factors that could harm our ability to improve our gross margins include:\n\u00b7\nincreased costs to license and maintain third party software embedded in our software applications or the cost to create or substitute such third party software if it can no longer be licensed on commercially reasonable terms;\n\u00b7\nour inability to maintain or increase the prices customers pay for our products and services based on competitive pricing pressures and general economic conditions limiting customer demand;\n\u00b7\nincreased cost of third party services providers, including data centers for our cloud operations and professional services contractors performing implementation and technical support services to cloud customers;\n\u00b7\ncustomer contractual requirements that delay revenue recognition until customer implementations commence production operations or customer-specific requirements are met;\n\u00b7\nsignificant attrition as customers decide for their own economic or other reasons to not renew their cloud contracts when they are up for renewal could negatively impact the efficiency of our data centers and lead to the costs being spread over fewer customers negatively impacting gross margin;\n\u00b7\nthe inability to implement, or delays in implementing, technology-based efficiencies and efforts to streamline and consolidate processes to reduce operating costs; and\n\u00b7\nhigher wage and benefits costs for our existing personnel or the need to increase the number of our employees to support increasing customer demands for our professional services, technical support or general operations.\nIf we are unable to increase our recurring revenue gross margins, our ability to sustain or increase our operating profits will be hindered and our operating results and financial condition will be adversely affected.\nBecause we recognize revenue from subscriptions for our service over the term of the subscription, downturns or upturns in new business may not be immediately reflected in our operating results.\nWe generally recognize subscription revenue from customers ratably over the terms of their subscription agreements, which are typically 12 to 36 months. As a result, most of the revenue we report in each quarter is the result of subscription agreements entered into during previous quarters. Consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any one quarter may not be reflected in our revenue results for that quarter. Any such decline, however, will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters. Accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our service, and potential changes in our rate of renewals may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. Our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription term.\nWe cannot accurately predict subscription renewal or upgrade rates and the impact these rates may have on our future revenue and operating results.\nOur customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our service after the expiration of their initial subscription period, which is typically 12 to 36 months, and in fact, some customers have elected not to renew. In addition, our customers may renew for fewer subscriptions, renew for shorter contract lengths, or renew for lower cost editions of our service. We cannot accurately predict renewal rates given our varied customer base of enterprise and small and medium size business customers and the number of multiyear subscription contracts. Our renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including customer dissatisfaction with our service, customers\u2019 spending levels, decreases in the number of users at our customers, pricing changes and deteriorating general economic conditions. If our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our service or reduce the number of paying subscriptions at the time of renewal, our revenue will decline and our business will suffer.\nOur future success also depends in part on our ability to sell additional features and services, more subscriptions or enhanced editions of our service to our current customers. This may also require increasingly sophisticated and costly sales efforts that are targeted at senior management. Similarly, the rate at which our customers purchase new or enhanced services depends on a number of factors, including general economic conditions and that our customers do not react negatively to any price changes related to these additional features and services. If our efforts to upsell to our customers are not successful and negative reaction occurs, our business may suffer.\nOur credit agreement contains restrictive and financial covenants that may limit our operational flexibility. Furthermore, if we default on our obligations under the credit agreement, our operations may be interrupted and our business and financial results could be adversely affected.\nIn November 2014, we entered into a credit agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (\u201cWells Fargo\u201d), under which Wells Fargo agreed to provide a term loan in the amount of $10.0 million (\u201cTerm\u201d) and revolving loan to us in an amount not to exceed $10.0 million (\"Revolver\"), Term and Revolver (collectively, the \u201cLoans\u201d). In September 2015, we increased the maximum borrowing amount of the Revolver to $15.0 million. The Loans contain a number of restrictive covenants, and its terms may restrict our current and future operations, including:\n\u00b7\nour flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry conditions;\n\u00b7\nour ability to use our cash flows, or obtain additional financing, for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate purposes;\n\u00b7\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors; and\n\u00b7\nincrease our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions.\nIn addition, if we fail to comply with the covenants or payment obligations specified in the Loans, we may trigger an event of default and Wells Fargo would have the right to: (i) terminate its commitment to provide additional loans under the Loans, and (ii) declare all borrowings outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable. In addition, Wells Fargo would have the right to proceed against the Loans collateral, which consists of substantially all our assets. If the debt under the Loans were to be accelerated, we may not have sufficient cash or be able to sell sufficient collateral to repay this debt, which would have an immediate material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition\nOur lengthy sales cycles and the difficulty in predicting timing of sales or delays may impair our operating results.\nThe long sales cycle for our products may cause license revenue and operating results to vary significantly from period to period. The sales cycle for our products can be six months or more and varies substantially from customer to customer. Because we sell complex and deeply integrated solutions, it can take many months of customer education to secure sales. Because our potential customers may evaluate our products before, if ever, executing definitive agreements, we may incur substantial expenses and spend significant management effort in connection with the potential customer.\nOur multi-product offering and the increasingly complex needs of our customers contribute to a longer and unpredictable sales cycle. Consequently, we often face difficulty predicting the quarter in which expected sales will actually occur. This contributes to the uncertainty and fluctuations in our future operating results. In particular, the corporate decision-making and approval process of our customers and potential customers has become more complicated. This has caused our average sales cycle to further increase and, in some cases, has prevented the closure of sales that we believed were likely to close. In addition, historically our license sales have comprised a relatively small number of high value transactions; consequently, we may miss our revenue forecasts and may incur expenses that are not offset by corresponding revenue from the delay in even one transaction.\nWe may need additional capital, and raising such additional capital may be difficult or impossible and will likely significantly dilute existing stockholders.\nWe believe that existing capital resources will enable us to maintain current and planned operations for the next 12 months. However, our working capital requirements in the foreseeable future are subject to numerous risks and will depend on a variety of factors, in particular, whether we maintain or exceed the level of revenue achieved in fiscal year 2016 and that customers continue to pay on a timely basis. We may need to secure additional financing due to unforeseen or unanticipated market conditions. We may try to raise additional funds through public or private financings, strategic relationships, or other arrangements. Such financing may be difficult to obtain on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we succeed in raising additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible securities, then the issuance could result in substantial dilution to existing stockholders. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt securities or preferred stock, these new securities would have rights, preferences, and privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock. The terms of these securities could impose restrictions on our operations.\nBecause we depend on a relatively small number of customers for a substantial portion of our revenue, the loss of any of these customers or our failure to attract new significant customers could adversely impact our revenue and harm our business\nWe have in the past and expect in the future to derive a substantial portion of our revenue from sales to a relatively small number of customers. The composition of these customers has varied in the past, and we expect that it will continue to vary over time. As a result, the loss of any significant customer or a decline in business with any significant customer would materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nAs we acquire companies or technologies, we may not realize the expected business benefits, the acquisitions could prove difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our operations.\nAs part of our business strategy, we periodically make investments in, or acquisitions of, complementary businesses, joint ventures, services and technologies and intellectual property rights, and we expect that we will continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future. In August 2014, we acquired Exony Ltd. Acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks, including:\n\u00b7\nthe potential failure to achieve the expected benefits of the combination or acquisition;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in and the cost of integrating operations, technologies, services and personnel;\n\u00b7\ndiversion of financial and managerial resources from existing operations;\n\u00b7\nrisk of entering new markets in which we have little or no experience or where competitors may have stronger market positions;\n\u00b7\npotential write-offs of acquired assets or investments, and potential financial and credit risks associated with acquired customers;\n\u00b7\npotential loss of key employees;\n\u00b7\ninability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition or investment costs;\n\u00b7\nthe inability to maintain relationships with customers and partners of the acquired business;\n\u00b7\nthe difficulty of transitioning the acquired technology onto our existing platforms and maintaining the security standards consistent with our other services for such technology;\n\u00b7\npotential unknown liabilities associated with the acquired businesses;\n\u00b7\nunanticipated expenses related to acquired technology and its integration into existing technology;\n\u00b7\nnegative impact to our results of operations because of the depreciation and amortization of amounts related to acquired intangible assets, fixed assets and deferred compensation, and the loss of acquired deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue;\n\u00b7\ndelays in customer purchases due to uncertainty related to any acquisition;\n\u00b7\nthe need to implement controls, procedures and policies at the acquired company;\n\u00b7\nchallenges caused by distance, language and cultural differences;\n\u00b7\nin the case of foreign acquisitions, the challenges associated with integrating operations across different cultures and languages and any currency and regulatory risks associated with specific countries; and\n\u00b7\nthe tax effects of any such acquisitions.\nIn addition, if we finance acquisitions by issuing equity or convertible or other debt securities or loans, our existing stockholders may be diluted, or we could face constraints related to the terms of repayment obligations related to the incurrence of indebtedness which could affect the market price of our common stock. Further, if we fail to properly evaluate and execute acquisitions or investments, our business operations and prospects may be seriously harmed.\nWe must compete successfully in our market segment.\nThe market for customer engagement software is intensely competitive. Other than product innovation and existing customer relationships, there are no substantial barriers to entry in this market, and established or new entities may enter this market in the future. While software internally developed by enterprises represents indirect competition, we also compete directly with packaged application software vendors, including Avaya, Inc., Genesys Telecommunications, LivePerson, Inc., and Moxie Software, Inc. In addition, we face actual or potential competition from larger software companies such as Microsoft Corporation, Oracle Corporation, Salesforce.com, Inc. and similar companies that may attempt to sell customer engagement software to their installed base.\nWe believe competition will continue to be fierce as current competitors increase the sophistication of their offerings and as new participants enter the market. Many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, broader brand recognition, and significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources. With more established and better-financed competitors, these companies may be able to undertake more extensive marketing campaigns, adopt more aggressive pricing policies, and make more attractive offers to businesses to induce them to use their products or services.\nIf we fail to expand and improve our sales performance and marketing activities, we may be unable to grow our business, negatively impacting our operating results and financial condition.\nExpansion and growth of our business is dependent on our ability to expand our sales force and on the ability of our sales force to increase sales. If we are not able to effectively develop and maintain awareness of our products in a cost-effective manner, we may not achieve widespread acceptance of our existing and future products. This may result in a failure to expand and attract new customers and enhance relationships with existing customers. This may impede our efforts to improve operations in other areas of the Company and may result in declines in the market price of our common stock.\nDue to the complexity of our customer engagement hub platform and related products and services, we must utilize highly trained sales personnel to educate prospective customers regarding the use and benefits of our products and services\nas well as provide effective customer support. If we have turnover in our sales and marketing teams, we may not be able to successfully compete with those of our competitors.\nOur failure to develop and expand strategic and third party distribution channels would impede our revenue growth.\nOur success and future growth depends in part upon the skills, experience, performance and continued service of our distribution partners, including software and hardware vendors and resellers. We engage with distribution partners in a number of ways, including assisting us to identify prospective customers, to distribute our products in geographies where we do not have a physical presence and to distribute our products where they are considered complementary to other third party products distributed by the partner. We believe that our future success depends in part upon our ability to develop and expand strategic, long term and profitable partnerships and reseller relationships. If we are unable to do so, or if any existing or future distribution partners fail to successfully market, resell, implement or support our products for their customers, or if distribution partners represent multiple providers and devote greater resources to market, resell, implement and support competing products and services, our future revenue growth could be impeded. Our failure to develop and expand relationships with systems integrators could harm our business.\nWe sometimes rely on system integrators to recommend our products to their customers and to install and support our products for their customers. We likewise depend on broad market acceptance by these system integrators of our product and service offerings. Our agreements generally do not prohibit competitive offerings and system integrators may develop market or recommend software applications that compete with our products. Moreover, if these firms fail to implement our products successfully for their customers, we may not have the resources to implement our products on the schedule required by their customers. To the extent we devote resources to these relationships and the partnerships do not proceed as anticipated or provide revenue or other results as anticipated, our business may be harmed. Once partnerships are forged, there can be no guarantee that such relationships will be renewed in the future or available on acceptable terms. If we lose strategic third party relationships, fail to renew or develop new relationships, or fail to fully exploit revenue opportunities within such relationships, our results of operations and future growth may suffer.\nOur international operations involve various risks.\nWe derived 52% of our revenue from international sales for the fiscal year 2015 compared to 45% for the fiscal year 2014, and 40% for fiscal year 2013. Including those discussed above, our international sales operations are subject to a number of specific risks, such as:\n\u00b7\ngeneral economic conditions in each country or region in which we do or plan to do business;\n\u00b7\nforeign currency fluctuations and imposition of exchange controls;\n\u00b7\nexpenses associated with complying with differing technology standards and language translation issues;\n\u00b7\ndifficulty and costs in staffing and managing our international operations;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods;\n\u00b7\nhealth or similar issues, such as a pandemic or epidemic;\n\u00b7\nvarious trade restrictions and tax consequences;\n\u00b7\nhostilities in various parts of the world; and\n\u00b7\nreduced intellectual property protections in some countries.\nAs of June 30, 2015, approximately 41% of our workforce was employed in India. Of these employees, 42% are allocated to research and development. Although the movement of certain operations internationally was principally motivated by cost cutting, the continued management of these remote operations requires significant management attention and financial resources that could adversely affect our operating performance. In addition, with the significant increase in the numbers of foreign businesses that have established operations in India, the competition to attract and retain employees\nthere has increased significantly. As a result of the increased competition for skilled workers, we experienced increased compensation costs and expect these costs to increase in the future. Our reliance on our workforce in India makes us particularly susceptible to disruptions in the business environment in that region. In particular, sophisticated telecommunications links, high-speed data communications with other eGain offices and customers, and overall consistency and stability of our business infrastructure are vital to our day-to-day operations, and any impairment of such infrastructure will cause our financial condition and results to suffer. The maintenance of stable political relations between the United States, European Union and India are also of great importance to our operations.\nAny of these risks could have a significant impact on our product development, customer support, or professional services. To the extent the benefit of maintaining these operations abroad does not exceed the expense of establishing and maintaining such activities, our operating results and financial condition will suffer.\nDifficulties in implementing our products could harm our revenue and margins.\nWe generally recognize license revenue from a customer sale when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the product has been delivered, the arrangement does not involve significant customization of the software, the license fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the fee is probable. If an arrangement requires significant customization or implementation services from us, recognition of the associated license and service revenue could be delayed. The timing of the commencement and completion of these services is subject to factors that may be beyond our control, as this process requires access to the customer\u2019s facilities and coordination with the customer\u2019s personnel after delivery of the software. In addition, customers could cancel or delay product implementations. Implementation typically involves working with sophisticated software, computing and communications systems. If we experience difficulties with implementation or do not meet project milestones in a timely manner, we could be obligated to devote more customer support, engineering and other resources to a particular project. Some customers may also require us to develop customized features or capabilities. If new or existing customers cancel or have difficulty deploying our products or require significant amounts of our professional services, support, or customized features, revenue recognition could be cancelled or further delayed and our costs could increase, causing increased variability in our operating results.\nOur reserves may be insufficient to cover receivables we are unable to collect.\nWe assume a certain level of credit risk with our customers in order to do business. Conditions affecting any of our customers could cause them to become unable or unwilling to pay us in a timely manner, or at all, for products or services we have already provided them. In the past, we have experienced collection delays from certain customers, and we cannot predict whether we will continue to experience similar or more severe delays in the future. Although we have established reserves to cover losses due to delays or inability to pay, there can be no assurance that such reserves will be sufficient to cover our losses. If losses due to delays or inability to pay are greater than our reserves, it could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe may be subject to legal liability and/or negative publicity for the services provided to consumers via our technology platforms.\nOur technology platforms enable representatives of our customers as well as individual service providers to communicate with consumers and other persons seeking information or advice on the Internet. The law relating to the liability of online platform providers such as us for the activities of users of their online platforms is often challenged in the U.S. and internationally. We may be unable to prevent users of our technology platforms from providing negligent, unlawful or inappropriate advice, information or content via our technology platforms, or from behaving in an unlawful manner, and we may be subject to allegations of civil or criminal liability for negligent, fraudulent, unlawful or inappropriate activities carried out by users of our technology platforms.\nClaims could be made against online services companies under both U.S. and foreign law such as fraud, defamation, libel, invasion of privacy, negligence, copyright or trademark infringement, or other theories based on the nature and content of the materials disseminated by users of our technology platforms. In addition, domestic and foreign legislation has been proposed that could prohibit or impose liability for the transmission over the Internet of certain types of\ninformation. Our defense of any of these actions could be costly and involve significant time and attention of our management and other resources.\nThe Digital Millennium Copyright Act, or DMCA, is intended, among other things, to reduce the liability of online service providers for listing or linking to third party web properties that include materials that infringe copyrights or rights of others. Additionally, portions of The Communications Decency Act, or CDA, are intended to provide statutory protections to online service providers who distribute third party content. A safe harbor for copyright infringement is also available under the DMCA to certain online service providers that provide specific services, if the providers take certain affirmative steps as set forth in the DMCA. Important questions regarding the safe harbor under the DMCA and the CDA have yet to be litigated, and we cannot guarantee that we will meet the safe harbor requirements of the DMCA or of the CDA. If we are not covered by a safe harbor, for any reason, we could be exposed to claims, which could be costly and time-consuming to defend.\nUnplanned system interruptions and capacity constraints and failure to effect efficient transmission of customer communications and data over the Internet could harm our business and reputation.\nOur customers have in the past experienced some interruptions with eGain cloud operations. We believe that these interruptions will continue to occur from time to time. These interruptions could be due to hardware and operating system failures. As a result, our business will suffer if we experience frequent or long system interruptions that result in the unavailability or reduced performance of our hosted operations or reduce our ability to provide remote management services. We expect to experience occasional temporary capacity constraints due to sharply increased traffic or other Internet-wide disruptions, which may cause unanticipated system disruptions, slower response times, impaired quality, and degradation in levels of customer service. If this were to continue to happen, our business and reputation could be seriously harmed.\nThe growth in the use of the Internet has caused interruptions and delays in accessing the Internet and transmitting data over the Internet. Interruptions also occur due to systems burdens brought on by unsolicited bulk email or \u201cSpam,\u201d malicious service attacks and hacking into operating systems, viruses, worms and a \u201cTrojan\u201d horse, the proliferation of which is beyond our control and may seriously impact our and our customers\u2019 businesses.\nBecause we provide Cloud-based software, interruptions or delays in Internet transmissions will harm our customers\u2019 ability to receive and respond to online interactions. Therefore, our market depends on ongoing improvements being made to the entire Internet infrastructure to alleviate overloading and congestion.\nOur success largely depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer and communications hardware and network systems. A significant amount of our computer and communications systems are located in Sunnyvale, California. Due to our location, our systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from fire, earthquake, power loss, telecommunications failure and similar events.\nWe do maintain a business continuity plan for our customers in the event of an outage. We maintain other co-locations for the purposes of disaster recovery as well as maintaining back up\u2019s of our customer\u2019s information. We provide premium disaster recovery and standard disaster recovery to our customers. If a customer opts not to pay for premium disaster recovery, we will only assure that their data is available within 72 hours. This delay could cause severe disruptions to our customers\u2019s customers and may result in our customers termination of our solutions. Our premium disaster recovery service provides for an alternative data center and a return to operations within one business day.\nWe have entered into service agreements with some of our customers that require minimum performance standards, including standards regarding the availability and response time of our remote management services. If we fail to meet these standards, our customers could terminate their relationships with us, and we could be subject to contractual refunds and service credits to customers. Any unplanned interruption of services may harm our ability to attract and retain customers.\nIf our security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to a customer\u2019s data or our data or our IT systems, our service may be perceived as not being secure, customers may curtail or stop using our service and we may incur significant legal and financial exposure and liabilities.\nOur service involves the storage and transmission of customers\u2019 proprietary information, and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of this information, litigation and possible liability. These security measures may be breached as a result of third-party action, including intentional misconduct by computer hackers, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise and result in someone obtaining unauthorized access to our customers\u2019 data or our data, including our intellectual property and other confidential business information, or our IT systems. Additionally, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names, passwords or other information in order to gain access to our customers\u2019 data or our data or IT systems. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, or to sabotage systems, change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. In addition, our customers may authorize third party access to their customer data located in our cloud environment. Because we do not control the transmissions between customer authorized third parties, or the processing of such data by customer authorized third parties, we cannot ensure the integrity or security of such transmissions or processing. Any security breach could result in a loss of confidence in the security of our service, damage our reputation, negatively impact our future sales, disrupt our business and lead to legal liability.\nThe terms we agree to in our Service Level Agreements or other contracts may result in increased costs or liabilities, which would in turn affect our results of operations.\nOur Service Level Agreement (SLA) includes indemnification provisions and provides for service credits for system unavailability, and loss, damage or costs resulting from use of our system. If we were required to provide any of these in a material way, our results of operations would suffer.\nWe have been and may in the future be sued by third parties for various claims including alleged infringement of proprietary rights.\nWe are involved in various legal matters arising from the normal course of business activities. These may include claims, suits, and other proceedings involving alleged infringement of third-party patents and other intellectual property rights, and commercial, labor and employment, and other matters.\nThe software and Internet industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We have received in the past and may receive in the future communications from third parties claiming that we or our customers have infringed the intellectual property rights of others. In addition we have been, and may in the future be, sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their claimed proprietary rights. Our technologies and those of our customers may be subject to injunction if they are found to infringe the rights of a third party or we may be required to pay damages, or both. Many of our agreements require us to indemnify our customers for third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim.\nThe outcome of any litigation, regardless of its merits, is inherently uncertain. Any claims and lawsuits, and the disposition of such claims and lawsuits, could be time-consuming and expensive to resolve, divert management attention from executing our business plan, lead to attempts on the part of other parties to pursue similar claims and, in the case of intellectual property claims, require us to change our technology, change our business practices or pay monetary damages, or enter into short- or long-term royalty or licensing agreements.\nAny adverse determination related to intellectual property claims or other litigation could prevent us from offering our service to others, could be material to our financial condition or cash flows, or both, or could otherwise adversely affect our operating results. In addition, depending on the nature and timing of any such dispute, a resolution of a legal matter could materially affect our future results of operation or cash flows or both.\nWe rely on trademark, copyright, trade secret laws, contractual restrictions and patent rights to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights and if these rights are impaired, then our ability to generate revenue will be harmed.\nIf we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately, our competitors might gain access to our technology, and our business might be harmed. In addition, defending our intellectual property rights might entail significant expense. Any of our trademarks or other intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation. While we have some U.S. patents and pending U.S. patent applications, we may be unable to obtain patent protection for the technology covered in our patent applications. In addition, our existing patents and any patents issued in the future may not provide us with competitive advantages, or may be successfully challenged by third parties. Furthermore, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain. Effective patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available to us in every country in which our service is available. The laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the U.S., and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may be unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property.\nWe might be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights. We may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights. Any litigation, whether or not it is resolved in our favor, could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel.\nOur failure or inability to develop non-infringing technology or license the proprietary rights on a timely basis would harm our business.\nOur products may infringe issued patents that may relate to our products because patent applications in the United States are not publicly disclosed until the patent is issued, applications may have been filed which relate to our software products. We may be subject to legal proceedings and claims from time to time in the ordinary course of our business, including claims of alleged infringement of the patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties. Intellectual property litigation is expensive, time consuming, and could divert management\u2019s attention away from running our business. This litigation could also require us to develop non-infringing technology or enter into royalty or license agreements. These royalty or license agreements, if required, may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all, in the event of a successful claim of infringement.\nSoftware errors could be costly and time-consuming for us to correct, and could harm our reputation and impair our ability to sell our solutions.\nOur solutions are based on complex software that may contain errors, or \"bugs,\" that could be costly to correct, harm our reputation and impair our ability to sell our solutions to new customers. Moreover, customers relying on our solution may be more sensitive to such errors, and potential security vulnerabilities and business interruptions for these applications. If we incur substantial costs to correct any errors of this nature, our operating margins could be adversely affected. Because our customers depend on our solutions for critical business functions, any service interruptions could result in lost or delayed market acceptance and lost sales, higher service-level credits and warranty costs, diversion of development resources and product liability suits.\nOur stock price has demonstrated volatility and continued market conditions may cause declines or fluctuations.\nThe price at which our common stock trades has been and will likely continue to be highly volatile and show wide fluctuations due to factors such as the following:\n\u00b7\nconcerns related to liquidity of our stock;\n\u00b7\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results, our ability to meet announced or anticipated profitability goals and changes in or failure to meet securities analysts\u2019 expectations;\n\u00b7\nannouncements of technological innovations and/or the introduction of new services by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7\ndevelopments with respect to intellectual property rights and litigation, regulatory scrutiny and new legislation;\n\u00b7\nconditions and trends in the Internet and other technology industries; and\n\u00b7\ngeneral market and economic conditions.\nFurthermore, the stock market has recently and in the past experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices for the common stock of technology companies, regardless of the specific operating performance of the affected company. These broad market fluctuations may cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nOur insiders who are significant stockholders may control the election of our board and may have interests that conflict with those of other stockholders.\nOur directors and executive officers, together with their affiliates and members of their immediate families, beneficially owned, in the aggregate, approximately 39% of our outstanding capital stock as of our record date, September 8, 2015. As a result, acting together, this group has the ability to exercise significant control over most matters requiring our stockholders\u2019 approval, including the election and removal of directors and significant corporate transactions.\nOur offshore product development, support and professional services may prove difficult to manage or may not allow us to realize our cost reduction goals, produce effective new solutions and provide professional services to drive growth.\nWe use offshore resources to perform new product and services development and provide support and professional consulting efforts, which requires detailed technical and logistical coordination. We must ensure that our international resources and personnel are aware of and understand development specifications and customer support, as well as implementation and configuration requirements and that they can meet applicable timelines. If we are unable to maintain acceptable standards of quality in support, product development and professional services, our attempts to reduce costs and drive growth through new products and margin improvements in technical support and professional services may be negatively impacted, which would adversely affect our results of operations. Outsourcing services to offshore providers may expose us to misappropriation of our intellectual property or that of our customers, or make it more difficult to defend intellectual property rights in our technology.\nIf we are unable to hire and retain key personnel, our business and results of operations would be negatively affected.\nOur success will also depend in large part on the skills, experience and performance of our senior management, engineering, sales, marketing and other key personnel. The loss of the services of any of our senior management or other key personnel, including our Chief Executive Officer and co-founder, Ashutosh Roy, could harm our business. Additionally, an increase in attrition in the Indian workforce on which we rely for research and development would have significant negative effects on us and our results of operations. If we cannot hire and retain qualified personnel, our ability to expand our business would be impaired and our results of operations would suffer.\nPrivacy concerns and laws, evolving regulation of cloud computing, cross-border data transfer restrictions and other domestic or foreign regulations may limit the use and adoption of our solutions and adversely affect our business.\nRegulation related to the provision of services on the Internet is increasing, as federal, state and foreign governments continue to adopt new laws and regulations addressing data privacy and the collection, processing, storage and use of personal information. In some cases foreign data privacy laws and regulations, such as the European Union\u2019s Data Protection Directive, and the country-specific regulations that implement that directive, also govern the processing of personal information. Further, laws are increasingly aimed at the use of personal information for marketing purposes, such as the European Union\u2019s e-Privacy Directive, and the country-specific regulations that implement that directive. Such laws and regulations are subject to differing interpretations and may be inconsistent among jurisdictions. These and other\nrequirements could reduce demand for our solutions or restrict our ability to store and process data or, in some cases, impact our ability to offer our services and solutions in certain locations.\nIn addition to government activity, privacy advocacy and other industry groups have established or may establish new self-regulatory standards that may place additional burdens on us. Our customers expect us to meet voluntary certification or other standards established by third parties, such as TRUSTe. If we are unable to maintain these certifications or meet these standards, it could adversely affect our ability to provide our solutions to certain customers and could harm our business.\nThe costs of compliance with and other burdens imposed by laws, regulations and standards may limit the use and adoption of our service and reduce overall demand for it, or lead to significant fines, penalties or liabilities for any noncompliance.\nFurthermore, concerns regarding data privacy may cause our customers\u2019 customers to resist providing the data necessary to allow our customers to use our service effectively. Even the perception that the privacy of personal information is not satisfactorily protected or does not meet regulatory requirements could inhibit sales of our products or services, and could limit adoption of our subscription solution.\nIndustry-specific regulation is evolving and unfavorable industry-specific laws, regulations or interpretive positions could harm our business.\nOur customers and potential customers do business in a variety of industries, including financial services, the public sector, healthcare and telecommunications. Regulators in certain industries have adopted and may in the future adopt regulations or interpretive positions regarding the use of cloud computing and other outsourced services. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, industry-specific laws, regulations and interpretive positions may limit customers\u2019 use and adoption of our services and reduce overall demand for our services. For example, some financial services regulators have imposed guidelines for use of cloud computing services that mandate specific controls or require financial services enterprises to obtain regulatory approval prior to outsourcing certain functions. If we are unable to comply with these guidelines or controls, or if our customers are unable to obtain regulatory approval to use our service where required, our business may be harmed. In addition, an inability to satisfy the standards of certain voluntary third-party certification bodies that our customers may expect, such as an attestation of compliance with the Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standards, may have an adverse impact on our business. If in the future we are unable to achieve or maintain these industry-specific certifications or other requirements or standards relevant to our customers, it may harm our business.\nIn some cases, industry-specific laws, regulations or interpretive positions may also apply directly to us as a service provider. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with such requirements could have an adverse impact on our business.\nWe may need to license third-party technologies and may be unable to do so on commercially reasonable terms.\nTo the extent we need to license third-party technologies, we may be unable to do so on commercially reasonable terms or at all. In addition, we may fail to successfully integrate any licensed technology into our products or services. Third-party licenses may expose us to increased risks, including risks associated with the integration of new technology, the diversion of resources from the development of our own proprietary technology, and our inability to generate revenue from new technology sufficient to offset associated acquisition and maintenance costs. Our inability to obtain and successfully integrate any of these licenses could delay product and service development until equivalent technology can be identified, licensed and integrated. This in turn would harm our business and operating results.\nChanges to current accounting policies could have a significant effect on our reported financial results or the way in which we conduct our business.\nGenerally accepted accounting principles and the related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations for some of our significant accounting policies are highly complex and require subjective judgments\nand assumptions. Some of our more significant accounting policies that could be affected by changes in the accounting rules and the related implementation guidelines and interpretations include:\n\u00b7\nrecognition of revenue;\n\u00b7\ncontingencies and litigation; and\n\u00b7\naccounting for income taxes.\nChanges in these or other rules, or scrutiny of our current accounting practices, or a determination that our judgments or assumptions in the application of these accounting principles were incorrect, could have a significant adverse effect on our reported operating results or the way in which we conduct our business.\nWe depend on broad market acceptance of our applications and of our business model.\nWe depend on the widespread acceptance and use of our applications as an effective solution for businesses seeking to manage high volumes of customer interactions across multiple channels, including Web, phone, email, print and in-person. While we believe the potential to be very large, we cannot accurately estimate the size or growth rate of the potential market for such product and service offerings generally, and we do not know whether our products and services in particular will achieve broad market acceptance. The market for customer engagement software is rapidly evolving, and concerns over the security and reliability of online transactions, the privacy of users and quality of service or other issues may inhibit the growth of the Internet and commercial online services. If the market for our applications fails to grow or grows more slowly than we currently anticipate, our business will be seriously harmed.\nFurthermore, our business model is premised on business assumptions that are still evolving. Our business model assumes that both customers and companies will increasingly elect to communicate via multiple channels, as well as demand integration of the online channels into the traditional telephone-based call center. Our business model also assumes that many companies recognize the benefits of a hosted delivery model and will seek to have their customer engagement software applications hosted by us. If any of these assumptions is incorrect or if customers and companies do not adopt digital technology in a timely manner, our business will be seriously harmed and our stock price will decline.\nWe may be unable to respond to the rapid technological change and changing customer preferences in the online sales, marketing, customer service, and/or online consumer services industries and this may harm our business.\nIf we are unable, for technological, legal, financial or other reasons, to adapt in a timely manner to changing market conditions in the online sales, marketing, customer service and/or e-commerce industry or our customers\u2019 or Internet users\u2019 requirements or preferences, our business, results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected. Business on the Internet is characterized by rapid technological change. In addition, the market for online sales, marketing, customer service and expert advice solutions is relatively new. Sudden changes in customer and Internet user requirements and preferences, frequent new product and service introductions embodying new technologies, such as broadband communications, and the emergence of new industry standards and practices such as but not limited to security standards could render our services and our proprietary technology and systems obsolete. The rapid evolution of these products and services will require that we continually improve the performance, features and reliability of our services. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to:\n\u00b7\nenhance the features and performance of our services;\n\u00b7\ndevelop and offer new services that are valuable to companies doing business online as well as Internet users; and\n\u00b7\nrespond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices in a cost-effective and timely manner.\nIf any of our new services, including upgrades to our current services, do not meet our customers\u2019 or Internet users\u2019 expectations, our business may be harmed. Updating our technology may require significant additional capital expenditures and could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf new services require us to grow rapidly, this could place a significant strain on our managerial, operational, technical and financial resources. In order to manage our growth, we could be required to implement new or upgraded operating and financial systems, procedures and controls. Our failure to expand our operations in an efficient manner could cause our expenses to grow, our revenue to decline or grow more slowly than expected and could otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition\nThe European Parliament is considering revocation of the legal framework under which personal data of European residents may be transferred to the United States, and this revocation, if implemented, could hamper our business in Europe.\nThe use and transfer of personal data in many European countries is currently governed under a regulatory framework pursuant to which U.S. businesses: (i) commit to treat the personal data of European Union residents in accordance with the current regulatory framework and (ii) may self-certify their compliance. The European Union is currently considering adoption of new regulations which would include prohibitions on the transfer of our data about European Union customers to our computer servers in the United States. If these restrictions are adopted, we may have to create duplicative, and potentially expensive, information technology infrastructure and business operations in Europe, which may hinder our expansion plans in Europe, or render these plans commercially infeasible. These developments could materially increase our costs of doing business and harm our operating results.\nWe may engage in future acquisitions or investments that could dilute our existing stockholders, cause us to incur significant expenses or harm our business.\nWe may review acquisition or investment prospects that we believe may complement our current business or enhance our technological capabilities. Integrating any newly acquired businesses or their technologies or products may be expensive and time-consuming, and may not result in benefits to our business. To finance any acquisitions, it may be necessary for us to raise additional funds through public or private financings. Additional funds may not be available on terms that are favorable to us, if at all, and, in the case of equity financings, may result in dilution to our existing stockholders. We may not be able to operate acquired businesses profitably. If we are unable to integrate newly acquired entities or technologies effectively, our operating results could suffer. Future acquisitions by us could also result in large and immediate write-offs, incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, or amortization of expenses related to goodwill and other intangibles, any of which could harm our operating results.", "PERMNO": 87227, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "EGAN"}
