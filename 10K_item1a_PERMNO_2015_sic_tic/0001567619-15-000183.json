{"cik": "1530804", "company": "Tronox Ltd", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the risk factors set forth below, as well as the other information contained in this Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes. This Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or those we currently view to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nEconomic Factors\nMarket conditions, as well as global and regional economic downturns that adversely affect the demand for the end-use products that contain TiO2 or our other products, could adversely affect the profitability of our operations and the prices at which we can sell our products, negatively impacting our financial results.\nOur revenue and profitability is largely dependent on the TiO2 industry either through direct sales of TiO2 by our pigment business, or to TiO2 producers by our mineral sands business sales. TiO2 is a chemical used in many \u201cquality of life\u201d products for which demand historically has been linked to global, regional and local GDP and discretionary spending, which can be negatively impacted by regional and world events or economic conditions. Such events are likely to cause a decrease in demand for our products and, as a result, may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe markets for many of our products have seasonally affected sales patterns.\nThe demand for TiO2 during a given year is subject to seasonal fluctuations. Because TiO2 is widely used in paint and other coatings, titanium feedstock is in higher demand prior to the painting season in the Northern Hemisphere (spring and summer), and pig iron is in lower demand during the European summer holidays, when many steel plants and foundries undergo maintenance. Zircon generally is a non-seasonal product but is negatively impacted by the winter and Chinese New Year celebrations due to reduced zircon demand from China. We may be adversely affected by existing or future cyclical changes, and such conditions may be sustained or further aggravated by anticipated or unanticipated changes in regional weather conditions. For example, poor weather conditions in a region can lead to an abbreviated painting season, which can depress consumer sales of paint products that use TiO2.\nOur results of operations may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates.\nThe financial condition and results of operations of our operating entities outside the United States are reported in various foreign currencies, primarily South African Rand, Australian Dollars and Euros, and then converted into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rate for inclusion in the financial statements. As a result, any volatility of the U.S. dollar against these foreign currencies creates uncertainty for and may have a negative impact on reported sales and operating margin. We have made a U.S. dollar functional currency election for both Australian financial reporting and federal income tax purposes. On this basis, our Australian entities report their results of operations on a U.S. dollar basis. In addition, our operating entities often need to convert currencies they receive for their products into currencies in which they purchase raw materials or pay for services, which could result in a gain or loss depending on fluctuations in exchange rates.\nIn order to manage this risk, we have, from time to time, entered into forward contracts to buy and sell foreign currencies as \u201ceconomic hedges\u201d for these foreign currency transactions.\nOur operations may be negatively impacted by inflation.\nOur profits and financial condition could be adversely affected when cost inflation is not offset by devaluation in operating currencies or an increase in the price of our products. Our operations have been affected by inflation in the countries in which they have operated in recent years. Working costs and wages in South Africa and Australia have increased in recent years, resulting in significant cost pressures for the mining industry.\nAs an emerging market, South Africa poses a challenging array of long-term political, economic, financial and operational risks.\n\u2022 South Africa has been undergoing political and economic challenges. Changes to or instability in the economic or political environment in South Africa, especially if such changes create political instability, actual or potential shortages of production materials or labor unrest, could result in production delays and production shortfalls, and materially impact our production and results of operations.\n\u2022 In South Africa, our mining and smelting operations depend on electrical power generated by Eskom, the state-owned sole energy supplier. The contractual Notified Maximum Demand for the Namakwa Sands smelter and KZN Sands smelter sites are 72 mega volt amperes (\u201cMVA\u201d) and 87 MVA, respectively. South African electricity prices have risen during the past few years, and future increases are likely. Additionally, our KZN Sands operations currently use 245,277 gigajoules of Sasol gas, which is available only from Sasol Limited; however, we could replace approximately 30% to 40% of our current Sasol gas usage with furnace off-gas produced by KZN Sands, if necessary. KZN Sands is currently in the process of increasing its use of furnace off-gas. Construction of a 13.6 megawatt co-generation plant at Namakwa Sands has been completed. The plant, which consumes all furnace off-gas, produces electricity that is offset against current consumption sourced from Eskom.\n\u2022 We use significant amounts of water in our operations, which could impose significant costs. Use of water in South Africa is governed by water-use license. Our KZN mining operation in South Africa uses water to transport the slimes or sand from reclaimed areas to the processing plant and to the tailings facilities. Reduced water availability may result in rationing, which could impact production rates or result in increased water costs. However, our KZN Sands operation can use sea water, which is readily available since KZN Sands is located in a coastal region, although using sea water instead of fresh water would increase operational costs due to the desalination process, which may not be offset against lower water operating costs.\n\u2022 Under South African law, our South African mining operations are subject to water-use licenses that govern each operation. These licenses require, among other conditions, that mining operations achieve and maintain certain water quality limits for all water discharges, where applicable. Our South African operations that came into existence after the adoption of the National Water Act, No. 36 of 1998 have applied for and been issued the required water-use licenses. However, changes to water-use licenses could affect our operational results and financial condition.\n\u2022 The South African government may sharpen its focus on intervention in mining through various means including increased taxation, greater control and conditions on the distribution of mineral rights, poverty alleviation, and job creation. Such measures have not yet been defined, and the impact the measures may have on our business remains uncertain.\n\u2022 Changes to the revised MPRDA have been incorporated into the 2013 MPRDA amendment, and are awaiting approval by the South African Parliament before being promulgated. Some of the proposed changes may have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. Although we expect the bulk of the original act to remain intact, there could be substantial changes, based on the current draft. This could have adverse effects on our business, operating results and financial condition.\n\u2022 South Africa\u2019s exchange control regulations require resident companies to obtain the prior approval of the South African Reserve Bank to raise capital in any currency other than the Rand, and restrict the export of capital from South Africa. While the South African government has relaxed exchange controls in recent years, it is difficult to predict whether or how it will further relax or abolish exchange control measures in the future. These exchange control restrictions could hinder our financial and strategic flexibility, particularly our ability to use South African capital to fund acquisitions, capital expenditures, and new projects outside of South Africa.\n\u2022 Our operations in South Africa are reliant on services provided by the State agency, Transnet, for limited rail transport services at Namakwa Sands. Furthermore, they provide extensive dock-side services at both the ports of Richards Bay and Saldanha Bay. Delays, particularly industrial actions, could have a negative impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.\n\u2022 South African law governs the payment of compensation and medical costs to a compensation fund against which mining employees and other people at sites where ancillary mining activities are conducted can claim for mining activity-related illnesses or injuries. Should claims against the compensation fund rise significantly due to our mining activity or if claims against us are not covered by the compensation fund, the amount of our contribution or liability to claimants may increase, which could adversely impact our financial condition. In addition, the HIV/AIDS epidemic in South Africa poses risks to our South African operations in terms of potentially reduced productivity, and increased medical and other costs. If there is a significant increase in the incidence of HIV/AIDS infection and related diseases among the South African workforce over the next several years, our operations, projects and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nThe labor and employment laws in many jurisdictions in which we operate are more onerous than those of the United States; and some of our labor force has substantial works\u2019 council or trade union participation, which creates a risk of disruption from labor disputes and new laws affecting employment policies.\nLabor costs constituted approximately 25% of our production costs in 2014. The majority of our employees are located outside the United States. In most of those countries, labor and employment laws are more onerous than in the United States and, in many cases, grant significant job protection to employees, including rights on termination of employment.\nIn South Africa, over 70% of our workforce belongs to a union. In Australia, most employees are not currently represented by a union, but 50% are represented by a collective bargaining agreement. In The Netherlands, 50% of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement and 30% are members of a union.\nOur South African operations have entered into various agreements regulating wages and working conditions at our mines. There have been periods when various stakeholders have been unable to agree on dispute resolution processes, leading to threats of disruptive labor disputes, although only two strikes have ever occurred in the history of these operations. Due to the high level of employee union membership, our South African operations are at risk of production stoppages for indefinite periods due to strikes and other labor disputes. In the past five years, employees of KZN Sands went on strike once, for a 22-day period, from August 23 to September 13, 2010, in a dispute over wages and employment conditions, which resulted in an average daily production loss of 20,000 metric tons and 1,398 metric tons of heavy mineral concentrate, but had no significant impact on the smelter or furnace operations. Although we believe that we have good labor relations with our South African employees, we may experience labor disputes in the future.\nSouth African employment law, which is based on the minimum standard set by the International Labour Organization, sets out minimum terms and conditions of employment for employees. Although these may be improved by agreements between an employer and the trade unions, prescribed minimum terms and conditions form the benchmark for all employment contracts. Our South African operations are required to submit a report to the South African Department of Labour under South African employment law detailing the progress made towards achieving employment equity in the workplace. Failing to submit this report in a timely manner could result in substantial penalties. In addition, future legislative developments that affect South African employment policies may increase production costs or negatively impact relationships with employees and trade unions, which may have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe are required to consult with, and seek the consent or advice of, various employee groups or works\u2019 councils that represent our employees for any changes to our activities or employee benefits. This requirement could have a significant impact on our flexibility in managing costs and responding to market changes.\nBusiness Factors\nFluctuations in costs of our raw materials or our access to supplies of our raw materials could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn 2014, raw materials used in the production of TiO2 constituted approximately 53% of our operating expenses. Fuel and energy linked to commodities, such as diesel, heavy fuel oil and coal, and other consumables, such as chlorine, illuminating paraffin, electrodes, and anthracite, consumed in our manufacturing and mining operations form an important part of our operating costs. We have no control over the costs of these consumables, many of which are\nlinked to some degree to the price of oil and coal, and the costs of many of these raw materials may fluctuate widely for a variety of reasons, including changes in availability, major capacity additions or reductions, or significant facility operating problems. These fluctuations could negatively affect our operating margins and our profitability. As these costs rise, our operating expenses will increase and could adversely affect our business, especially if we are unable to pass price increases in raw materials through to our customers.\nShortages or price increases by our single source suppliers, such as the suppliers of chlorine to our Australian operations or high-quality anthracite to Namakwa Sands could decrease revenue or increase production costs, reducing the profitability of operations. Fluctuations in oil and coal prices impact our operating cost and capital expenditure estimates and, in the absence of other economic fluctuations, could result in significant changes in the total expenditure estimates for our operations or new expansion projects, and when taken into account with other production costs, such as wages, equipment and machinery costs, may render certain operations nonviable.\nGiven the nature of our chemical, mining and smelting operations, we face a material risk of liability, delays and increased cash costs of production from environmental and industrial accidents and operational breakdowns.\nOur business involves significant risks and hazards, including environmental hazards, industrial accidents, and breakdowns of equipment and machinery. Our business is exposed to hazards associated with chemical process manufacturing and the related storage, handling and transportation of raw materials, products and wastes, and our furnace operations that are subject to explosions, water ingress and refractory failure, and our open pit (also called open-cut) and dredge mining operations that are subject to flooding and accidents associated with rock transportation equipment and conveyor belts. Furthermore, during operational breakdowns, the relevant facility may not be fully operational within the anticipated timeframe, which could result in further business losses. The occurrence of any of these or other hazards could delay production, suspend operations, increase repair, maintenance or medical costs and, due to the integration of our facilities, could have an adverse effect on the productivity and profitability of a particular manufacturing facility or on our business as a whole. Over our operating history, we have incurred incidents of this nature.\nThere is also a risk that our key raw materials or our products may be found to have currently unrecognized toxicological or health-related impact on the environment or on our customers or employees. Such hazards may cause personal injury and loss of life, damage to property and contamination of the environment, which could lead to government fines or work stoppage injunctions and lawsuits by injured persons. If such actions are determined to be adverse to us, we may have inadequate insurance to cover such claims, or insufficient cash flow to pay for such claims. Such outcomes could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are a holding company that is dependent on cash flows from our operating subsidiaries to fund our debt obligations, capital expenditures and ongoing operations.\nAll of our operations are conducted and all of our assets are owned by our operating companies, which are our subsidiaries. We intend to continue to conduct our operations at the operating companies and any future subsidiaries. Consequently, our cash flow and our ability to meet our obligations or make cash distributions depends upon the cash flow of our operating companies and any future subsidiaries, and the payment of funds by our operating companies and any future subsidiaries in the form of dividends or otherwise. The ability of our operating companies and any future subsidiaries to make any payments to us depends on their earnings, the terms of their indebtedness, including the terms of any credit facilities, and legal restrictions regarding the transfer of funds.\nOur ability to service our debt and fund our planned capital expenditures and ongoing operations will depend on our ability to generate and increase cash flow, and our access to additional liquidity sources. Our ability to generate and increase cash flow is dependent on many factors, including:\n\u2022 the impact of competition from other chemical and materials manufacturers and diversified companies;\n\u2022 the transfer of funds from subsidiaries in the United States to certain foreign subsidiaries;\n\u2022 general world business conditions, economic uncertainty or downturn and the significant downturn in housing construction and overall economies;\n\u2022 our ability to obtain raw materials at reasonable prices or to raise prices to offset, in whole or in part, the effects of higher raw material costs;\n\u2022 our ability to adequately deliver customer service and competitive product quality; and,\n\u2022 the effects of governmental regulation on our business.\nMany of these factors are beyond our control. A general economic downturn can result in reduced spending by customers, which will impact our revenues and cash flows from operating activities. At reduced performance, if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or access additional liquidity sources, we may not be able to service and repay our existing debt, operate our business, respond to competitive challenges, or fund our other liquidity and capital needs.\nOur industry and the end-use markets in which we compete are highly competitive. This competition may adversely affect our results of operations and operating cash flows.\nEach of our markets is highly competitive. Competition in the pigment industry is based on a number of factors such as price, product quality, and service. We face significant competition from major international and smaller regional competitors. Our most significant competitors include major chemical and materials manufacturers and diversified companies, a number of which have substantially larger financial resources, greater personnel, and larger facilities than we do. We also compete with numerous smaller, regional producers, including producers in China, that have expanded their sulphate TiO2 production capacity during the previous five years.\nZircon producers generally compete on the basis of price, quality, logistics, delivery, and payment terms and consistency of supply. Although we believe we have competitive quality, long-term relationships with customers and product range, our primary competitive disadvantage relative to our major competitors is our distance from our main consumers (i.e., Asia and Europe).\nWithin the end-use markets in which we compete, competition between products is intense. We face substantial risk that certain events, such as new product development by competitors, changing customer needs, production advances for competing products, or price changes in raw materials, could cause our customers to switch to our competitors\u2019 products. If we are unable to develop and produce or market our products to compete effectively against our competitors following such events, our results of operations and operating cash flows may suffer.\nWe may need additional capital in the future and may not be able to obtain it on favorable terms.\nOur industry is capital intensive, and our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to develop and market innovative products and to update our facilities and process technology. We may require additional capital in the future to finance our growth and development, implement further marketing and sales activities, fund ongoing research and development activities and meet general working capital needs. Our capital requirements will depend on many factors, including acceptance of, and demand for our products, the extent to which we invest in new technology and research and development projects, and the status and timing of these developments, as well as general availability of capital from debt and/or equity markets. Additional financing may not be available when needed on terms favorable to us, or at all. Further, the terms of our debt may limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness or issue additional equity. If we are unable to obtain adequate funds on acceptable terms, we may be unable to develop or enhance our products, take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures, which could harm our business.\nThe agreements and instruments governing our debt contain restrictions and limitations that could affect our ability to operate our business, as well as impact our liquidity.\nAs of December 31, 2014, our total principal amount of long-term debt was $2.4 billion (including $7 million of original issue discount in connection with the senior secured term loan (the \u201cTerm Loan\u201d), which has a face value of $1.5 billion). Our credit facilities contain covenants that could adversely affect our ability to operate our business, our liquidity, and our results of operations. These covenants restrict, among other things, our and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to:\n\u2022 incur or guarantee additional indebtedness;\n\u2022 complete asset sales, acquisitions or mergers;\n\u2022 make investments and capital expenditures;\n\u2022 prepay other indebtedness;\n\u2022 enter into transactions with affiliates; and,\n\u2022 fund dividends or repurchase shares.\nIn addition, the terms of our credit facilities require us and our subsidiaries to maintain certain minimum performance levels relative to our debt. Certain of our facilities, excluding the Term Loan and the $900 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes (the \u201cSenior Notes\u201d), include requirements relating to the ratio of adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\u201cEBITDA\u201d) to indebtedness or certain fixed charges. The breach of any covenants or obligations in our credit facilities, not otherwise waived or amended, could result in a default under the applicable debt obligations (and cross-defaults to certain other debt obligations) and could trigger acceleration of those obligations, which in turn could trigger other cross defaults under other future agreements governing our long-term indebtedness. In addition, the secured lenders under the credit facilities could foreclose on their collateral, which includes equity interests in our subsidiaries, and exercise other rights of secured creditors. Any default under those credit facilities could adversely affect our growth, our financial condition, our results of operations and our ability to make payments on our credit facilities, and could force us to seek the protection of bankruptcy laws.\nExxaro may exert substantial influence over us as a shareholder.\nAt December 31, 2014, Exxaro held approximately 44% of the voting securities of Tronox Limited, and had three representatives serving as Directors on our nine-member board. Additionally, in the future, Exxaro may exchange its retained interest in the mineral sands business for additional Class B Shares.\nDue to Exxaro\u2019s significant ownership interest, it is entitled to certain rights under the Constitution and the Shareholder\u2019s Deed of Tronox Limited. For example, the Constitution provides that, for as long as the Class B voting interest is at least 10% of the total voting interest in Tronox Limited, there must be nine directors on our board; of which the holders of Class A ordinary shares (\u201cClass A Shares\u201d) will be entitled to vote separately to elect a certain number of directors to our board (which we refer to as Class A Directors), and the holders of Class B Shares will be entitled to vote separately to elect a certain number of directors to our board (which we refer to as Class B Directors). If the Class B voting interest is greater than or equal to 30%, our board will consist of six Class A Directors and three Class B Directors. If the Class B voting interest is greater than or equal to 20% but less than 30%, our board of directors will consist of seven Class A Directors and two Class B Directors. If the Class B voting interest is greater than or equal to 10% but less than 20%, our board will consist of eight Class A Directors and one Class B Director.\nThe Constitution also provides that, subject to certain limitations, for as long as the Class B voting interest is at least 20%, a separate vote by holders of Class A Shares and Class B Shares is required to approve certain types of merger or similar transactions that will result in a change in control or a sale of all or substantially all of our assets or any reorganization or transaction that does not treat Class A and Class B Shares equally.\nUnder the terms of the Shareholder\u2019s Deed entered into upon completion of the Transaction, Exxaro agreed that for the Standstill Period, it would not engage in any transaction or other action that would result in its beneficial ownership of the voting shares of Tronox Limited exceeding 45% of the total issued shares of Tronox Limited. In addition, except under certain circumstances, Exxaro agreed not to sell, pledge or otherwise transfer any such voting shares during the Standstill Period. After the Standstill Period, Exxaro has agreed not to acquire any voting shares of Tronox Limited if, following such acquisition, Exxaro will have a voting interest in Tronox Limited of 50% or more unless Exxaro brings any proposal to make such an acquisition to the board of directors of Tronox Limited on a confidential basis. In the event an agreement regarding the proposal is not reached, Exxaro is permitted to make a takeover offer for all the shares of Tronox Limited not held by affiliates of Exxaro provided that binding acceptances are received from a majority of the shares not held by affiliates of Exxaro.\nAs a result of Exxaro\u2019s significant ownership interest and its governance rights, Exxaro may be able to exert substantial influence over our management, operations and potential significant corporate transactions, including a change in control or the sale of all or substantially all of our assets. Exxaro\u2019s influence may have an adverse effect on the trading price of our ordinary shares.\nOur South African operations may lose the benefit of the Black Economic Empowerment (\u201cBEE\u201d) status under South African legislation, resulting in the need to implement a remedial solution or introduce a new minority shareholder, which could negatively impact our South African operations.\nExxaro retains a 26% direct ownership interest in each of Tronox KZN Sands (Pty) Ltd and Tronox Mineral Sands (Pty) Ltd in order for these two entities to comply with the requirements of the MPRDA and the South African Mining Charter ownership requirements under the BEE legislation. Exxaro has agreed to maintain its direct ownership for a period of the shorter of 10 years (unless it transfers the direct ownership interests to another qualified buyer under the BEE legislation) or the date on which the requirement to maintain a direct ownership stake in each of Tronox KZN Sands (Pty) Ltd and Tronox Mineral Sands (Pty) Ltd no longer applies, as determined by the DMR. If either Tronox KZN Sands (Pty) Ltd or Tronox Mineral Sands (Pty) Ltd ceases to qualify under the BEE legislation, Tronox Limited and Exxaro have agreed to jointly seek a remedial solution. If Tronox Limited and Exxaro cannot successfully implement a solution and the reason for this failure is due to anything other than a change in law, then we may dispose of Exxaro\u2019s shares in the non-qualifying company to another BEE compliant, qualifying purchaser. During any period of any non-qualification, our South African operations may be in violation of their mining or prospecting rights, as well as the requirements of the MPRDA and the South African Mining Charter, which could result in a suspension or revocation of the non-qualifying company\u2019s mining and prospecting rights and could expose us to operating restrictions, lost business opportunities and delays in receiving further regulatory approvals for our South African operations and expansion activities. In addition, if Exxaro\u2019s direct ownership in Tronox KZN Sands (Pty) Ltd and Tronox Mineral Sands (Pty) Ltd is sold to another purchaser, we would be required to share ownership and control of our South African operations with a minority shareholder, which may impact our operational and financial flexibility and could impact profitability, expansion opportunities and our results of operations.\nEstimations of our ore resources and reserve estimates are based on a number of assumptions, including mining and recovery factors, future cash costs of production and ore demand and pricing. As a result, ore resources and reserve quantities actually produced may differ from current estimates.\nThe mineral resource and reserve estimates are estimates of the quantity and ore grades in our mines based on the interpretation of geological data obtained from drill holes and other sampling techniques, as well as from feasibility studies. The accuracy of these estimates is dependent on the assumptions and judgments made in interpreting the geological data. The assessment of geographical characteristics, such as location, quantity, quality, continuity of geology and grade, is made with varying degrees of confidence in accordance with established guidelines and standards. We use various exploration techniques, including geophysical surveys and sampling through drilling and trenching, to investigate resources and implement applicable quality assurance and quality control criteria to ensure that data is representative. Our mineral reserves represent the amount of ore that we believe can be successfully mined and processed, and are estimated based on a number of factors, which have been stated in accordance with the South African Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves 2007 version, as amended 2009 (the \u201cSAMREC Code\u201d) and the Australian code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources the Joint Ore Reserves Committee Code (2012) (the \u201cJORC Code\u201d).\nThere is significant uncertainty in any mineral reserve or mineral resource estimate. Factors that are beyond our control, such as the ability to secure mineral rights, the sufficiency of mineralization to support mining and beneficiation practices and the suitability of the market may significantly impact mineral resource and reserve estimates. The actual deposits encountered and the economic viability of mining a deposit may differ materially from our estimates. Since these mineral resources and reserves are estimates based on assumptions related to factors discussed above, we may revise these estimates in the future as we become aware of new developments. To maintain TiO2 feedstock production beyond the expected lives of our existing mines or to increase production materially above projected levels, we will need to access additional reserves through exploration or discovery.\nIf we are unable to innovate and successfully introduce new products, or new technologies or processes reduce the demand for our products or the price at which we can sell products, our profitability could be adversely affected.\nOur industries and the end-use markets into which we sell our products experience periodic technological change and product improvement. Our future growth will depend on our ability to gauge the direction of commercial and technological progress in key end-use markets and on our ability to fund and successfully\ndevelop, manufacture and market products in such changing end-use markets. We must continue to identify, develop and market innovative products or enhance existing products on a timely basis to maintain our profit margins and our competitive position. We may be unable to develop new products or technology, either alone or with third parties, or license intellectual property rights from third parties on a commercially competitive basis. If we fail to keep pace with the evolving technological innovations in our end-use markets on a competitive basis, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, new technologies or processes have the potential to replace or provide lower-cost alternatives to our products, such as new processes that reduce TiO2 in consumer products or the use of chloride slag in the production of TiO2, which could result in TiO2 producers using less chloride slag, or to reduce the need for TiO2 in consumer products, which could depress the demand and pricing for TiO2. We cannot predict whether technological innovations will, in the future, result in a lower demand for our products or affect the competitiveness of our business. We may be required to invest significant resources to adapt to changing technologies, markets and competitive environments.\nViolations or noncompliance with the extensive environmental, health and safety laws and regulations to which we are subject or changes in laws or regulations governing our operations could result in unanticipated loss or liability.\nOur operations and production facilities are subject to extensive environmental and health and safety laws and regulations at national, international and local levels in numerous jurisdictions relating to use of natural resources, pollution, protection of the environment, transporting and storing raw materials and finished products, and storing and disposing of hazardous wastes among other materials. The costs of compliance with the extensive environmental, health and safety laws and regulations or the inability to obtain, update or renew permits required for operation or expansion of our business could reduce our profitability or otherwise adversely affect our business. If we fail to comply with the conditions of our permits governing the production and management of regulated materials, mineral sands mining licenses or leases or the provisions of the applicable South African or Australian law, these permits, mining licenses or leases and mining rights could be canceled or suspended, and we could be prevented from obtaining new mining and prospecting rights, which could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Additionally, we could incur substantial costs, including fines, damages, criminal or civil sanctions and remediation costs, or experience interruptions in our operations, for violations arising under these laws and regulations. In the event of a catastrophic incident involving any of the raw materials we use, or chemicals or mineral products we produce, we could incur material costs as a result of addressing the consequences of such event.\nChanges to existing laws governing operations, especially changes in laws relating to transportation of mineral resources, the treatment of land and infrastructure, contaminated land, the remediation of mines, tax royalties, exchange control restrictions, environmental remediation, mineral rights, ownership of mining assets, or the rights to prospect and mine may have a material adverse effect on our future business operations and financial performance. There is risk that onerous conditions may be attached to authorizations in the form of mining rights, water-use licenses, miscellaneous licenses and environmental approvals, or that the grant of these approvals may be delayed or not granted.\nOur current operations involve the production and management of regulated materials that are subject to various environmental laws and regulations and are dependent on obtaining and the periodic renewal of permits from various governmental agencies. The inability to obtain, update or renew permits related to the operation of our businesses, or the costs required in order to comply with permit standards, could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe compete with other mining and chemical businesses for key human resources in the countries in which we operate, and our business will suffer if we are unable to hire highly skilled employees or if our key officers or employees discontinue employment with us.\nWe compete with other chemical and mining companies, and other companies generally, in the countries in which we operate to attract and retain key human resources at all levels with the appropriate technical skills and operating and managerial experience necessary to continue operating and expanding our businesses. These operations use modern techniques and equipment and accordingly require various types of skilled workers. The success of our business will be materially dependent upon the skills, experience and efforts of our key officers\nand skilled employees. The global shortage of key mining skills, including geologists, mining engineers, metallurgists, and skilled artisans, has been exacerbated by increased mining activity across the globe. Competition for skilled employees is particularly severe in Western Australia and at Namakwa Sands, which may cost us in terms of higher labor costs or reduced productivity. As a result, we may not be able to attract and retain skilled and experienced employees. Should we lose any of our key personnel or fail to attract and retain key qualified personnel or other skilled employees, our business may be harmed and our operational results and financial condition could be affected.\nThere may be difficulty in effecting service of legal process and enforcing judgments against us and our directors and management.\nWe are registered under the laws of Western Australia, Australia, and substantial portions of our assets are located outside of the United States. In addition, certain members of our board of directors reside outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon Tronox Limited or such other persons residing outside the United States, or to enforce judgments outside the United States obtained against such persons in U.S. courts in any action, including actions predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws. In addition, it may be difficult for investors to enforce rights predicated upon the U.S. federal securities laws in original actions brought in courts in jurisdictions located outside the United States.\nThird parties may develop new intellectual property rights for processes and/or products that we would want to use, but would be unable to do so; or, third parties may claim that the products we make or the processes that we use infringe their intellectual property rights, which may cause us to pay unexpected litigation costs or damages or prevent us from making, using or selling products we make or require alteration of the processes we use.\nResults of our operations may also be negatively impacted if a competitor develops or has the right to use intellectual property rights for new processes or products and we cannot obtain similar rights on favorable terms or are unable to independently develop non-infringing competitive alternatives.\nAlthough there are currently no known pending or threatened proceedings or claims relating to alleged infringement, misappropriation or violation of the intellectual property rights of others, we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the future in which third parties allege that their patents or other intellectual property rights are infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated by us or our products or processes. In the event that any such infringement, misappropriation or violation of the intellectual property rights of others is found, we may need to obtain licenses from those parties or substantially re-engineer our products or processes to avoid such infringement, misappropriation or violation. We might not be able to obtain the necessary licenses on acceptable terms or be able to re-engineer our products or processes successfully. Moreover, if we are found by a court of law to infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of others, we could be required to pay substantial damages or be enjoined from making, using or selling the infringing products or technology. We also could be enjoined from making, using or selling the allegedly infringing products or technology pending the final outcome of the suit. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our intellectual property were compromised or copied by competitors, or if competitors were to develop similar intellectual property independently, our results of operations could be negatively affected.\nOur success depends to a significant degree upon our ability to protect and preserve our intellectual property rights. Although we own and have applied for numerous patents and trademarks throughout the world, we may have to rely on judicial enforcement of our patents and other proprietary rights. Our patents and other intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, and rendered unenforceable or otherwise compromised. A failure to protect, defend or enforce our intellectual property could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe also rely upon unpatented proprietary technology, know-how and other trade secrets to maintain our competitive position. While we maintain policies to enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to protect our proprietary expertise and other trade secrets, these agreements may not be enforceable or, even if legally enforceable, we may not have adequate remedies for breaches of such agreements. We also\nmay not be able to readily detect breaches of such agreements. The failure of our patents or confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary technology, know-how or trade secrets could result in significantly lower revenues, reduced profit margins or loss of market share.\nIn addition, we may be unable to determine when third parties are using our intellectual property rights without our authorization. We also have licensed certain of our intellectual property rights to third parties, and we cannot be certain that our licensees are using our intellectual property only as authorized by the applicable license agreement. The undetected or unremedied unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights or the legitimate development or acquisition of intellectual property related to our industry by third parties could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage we have as a result of our intellectual property, adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operations. If we must take legal action to protect, defend or enforce our intellectual property rights, any suits or proceedings could result in significant costs and diversion of our resources and our management\u2019s attention, and we may not prevail in any such suits or proceedings. A failure to protect, defend or enforce our intellectual property rights could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our intangible assets or other long-lived assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.\nWe have a significant amount of intangible assets and other long-lived assets on our consolidated balance sheets. Under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d), we review our intangible assets and other long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances, indicating that the carrying value of our intangible assets and other long-lived assets may not be recoverable, include, but are not limited to, a significant decline in share price and market capitalization, changes in the industries in which we operate, particularly the impact of a downturn in the global economy, as well as competition or other factors leading to reduction in expected long-term sales or profitability. We may be required to record a significant noncash charge in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our intangible assets and other long-lived assets is determined, negatively impacting our results of operations.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting which could, if not remediated, result in material misstatements in our financial statements which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting. As more fully described in Controls and Procedures in Part II, Item 9A of this report, in connection with the audit of our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2014, management identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting relating to (i) controls over the information and communication related to our South African operations that were improperly designed and not effective, as information required to execute control activities to completely and accurately record and disclose transactions was not communicated timely to the individuals responsible for executing control activities. The controls over our calculation for accrued royalty expenses relating to our mining operations in Namakwa South African were improperly designed and not effective; and (ii) controls over restricted access and segregation of duties within our SAP systems that were improperly designed and not effective as certain personnel have inappropriate access to execute conflicting transactions, as well as the ability to prepare and post journal entries without an independent review required by someone other than the preparer.\nWe are actively engaged in developing a remediation plan to address such materials weaknesses. However, while we expect to complete the implementation of remediation measures and remediate such material weaknesses as soon as practicable, there can be no assurance that such efforts will be successful or that our internal control over financial reporting will be effective as a result of such efforts. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will not identify internal control material weaknesses in the future or that any such weaknesses will not have a material impact on our operating results or financial statements or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. In addition, if we discover a material weakness in our internal controls in the future, the disclosure of that fact could reduce the market\u2019s confidence in our financial statements.\nOur results of operations and financial condition could be seriously impacted by security breaches, including cybersecurity incidents.\nFailure to effectively prevent, detect and recover from security breaches, including attacks on information technology and infrastructure by hackers; viruses; breaches due to employee error or actions; or other disruptions could result in misuse of our assets, business disruptions, loss of property including trade secrets and confidential business information, legal claims or proceedings, reporting errors, processing inefficiencies, negative media attention, loss of sales and interference with regulatory compliance. We have determined that such attacks could result in unauthorized parties gaining access to at least certain confidential business information. However, to date, we have not experienced any material financial impact, changes in the competitive environment or business operations that we attribute to these attacks. Although management does not believe that we have experienced any material losses to date related to security breaches, including cybersecurity incidents, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future. We actively manage the risks within our control that could lead to business disruptions and security breaches. As these threats continue to evolve, particularly around cybersecurity, we may be required to expend significant resources to enhance our control environment, processes, practices and other protective measures. Despite these efforts, such events could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.", "PERMNO": 91153, "SIC": 2810, "TIC": "TROX"}
