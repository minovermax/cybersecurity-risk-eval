{"cik": "854800", "company": "MICT, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-04-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nInvesting in our securities is highly speculative and involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following factors and other information in this Annual Report and our other SEC filings before making a decision to invest in our securities. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of may become important factors that affect us. If any of the following events occur, our business, financial conditions and operating results may be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of our common stock and warrants may decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWhile we have executed the Acquisition Agreement relating to our acquisition by BNN, the closing of the Acquisition Agreement is subject to numerous conditions which may not be satisfied or waived.\nWhile we have executed the Acquisition Agreement, the closing of the agreement is subject to numerous closing conditions including, but not limited to, the approval of our stockholders. While the parties believe the conditions to the Acquisition Agreement will be satisfied or waived, there is no guarantee that we will be successful in closing the transaction. If the conditions are not satisfied or waived, the closing of the Acquisition Agreement may not occur, or may be delayed. Such delays may cause us to lose some or all of the intended benefits of the transaction and may adversely affect our business, financial condition, prospects, results of operations and reputation.\nAs a result of Micronet\u2019s public offering in Israel in February 2019, the Company no longer holds a majority of Micronet\u2019s outstanding common equity.\nAs a result of the consummation of Micronet\u2019s public offering in Israel in February 2019, the Company\u2019s ownership interest was reduced to 33.88% of the issued and outstanding shares of Micronet, while the Company\u2019s voting interest in Micronet is 39.53% as a result of an irrevocable proxy in our benefit from Mr. David Lucatz, the Company\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer. As a result of the February 2019 offering in Israel, the Company no longer owns a majority stake nor does it have majority voting interest in Micronet. Therefore, the Company may no longer effectively control Micronet\u2019s business or have significant input in its operations. In addition, since the Company no longer owns a majority stake in Micronet, Micronet may not be considered a subsidiary of the Company and Micronet\u2019s financial statements may not be consolidated with the Company\u2019s financial statements. In addition, as a result of the Company no longer filing Micronet\u2019s financial statements on a consolidated basis, the Company may not be able to meet Nasdaq\u2019s continued listing requirements.\nIf Micronet is unable to develop new products and maintain a qualified workforce Micronet may not be able to meet the needs of its customers in the future\nVirtually all of the products that Micronet produces and sells are highly engineered and require sophisticated manufacturing and system-integration techniques and capabilities. The markets and industry in which Micronet operates are characterized by rapidly changing technologies. The products, systems and solutions needs of Micronet\u2019s customers change and evolve regularly. Accordingly, Micronet\u2019s future performance depends on Micronet\u2019s ability to develop and manufacture competitive products and solutions, and bring those products to market quickly at cost-effective prices. In addition, because of the highly specialized nature of Micronet\u2019s business, Micronet must be able to hire and retain the skilled and qualified personnel necessary to perform the services required by its customers. If Micronet is unable to develop new products that meet customers\u2019 changing needs or successfully attract and retain qualified personnel, Micronet\u2019s future revenues and earnings may be adversely affected.\nWe are dependent on the services of our executive officers, whose potential conflicts of interest may not permit us to effectively execute our business strategy.\nWe currently depend on the continued services and performance of David Lucatz, our Chairman and also Micronet\u2019s Chairman and President. Mr. Lucatz also serves as the President, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of D.L. Capital Ltd., or DLC, the primary asset of which is its ownership of shares of our common stock. We have a management and consulting services agreement with DLC. Our business and results of operations may suffer if Mr. Lucatz, other executive officers or directors, are unable to devote the attention necessary to our overall business strategy and operations.\nDeveloping new technologies entails significant risks and uncertainties that may cause Micronet to incur significant costs and could have a material adverse effect on Micronet\u2019s operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows.\nA significant portion of Micronet\u2019s business relates to developing sophisticated products and applications. New technologies may be untested or unproven. In addition, Micronet may incur significant liabilities that are unique to its products and services. While Micronet maintains insurance for some business risks, it is not practicable to obtain coverage to protect against all operational risks and liabilities. In addition, Micronet may seek limitation of potential liability related to the sale and use of its products and systems. Micronet may elect to provide products or services even in instances where it is unable to obtain such indemnification or qualification. Accordingly, Micronet may be forced to bear substantial costs resulting from risks and uncertainties of its products and products under development, which could have a material adverse effect on its operating results, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nIf Micronet is unable to effectively protect our proprietary technology, our business and competitive position may be harmed.\nMicronet\u2019s success and ability to compete are dependent on its proprietary technology. The steps Micronet has taken to protect its proprietary rights may not be adequate and Micronet may not be able to prevent others from using its proprietary technology. The methodologies and proprietary technology that constitute the basis of Micronet\u2019s solutions and products are not protected by patents. Existing trade secret, copyright and trademark laws and non-disclosure agreements to which Micronet is a party offer only limited protection. Therefore, others, including our competitors, may develop and market similar solutions and products, copy or reverse engineer elements of Micronet\u2019s production lines, or engage in the unauthorized use of Micronet\u2019s intellectual property. Any misappropriation of Micronet\u2019s proprietary technology or the development of competitive technology may have a significant adverse effect on Micronet\u2019s ability to compete and may harm our business and financial position.\nMicronet may incur substantial costs as a result of litigation or other proceedings relating to intellectual property rights.\nThird parties may challenge the validity of Micronet\u2019s intellectual property rights or bring claims regarding Micronet\u2019s infringement of a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights. This may result in costly litigation or other time-consuming and expensive judicial or administrative proceedings, which could deprive us of valuable rights, cause us to incur substantial expenses and cause a diversion for technical and management personnel. An adverse determination may subject Micronet to significant liabilities or require it to seek licenses that may not be available from third parties on commercially favorable terms, if at all. Further, if such claims are proven valid, through litigation or otherwise, Micronet may be required to pay substantial financial damages or be required to discontinue or significantly delay the development, marketing, sale or licensing of the affected products and intellectual property rights.\nOur business may be negatively impacted if Micronet is unable to perform under its contracts.\nWhen agreeing to contractual terms, Micronet\u2019s management makes assumptions and projections about future conditions or events. These projections assess:\n\u25cf the productivity and availability of labor;\n\u25cf the complexity of the work to be performed;\n\u25cf the cost and availability of materials;\n\u25cf the impact of delayed performance; and\n\u25cf the timing of product deliveries.\nIf there is a significant change in one or more of these circumstances or estimates, or if Micronet faces unexpected contract costs, the profitability of one or more of these contracts may be adversely affected and could affect, among other things, our earnings and margins, due to the fact that Micronet\u2019s contracts are often made on a fixed-price basis.\nMicronet\u2019s earnings and margins could be negatively affected by deficient subcontractor performance or unavailable raw materials or components.\nMicronet relies on other companies to provide raw materials, major components and subsystems for its products. Subcontractors perform some of the services that Micronet provides to its customers. Micronet depend on these subcontractors and vendors to meet its contractual obligations in full compliance with customer requirements. Occasionally, Micronet rely on only one or two sources of supply that, if disrupted, could have an adverse effect on its ability to meet its commitments to customers. Micronet\u2019s ability to perform its obligations as a prime contractor may be adversely affected if one or more of these suppliers is unable to provide the agreed-upon supplies or perform the agreed-upon services in a timely and cost-effective manner. Further, deficiencies in the performance of Micronet\u2019s subcontractors and vendors could result in a customer terminating a contract for default. A termination for default could expose us and Micronet to liability and adversely affect our financial performance and Micronet\u2019s ability to win new contracts.\nMicronet depend on major customers for a significant portion of its revenues and its future revenues and earnings could be negatively impacted by the loss or reduction of the demand for its products or services by such customers.\nA significant portion of Micronet\u2019s annual revenues derived from a few leading customers. As of December 31, 2018, Micronet had two customers that combined account for approximately 55% of its revenues. Most of Micronet\u2019s major customers do not have any obligation to purchase additional products or services from the company. Therefore, we cannot provide any assurance that any of Micronet\u2019s leading customers will continue to purchase solutions, products or services at levels comparable to previous years.\nMicronet operates in a highly competitive and fragmented market and may not be able to maintain its competitive position in the future.\nA number of larger competitors have recently entered the MRM market in which Micronet operates. These large competitors have far greater development and capital resources that exceed those available to Micronet. Further, there are competitors of Micronet that offer solutions, products and services similar to those offered by Micronet. If they continue, these trends could undermine Micronet\u2019s competitive strength and position and adversely affect its earnings and financial condition.\nMicronet is subject to regulations in the United States and Europe, which if failed to be met, could negatively impact Micronet\u2019s and our business and reputation.\nMicronet\u2019s business is subject to certain international standards such as U.S. Federal Communications Commission, or FCC, Part 15B, FCC ID, CE and Restriction of Hazardous Substances, or RoHS, which define compatibility of interface and telecommunications standards to those implemented in the United States by the FCC and in Europe by the European Commission, respectively. Micronet\u2019s solutions and products also need to comply with the E-Mark European standard, which is the standard that defines the compatibility of interface and telecommunications to all appliances installed in and around an automobile. We and Micronet are exposed to risks from regulators, arising from Micronet\u2019s failure to comply with the aforementioned international standards, which define interface and communication standards, compliance with the standards of the European Common Market, European Conformity, or the CE, and the requirements of the U.S. Communications Regulatory Commission, the FCC, inclusive of the ELD mandate. If Micronet does not adhere to these international standards, we and Micronet may be limited in marketing Micronet\u2019s products in such markets, and face fines and/or risks to both our and Micronet\u2019s reputation, and which may also adversely effect our and Micronet\u2019s future revenues and earnings.\nMicronet may cease to be eligible for, or receive reduced, tax benefits under Israeli law, which could negatively impact our profits in the future.\nMicronet currently receives certain tax benefits under the Israeli Law for Encouragement of Capital Investments of 1959, as a result of the designation of its production facility as an \u201cApproved Enterprise.\u201d To maintain its eligibility for these tax benefits, Micronet must continue to meet several conditions including, among others, generating more than 25% of its gross revenues outside the State of Israel and continuing to qualify as an \u201cIndustrial Company\u201d under Israeli tax law. An Industrial Company, according to the applicable Israeli law (Law for the Encouragement of Industry (Taxes), 1969), is a company that resides in Israel (either incorporated in Israel or managed and controlled from Israel) that, during the relevant tax year, derives at least 90% of its income from an Industrial Factory. An Industrial Factory means a factory that is owned by an Industrial Company and where its manufacturing operations constitute a vast majority of the factory\u2019s total operations/business. The tax benefits of qualifying as an Industrial Company include a reduction of the corporate tax from 23% for \u201cRegular Entities\u201d and 16% or 7.5% for \u201cPreferred Enterprises\u201d (depending on the location of industry) in 2018. In addition, in recent years the Israeli government has reduced the benefits available under this program and has indicated that it may further reduce or eliminate benefits in the future. There is no assurance that Micronet will continue to qualify for these tax benefits or that such tax benefits will continue to be available at their current level, or at all. The termination or reduction of these tax benefits would increase the amount of tax payable by Micronet and, accordingly, reduce our net profit after tax and negatively impact our profits.\nBecause the majority of our officers and directors are located in non-U.S. jurisdictions, you may have no effective recourse against our management for misconduct.\nCurrently, a majority of our directors and officers are or will be nationals and/or residents of countries other than the United States, and all or a substantial portion of their assets are located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to enforce within the United States any judgments obtained against such officers or directors, including judgments predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any U.S. state. Additionally, it may be difficult to enforce civil liabilities under U.S. securities law in original actions instituted in Israel. Israeli courts may refuse to hear a claim based on a violation of U.S. securities laws because Israel is not the most appropriate forum to bring such a claim. In addition, even if an Israeli court agrees to hear a claim, it may determine that Israeli law and not U.S. law is applicable to hear the claim. If U.S. law is found to be applicable, the content of applicable U.S. law must be proved as a fact, which can be a time-consuming and costly process. Certain matters of procedure will also be governed by Israeli law.\nOur financial results may be negatively affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations.\nOur revenues are mainly denominated in U.S. currency and our costs are mainly denominated in Israeli currency. Where possible, we match sales and purchases in these and other currencies to achieve a natural hedge. Currently, Micronet does not have a policy with respect to the use of derivative instruments for hedging purposes, except that Micronet will consider engaging in such hedging activities on a case by case basis. To the extent we are unable to fully match our sales and purchases in different currencies, our business will be exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.\nWe may become a target for cybersecurity disruptions which may impact our business operations.\nWe may be subject to attempted cybersecurity disruptions from a variety of threat actors. If systems for protecting against cybersecurity disruptions prove to be insufficient, the Company, customers, employees or third parties could be adversely affected. Such cybersecurity disruptions could cause physical harm to people or the environment; damage or destroy assets; compromise business systems; result in proprietary information being altered, lost or stolen; result in employee, customer or third party information being compromised; or otherwise disrupt business operations. We could incur significant costs to remedy the effects of such a cybersecurity disruption, as well as in connection with resulting regulatory actions and litigation, and such disruption may harm our relationships with our customers and impact our business reputation.\nCost fluctuations in the global hardware and communications market and reducing production costs may have a negative impact on our business and operations.\nMicronet\u2019s operations are affected by global hardware prices and communication costs, which are a combined component of the technological solution offered by Micronet to its customers or end users. Also, in order to continue to compete effectively in the target markets, Micronet must continue to streamline its production costs and reduce them in order to enable a competitive price for its products. Micronet must compete among other manufacturers of components and / or products from East Asia including China and India. Micronet's ability to streamline the production process depends, among other things, on its ability to integrate production processes in these areas, as well as to continue to locate target markets and target customers who are interested in purchasing high-end products that are less sensitive to cost.\nDuration of development and introduction of new products to the market and costs.\nDue to the long period required in order to develop new technologies and products and the effective ability to introduce such technologies and products to the market, Micronet is exposed to a risk that at such time the development and market introduction process is finalized, alternative products or similar products, solutions or services shall be available in the market distributed and sold by our competitors, gaining market share and acquiring potential customers, all may negatively impact Micronet\u2019s business results and profits.\nEconomic changes in Micronet\u2019s target markets may adversely impact its business.\nDue to the fact that Micronet\u2019s target markets are mainly located in North America and Europe, the lack of economic stability in such markets, such as slowdown or changes to the demands for products or services offered by Micronet, may adversely affect its operations and results\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Securities\nProvisions in our corporate charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation, as amended, and amended and restated bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control of us that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your common stock. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for our securities, thereby depressing the market price of our securities. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors. Because our board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions could in turn affect any attempt by our stockholders to replace current members of our management team.\nMoreover, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, or the DGCL, which prohibits a person who owns in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner. We have not opted out of the restrictions under Section 203.\nOur stockholders may experience significant dilution as a result of any additional financing using our equity securities and/or debt securities.\nTo the extent that we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, such as through our Standby Equity Distribution Agreement as described below, or convertible debt securities, our stockholders may experience significant dilution. Sales of additional equity and/or convertible debt securities at prices below certain levels will trigger anti-dilution provisions with respect to certain securities we have previously sold. If additional funds are raised through a credit facility, or the issuance of debt securities or preferred stock, lenders under the credit facility or holders of these debt securities or preferred stock would likely have rights that are senior to the rights of holders of our common stock, and any credit facility or additional securities could contain covenants that would restrict our operations.\nIf the price of our common stock is volatile, purchasers of our common stock could incur substantial losses.\nThe price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be volatile. The market price of our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including but not limited to the following:\n\u25cf announcements of developments related to our or Micronet\u2019s business;\n\u25cf quarterly fluctuations in our actual or anticipated operating results;\n\u25cf announcements of technological innovations by Micronet;\n\u25cf new products or product enhancements introduced by Micronet or by its competitors;\n\u25cf developments in patents and other intellectual property rights and litigation;\n\u25cf developments in Micronet\u2019s relationships with our third party manufacturers and/or strategic partners;\n\u25cf developments in Micronet\u2019s relationships with our customers and/or suppliers;\n\u25cf regulatory or legal developments in the United States, Israel and other countries;\n\u25cf general conditions in the global economy; and\n\u25cf the other factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nFor these reasons and others, you should consider an investment in our common stock as risky and invest only if you can withstand a significant loss and wide fluctuations in the value of your investment.\nA sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or securities convertible into or exercisable for our common stock may cause the price of our common stock to decline and may impair our ability to raise capital in the future.\nOur common stock is traded on Nasdaq and, despite certain increases of trading volume from time to time, there have been periods when it could be considered \u201cthinly-traded,\u201d meaning that the number of persons interested in purchasing our common stock at or near bid prices at any given time may have been relatively small or non-existent. Finance transactions resulting in a large amount of newly-issued securities may be readily tradable, or other events that cause current stockholders to sell shares, could place downward pressure on the trading price of our common stock. In addition, the lack of a robust resale market may require a stockholder who desires to sell a large number of shares of common stock to sell those shares in increments over time to mitigate any adverse impact of the sales on the market price of our stock. If our stockholders sell, or the market perceives that our stockholders intend to sell for various reasons, including the ending of restriction on resale, substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, including shares issued upon the exercise of outstanding options or warrants, the market price of our common stock could fall. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem reasonable or appropriate. Moreover, we may become involved in securities class action litigation that could divert management\u2019s attention and harm our business.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports or publish unfavorable research about our business, the price of our common stock could decline.\nWe do not currently have any significant research coverage by securities and industry analysts and we may never obtain such research coverage. If securities or industry analysts do not commence or maintain coverage of us, the trading price for our common stock might be negatively affected. In the event we obtain securities or industry analyst coverage, if one or more of the analysts who covers us or will cover us downgrades our securities, the price of our common stock would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases to cover us or fails to publish regular reports on us, interest in the purchase of our common stock could decrease, which could cause the price of our common stock and trading volume to decline.\nWe did not declare or pay cash dividends in either 2018 or 2017 and do not expect to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe have no dividends policy and will consider distributing dividends on a year by year basis. The payment of dividends, if any, in the future, rests within the discretion of our board of directors and will depend, among other things, upon our earnings, our capital requirements and our financial condition, as well as other relevant factors. There are no restrictions in our certificate of incorporation, as amended, or amended and restated bylaws that restrict us from declaring dividends. There are no assurances that we will pay dividends in the future.\nRisks Related to Israeli Law and Our Operations in Israel\nPotential political, economic and military instability in Israel could adversely affect our operations.\nOur principal offices and one of Micronet\u2019s operating facilities are located in Israel. Accordingly, political, economic and military conditions in Israel directly affect our and Micronet\u2019s operations. Since the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, a number of armed conflicts have taken place between Israel and its Arab neighbors. A state of hostility, varying in degree and intensity, has led to security and economic problems for Israel. Since October 2000, there has been an increase in hostilities between Israel and the Palestinian Arabs, which has adversely affected the peace process and has negatively influenced Israel\u2019s relationship with its Arab citizens and several Arab countries, including the Israel-Gaza conflict. Such ongoing hostilities may hinder Israel\u2019s international trade relations and may limit the geographic markets where Micronet can sell its products and solutions. Hostilities involving or threatening Israel, or the interruption or curtailment of trade between Israel and its present trading partners, could materially and adversely affect Micronet\u2019s or our operations.\nIn addition, Israel-based companies and companies doing business with Israel have been the subject of an economic boycott by members of the Arab League and certain other predominantly Muslim countries since Israel\u2019s establishment. Although Israel has entered into various agreements with certain Arab countries and the Palestinian Authority, and various declarations have been signed in connection with efforts to resolve some of the economic and political problems in the Middle East, we cannot predict whether or in what manner these problems will be resolved. Wars and acts of terrorism have resulted in significant damage to the Israeli economy, including reducing the level of foreign and local investment.\nFurthermore, certain of our officers and employees may be obligated to perform annual reserve duty in the Israel Defense Forces and are subject to being called up for active military duty at any time. All Israeli male citizens who have served in the army are subject to an obligation to perform reserve duty until they are between 40 and 49 years old, depending upon the nature of their military service.\nUnder current Israeli law, the Company and Micronet may not be able to enforce our respective Israeli employees\u2019 covenants not to compete and therefore may be unable to prevent our competitors from benefiting from the expertise of some of our respective former employees.\nPreviously, the Company and Micronet entered, and the Company and Micronet may plan in the future to enter into, non-competition agreements with our key employees, in most cases within the framework of their employment agreements. These agreements prohibit our key employees, if they cease working for us, from competing directly with us or working for our competitors for a limited period. Under applicable Israeli law, the Company and Micronet may be unable to enforce these agreements or any part thereof against our Israeli employees. If the Company and Micronet cannot enforce its non- competition agreements against their respective Israeli employees, then the Company and Micronet may be unable to prevent their competitors from benefiting from the expertise of these former employees, which could impair the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and ability to capitalize on Micronet\u2019s proprietary information.\nMicronet may become subject to claims for remuneration or royalties for assigned service invention rights by our employees, which could result in litigation and harm our business.\nA significant portion of the intellectual property covered by Micronet\u2019s products has been developed by Micronet\u2019s employees in the course of their employment for Micronet. Under the Israeli Patent Law, 5727-1967, or the Patent Law, and recent decisions by the Israeli Supreme Court and the Israeli Compensation and Royalties Committee, a body constituted under the Patent Law, Israeli employees may be entitled to remuneration for intellectual property that they develop for us unless they explicitly waive any such rights. To the extent that Micronet is unable to enter into agreements with its future employees pursuant to which they agree that any inventions created in the scope of their employment or engagement are owned exclusively by Micronet (as it has done in the past), Micronet may face claims demanding remuneration. As a consequence of such claims, Micronet could be required to pay additional remuneration or royalties to its current and former employees, or be forced to litigate such claims, which could negatively affect its own and our business.\nThe Israeli identity of certain of Micronet\u2019s products may adversely affect its ability to sell its products and/or solutions.\nThe sale of Micronet\u2019s products is affected in certain countries and may be affected in other countries by the international status of the State of Israel. Israeli identity may be used in some cases for promoting sales (in light of the recognition of the technological advantages that exist in Israel) whereas in other cases and is likely to continue to be a disadvantage and result in the cancellation of transactions.\nProvisions of Israeli law and Micronet\u2019s amended and restated articles of association may delay, prevent or otherwise impede a merger with, or an acquisition of, our company, which could prevent a change of control, even when the terms of such a transaction are favorable to Micronet and its shareholders.\nAs a company incorporated under the law of the State of Israel, Micronet is subject to Israeli corporate law. Israeli corporate law regulates mergers, requires tender offers for acquisitions of shares above specified thresholds, requires special approvals for transactions involving directors, officers or significant shareholders and regulates other matters that may be relevant to such types of transactions. For example, a merger may not be consummated unless at least 50 days have passed from the date on which a merger proposal is filed by each merging company with the Israel Registrar of Companies and at least 30 days have passed from the date on which the shareholders of both merging companies have approved the merger. In addition, a majority of each class of securities of the target company must approve a merger. Moreover, a tender offer for all of a company\u2019s issued and outstanding shares can only be completed if the acquirer receives positive responses from the holders of at least 95% of the issued share capital. Completion of the tender offer also requires approval of and a majority of the offerees that do not have a personal interest in the tender offer approves the tender offer, unless, following consummation of the tender offer, the acquirer would hold at least 98% of the company\u2019s outstanding shares. Furthermore, the shareholders, including those who indicated their acceptance of the tender offer, may, at any time within six months following the completion of the tender offer, claim that the consideration for the acquisition of the shares does not reflect their fair market value, and petition an Israeli court to alter the consideration for the acquisition, unless accordingly, other than those who indicated their acceptance of the tender offer in case the acquirer stipulated in its tender offer that a shareholder that accepts the offer may not seek such appraisal rights., and the acquirer or the company published all required information with respect to the tender offer prior to the tender offer\u2019s response date.\nFurthermore, Israeli tax considerations may make potential transactions unappealing to Micronet or to its shareholders whose country of residence does not have a tax treaty with Israel exempting such shareholders from Israeli tax.\nMicronet\u2019s amended and restated articles of association also contain provisions that could delay or prevent changes in control or changes in its management without the consent of its board of directors. These provisions include the following:\n\u25cf no cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority shareholders to elect director candidates; and\n\u25cf the right of Micronet\u2019s board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which may prevent shareholders from being able to fill vacancies on its board of directors.\nMicronet\u2019s operations may be disrupted as a result of the obligation of management or key personnel to perform military service.\nMicronet\u2019s employees and consultants in Israel, including members of its senior management, may be obligated to perform one month, and in some cases longer periods, of military reserve duty until they reach the age of 40 (or older, for citizens who hold certain positions in the Israeli armed forces reserves) and, in the event of a military conflict or emergency circumstances, may be called to immediate and unlimited active duty. In the event of severe unrest or other conflict, individuals could be required to serve in the military for extended periods of time. In response to increases in terrorist activity, there have been periods of significant call-ups of military reservists. It is possible that there will be similar large-scale military reserve duty call-ups in the future. Micronet\u2019s operations could be disrupted by the absence of a significant number of our officers, directors, employees and consultants related to military service. Such disruption could materially adversely affect Micronet\u2019s business and operations.", "PERMNO": 13879, "SIC": 3812, "TIC": "MICT"}
