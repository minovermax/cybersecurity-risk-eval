You should carefully consider the following risks, together with the information included in or incorporated by reference in this report, before deciding whether an investment in our common stock is suitable for you. If any of these risks actually occurs, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. In such an event, the trading prices of our common stock could decline and you might lose all or part of your investment. The following is a list of our risk factors.\nECONOMIC/POLITICAL RISKS\nChanges in legal requirements and governmental policies concerning zoning, land use, environmental and other areas of the law may result in additional liabilities, a reduction in operating hours and additional capital expenditures - Our operations are affected by numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations related to zoning, land use and environmental matters. Despite our compliance efforts, we have an inherent risk of liability in the operation of our business. These potential liabilities could have an adverse impact on our operations and profitability. In addition, our operations are subject to environmental, zoning and land use requirements and require numerous governmental approvals and permits, which often require us to make significant capital and operating expenditures to comply with the applicable requirements. Stricter laws and regulations, or more stringent interpretations of existing laws or regulations, may impose new liabilities on us, reduce operating hours, require additional investment by us in pollution control equipment, or impede our opening new or expanding existing plants or facilities.\nOur business is dependent on the timing and amount of federal, state and local funding for infrastructure - Our products are used in a variety of public infrastructure projects that are funded and financed by federal, state and local governments. Congress recently passed a five-year, fully funded bill to invest in roads, bridges and public transportation. The resulting certainty and the modestly increased investment are positive developments and mitigate risk in this area. In addition, eleven Vulcan-served states successfully increased transportation funding between 2013 and the present; similar efforts are expected in at least three other states in our service area in 2016. However, given varying state and local budgetary situations and the associated pressure on infrastructure spending, we cannot be entirely assured of the existence, amount and timing of appropriations for future public infrastructure projects.\nClimate change and climate change legislation or regulations may adversely impact our business - A number of governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating legislative and regulatory change in response to the potential impacts of climate change. Such legislation or regulation, if enacted, potentially could include provisions for a \"cap and trade\" system of allowances and credits or a carbon tax, among other provisions.\nOther potential impacts of climate change include physical impacts, such as disruption in production and product distribution due to impacts from major storm events, shifts in regional weather patterns and intensities, and potential impacts from sea level changes. There is also a potential for climate change legislation and regulation to adversely impact the cost of purchased energy and electricity.\nThe impacts of climate change on our operations and the company overall are highly uncertain and difficult to estimate. However, climate change legislation and regulation concerning greenhouse gases could have a material adverse effect on our future financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nGROWTH AND COMPETITIVE RISKS\nWithin our local markets, we operate in a highly competitive industry which may negatively impact prices, volumes and costs - The construction aggregates industry is highly fragmented with a large number of independent local producers in a number of our markets. Additionally, in most markets, we also compete against large private and public companies, some of which are significantly vertically integrated. Therefore, there is intense competition in a number of markets in which we operate. This significant competition could lead to lower prices and lower sales volumes in some markets, negatively affecting our earnings and cash flows.\nThe expanded use of aggregates substitutes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations - Recycled concrete and asphalt mix are increasingly being used in a number of our markets, particularly urban markets, as a substitute for aggregates. The use of recycled concrete and asphalt mix could cause a significant reduction in the demand for aggregates.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nPart I\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nOur long-term success depends upon securing and permitting aggregates reserves in strategically located areas. If we are unable to secure and permit such reserves it could negatively affect our future earnings - Construction aggregates are bulky and heavy and, therefore, difficult to transport efficiently. Because of the nature of the products, the freight costs can quickly surpass the production costs. Therefore, except for geographic regions that do not possess commercially viable deposits of aggregates and are served by rail, barge or ship, the markets for our products tend to be localized around our quarry sites and are served by truck. New quarry sites often take years to develop; therefore, our strategic planning and new site development must stay ahead of actual growth. Additionally, in a number of urban and suburban areas in which we operate, it is increasingly difficult to permit new sites or expand existing sites due to community resistance. Therefore, our future success is dependent, in part, on our ability to accurately forecast future areas of high growth in order to locate optimal facility sites and on our ability to secure operating and environmental permits to operate at those sites.\nOur future growth depends in part on acquiring other businesses in our industry and successfully integrating them with our existing operations. If we are unable to integrate acquisitions successfully, it could lead to higher costs and could negatively affect our earnings - The expansion of our business is dependent in part on the acquisition of existing businesses that own or control aggregates reserves. Disruptions in the availability of financing could make it more difficult to capitalize on potential acquisitions. Additionally, with regard to the acquisitions we are able to complete, our future results will depend in part on our ability to successfully integrate these businesses with our existing operations.\nFINANCIAL/ACCOUNTING RISKS\nOur industry is capital intensive, resulting in significant fixed and semi-fixed costs. Therefore, our earnings are highly sensitive to changes in volume - Due to the high levels of fixed capital required for extracting and producing construction aggregates, our profits and profit margins are negatively affected by significant decreases in volume.\nSignificant downturn in the construction industry may result in an impairment of our goodwill - We test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or circumstances change in a manner that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. While we have not identified any events or changes in circumstances since our annual impairment test on November 1, 2015 that indicate the fair value of any of our reporting units is below its carrying value, a significant downturn in the construction industry may have a material effect on the fair value of our reporting units. A significant decrease in the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units could result in the recognition of a material, noncash write-down of goodwill.\nWe have substantial debt and our credit ratings are non-investment grade - Our ability to make scheduled interest and principal payments depends on our financial performance. Financial performance is, in turn, subject to general economic and business conditions, many of which are outside of our control. Our ability to refinance maturing debt depends on our financial performance and the state of the non-investment grade debt market, which is more volatile than the investment-grade debt market.\nOur debt instruments contain customary covenants, including: affirmative (e.g., maintain insurance), negative (e.g., to limit our ability to incur secured debt), informational (e.g., provide financial statements) and financial (e.g., minimum EBITDA to interest ratio) covenants. If we fail to comply with any of these covenants, the related debt could become due prior to its stated maturity, and our ability to obtain alternative or additional financing could be impaired.\nWe use estimates in accounting for a number of significant items. Changes in our estimates could adversely affect our future financial results - As discussed more fully in \"Critical Accounting Policies\" under Item 7 \"Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\" we use significant judgment in accounting for:\n\u00a7\ngoodwill and goodwill impairment\n\u00a7\nimpairment of long-lived assets excluding goodwill\n\u00a7\nreclamation costs\n\u00a7\npension and other postretirement benefits\n\u00a7\nenvironmental compliance\n\u00a7\nclaims and litigation including self-insurance\n\u00a7\nincome taxes\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nPart I\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe believe we have sufficient experience and reasonable procedures to enable us to make appropriate assumptions and formulate reasonable estimates; however, these assumptions and estimates could change significantly in the future and could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nPERSONNEL RISKS\nOur future success greatly depends upon attracting and retaining qualified personnel, particularly in sales and operations - A significant factor in our future profitability is our ability to attract, develop and retain qualified personnel. Our success in attracting qualified personnel, particularly in the areas of sales and operations, is affected by changing demographics of the available pool of workers with the training and skills necessary to fill the available positions, the impact on the labor supply due to general economic conditions, and our ability to offer competitive compensation and benefit packages.\nWe are subject to various risks arising from our international business operations and relationships, which could adversely affect our business - We have international operations and are subject to both the risks of conducting international business and the requirements of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (the FCPA). Failure to comply with the FCPA may result in legal claims against us. In addition, we face other risks associated with international operations and relationships, which may include restrictive trade policies, imposition of duties, taxes or government royalties impressed by foreign governments.\nOTHER RISKS\nWe are dependent on information technology and our systems and infrastructure face certain risks, including cybersecurity risks and data leakage risks - Any significant breakdown, invasion, destruction or interruption of our systems by employees, others with authorized access to our systems or unauthorized persons could negatively impact operations. There is also a risk that we could experience a business interruption, theft of information, or reputational damage as a result of a cyber-attack, such as an infiltration of a data center, or data leakage of confidential information either internally or at our third-party providers. While we have invested in the protection of our data and informational technology to reduce these risks and periodically test the security of our information systems network, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in our systems that could adversely affect or business. Management is not aware of a cybersecurity incident that has had a material impact on our operations.\nWeather can materially affect our operating results - Almost all of our products are consumed outdoors in the public or private construction industry, and our production and distribution facilities are located outdoors. Inclement weather affects both our ability to produce and distribute our products and affects our customers\u2019 short-term demand because their work also can be hampered by weather.\nOur products are transported by truck, rail, barge or ship, often by third-party providers. Significant delays or increased costs affecting these transportation methods could materially affect our operations and earnings - Our products are distributed either by truck to local markets or by rail, barge or oceangoing vessel to remote markets. The costs of transporting our products could be negatively affected by factors outside of our control, including rail service interruptions or rate increases, tariffs, rising fuel costs and capacity constraints. Additionally, inclement weather, including hurricanes, tornadoes and other weather events, can negatively impact our distribution network.\nWe use large amounts of electricity, diesel fuel, liquid asphalt and other petroleum-based resources that are subject to potential supply constraints and significant price fluctuation, which could affect our operating results and profitability - In our production and distribution processes, we consume significant amounts of electricity, diesel fuel, liquid asphalt and other petroleum-based resources. The availability and pricing of these resources are subject to market forces that are beyond our control. Our suppliers contract separately for the purchase of such resources and our sources of supply could be interrupted should our suppliers not be able to obtain these materials due to higher demand or other factors that interrupt their availability. Variability in the supply and prices of these resources could materially affect our operating results from period to period and rising costs could erode our profitability.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nPart I\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe are involved in a number of legal proceedings. We cannot predict the outcome of litigation and other contingencies with certainty - We are involved in several complex litigation proceedings, some arising from our previous ownership and operation of our Chemicals and Metals businesses. Although we divested our Chemicals business in June 2005, we retained certain liabilities related to the business. As required by generally accepted accounting principles, we establish reserves when a loss is determined to be probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Our assessment of probability and loss estimates are based on the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time. Subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our assessment and estimates of a loss contingency, and could result in an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. For a description of our current significant legal proceedings see Note 12 \"Commitments and Contingencies\" in Item 8 \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\nWe are involved in certain environmental matters. We cannot predict the outcome of these contingencies with certainty - We are involved in environmental investigations and cleanups at sites where we operate or have operated in the past or sent materials for recycling or disposal. As required by generally accepted accounting principles, we establish reserves when a loss is determined to be probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Our assessment of probability and loss estimates are based on the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time. Subsequent developments related to these matters may affect our assessment and estimates of loss contingency, and could result in an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. For a description of our current significant environmental matters see Note 12 \u201cCommitments and Contingencies\" in Item 8 \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"", "PERMNO": 15202, "SIC": 1400, "TIC": "VMC"}
