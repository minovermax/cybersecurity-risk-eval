{"cik": "1348649", "company": "CoLucid Pharmaceuticals, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-24", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nIn addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following factors should be considered in evaluating our business. Our operating results depend upon many factors and are subject to various risks and uncertainties. The most significant risks and uncertainties known to us which may cause the operating results to vary from anticipated results or which may negatively affect our operating results and profitability are as follows.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Condition\nWe are highly dependent on the success of lasmiditan, which is still in clinical development, and we may not obtain FDA approval for lasmiditan or successfully commercialize lasmiditan or any other product candidates.\nWe currently do not have any product candidates that have gained marketing approval for sale in the United States or any other country, and we cannot guarantee that we will ever have marketable products. To date, we have invested substantially all of our efforts and financial resources in the research and development and commercial planning for our current product candidates. In particular, we have completed a Phase 2b clinical trial for lasmiditan and a Phase 2 clinical trial for IV lasmiditan. Our near-term prospects, including our ability to finance our company and generate revenue, as well as our future growth, will depend heavily on the successful development, marketing approval and commercialization of our product candidates. The clinical and commercial success of product candidates will depend on a number of factors, including the following:\n\u00b7\ninitiating and obtaining favorable results from our Phase 3 clinical program for our product candidates, which may be slower or cost more than we currently anticipate;\n\u00b7\neven if our trials are successful, there can be no assurance that the FDA will agree that we have satisfactorily demonstrated safety or efficacy or that the FDA will not raise new issues regarding the design of our clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nour ability to demonstrate the safety of our product candidates to the satisfaction of the FDA and other comparable foreign regulatory authorities;\n\u00b7\nour ability to demonstrate the efficacy of our product candidates to the satisfaction of the FDA and other comparable foreign regulatory authorities, including our ability to utilize FDA-acceptable endpoint tools for measuring efficacy of lasmiditan in our clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nwhether we are required by the FDA or comparable foreign regulators to conduct additional clinical trials to support the approval of our product candidates;\n\u00b7\nthe acceptance by the FDA, or comparable foreign regulators, of our proposed parameters for regulatory approval, including our proposed indication, endpoints and endpoint measurement tools relating to our product candidates;\n\u00b7\nthe incidence, duration and severity of adverse effects;\n\u00b7\nthe timely receipt of necessary marketing approvals from the FDA and comparable foreign regulators around the world;\n\u00b7\nachieving and maintaining compliance with all regulatory requirements applicable to our product candidates;\n\u00b7\nthe availability, perceived advantages, relative cost, relative safety and relative efficacy of alternative and competing treatments;\n\u00b7\nthe effectiveness of our and our potential collaborators\u2019 marketing, sales and distribution strategy and operations in the United States and other markets around the world;\n\u00b7\nwhether we are able to secure collaborations for the development and commercialization of IV lasmiditan in the United States, if approved;\n\u00b7\nwhether we are able to secure collaborations for the development and, if approved, commercialization of lasmiditan and IV lasmiditan outside of the United States and whether such collaborators will be required to conduct additional studies for the approval of our product candidates in such markets in a timely manner;\n\u00b7\nour success in educating physicians and patients about the benefits, administration and use of lasmiditan;\n\u00b7\nthe ability of our third-party manufacturers and potential collaborators to manufacture clinical trial and commercial supplies of lasmiditan to remain in good standing with regulatory bodies, and to develop, validate and maintain commercially viable manufacturing processes that are compliant with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, regulations;\n\u00b7\nour ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates in the United States, if approved for marketing;\n\u00b7\nour potential collaborators\u2019 ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates in other markets outside of the United States;\n\u00b7\nour ability to enforce our intellectual property rights in and to lasmiditan;\n\u00b7\nour ability to avoid third-party patent interference or patent infringement claims;\n\u00b7\nacceptance of our product candidates as safe and effective by patients and the medical community; and\n\u00b7\na continued acceptable safety profile of our product candidates following approval.\nMany of these factors are beyond our control. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will ever be able to generate revenue through the sale of our product candidates. Any one of these factors or other factors discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K could affect our ability to successfully commercialize product candidates, which could impact our ability to earn sufficient revenues to transition from a developmental stage company and continue our business. If we are not successful in obtaining marketing approval of and commercializing our product candidates, or are significantly delayed in doing so, our business will be materially harmed.\nWe have a limited operating history and have incurred significant losses since our inception, and we anticipate that we will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future and may never achieve or maintain profitability. We have one lead product candidate and no commercial sales, which, together with our limited operating history, make it difficult to assess our future viability.\nWe are a Phase 3 clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company with a limited operating history. Pharmaceutical product development is a highly speculative undertaking and involves a substantial degree of risk. To date, we have focused principally on developing our lead product candidate, lasmiditan. We are not profitable and have incurred losses in each year since our inception in 2005. We have only a limited operating history upon which you can evaluate our business and prospects. In addition, we have limited experience and have not yet demonstrated an ability to successfully overcome many of the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in new and rapidly evolving fields, particularly in the specialty pharmaceutical industry. We have not generated any revenue to date. We continue to incur significant research and development and other expenses related to our ongoing operations. Our net loss for the year ended December 31, 2015 was approximately $38.5 million. As of December 31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of $87.1 million. We expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future, as we continue our development of, and seek marketing approvals for our product candidates, and if we obtain marketing approval, begin to commercialize lasmiditan and IV lasmiditan. Even if we achieve profitability in the future, we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods. Our prior losses, combined with expected future losses, have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders\u2019 equity and working capital.\nWe currently have no source of product sales revenue.\nWe have not generated any revenues from commercial sales of our product candidates. Our ability to generate product revenue depends upon our ability to successfully commercialize products, including any of our current product candidates or other product candidates that we may develop, in-license or acquire in the future. We do not anticipate generating revenue from the sale of products for the foreseeable future. Our ability to generate future product revenue from our current or future product candidates also depends on a number of additional factors, including our ability to:\n\u00b7\nsuccessfully complete research and clinical development of current and future product candidates;\n\u00b7\nestablish and maintain supply and manufacturing relationships with third parties, and ensure adequate and legally compliant manufacturing of bulk drug substances and drug products to maintain that supply;\n\u00b7\nobtain regulatory approval from relevant regulatory authorities in jurisdictions where we intend to market our product candidates;\n\u00b7\nlaunch and commercialize product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval, if any, and if launched independently, successfully establish a sales force, marketing and distribution infrastructure;\n\u00b7\nobtain coverage and adequate product reimbursement from third-party payors, including government payors;\n\u00b7\nachieve market acceptance for our products, if any;\n\u00b7\nestablish, maintain and protect our intellectual property rights; and\n\u00b7\nattract, hire and retain qualified personnel.\nIn addition, because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with clinical product development, including that our product candidates may not advance through development or achieve the endpoints of applicable clinical trials, we are unable to predict the timing or amount of any potential future product sales revenues. Our expenses also could increase beyond expectations if we decide to or are required by the FDA, or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, to perform studies or trials in addition to those that we currently anticipate. Even if we complete the development and regulatory processes described above, we anticipate incurring significant costs associated with launching and commercializing these products.\nWe will require substantial additional financing to obtain marketing approval of our product candidates and commercialize our product candidates, and a failure to obtain this necessary capital when needed on acceptable terms, or at all, could force us to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development, other operations or commercialization efforts.\nSince our inception, substantially all of our resources have been dedicated to the preclinical and clinical development of our lead product candidate, lasmiditan. As of December 31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of $87.1 million, working capital of $59.9 million and cash and cash equivalents of $28.0 million. We believe that we will continue to expend substantial resources for the foreseeable future on the completion of clinical development and regulatory preparedness of our product candidates, preparations for a commercial launch of our product candidates, if approved, and development of any other current or future product candidates we may choose to further develop. These expenditures will include costs associated with research and development, conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials, obtaining marketing approvals, and manufacturing and supply as well as marketing and selling any products approved for sale. In addition, other unanticipated costs may arise. Because the outcome of any drug development process is highly uncertain, we cannot reasonably estimate the actual amounts necessary to successfully complete the development and commercialization of our current product candidates, if approved, or future product candidates, if any.\nAlthough we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our operations through mid-2017, including to fund our two pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials of lasmiditan, our operating plan may change as a result of factors currently unknown to us, and we may need to seek additional funds sooner than planned, through public or private equity or debt financings or other sources, such as strategic collaborations. Such financing may result in dilution to stockholders, imposition of debt covenants and repayment obligations, or other restrictions that may adversely affect our business. In addition, we may seek additional capital due to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans.\nOur future capital requirements depend on many factors, including:\n\u00b7\nthe scope, progress, results and costs of researching and developing our current product candidates, future product candidates and conducting preclinical and clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nthe cost of commercialization activities if our current product candidates and future product candidates are approved for sale, including marketing, sales and distribution costs and preparedness of our corporate infrastructure;\n\u00b7\nthe cost of manufacturing our current product candidates and future product candidates, if any, that we obtain approval for and successfully commercialize;\n\u00b7\nour ability to establish and maintain strategic collaborations, licensing or other arrangements and the financial terms of such agreements;\n\u00b7\nthe number and characteristics of any additional product candidates we may develop or acquire;\n\u00b7\nany product liability or other lawsuits related to our products or commenced against us;\n\u00b7\nthe expenses needed to attract and retain skilled personnel;\n\u00b7\nthe costs associated with being a public company;\n\u00b7\nthe costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing patent claims, including litigation costs and the outcome of such litigation; and\n\u00b7\nthe timing, receipt and amount of sales of, or royalties on, any future approved products, if any.\nAdditional funds may not be available when we need them, on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. If adequate funds are not available to us on a timely basis, we may be required to:\n\u00b7\ndelay, limit, reduce or terminate preclinical studies, clinical trials or other development activities for our current product candidates or future product candidates, if any;\n\u00b7\ndelay, limit, reduce or terminate our research and development activities; or\n\u00b7\ndelay, limit, reduce or terminate our establishment of sales and marketing capabilities or other activities that may be necessary to commercialize our future product candidates.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or product candidates.\nWe may seek additional capital through a combination of public and private equity offerings, debt financings, strategic collaborations and alliances and licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a stockholder. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed payment obligations and could involve certain restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, limitations on our ability to acquire or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. If we raise additional funds through strategic collaborations and alliances and licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies or product candidate, or grant licenses on terms unfavorable to us.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs, of approximately $67.7 million and $57.3 million, respectively, which begin to expire in 2025 and 2026, respectively, unless previously utilized. We had federal research and development tax credit carryforwards at December 31, 2015 of $2.1 million, which begin to expire in 2026. Under Sections 382 and 383 of Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change NOLs and other pre-change tax attributes, such as research tax credits, to offset its future post-change income and taxes may be limited. In general, an \u201cownership change\u201d occurs if there is a cumulative change in our ownership by \u201c5% stockholders\u201d that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. In the event that it is determined that we have in the past experienced additional ownership changes, or if we experience one or more ownership changes as a result of this offering or future transactions in our stock, then we may be further limited in our ability to use our NOLs and other tax assets to reduce taxes owed on the net taxable income that we earn in the event that we attain profitability. Any such limitations on the ability to use our NOLs and other tax assets could adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results in the event that we attain profitability.\nRisks Related to the Clinical Development and Marketing Approval of Our Product Candidates\nThe marketing approval processes of the FDA and comparable foreign authorities are lengthy, time consuming and inherently unpredictable, and if we are ultimately unable to obtain marketing approval for our product candidates, our business will be substantially harmed.\nWe currently do not have any product candidates that have gained marketing approval for sale in the United States or any other country, and we cannot guarantee that we will ever have marketable products. Our business is substantially dependent on our ability to complete the development of, obtain marketing approval for and successfully commercialize our product candidates in a timely manner. We cannot commercialize our product candidates in the United States without first obtaining marketing approval to market each product candidate from the FDA. Similarly, we cannot commercialize our product candidates outside of the United States without obtaining regulatory approval from comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Our product candidates could fail to receive marketing approval for many reasons, including the following:\n\u00b7\nthe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with the design or implementation of our clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nwe may be unable to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities that a product candidate is safe and effective for its proposed indication;\n\u00b7\nthe results of clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical significance required by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities for approval;\n\u00b7\nwe may be unable to demonstrate that a product candidate\u2019s clinical and other benefits outweigh its safety risks;\n\u00b7\nthe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with our interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nthe data collected from clinical trials of our product candidates may not be sufficient to support the submission of an NDA or other submission or to obtain marketing approval in the United States or elsewhere;\n\u00b7\nthe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may fail to find adequate the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with which we contract for clinical and commercial supplies; and\n\u00b7\nthe approval policies or regulations of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may significantly change in a manner that would delay marketing approval.\nBefore obtaining marketing approvals for the commercial sale of any product candidate for a target indication, we must demonstrate in preclinical studies and well-controlled clinical trials and, with respect to approval in the United States, to the satisfaction of the FDA, that the product candidate is safe and effective for use for that target indication and that the manufacturing facilities, processes and controls are adequate. In the United States, it is necessary to submit and obtain approval of an NDA from the FDA. An NDA must include extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to establish the product candidate\u2019s safety and efficacy for each desired indication. The NDA must also include significant information regarding the chemistry, manufacturing and controls, or CMC, for the product. The manufacturing facilities used to manufacture a product candidate must be approved by the FDA pursuant to inspections that will be conducted after we submit an NDA to the FDA to ensure that the facilities are in compliance with the applicable regulatory requirements. The FDA and other regulatory authorities may also inspect our clinical trial sites to ensure that our studies are properly conducted in accordance with good clinical practices, or GCP, which are regulations and guidelines enforced by the FDA, the Competent Authorities of the Member States of the European Economic Area, or EEA, and comparable foreign regulatory authorities for products in clinical development. Obtaining approval of an NDA is a lengthy, expensive and uncertain process, and approval may not be obtained. Upon submission of an NDA, the FDA must make an initial determination that the application is sufficiently complete to accept the submission for filing. We cannot be certain that any submissions will be accepted for filing and reviewed by the FDA, or ultimately be approved. If the application is not accepted for review or approval, the FDA may require that we conduct additional clinical or preclinical trials, or take other actions before it will reconsider our application. If the FDA requires additional studies or data, we would incur increased costs and delays in the marketing approval process, which may require us to expend more resources than we have available. In addition, the FDA may not consider any additional information to be complete or sufficient to support approval. Regulatory authorities outside of the United States, such as in Europe and Japan and in emerging markets, also have requirements for approval of drugs for commercial sale with which we must comply prior to marketing in those areas. Regulatory requirements can vary widely from country to country and could delay or prevent the introduction of our product candidates. Clinical trials conducted in one country may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other countries, and obtaining regulatory approval in one country does not mean that regulatory approval will be obtained in any other country. However, the failure to obtain regulatory approval in one jurisdiction could have a negative impact on our ability to obtain approval in a different jurisdiction. Approval processes vary among countries and can involve additional product candidate testing and validation and additional administrative review periods. Seeking foreign regulatory approval could require additional non-clinical studies or clinical trials, which could be costly and time consuming. Foreign regulatory approval may include all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval. For all of these reasons, we may not obtain foreign regulatory approvals on a timely basis, if at all.\nThe process to develop, obtain marketing approval for and commercialize product candidates is long, complex and costly both inside and outside of the United States, and approval is never guaranteed. The time required to obtain approval by the FDA and comparable foreign authorities is unpredictable but typically takes many years following the commencement of clinical trials and depends upon numerous factors, including the substantial discretion of the regulatory authorities. In addition, approval policies, regulations, or the type and amount of clinical data necessary to gain approval may change during the course of a product candidate\u2019s clinical development and may vary among jurisdictions. Even if our product candidates were to successfully obtain approval from regulatory authorities, any such approval might significantly limit the approved indications for use, including more limited patient populations, require that precautions, warnings or contraindications be included on the product labeling, including black box warnings, require expensive and time-consuming post-approval clinical studies, risk evaluation and mitigation strategies or surveillance as conditions of approval, or, through the product label, the approval may limit the claims that we may make, which may impede the successful commercialization of our product candidates. Following any approval for commercial sale of our product candidates, certain changes to the product, such as changes in manufacturing processes and additional labeling claims, as well as new safety information, may require new studies and will be subject to additional FDA notification, or review and approval. Also, marketing approval for any of our product candidates may be withdrawn. If we are unable to obtain marketing approval for our product candidates in one or more jurisdictions, or if any approval contains significant limitations, our ability to market to our full target market will be reduced and our ability to realize the full market potential of our product candidates will be harmed. Furthermore, we may not be able to obtain sufficient funding or generate sufficient revenue and cash flows to continue or complete the development of any of our current or future product candidates.\nClinical drug development involves a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome, and results of earlier studies and trials may not be predictive of future trial results.\nClinical testing is expensive, and can take many years to complete, and its outcome is inherently uncertain. The FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities have substantial discretion in the approval process, and determining when or whether marketing approval will be obtained for our current product candidates. Even if we believe the data collected from clinical trials of our current product candidates are promising, such data may not be sufficient to support approval by the FDA or comparable foreign authorities. Our future clinical trial results may not be successful.\nIt is impossible to predict the extent to which the clinical trial process may be affected by legislative and regulatory developments. Due to these and other factors, our current product candidates or future product candidates could take a significantly longer time to gain marketing approval than expected or may never gain marketing approval. This could delay or eliminate any potential product revenue by delaying or terminating the potential commercialization of our current product candidates.\nPreclinical trials must also be conducted in accordance with FDA and comparable foreign authorities\u2019 legal requirements, regulations or guidelines, including Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, an international standard meant to harmonize the conduct and quality of nonclinical studies and the archiving and reporting of findings. Preclinical studies including long-term toxicity studies and carcinogenicity studies in experimental animals may result in findings which may require further evaluation, which could affect the risk-benefit evaluation of clinical development, or which may even lead the regulatory agencies to delay, prohibit the initiation of or halt clinical trials or delay or deny marketing authorization applications. Failure to adhere to the applicable GLP standards or misconduct during the course of the study may invalidate the study requiring repeat of the study.\nClinical trials must also be conducted in accordance with FDA and comparable foreign authorities\u2019 legal requirements, regulations or guidelines, including GCP. Clinical trials are further subject to oversight by these governmental agencies and institutional review boards, or IRBs, at the medical institutions where the clinical trials are conducted. In addition, clinical trials must be conducted with supplies of our current product candidates produced under cGMP, and other requirements. Our clinical trials are conducted at multiple sites, including some sites in countries outside the United States and the European Union, or EU, which may subject us to further delays and expenses as a result of increased shipment costs, additional regulatory requirements and the engagement of foreign and non-EU clinical research organizations, as well as expose us to risks associated with clinical investigators who are unknown to the FDA or the European regulatory authorities, and with different standards of diagnosis, screening and medical care.\nTo date, we have not completed all clinical trials required for the approval of our current product candidates. The commencement and completion of clinical trials for our current product candidates may be delayed, suspended or terminated as a result of many factors, including but not limited to:\n\u00b7\nthe delay or refusal of regulators or IRBs to authorize us to commence a clinical trial at a prospective trial site and changes in regulatory requirements, policies and guidelines;\n\u00b7\nthe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities disagreeing as to the design or implementation of our clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nfailure to reach agreement on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations, or CROs, and clinical trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;\n\u00b7\ndelays in patient enrollment and variability in the number and types of patients available for clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nthe inability to enroll a sufficient number of patients in trials to ensure adequate statistical power to detect statistically significant treatment effects;\n\u00b7\nlower than anticipated retention rates of patients and volunteers in clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nclinical sites deviating from trial protocol or dropping out of a trial;\n\u00b7\nadding new clinical trial sites;\n\u00b7\nnegative or inconclusive results, which may require us to conduct additional preclinical or clinical trials or to abandon projects that we expect to be promising;\n\u00b7\nsafety or tolerability, which could cause us to suspend or terminate a trial if we find that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks;\n\u00b7\nregulators or IRBs requiring that we or our investigators suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements;\n\u00b7\nour third-party research and manufacturing contractors failing to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner, or at all;\n\u00b7\ndifficulty in maintaining contact with patients after treatment, resulting in incomplete data;\n\u00b7\ndelays in establishing the appropriate dosage levels;\n\u00b7\nthe quality or stability of our current product candidates falling below acceptable standards;\n\u00b7\nthe inability to produce or obtain sufficient quantities of our current product candidates to complete clinical trials; and\n\u00b7\nexceeding budgeted costs due to difficulty in predicting accurately costs associated with clinical trials.\nPatient enrollment is a significant factor in the timing of clinical trials and is affected by many factors, including the size and nature of the patient population, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for the trial, the design of the clinical trial, competing clinical trials and clinicians\u2019 and patients\u2019 perceptions as to the potential advantages of the drug being studied in relation to other available therapies, including any new drugs or treatments that may be approved for the indications we are investigating.\nWe could encounter delays if a clinical trial is suspended or terminated by us, by the IRBs of the institutions in which such trials are being conducted, by the data safety monitoring board, or DSMB, for such trial or by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. We or such authorities may impose a suspension or termination due to a number of factors, including failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols, inspection of the clinical trial operations or trial site by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold, safety issues or adverse side effects, failure to demonstrate a benefit from using the drug, changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions or lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial. If we experience delays in the completion of, or termination of, any clinical trial of our current product candidates, the commercial prospects of our current product candidates will be harmed and our ability to generate product revenues from our product candidates will be delayed. In addition, any delays in completing our clinical trials will increase our costs, slow our development and approval process and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenues. Many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of marketing approval of our product candidates.\nMoreover, principal investigators for our clinical trials may serve as scientific advisors or consultants to us from time to time and receive compensation in connection with such services. Under certain circumstances, we may be required to report some of these relationships to the FDA. The FDA may conclude that a financial relationship between us and a principal investigator has created a conflict of interest or otherwise affected interpretation of the study. The FDA may therefore question the integrity of the data generated at the applicable clinical trial site and the utility of the clinical trial itself may be jeopardized. This could result in a delay in approval, or rejection, of our marketing applications by the FDA and may ultimately lead to the denial of marketing approval of one or more of our product candidates.\nAny of these occurrences could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may\nalso ultimately lead to the denial of marketing approval of our current product candidates. Significant clinical trial delays could also allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do or shorten any periods during which we have the exclusive right to commercialize our current product candidates and impair our ability to commercialize our current product candidates, which may harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nClinical failure can occur at any stage of clinical development. Because the results of earlier clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of future results, any product candidate we advance through clinical trials may not have favorable results in later clinical trials or receive marketing approval.\nClinical failure can occur at any stage of our clinical development. The results of preclinical studies and early clinical trials of our product candidates may not be predictive of the results of later-stage clinical trials. For example, the positive results generated to date in clinical trials for lasmiditan and IV lasmiditan do not ensure that later clinical trials, including our Phase 3 studies, will demonstrate similar results. Product candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy traits despite having progressed through preclinical studies and initial clinical trials. A number of companies in the biopharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials due to lack of efficacy or adverse safety profiles, notwithstanding promising results in earlier trials. Clinical trials may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical or preclinical testing. Data obtained from tests are susceptible to varying interpretations, and regulators may not interpret our data as favorably as we do, which may delay, limit or prevent marketing approval. In addition, the design of a clinical trial can determine whether its results will support approval of a product, or approval of a product for desired indications, and flaws or shortcomings in the design of a clinical trial may not become apparent until the clinical trial is well advanced. We have limited experience in designing clinical trials and may be unable to design and execute a clinical trial to support marketing approval for our desired indications. Further, clinical trials of potential products often reveal that it is not practical or feasible to continue development efforts. If one of our product candidates is found to be unsafe or lack efficacy, we will not be able to obtain marketing approval for it and our business would be harmed. For example, if the results of our Phase 3 clinical trials of our product candidates do not achieve pre-specified endpoints or we are unable to provide primary or secondary endpoint measurements deemed acceptable by the FDA or comparable foreign regulators, or if we are unable to demonstrate an acceptable level of safety relative to the efficacy associated with our proposed indications, the prospects for approval of our product candidates would be materially and adversely affected. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical industry, including those with greater resources and experience than us, have suffered significant setbacks in Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials, even after seeing promising results in earlier clinical trials.\nIn some instances, there can be significant variability in safety and/or efficacy results between different trials of the same product candidate due to numerous factors, including differences in trial protocols and design, the size and type of the patient populations, adherence to the dosing regimen and the rate of dropout among clinical trial participants. We do not know whether any Phase 3 or other clinical trials we may conduct will demonstrate consistent and/or adequate efficacy and safety to obtain marketing approval to market our product candidates.\nWhile we have negotiated a SPA agreement with the FDA relating to SAMURAI, this agreement does not guarantee approval of lasmiditan or any other particular outcome with respect to regulatory review of the study or the product candidate.\nIn May 2014, we announced that we reached a SPA agreement with the FDA for SAMURAI. The FDA\u2019s SPA process is designed to facilitate the FDA\u2019s review and approval of drugs by allowing the FDA to evaluate the proposed design and size of Phase 3 clinical trials that are intended to form the primary basis for determining a drug product\u2019s efficacy. Upon specific request by a clinical trial sponsor, the FDA will evaluate the protocol and respond to a sponsor\u2019s questions regarding, among other things, primary efficacy endpoints, trial conduct and data analysis, within 45 days of receipt of the request. The FDA ultimately assesses whether the protocol design and planned analysis of the trial are acceptable to support regulatory submission for the product candidate with respect to the indication studied. All agreements and disagreements between the FDA and the sponsor regarding a SPA must be clearly documented in a SPA letter or the minutes of a meeting between the sponsor and the FDA. However, a SPA agreement does not guarantee approval of a product candidate, and even if the FDA agrees to the design, execution, and analysis proposed in protocols reviewed under the SPA process, the FDA may revoke or alter its agreement in certain circumstances. In particular, a SPA agreement is not binding on the FDA if public health concerns emerge that were unrecognized at the time of the SPA agreement, other new scientific concerns regarding product safety or efficacy arise, the sponsor fails to comply with the agreed upon trial protocols, or the relevant data, assumptions or information provided by the sponsor in a request for the SPA change or are found to be false or omit relevant facts. After a SPA agreement is finalized, the SPA agreement may be modified, and such modification will be deemed binding on the FDA review division, except under the circumstances described above, if the FDA and the sponsor agree in writing to modify the protocol and such modification is intended to improve the study. The FDA retains significant latitude and discretion in interpreting the terms of the SPA agreement and the data and results from any study that is the subject of the SPA agreement.\nWe cannot assure you that our Phase 3 clinical trial under a SPA will succeed, will be deemed acceptable to the FDA under our SPA agreement, or will result in any FDA approval for lasmiditan. The trial is expected to administer lasmiditan treatment to\napproximately 1,483 patients with a history of migraine with or without aura from approximately 80 general practice and neurology study centers, but we cannot assure you that our desired number of patients will enroll within our anticipated timeline, which could result in delays. We began enrolling patients during the second quarter of 2015 and expect enrollment to last approximately 12 months, with top-line data available in the third quarter of 2016. We expect that the FDA will review our compliance with the protocol under our SPA agreement and that it will conduct inspections of some of the approximately 80 sites we expect to have in the United States where the clinical trials are being conducted. We cannot assure you that the clinical trial sites will pass such FDA inspections, and negative inspection results could significantly delay or prevent any potential approval for lasmiditan. If the FDA revokes or alters its agreement under the SPA, or interprets the data collected from the clinical trial, or the manner in which the study was conducted, as not consistent with the terms of our SPA, the FDA may not deem the data sufficient to support an application for marketing approval, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, we have negotiated a SPA agreement with the FDA for SPARTAN. The same risks discussed above related to the SAMURAI SPA agreement will apply to the SPARTAN SPA agreement.\nAs an organization, we have never completed a Phase 3 clinical trial before and may be unable to do so efficiently or at all for our current product candidates or any product candidate we are developing.\nWe have initiated our first pivotal Phase 3 trial and a long-term open-label Phase 3 trial. The conduct of Phase 3 clinical trials and the submission of a successful NDA is a complicated process. As an organization, we have not completed a Phase 3 clinical trial before, and we have limited experience in preparing and submitting regulatory filings. Consequently, we may be unable to successfully and efficiently execute and complete necessary clinical trials in a way that leads to NDA submission and approval of our current product candidates or for any other product candidate we develop. We may require more time and incur greater costs than anticipated and may not succeed in obtaining marketing approvals of the product candidates we develop. Failure to commence or complete, or delays in, our planned clinical trials would prevent us from, or delay us in, commercializing our current product candidates or any other product candidate we are developing.\nMarketing approval may be substantially delayed or may not be obtained for one or all of our product candidates if regulatory authorities require additional or more time-consuming studies to assess the safety and efficacy of our product candidates.\nWe may be unable to initiate or complete development of our product candidates on schedule, if at all. The timing for the completion of the studies for our product candidates will require funding beyond our current cash and cash equivalents. In addition, if regulatory authorities require additional or more time-consuming studies to assess the safety or efficacy of our product candidates, we may not have or be able to obtain adequate funding to complete the necessary steps for approval for any or all of our product candidates. Additional delays may result if the FDA, an FDA Advisory Committee, if one is convened to review our NDA, or other regulatory authority indicates that the product candidate should not be approved or there should be restrictions on approval, such as the requirement for a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, to ensure safe use of the drug. Delays in marketing approvals or rejections of applications for marketing approval in the United States or other markets may result from many factors, including:\n\u00b7\nthe FDA\u2019s or comparable foreign regulatory authorities\u2019 disagreement with the design or implementation of our clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nregulatory requests for additional analyses, reports, data, non-clinical and preclinical studies and clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nregulatory questions or disagreement by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities regarding interpretations of data and results and the emergence of new information regarding our current or future product candidates or the field of research;\n\u00b7\nunfavorable or inconclusive results of clinical trials and supportive non-clinical studies, including unfavorable results regarding safety or efficacy of our product candidates during clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nfailure to meet the level of statistical significance required for approval;\n\u00b7\ninability to demonstrate that a product candidate\u2019s clinical and other benefits outweigh its safety risks;\n\u00b7\nlack of adequate funding to commence or continue our clinical trials due to unforeseen costs or other business decisions;\n\u00b7\nregulatory authorities may find inadequate the manufacturing processes or facilities of the third-party manufacturers with whom we contract for clinical and commercial supplies;\n\u00b7\nwe may have insufficient funds to pay the significant user fees required by the FDA upon the filing of an NDA; and\n\u00b7\nthe approval policies or regulations of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may significantly change in a manner that would delay marketing approval.\nThe lengthy and unpredictable approval process, as well as the unpredictability of future clinical trial results, may result in our failure to obtain marketing approval to market our other product candidates, which would significantly harm our business, results of operations and prospects.\nOur product candidates may cause undesirable adverse effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent their marketing approval, limit the commercial profile of an approved label, or result in significant negative consequences following marketing approval, if any.\nUndesirable side effects caused by our product candidates could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in a more restrictive label or the delay or denial of marketing approval by the FDA or other comparable foreign authorities. If our current product candidates or any other product candidate we develop is associated with serious adverse, undesirable or unacceptable side effects, we may need to abandon such candidate\u2019s development or limit development to certain uses or sub-populations in which such side effects are less prevalent, less severe or more acceptable from a risk-benefit perspective. Many compounds that initially showed promise in early-stage or clinical testing have later been found to cause side effects that prevented further development of the compound. Results of our trials could reveal a high and unacceptable prevalence of these or other side effects. In such an event, our trials could be suspended or terminated and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities could order us to cease further development of or deny approval of our product candidates for any or all targeted indications. The drug-related side effects could affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled patients to complete the trial or result in potential product liability claims. To date, the most common side effects observed in clinical studies of our product candidates include dizziness, fatigue, somnolence and paresthesia (tingling sensation). Because our product candidates have been tested in relatively small patient populations and for limited durations, additional side effects may be observed as development of our product candidates progresses.\nIf our product candidates receive marketing approval, and we or others later identify undesirable side effects caused by such products, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:\n\u00b7\nregulatory authorities may withdraw approvals of such product;\n\u00b7\nwe may be required to recall a product or change the way such product is administered to patients;\n\u00b7\nadditional restrictions may be imposed on the marketing of the particular product or the manufacturing process for the product or any component thereof;\n\u00b7\nregulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements, such as a precaution, \u201cblack box\u201d warning or other warnings or a contraindication;\n\u00b7\nwe or our collaborators may be required to implement a REMS or create a medication guide outlining the risks of such side effect for distribution to patients;\n\u00b7\nwe or our collaborators could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients;\n\u00b7\nthe product may become less competitive; and\n\u00b7\nour reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of our product candidates, if approved, and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nEven if we receive marketing approval for our product candidates, such approved products will be subject to ongoing obligations and continued regulatory review, which may result in significant additional expense. Additionally, our product candidates, if approved, could be subject to labeling and other restrictions, and we may be subject to penalties and legal sanctions if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or experience unanticipated problems with our approved products.\nIf the FDA approves any of our product candidates, the manufacturing processes, labeling, packaging, distribution, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion and recordkeeping for the product will be subject to extensive and ongoing regulatory requirements. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration, as well as continued compliance with cGMP, and GCP for any clinical trials that we conduct post-approval. Any marketing approvals that we receive for our product candidates may also be subject to limitations on the approved indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or to conditions of approval, or contain requirements for potentially costly post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to monitor safety and efficacy.\nLater discovery of previously unknown problems with an approved product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing operations or processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in, among other things:\n\u00b7\nrestrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, withdrawal of the product from the market, or voluntary or mandatory product recalls;\n\u00b7\nfines, warning letters, or holds on clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nrefusal by the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications filed by us, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;\n\u00b7\nproduct seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; and\n\u00b7\ninjunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nThe FDA\u2019s policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay marketing approval, manufacturing or commercialization of our product candidates. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that may have been obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability, which would adversely affect our business.\nIf we fail to obtain regulatory approval in jurisdictions outside the United States, we will not be able to market our products in those jurisdictions.\nWe intend to market our product candidates, if approved, in international markets, or in conjunction with collaborators. Such marketing will require separate regulatory approvals in each market and compliance with numerous and varying regulatory requirements. The approval procedures vary from country-to-country and may require testing in addition to what is required for a marketing application in the United States. Moreover, the time required to obtain approval may differ from that required to obtain FDA approval. In addition, in many countries outside the United States, a product candidate must be approved for reimbursement before it can be approved for sale in that country. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions, and approval by one foreign regulatory authority does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other foreign countries or by the FDA. The failure to obtain approval in one jurisdiction may negatively impact our ability to obtain approval in another jurisdiction. The foreign regulatory approval process may include all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval and additional or different risks. We may not be able to file for regulatory approvals and may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize our products in any market.\nAgencies like the FDA and national competition regulators in European countries regulate the promotion and uses of drugs. If we are found to have improperly promoted our current product candidates, we may become subject to significant liability.\nRegulatory authorities like the FDA and national competition laws in Europe strictly regulate the promotional claims that may be made about prescription products, such as lasmiditan and IV lasmiditan, if approved. In particular, a product may not be promoted for uses that are not approved by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities as reflected in the product\u2019s approved labeling, known as \u201coff-label\u201d use, nor may it be promoted prior to obtaining marketing approval. If we receive marketing approval for our product candidates for our proposed indications, physicians may nevertheless use our products for their patients in a manner that is inconsistent with the approved label, if the physicians personally believe in their professional medical judgment it could be used in such manner. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses.\nIn addition, the FDA requires that promotional claims not be \u201cfalse or misleading\u201d as such terms are defined in the FDA\u2019s regulations. For example, the FDA requires substantial evidence, which generally consists of two adequate and well-controlled head-to-head clinical trials, for a company to make a claim that its product is superior to another product in terms of safety or effectiveness. Generally, unless we perform clinical trials meeting that standard comparing our product candidates to competitive products and these claims are approved in our product labeling, we will not be able promote our current product candidates as superior to other products. If we are found to have made such claims, we may become subject to significant liability. In the United States, the federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion and has enjoined several companies from engaging in improper promotion. The FDA has also requested that companies enter into consent decrees or corporate integrity agreements, or could seek permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is monitored, changed or curtailed.\nOur current and future relationships with healthcare professionals, investigators, consultants, collaborators, actual customers, potential customers and third-party payors in the United States and elsewhere may be subject, directly or indirectly, to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, physician payment transparency, health information privacy and security and other healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to sanctions.\nHealthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors in the United States and elsewhere will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any drug candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Our current and future arrangements with healthcare professionals, investigators, consultants, collaborators, actual customers, potential customers and third-party payors may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws, including, without limitation, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the federal False Claims Act, that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we sell, market and distribute any drug candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. In addition, we may be subject to physician payment transparency laws and patient privacy and security regulation by the federal government and by the U.S. states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. The applicable federal, state and foreign healthcare laws that may affect our ability to operate include the following:\n\u00b7\nthe federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, lease, order or recommendation of, any good, facility, item or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under federal and state healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid;\n\u00b7\nfederal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, including the federal False Claims Act, which impose criminal and civil penalties, including civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;\n\u00b7\nthe civil monetary penalties statute, which imposes penalties against any person or entity who, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent;\n\u00b7\nthe federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, regardless of the payor (e.g., public or private), knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a health care benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services relating to healthcare matters;\n\u00b7\nHIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 and their respective implementing regulations, which impose obligations on covered entities, including healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, as well as their respective business associates that create, receive, maintain or transmit individually identifiable health information for or on behalf of a covered entity, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;\n\u00b7\nthe federal Open Payments program, created under Section 6002 of the Affordable Care Act and its implementing regulations, which imposed new annual reporting requirements for manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologicals and medical supplies for certain payments and \u201ctransfers of value\u201d provided to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit timely, accurately and completely the required information for all covered payments, transfers of value and ownership or investment interests may result in civil monetary penalties; and\n\u00b7\nanalogous state and foreign laws, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers; state and foreign laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nFurther, the Affordable Care Act, among other things, amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and certain criminal statutes governing healthcare fraud. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the Affordable Care Act provided that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act.\nEfforts to ensure that our future business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations may involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, including, without limitation, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, which could significantly harm our business. If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business, including our current and future collaborators, if any, is found not to be in compliance with applicable laws, those persons or entities may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from participation in government healthcare programs, which could also affect our business.\nThe impact of recent healthcare reform legislation and other changes in the healthcare industry and healthcare spending on us is currently unknown, and may adversely affect our business model.\nIn the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system could prevent or delay marketing approval of our drug candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to profitably sell any drug candidates for which we obtain marketing approval.\nOur revenue prospects could be affected by changes in healthcare spending and policy in the United States and abroad. We operate in a highly regulated industry and new laws, judicial decisions, or new interpretations of existing laws, or decisions, related to healthcare availability, the method of delivery or payment for healthcare products and services could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. There is significant interest in promoting health care reform, as evidenced by the enactment in the United States of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or the Affordable Care Act. Among other things, the Affordable Care Act contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products, including, for example, revising the methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers for covered outpatient drugs under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated, extending the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care plans, imposing mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries, and subjecting drug manufacturers to payment of an annual fee.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. On August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation\u2019s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which started in April 2013, and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will remain in effect through 2024 unless additional Congressional action is taken. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, also reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers.\nWe expect that the Affordable Care Act, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue or commercialize our drugs.\nIt is likely that federal and state legislatures within the United States and foreign governments will continue to consider changes to existing healthcare legislation. We cannot predict the reform initiatives that may be adopted in the future or whether initiatives that have been adopted will be repealed or modified. The continuing efforts of the government, insurance companies, managed care organizations and other payors of healthcare services to contain or reduce costs of healthcare may adversely affect the following aspects of our business, among other things:\n\u00b7\nthe demand for any drug products for which we may obtain marketing approval;\n\u00b7\nour ability to set a price that we believe is fair for our products;\n\u00b7\nour ability to obtain coverage and reimbursement approval for a product;\n\u00b7\nour ability to generate revenues and achieve or maintain profitability; and\n\u00b7\nthe level of taxes that we are required to pay.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nDue to our limited resources and access to capital, we must decide to prioritize development of our current product candidates for certain indications and at certain doses. These decisions may prove to have been wrong and may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nBecause we have limited resources and access to capital to fund our operations, we must decide which dosages and indications to pursue for the clinical development of our current product candidates and the amount of resources to allocate to each. Our decisions concerning the allocation of research, collaboration, management and financial resources toward dosages or therapeutic areas may not lead to the development of viable commercial products and may divert resources away from better opportunities. If we make incorrect determinations regarding the market potential of our current product candidates or misread trends in the pharmaceutical industry, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to win government, academic institution or non-profit contracts or grants.\nFrom time to time, we may apply for contracts or grants from government agencies, non-profit entities and academic institutions. Such contracts or grants can be highly attractive because they provide capital to fund the on-going development of our product candidates without diluting our stockholders. However, there is often significant competition for these contracts or grants. Entities offering contracts or grants may have requirements to apply for or to otherwise be eligible for certain contracts or grants that our competitors may be able to satisfy that we cannot. In addition, such entities may make arbitrary decisions as to whether to offer contracts or make grants, to whom the contracts or grants will be awarded and the size of the contracts or grants to each awardee. Even if we are able to satisfy the award requirements, there is no guarantee that we will be a successful awardee. Therefore, we may not be able to win any contracts or grants in a timely manner, if at all.\nIf we fail to attract and retain key management and scientific personnel, we may be unable to successfully develop or commercialize our product candidates.\nOur success as a biopharmaceutical company depends on our continued ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified management and scientific and clinical personnel. The loss of the services of any of our senior management could delay or prevent obtaining marketing approval or commercialization of our product candidates.\nWe may not be able to attract or retain qualified management and scientific personnel in the future due to the intense competition for a limited number of qualified personnel among biopharmaceutical, biotechnology, pharmaceutical and other businesses. Our failure to attract, hire, integrate and retain qualified personnel could impair our ability to achieve our business objectives.\nIf a successful product liability claim or series of claims is brought against us for uninsured liabilities or in excess of insured liabilities, we could be forced to pay substantial damage awards.\nThe use of any of our product candidates in clinical trials, and the sale of any approved products, may expose us to product liability claims. We currently maintain $10.0 million of product liability insurance coverage, which is an amount we believe is adequate for our clinical trials currently in progress and those recently completed. We monitor the amount of coverage we maintain as the size and design of our clinical trials evolve and intend to adjust the amount of coverage we maintain accordingly. However, we cannot assure you that such insurance coverage will fully protect us against some or all of the claims to which we might become subject. We might not be able to maintain adequate insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts or scope to protect us against potential losses. In the event a claim is brought against us, we might be required to pay legal and other expenses to defend the claim, as well as uncovered damages awards resulting from a claim brought successfully against us. Furthermore, whether or not we are ultimately successful in defending any such claims, we might be required to direct financial and managerial resources to such defense and adverse publicity could result, all of which could harm our business.\nOur employees, independent contractors, investigators, contract research organizations, consultants, collaborators and vendors may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements and insider trading.\nWe are exposed to the risk that our employees and other third parties may engage in fraudulent conduct or other illegal activity. Misconduct by employees and other third parties could include intentional, reckless and/or negligent conduct or disclosure of\nunauthorized activities to us that violate laws and regulations, including those laws requiring the reporting of true, complete and accurate information to the FDA, manufacturing standards, federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations, or laws that require the reporting of financial information or data accurately. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws intended to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Activities subject to these laws also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. It is not always possible to identify and deter employee and other third-party misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, disgorgement, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings and curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate.\nAs we evolve from a company primarily involved in clinical development to a company also involved in commercialization, if we obtain approval of our product candidates, we may encounter difficulties in managing our growth and expanding our operations successfully.\nAs we advance our product candidates through clinical trials, we will need to expand our development, regulatory, manufacturing, marketing and sales capabilities or contract with third parties to provide these capabilities for us. As our operations expand, we expect that we will need to manage additional relationships with such third parties, as well as additional collaborators and suppliers.\nMaintaining these relationships and managing our future growth will impose significant added responsibilities on members of our management and other personnel. We must be able to: manage our development efforts effectively; manage our clinical trials effectively; hire, train and integrate additional management, development, administrative and sales and marketing personnel; improve our managerial, development, operational and finance systems; and expand our facilities, all of which may impose a strain on our administrative and operational infrastructure.\nOur internal computer systems, or those of our development collaborators, third-party clinical research organizations or other contractors or consultants, may fail or suffer security breaches, which could result in a material disruption of our product development programs.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our current and any future contract research organizations and other contractors, consultants and collaborators are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. While we have not experienced any such material system failure, accident or security breach to date, if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our development programs and our business operations. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed or future clinical trials could result in delays in our marketing approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. Likewise, we rely on third parties to manufacture our product candidates and conduct clinical trials, and similar events relating to their computer systems could also have a material adverse effect on our business. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and the further development and commercialization of our product candidates could be delayed.\nRisks Related to Commercialization of Our Product Candidates\nEven if we obtain the required regulatory approvals in the United States and other territories, the commercial success of our product candidates will depend on market awareness and acceptance of our product candidates.\nEven if we obtain marketing approval for our current product candidates or any other product candidates that we may develop or acquire in the future, the product may not gain market acceptance among physicians, key opinion leaders, healthcare payors, patients and the medical community. Market acceptance of any approved products depends on a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7\nthe timing of market introduction;\n\u00b7\nthe efficacy and safety of the product, as demonstrated in clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nthe clinical indications for which the product is approved and the label approved by regulatory authorities for use with the product, including any precautions, warnings or contraindications that may be required on the label;\n\u00b7\nacceptance by physicians, key opinion leaders and patients of the product as a safe and effective treatment;\n\u00b7\nthe cost, safety and efficacy of treatment in relation to alternative treatments;\n\u00b7\nthe availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement and pricing by third-party payors and government authorities;\n\u00b7\nthe number and clinical profile of competing products;\n\u00b7\nthe growth of drug markets in our various indications;\n\u00b7\nrelative convenience and ease of administration;\n\u00b7\nmarketing and distribution support;\n\u00b7\nthe prevalence and severity of adverse side effects; and\n\u00b7\nthe effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts.\nMarket acceptance is critical to our ability to generate revenue. Any product candidate, if approved and commercialized, may be accepted in only limited capacities or not at all. If any approved products are not accepted by the market to the extent that we expect, we may not be able to generate revenue and our business would suffer.\nWe have never commercialized a product candidate, and we currently have no marketing and sales organization. To the extent our product candidates are approved for marketing, if we are unable to establish marketing and sales capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell our product candidates, we may not be able to effectively market and sell our product candidates or generate product revenue.\nWe have never commercialized a product candidate, and we currently do not have marketing, sales or distribution capabilities for our product candidates. In order to commercialize any of our products that receive marketing approval, we would have to build marketing, sales, distribution, managerial and other non-technical capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services, and we may not be successful in doing so. In the event of successful development of our product candidates, if we elect to build a targeted specialty sales force, such an effort would be expensive and time consuming. Any failure or delay in the development of our internal sales, marketing and distribution capabilities would adversely impact the commercialization of these products. We may choose to collaborate with third parties that have their own sales forces and established distribution systems, in lieu of or to augment any sales force and distribution systems we may create. If we are unable to enter into collaborations with third parties for the commercialization of approved products, if any, on acceptable terms or at all, or if any such collaborator does not devote sufficient resources to the commercialization of our product or otherwise fails in commercialization efforts, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our product candidates if they receive marketing approval. If we are not successful in commercializing our product candidates, either on our own or through collaborations with one or more third parties, our future revenue will be materially and adversely impacted.\nIf we fail to enter into strategic relationships or collaborations, our business, financial condition, commercialization prospects and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nOur product development programs and the potential commercialization of our current product candidates will require substantial additional cash to fund expenses. Therefore, in addition to financing the development of our product candidates through additional equity financings or through debt financings, we may decide to enter into collaborations with pharmaceutical or biopharmaceutical companies for the development and potential commercialization of our product candidates.\nWe face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators. Collaborations are complex and time-consuming to negotiate and document. We may also be restricted under existing and future collaboration agreements from entering into agreements on certain terms with other potential collaborators. We may not be able to negotiate collaborations on acceptable terms, or at all. If that were to occur, we may have to curtail the development of a particular product, reduce or delay its development program or one or more of our other development programs, delay its potential commercialization or reduce the scope of our sales or marketing activities, or increase our expenditures and undertake development or commercialization activities at our own expense. If we elect to increase our expenditures to fund development or commercialization activities on our own, we may need to obtain additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we do not have sufficient funds, we will not be able to bring our product candidates to market and generate product revenue. If we do enter into a new collaboration agreement, we could be subject to the following risks, each of which may materially harm our business, commercialization prospects and financial condition:\n\u00b7\nwe may not be able to control the amount and timing of resources that a collaborator devotes to the product development program;\n\u00b7\na collaborator may experience financial difficulties and thus not commit sufficient financial resources to the product development program;\n\u00b7\nwe may be required to relinquish important rights such as marketing, distribution and intellectual property rights;\n\u00b7\na collaborator could move forward with a competing product developed either independently or in collaboration with third parties, including our competitors; or\n\u00b7\nbusiness combinations or significant changes in a collaborator\u2019s business strategy may adversely affect our willingness to complete our obligations under any arrangement.\nOur strategy for the development and commercialization of IV lasmiditan depends on securing a collaboration prior to commencing a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial, and if we fail to secure such a collaboration on acceptable terms, it could delay or limit our ability to successfully develop and commercialize IV lasmiditan.\nWe plan to commence a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial for IV lasmiditan after securing a collaboration for the development and commercialization of IV lasmiditan. We will require a collaboration arrangement in order to develop and maintain marketing approval of IV lasmiditan and commercialize IV lasmiditan, and a failure to obtain this necessary collaboration when needed on acceptable terms, or at all, could force us to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development, other operations or commercialization efforts for IV lasmiditan. Given the unique call point of emergency rooms and other urgent care settings, which will be outside of our specialty sales force, a sales force with expertise in such settings would be best positioned for commercialization of IV lasmiditan. We expect to face significant challenges in securing a collaboration with a party that has the appropriate expertise to successfully develop and commercialize IV lasmiditan. Even if we are able to identify an appropriate collaborator, we may be unable to negotiate such collaboration on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to secure such a collaboration, it could delay or limit our ability to develop and commercialize IV lasmiditan as we continue to seek an appropriate collaboration or expend additional capital to hire additional personnel with the necessary expertise to develop and commercialize IV lasmiditan.\nOur product candidates utilize a novel mechanism of action, which may result in greater research and development expenses, regulatory issues that could delay or prevent approval, or discovery of unknown or unanticipated adverse effects.\nLasmiditan is a new chemical entity designed to treat migraine using a novel mechanism by acting as an agonist at the 5-HT1F receptor. In contrast to triptans, which act peripherally, lasmiditan is designed to penetrate the CNS and to block the pathway that contributes to headache pain. There can be no assurance that problems related to the development of this novel mechanism will not arise in the future, which may cause significant delays or which we may not be able to resolve.\nRegulatory approval of novel product candidates such as ours can be more expensive and take longer than for other, more well-known or extensively studied pharmaceutical or biopharmaceutical product candidates due to our and regulatory agencies\u2019 lack of experience with them. The novelty of our mechanism of action may lengthen the regulatory review process, require us to conduct additional studies or clinical trials, increase our development costs, lead to changes in regulatory positions and interpretations, delay or prevent approval and commercialization of our product candidates or lead to significant post-approval limitations or restrictions. The novel mechanism of action of lasmiditan and IV lasmiditan also means that fewer people are trained in or experienced with product candidates of this type, which may make it more difficult to find, hire and retain personnel for research, development and manufacturing positions. Because lasmiditan utilizes a novel mechanism of action that has not been the subject of extensive study compared to more well-known product candidates, there is also an increased risk that we may discover previously unknown or unanticipated adverse effects during our pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials and beyond. Any such events could adversely impact our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nCoverage and reimbursement may be limited or unavailable in certain market segments for our product candidates, which could make it difficult for us to sell our products profitably.\nThere is significant uncertainty related to third-party coverage and reimbursement of newly approved pharmaceuticals. Market acceptance and sales of any approved product candidates will depend significantly on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors and may be affected by existing and future healthcare reform measures. Government authorities and third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which drugs they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. Increasingly, third-party payors are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for drugs and products. Coverage and reimbursement may not be available for any product that we commercialize and, even if these are available, the level of reimbursement may not be satisfactory. Inadequate reimbursement levels may adversely affect the demand for, or the price of, any drug candidate for which we obtain marketing approval.\nReimbursement by a third-party payor may depend upon a number of factors, including the third-party payor\u2019s determination that use of a product is, among other things:\n\u00b7\na covered benefit under its health plan;\n\u00b7\nsafe, effective and medically necessary;\n\u00b7\nappropriate for the specific patient;\n\u00b7\ncost-effective; and\n\u00b7\nneither experimental nor investigational.\nObtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement approval for a product from a government or other third-party payor is a time consuming and costly process that could require us to provide supporting scientific, clinical and cost-effectiveness data for the use of our products to the payor. We may not be able to provide data sufficient to gain acceptance with respect to coverage and adequate reimbursement. In addition to examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of new products, there may be limited coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drug products for a particular indication. There may also be formulary placements that result in lower reimbursement levels and higher cost-sharing borne by patients, any of which could have an adverse effect on our revenues and profits. Moreover, a third-party payor\u2019s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. Additionally, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor. One third-party payor\u2019s decision to cover a particular drug product does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the drug product, or even if coverage is available, establish an adequate reimbursement rate.\nPatients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Patients are unlikely to use our product candidates, if approved, unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products. Sales of our product candidates will, therefore, depend substantially on the extent to which the costs of our product candidates will be paid by third-party payors.\nWe cannot be sure that coverage or adequate reimbursement will be available for any of our product candidates. Also, we cannot be sure that reimbursement amounts will not reduce the demand for, or the price of, our products. If reimbursement is not available or is available only to limited levels, we may not be able to commercialize certain of our products. In addition in the United States, third-party payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement of new drugs. As a result, significant uncertainty exists as to whether and how much third-party payors will reimburse patients for their use of newly approved drugs, which in turn will put pressure on the pricing of drugs.\nOutside of the United States, government programs that reimburse at typically predetermined fixed rates may decrease or otherwise limit amounts available through reimbursement. For example, in the European Union, member states impose controls on whether products are reimbursable by national or regional health service providers and on the prices at which medicines and medical devices are reimbursed under state-run healthcare schemes. Some member states operate reference pricing systems in which they set national reimbursement prices by reference to those in other member states. Other governmental funding restrictions, legislative proposals and interpretations of policy may negatively impact amounts available through reimbursement, including by restricting payment increases to hospitals and other providers through reimbursement systems. We are not able to predict whether changes will be made in the rates prescribed by these governmental programs or, if they are made, what effect they could have on our business. However, governmental rate changes and other similar developments could negatively affect our ability to sell our products, if approved.\nWe face substantial competition, which may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing products before, or more successfully, than we do.\nThe life sciences industry is highly competitive, and we face significant competition from many biopharmaceutical, biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies that are researching and marketing products designed to treat migraine and headache pain. Such competition may include large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical and generic companies and medical technology companies. Our future success depends on our ability to demonstrate and maintain a competitive advantage with respect to the design, development and commercialization of our product candidates. Our objective is to design, develop and commercialize new products that are efficacious, convenient, tolerable and safe. In many cases, the product candidates that we intend to commercialize with our strategic collaborators or on our own will compete with existing, market-leading products.\nIf our product candidates are approved, they will compete with currently marketed drugs and devices and potentially with product candidates currently in development to treat migraine. Many of our potential competitors have significantly greater financial, manufacturing, marketing, development, technical and human resources than we do. Large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, in particular, have extensive experience in clinical testing, obtaining regulatory approvals, recruiting patients and in manufacturing clinical products. These companies also have significantly greater research and marketing capabilities than we do and may also have products that have been approved or are in late stages of development, and have collaborative arrangements in our target markets with leading companies and research institutions. Established companies may also invest heavily to accelerate discovery and development of compounds that could make the product candidates that we develop obsolete. As a result of all of these factors, the highly competitive nature of and rapid technological changes in the industry could render our product candidates or our technology obsolete or non-competitive. Our competitors may, among other things:\n\u00b7\nhave greater name and brand recognition, financial and human resources;\n\u00b7\ndevelop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, less expensive, or more convenient or easier to administer;\n\u00b7\nobtain quicker marketing approval;\n\u00b7\nestablish superior proprietary positions;\n\u00b7\nhave access to more manufacturing capacity;\n\u00b7\nimplement more effective approaches to sales and marketing; or\n\u00b7\nform more advantageous strategic alliances.\nShould any of these factors occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be materially adversely affected. If we are not able to compete effectively against potential competitors, our business will not grow and our financial condition and operations will suffer.\nWe believe that our ability to successfully compete will depend on, among other things:\n\u00b7\nour ability to design and successfully execute appropriate clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nour ability to recruit and enroll patients for our clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nthe results of our clinical trials and the efficacy and safety of our product candidates;\n\u00b7\nthe speed at which we develop our product candidates;\n\u00b7\nachieving and maintaining compliance with regulatory requirements applicable to our business;\n\u00b7\nthe timing and scope of regulatory approvals, including labeling;\n\u00b7\nadequate levels of reimbursement under private and governmental health insurance plans, including Medicare;\n\u00b7\nour ability to protect intellectual property rights related to our product candidates;\n\u00b7\nour ability to commercialize and market any of our product candidates that may receive marketing approval;\n\u00b7\nour ability to manufacture and sell commercial quantities of any approved product candidates to the market;\n\u00b7\nacceptance of our product candidates by physicians, other healthcare providers and patients; and\n\u00b7\nthe cost of treatment in relation to alternative therapies.\nPrice controls may be imposed in foreign markets, which may adversely affect our future profitability.\nIn some countries, particularly member states of the European Union, the pricing of prescription drugs is subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after receipt of marketing approval for a product. In addition, there can be considerable pressure by governments and other stakeholders on prices and reimbursement levels, including as part of cost containment measures. Political, economic and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. Reference pricing used by various European Union member states and parallel distribution, or arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced member states, can further reduce prices. In some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical trial or other studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of our product candidates to other available therapies in order to obtain or maintain reimbursement or pricing approval. Publication of discounts by third-party payors or authorities may lead to further pressure on the prices or reimbursement levels within the country of publication and other countries. If reimbursement of our products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, our business could be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Third Parties\nWe currently rely on third-party suppliers and other third parties for production of our product candidates and our dependence on these third parties may impair the advancement of our research and development programs and the development of our product candidates.\nWe do not currently own or operate manufacturing facilities for clinical or commercial production of our product candidates. We lack the resources and the capability to manufacture any of our product candidates on a clinical or commercial scale. Instead, we currently rely on, and expect to continue to rely on, only one third party for the supply of raw materials and manufacture of drug supplies necessary to conduct our preclinical studies and clinical trials. Our current reliance on one third party may expose us to more risk than if we were to manufacture our current product candidates or other products ourselves, or if we were to have relationships with multiple or back-up third parties. Delays in production by this third party could delay our clinical trials or have an adverse impact on any commercial activities. In addition, the fact that we are dependent on this third party for the manufacture of and formulation of our product candidates means that we are subject to the risk that the products may have manufacturing defects that we have limited ability to prevent or control. Although we oversee these activities to ensure compliance with our quality standards, budgets and timelines, we have had and will continue to have less control over the manufacturing of our product candidates than potentially would be the case if we were to manufacture our product candidates, or have alternative manufacturers to turn to in instances where batches of our product candidates did not meet required standards. Further, the third party we deal with could have staffing difficulties, might undergo changes in priorities or may become financially distressed, which would adversely affect the manufacturing and production of our lasmiditan oral tablets and IV formulation. In addition, they could be acquired by, or enter into an exclusive arrangement with, one of our competitors, which would adversely affect our ability to access the formulations we require. In the event that we need to transition to alternate sources of raw materials supply or finished goods manufacturing to satisfy our requirements, we cannot be certain that such sources exist or that there would not be significant delay or material additional costs associated with such a transition.\nThe facilities used by our current contract manufacturer and any future manufacturers to manufacture our product candidates must be inspected by the FDA after we submit our NDA to the FDA. We do not control the manufacturing process of, and are completely dependent on, our contract manufacturers for compliance with the regulatory requirements, known as cGMPs, for manufacture of both active drug substances and finished drug products. If our contract manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and the strict regulatory requirements of the FDA or others, FDA may refuse to approve our NDA. If the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority does not approve our NDA because of concerns about the manufacture of our product candidates or if significant manufacturing issues arise in the future, we may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities, which would significantly impact our ability to develop, obtain marketing approval of our NDA or to continue to market our product candidates, if approved. Although we are ultimately responsible for ensuring compliance with these regulatory requirements, we do not have day-to-day control over a contract manufacturing organization, or CMO, or other third-party manufacturer\u2019s compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including cGMPs and other laws and regulations, such as those related to environmental health and safety matters. Any failure to achieve and maintain compliance with these laws, regulations and standards could subject us to the risk that we may have to suspend the manufacturing of our product candidates or that obtained approvals could be revoked, which would adversely affect our business and reputation. In addition, third-party contractors, such as our CMOs, may elect not to continue to work with us due to factors beyond our control. They may also refuse to work with us because of their own financial difficulties, business priorities or other reasons, at a time that is costly or otherwise inconvenient for us. If we were unable to find adequate replacement or another acceptable solution in time, our clinical trials could be delayed or our commercial activities could be harmed.\nProblems with the quality of the work of third parties may lead us to seek to terminate our working relationships and use alternative service providers. However, making this change may be costly and may delay the trials. In addition, it may be very challenging, and in some cases impossible, to find replacement service providers that can develop and manufacture the lasmiditan in\nan acceptable manner and at an acceptable cost and on a timely basis. The sale of products containing any defects or any delays in the supply of necessary services could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nGrowth in the costs and expenses of components or raw materials may also adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. Supply sources could be interrupted from time to time and, if interrupted, supplies may not be resumed (whether in part or in whole) within a reasonable timeframe and at an acceptable cost or at all.\nWe currently rely on one CRO to conduct clinical trials for our product candidates and plan to rely on third parties to conduct future clinical trials. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, it may cause delays in commencing and completing clinical trials of our product candidates or we may be unable to obtain marketing approval for or commercialize our product candidates.\nClinical trials must meet applicable FDA and foreign regulatory requirements. We do not have the ability to independently conduct Phase 2 or Phase 3 clinical trials for any of our product candidates. We currently rely on and expect to continue to rely on third parties, such as contract research organizations, medical institutions, clinical investigators and contract laboratories, to conduct all of our clinical trials of our product candidates; however, we remain responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with its investigational plan and protocol. Moreover, the FDA and other foreign regulatory authorities require us to comply with regulations and standards, commonly referred to as cGCPs for conducting, monitoring, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to ensure that the data and results are scientifically credible and accurate and that the trial subjects are adequately informed of the potential risks of participating in clinical trials. Our reliance on third parties does not relieve us of these responsibilities and requirements. Regulatory authorities enforce these cGCPs through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, CROs, principal investigators and trial sites. If we or any of our third-party contractors fail to comply with applicable cGCPs, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. We cannot assure you that upon inspection by a given regulatory authority, such regulatory authority will determine that any of our clinical trials comply with cGCP regulations. In addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with product produced under cGMP regulations. Our failure to comply with these regulations may require us to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the marketing approval process. In addition, failure to comply with GCPs could result in other consequences including imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of a warning letter, or other enforcement.\nWe or the third parties we rely on may encounter problems in clinical trials that may cause us or the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies to delay, suspend or terminate our clinical trials at any phase. These problems could include the possibility that we may not be able to manufacture sufficient quantities of materials for use in our clinical trials, conduct clinical trials at our preferred sites, enroll a sufficient number of patients for our clinical trials at one or more sites, or begin or successfully complete clinical trials in a timely fashion, if at all. Furthermore, we, the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies may suspend clinical trials of our product candidates at any time if we or they believe the subjects participating in the trials are being exposed to unacceptable health risks, whether as a result of adverse events occurring in our trials or otherwise, or if we or they find deficiencies in the clinical trial process or conduct of the investigation.\nThe FDA and foreign regulatory agencies could also require additional clinical trials before or after granting of marketing approval for any products, which would result in increased costs and significant delays in the development and commercialization of such products and could result in the withdrawal of such products from the market after obtaining marketing approval. Our failure to adequately demonstrate the safety and efficacy of a product candidate in clinical development could delay or prevent obtaining marketing approval of the product candidate and, after obtaining marketing approval, data from post-approval studies could result in the product being withdrawn from the market, either of which would likely have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf our contractors fail to comply with continuing regulations, we or they may be subject to enforcement action that could adversely affect us.\nIf any of our contractors fail to comply with the requirements of the FDA and other applicable U.S. or foreign governmental or regulatory authorities, or if previously unknown problems with our products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes are discovered, we or the contractor could be subject to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions, including: restrictions on the products, the manufacturers or manufacturing processes we use, warning letters, civil or criminal penalties, fines, injunctions, product seizures or detentions, import bans, voluntary or mandatory product recalls and publicity requirements, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, total or partial suspension of production, and refusal to approve pending applications for marketing approval of new products to approved applications.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nOur proprietary rights may not adequately protect our technologies and product candidates.\nOur commercial success will depend in part on our ability to obtain additional patents and protect our existing patent position as well as our ability to maintain adequate protection of other intellectual property for our technologies, product candidates, and any future products in the United States and other countries. If we do not adequately protect our intellectual property, competitors may be able to use our technologies and erode or negate any competitive advantage we may have, which could harm our business and ability to achieve profitability. The laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent or in the same manner as U.S. laws, and we may encounter significant problems in protecting and defending our proprietary rights in these countries. We will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary technologies, product candidates and any future products are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets.\nWe apply for patents covering both our technologies and product candidates, as we deem appropriate. However, we may fail to apply for patents on important technologies or product candidates in a timely fashion, or at all. Our existing patents and any future patents we obtain may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from practicing our technologies or from developing competing products and technologies. We cannot be certain that our patent applications will be approved or that any patents issued will adequately protect our intellectual property.\nWhile we are responsible for and have control over the filing and prosecuting of patent applications and maintaining patents which cover making, using or selling lasmiditan we may lose such rights if we decide to allow any licensed patent to lapse. If we fail to appropriately prosecute and maintain patent protection for any of our product candidates, our ability to develop and commercialize those product candidates may be adversely affected and we may not be able to prevent competitors from making, using and selling competing products.\nMoreover, the patent positions of pharmaceutical companies are highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles are often evolving and remain unresolved. As a result, the validity and enforceability of patents cannot be predicted with certainty. In addition, we do not know whether:\n\u00b7\nwe or our licensors were the first to make the inventions covered by each of our issued patents and pending patent applications;\n\u00b7\nwe or our licensors were the first to file patent applications for these inventions;\n\u00b7\nany of our product candidates will be Orange Book eligible;\n\u00b7\nothers will independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies;\n\u00b7\nany of our or our licensors\u2019 pending patent applications will result in issued patents;\n\u00b7\nany of our or our licensors\u2019 patents will be valid or enforceable;\n\u00b7\nany patents issued to us or our licensors and collaborators will provide us with any competitive advantages, or will be challenged by third parties;\n\u00b7\nwe will develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable;\n\u00b7\nthe U.S. government will exercise any of its statutory rights to our intellectual property that was developed with government funding; or\n\u00b7\nour business may infringe the patents or other proprietary rights of others.\nThe actual protection afforded by a patent varies based on products or processes, from country to country and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country, the validity and enforceability of the patents and our financial ability to enforce our patents and other intellectual property. Our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary position for our products will depend on our success in obtaining effective claims and enforcing those claims once granted. Our issued patents and those that may issue in the future, or those licensed to us, may be challenged, narrowed, invalidated or circumvented, and the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar products. Due to the extensive amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that, before any of our product candidates can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of the patent.\nWe may also rely on trade secrets to protect some of our technology, especially where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to maintain. While we use reasonable efforts to protect our trade secrets, our or any of our collaborators\u2019 employees, consultants, contractors or scientific and other advisors may unintentionally or willfully disclose our proprietary information to competitors and we may not have adequate remedies in respect of that disclosure. Enforcement of claims that a third party has illegally obtained and is using trade secrets is expensive, time consuming and uncertain. In addition, foreign courts are sometimes less willing than U.S. courts to protect trade secrets. If our competitors independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how, we would not be able to assert our trade secrets against them and our business could be harmed.\nWe are a party to a license agreement with Eli Lilly under which we license the intellectual property and receive commercialization rights to lasmiditan; any termination of such agreement would adversely affect our business.\nIn 2005, we entered into an agreement with Eli Lilly and Company, or Lilly, pursuant to which we obtained an exclusive, worldwide license from Lilly to develop and commercialize lasmiditan. Pursuant to our agreement with Lilly, we have been granted an exclusive worldwide license, with the right to grant sublicenses, under certain patents and know-how owned or controlled by Lilly relating to lasmiditan. Under this license agreement, we are subject to commercialization and development, diligence obligations, royalty payments and other obligations. If we fail to comply with any of these obligations or otherwise breach this license agreement, Lilly may have the right to terminate the license in whole or in part or to terminate the exclusive nature of the license. Generally, the loss of the licenses granted to us under our agreement with Lilly or the rights provided therein could materially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. See \u201cBusiness-Strategic Relationships-Eli Lilly and Company\u201d for a description of the material terms of this agreement.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents on product candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States can be less extensive than those in the United States. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the United States. For example, many foreign countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner must grant licenses to third parties. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States, or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but enforcement rights are not as strong as those in the United States. These products may compete with our product candidates in jurisdictions where we do not have any issued patents and our patent claims or other intellectual rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from so competing.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license.\nIf we do not obtain patent term extension in the United States under the Hatch-Waxman Act and in foreign countries under similar legislation, thereby potentially extending the term of marketing exclusivity for our product candidates, our business may be materially harmed.\nDepending on the timing, duration and specifics of FDA marketing approval of our product candidates, if any, one of the U.S. patents covering each of such approved product(s) or the use thereof may be eligible for up to five years of patent term restoration under the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act allows a maximum of one patent to be extended per FDA approved product. Patent term extension also may be available in certain foreign countries upon regulatory approval of our product candidates. Nevertheless, we may not be granted patent term extension either in the United States or in any foreign country because of, for example, failing to apply within applicable deadlines, failing to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or otherwise failing to satisfy applicable requirements. Moreover, the term of extension, as well as the scope of patent protection during any such extension, afforded by the governmental authority could be less than we request.\nIf we are unable to obtain patent term extension or restoration, or the term of any such extension is less than we or our collaborators request, the period during which we will have the right to exclusively market our product will be shortened and our\ncompetitors may obtain approval of competing products following our patent expiration, and our revenue could be reduced, possibly materially.\nWe may not identify relevant patents or may incorrectly interpret the relevance, scope or expiration of a patent, which may adversely affect our ability to develop and market our product candidates.\nWe cannot guarantee that any of our patent searches or analyses, including but not limited to the identification of relevant patents, the scope of patent claims or the expiration of relevant patents, are complete or thorough, nor can we be certain that we have identified each and every patent and pending application in the United States and abroad that is relevant to or necessary for the commercialization of our product candidates in any jurisdiction.\nThe scope of a patent claim is determined by an interpretation of the law, the written disclosure in a patent and the patent\u2019s prosecution history. Our interpretation of the relevance or the scope of a patent or a pending application may be incorrect, which may negatively impact our ability to market our product candidates. We may incorrectly determine that our product candidates are not covered by a third-party patent.\nMany patents may cover a marketed product, including but not limited to patents covering the composition, methods of use, formulations, production processes and purification processes of or for the product. The identification of all patents and their expiration dates relevant to the production and sale of a therapeutic product is extraordinarily complex and requires sophisticated legal knowledge in the relevant jurisdiction. It may be impossible to identify all patents in all jurisdictions relevant to a marketed product. Our determination of the expiration date of any patent in the United States or abroad that we consider relevant may be incorrect, which may negatively impact our ability to develop and market our product candidates.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, documentary, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nThe United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent prosecution process. Periodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees and various other governmental fees on any issued patent and/or pending patent applications are due to be paid to the USPTO and foreign patent agencies in several stages over the lifetime of a patent or patent application. We have systems in place to remind us to pay these fees, and we employ an outside firm and rely on our outside counsel to pay these fees. While an inadvertent lapse may sometimes be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules, there are many situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. If we fail to maintain the patents and patent applications directed to our product candidates, our competitors might be able to enter the market earlier than should otherwise have been the case, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe patent protection for our product candidates may expire before we are able to maximize their commercial value, which may subject us to increased competition and reduce or eliminate our opportunity to generate product revenue.\nThe patents for our product candidates have varying expiration dates and, if these patents expire, we may be subject to increased competition and we may not be able to recover our development costs or market any of our approved products profitably. In some of the larger potential market territories, such as the United States and Europe, patent term extension or restoration may be available to compensate for time taken during aspects of the product\u2019s development and regulatory review. However, we cannot be certain that such an extension will be granted, or if granted, what the applicable time period or the scope of patent protection afforded during any extension period will be. In addition, even though some regulatory authorities may provide some other exclusivity for a product under their own laws and regulations, we may not be able to qualify the product or obtain the exclusive time period. If we are unable to obtain patent term extension/restoration or some other exclusivity, we could be subject to increased competition and our opportunity to establish or maintain product revenue could be substantially reduced or eliminated. Furthermore, we may not have sufficient time to recover our development costs prior to the expiration of our U.S. and foreign patents.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits to protect our patents or other intellectual property rights, which could be expensive, time-consuming and ultimately unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe our patents or other intellectual property rights. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time consuming. In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours is not valid or is unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation or defense\nproceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing.\nInterference proceedings brought by the USPTO may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to our patents and patent applications or those of our current or future collaborators. An unfavorable outcome could require us to cease using the technology or to attempt to license rights to it from the prevailing party. Our business could be harmed if a prevailing party does not offer us a license on terms that are acceptable to us. Litigation or interference proceedings may fail and, even if successful, may result in substantial costs and distraction of our management and other employees. We may not be able to prevent, alone or with our collaborators, misappropriation of our proprietary rights, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect those rights as fully as in the United States.\nFurthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential and proprietary information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nThird-party claims of intellectual property infringement or misappropriation may adversely affect our business and could prevent us from developing or commercializing our product candidates.\nOur commercial success depends in part on us not infringing the patents and proprietary rights of third parties. There is a substantial amount of litigation, both within and outside the United States, involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including patent infringement lawsuits, interferences, oppositions, ex-parte review and inter partes reexamination and post-grant review proceedings before the USPTO and corresponding foreign patent offices. Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications owned by third parties exist in the fields in which we are developing and may develop our product candidates. As the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries expand and more patents are issued, the risk increases that our product candidates may be subject to claims of infringement of the patent rights of third parties. If a third party claims that we infringe on their products or technology, we could face a number of issues, including:\n\u00b7\ninfringement and other intellectual property claims which, with or without merit, can be expensive and time-consuming to litigate and can divert management\u2019s attention from our core business;\n\u00b7\nsubstantial damages for past infringement, which we may have to pay if a court decides that our product infringes on a competitor\u2019s patent;\n\u00b7\na court prohibiting us from selling or licensing our product unless the patent holder licenses the patent to us, which the collaborator would not be required to do;\n\u00b7\nif a license is available from a patent holder, we may have to pay substantial royalties or grant cross licenses to our patents; and\n\u00b7\nredesigning our processes so they do not infringe, which may not be possible or could require substantial funds and time.\nThird parties may assert that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization. There may be third-party patents or patent applications with claims to materials, formulations, methods of manufacture or methods for treatment related to the use or manufacture of our product candidates, that we failed to identify. For example, applications filed before November 29, 2000 and certain applications filed after that date that will not be filed outside the United States remain confidential until issued as patents. Except for the preceding exceptions, patent applications in the United States and elsewhere are generally published only after a waiting period of approximately 18 months after the earliest filing. Therefore, patent applications covering our platform technology or our product candidates could have been filed by others without our knowledge. Additionally, pending patent applications which have been published can, subject to certain limitations, be later amended in a manner that could cover our platform technologies, our product candidates or the use or manufacture of our product candidates. We may also face a claim of misappropriation if a third party believes that we inappropriately obtained and used trade secrets of such third party. If we are found to have misappropriated a third party\u2019s trade secrets, we may be prevented from further using such trade secrets, limiting our ability to develop our product candidates, and we may be required to pay damages.\nIf any third-party patents were held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover aspects of our materials, formulations, methods of manufacture or methods for treatment, the holders of any such patents would be able to block our ability to develop and commercialize the applicable product candidate until such patent expired or unless we obtain a license. These licenses may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, the rights may be nonexclusive, which could result in our competitors gaining access to the same intellectual property. Ultimately, we could be prevented from commercializing a product, or be forced to cease some aspect of our business operations, if, as a result of actual or threatened patent infringement claims, we are\nunable to enter into licenses on acceptable terms. In addition, during the course of any patent or other intellectual property litigation, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, rulings on motions, and other interim proceedings in the litigation. If securities analysts or investors regard these announcements as negative, the perceived value of our product candidates, programs, or intellectual property could be diminished. Accordingly, the market price of our common stock may decline.\nParties making claims against us may obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to further develop and commercialize one or more of our product candidates. Defending against claims of patent infringement or misappropriation of trade secrets could be costly and time-consuming, regardless of the outcome. Thus, even if we were to ultimately prevail, or to settle at an early stage, such litigation could burden us with substantial unanticipated costs. In addition, litigation or threatened litigation could result in significant demands on the time and attention of our management team, distracting them from the pursuit of other company business. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us, we may have to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees for willful infringement, pay royalties, redesign our infringing products or obtain one or more licenses from third parties, which may be impossible or require substantial time and monetary expenditure. In addition, the uncertainties associated with litigation could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our clinical trials, continue our research programs, license necessary technology from third parties, or enter into development collaborations that would help us bring our product candidates to market.\nChanges in U.S. patent law could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our product candidates.\nAs is the case with other pharmaceutical companies, our success is heavily dependent on intellectual property, particularly on obtaining and enforcing patents. Obtaining and enforcing patents in the specialty pharmaceutical industry involves both technological and legal complexity, and therefore, is costly, time-consuming and inherently uncertain. In addition, the United States has recently enacted and is currently implementing wide-ranging patent reform legislation. Further, several recent U.S. Supreme Court rulings have either narrowed the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances or weakened the rights of patent owners in certain situations. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents, once obtained.\nFor our U.S. patent applications containing a claim not entitled to priority before March 16, 2013, there is a greater level of uncertainty in the patent law. In September 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the American Invents Act, or AIA, was signed into law. The AIA includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law, including provisions that affect the way patent applications will be prosecuted, reviewed after issuance, and may also affect patent litigation. The USPTO is currently developing regulations and procedures to govern administration of the AIA, and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the AIA. It is not clear what other, if any, impact the AIA will have on the operation of our business. Moreover, the AIA and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nAn important change introduced by the AIA is that, as of March 16, 2013, the United States transitioned to a \u201cfirst-inventor-to-file\u201d system for deciding which party should be granted a patent when two or more patent applications are filed by different parties claiming the same invention. A third party that files a patent application in the USPTO after that date but before us could therefore be awarded a patent covering an invention of ours even if we had made the invention before it was made by the third party. This will require us to be cognizant going forward of the time from invention to filing of a patent application. Furthermore, our ability to obtain and maintain valid and enforceable patents depends on whether the differences between our technology and the prior art allow our technology to be patentable over the prior art. Since patent applications in the United States and most other countries are confidential for a period of time after filing, we cannot be certain that we were the first to either (a) file any patent application related to our product candidates or (b) invent any of the inventions claimed in our patents or patent applications.\nAmong some of the other changes introduced by the AIA are changes that limit where a patentee may file a patent infringement suit and providing opportunities for third parties to challenge any issued patent in the USPTO. This applies to all of our U.S. patents, even those issued before March 16, 2013. Because of a lower evidentiary standard in USPTO proceedings compared to the evidentiary standard in United States federal court necessary to invalidate a patent claim, a third party could potentially provide evidence in a USPTO proceeding sufficient for the USPTO to hold a claim invalid as unpatentable even though the same evidence may be insufficient to invalidate the claim if first presented in a district court action. Accordingly, a third party may attempt to use the USPTO procedures to invalidate our patent claims that would not have been invalidated if first challenged by the third party as a defendant in a district court action.\nDepending on decisions by the U.S. Congress, the federal courts, and the USPTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents that we might obtain in the future.\nBecause of the expense and uncertainty of litigation, we may not be in a position to enforce our intellectual property rights against third parties.\nBecause of the expense and uncertainty of litigation, we may conclude that even if a third party is infringing our patents or other intellectual property rights, the risk-adjusted cost of bringing and enforcing such a claim or action may be too high or not in the best interest of our company or our stockholders. In such cases, we may decide that the more prudent course of action is to simply monitor the situation or initiate or seek some other non-litigious action or solution.\nIntellectual property rights do not address all potential threats to our competitive advantage.\nThe degree of future protection afforded by our intellectual property rights is uncertain because intellectual property rights have limitations, and may not adequately protect our business, or permit us to maintain our competitive advantage. The following examples are illustrative:\n\u00b7\nOthers may be able to make products that are similar to our product candidates but that are not covered by the claims of the patents that we own or license from others.\n\u00b7\nOthers may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or otherwise circumvent any of our technologies without infringing our intellectual property rights.\n\u00b7\nWe or any of our collaborators might not have been the first to conceive and reduce to practice the inventions covered by the patents or patent applications that we own, license or will own or license.\n\u00b7\nWe or any of our collaborators might not have been the first to file patent applications covering certain of the patents or patent applications that we or they own or have obtained a license, or will own or will have obtained a license.\n\u00b7\nIt is possible that our pending patent applications will not lead to issued patents.\n\u00b7\nIssued patents that we own may not provide us with any competitive advantage, or may be held invalid or unenforceable, as a result of legal challenges by our competitors.\n\u00b7\nOur competitors might conduct research and development activities in countries where we do not have patent rights, or in countries where research and development safe harbor laws exist, and then use the information learned from such activities to develop competitive products for sale in our major commercial markets.\n\u00b7\nOwnership of our patents or patent applications may be challenged by third parties.\n\u00b7\nThe patents of third parties or pending or future applications of third parties, if issued, may have an adverse effect on our business.\nConfidentiality agreements with employees and others may not adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and protect other proprietary information.\nWe consider proprietary trade secrets and/or confidential know-how and unpatented know-how to be important to our business. We may rely on trade secrets and/or confidential know-how to protect our technology, especially where patent protection is believed by us to be of limited value. However, trade secrets and/or confidential know-how can be difficult to maintain as confidential.\nTo protect this type of information against disclosure or appropriation by competitors, our policy is to require our employees, consultants, contractors and advisors to enter into confidentiality agreements with us. However, current or former employees, consultants, contractors and advisers may unintentionally or willfully disclose our confidential information to competitors, and confidentiality agreements may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. Enforcing a claim that a third party obtained illegally and is using trade secrets and/or confidential know-how is expensive, time consuming and unpredictable. The enforceability of confidentiality agreements may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.\nFailure to obtain or maintain trade secrets and/or confidential know-how trade protection could adversely affect our competitive position. Moreover, our competitors may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and may even apply for patent protection in respect of the same. If successful in obtaining such patent protection, our competitors could limit our use of our trade secrets and/or confidential know-how.\nWe may need to license certain intellectual property from third parties, and such licenses may not be available or may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.\nA third party may hold intellectual property, including patent rights that are important or necessary to the development or commercialization of our product candidates. It may be necessary for us to use the patented or proprietary technology of third parties\nto commercialize our product candidates, in which case we would be required to obtain a license from these third parties. Such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all, which could materially harm our business.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees, consultants or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information of third parties.\nWe have received confidential and proprietary information from third parties. In addition, we employ individuals who were previously employed at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies. We may be subject to claims that we or our employees, consultants or independent contractors have inadvertently or otherwise improperly used or disclosed confidential information of these third parties or our employees\u2019 former employers. Further, we may be subject to ownership disputes in the future arising, for example, from conflicting obligations of consultants or others who are involved in developing our product candidates. We may also be subject to claims that former employees, consultants, independent contractors, collaborators or other third parties have an ownership interest in our patents or other intellectual property. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these and other claims challenging our right to and use of confidential and proprietary information. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose our rights therein. Such an outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial cost and be a distraction to our management and employees.\nWe may be subject to claims challenging the inventorship or ownership of our patents and other intellectual property.\nWe may also be subject to claims that former employees, collaborators or other third parties have an ownership interest in our patents or other intellectual property. We may be subject to ownership disputes in the future arising, for example, from conflicting obligations of consultants or others who are involved in developing our product candidates. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these and other claims challenging inventorship or ownership. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights, such as exclusive ownership of, or right to use, valuable intellectual property. Such an outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees.\nOur reliance on third parties requires us to share our trade secrets, which increases the possibility that a competitor will discover them or that our trade secrets will be misappropriated or disclosed.\nBecause we rely on third parties to assist with the research and develop and to manufacture our product candidates, we must, at times, share trade secrets with them. We seek to protect our proprietary technology in part by entering into confidentiality agreements and, if applicable, material transfer agreements, consulting agreements or other similar agreements with our advisors, employees, third-party contractors and consultants prior to beginning research or disclosing proprietary information. These agreements typically limit the rights of the third parties to use or disclose our confidential information, including our trade secrets. Despite the contractual provisions employed when working with third parties, the need to share trade secrets and other confidential information increases the risk that such trade secrets become known by our competitors, are inadvertently incorporated into the technology of others, or are disclosed or used in violation of these agreements. Given that our proprietary position is based, in part, on our know-how and trade secrets, a competitor\u2019s discovery of our trade secrets or other unauthorized use or disclosure would impair our competitive position and may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition, these agreements typically restrict the ability of our advisors, employees, third-party contractors and consultants to publish data potentially relating to our trade secrets, although our agreements may contain certain limited publication rights. For example, any academic institution that we may collaborate with in the future will usually expect to be granted rights to publish data arising out of such collaboration, provided that we are notified in advance and given the opportunity to delay publication for a limited time period in order for us to secure patent protection of intellectual property rights arising from the collaboration, in addition to the opportunity to remove confidential or trade secret information from any such publication. In the future we may also conduct joint research and development programs that may require us to share trade secrets under the terms of our research and development or similar agreements. Despite our efforts to protect our trade secrets, our competitors may discover our trade secrets, either through breach of our agreements with third parties, independent development or publication of information by any of our third-party collaborators. A competitor\u2019s discovery of our trade secrets would impair our competitive position and have an adverse impact on our business.\nIf our trademarks and trade names are not adequately protected, then we may not be able to build name recognition in our markets of interest and our business may be adversely affected.\nIf our trademarks and trade names are not adequately protected, than we may not be able to build name recognition in our markets of interest and our business may be adversely affected. We currently do not have any registered trademarks. Our unregistered trademarks or trade names may be challenged, infringed, circumvented or declared generic or determined to be infringing on other\nmarks. We may not be able to protect our rights to these trademarks and trade names, which we need to build name recognition among potential collaborators or customers in our markets of interest. At times, competitors may adopt trade names or trademarks similar to ours, thereby impeding our ability to build brand identity and possibly leading to market confusion. In addition, there could be potential trade name or trademark infringement claims brought by owners of other registered trademarks or trademarks that incorporate variations of our unregistered trademarks or trade names. Over the long term, if we are unable to successfully register our trademarks and trade names and establish name recognition based on our trademarks and trade names, then we may not be able to compete effectively and our business may be adversely affected. Our efforts to enforce or protect our proprietary rights related to trademarks, trade secrets, domain names, copyrights or other intellectual property may be ineffective and could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nAn active trading market for our common stock may not continue to develop or be sustained.\nSince our initial listing on The NASDAQ Global Market in May 2015, the trading market in our common stock has been limited. The listing of our common stock on The NASDAQ Global Market does not assure that a meaningful, consistent and liquid trading market currently exists. We cannot predict whether a more active market for our common stock will develop or be sustained in the future.\nOur executive officers, directors and 5% stockholders and their respective affiliates in the aggregate own a significant percentage of our outstanding shares of common stock, which may adversely affect the liquidity of the trading market for our common stock. If these stockholders continue to hold their shares of common stock, there will be limited trading volume in our common stock, which may make it more difficult for investors to sell their shares and may increase the volatility of our stock price. The absence of an active trading market could adversely affect our stockholders\u2019 ability to sell our common stock at current market prices in short time periods, or possibly at all. Additionally, market visibility for our common stock may be limited and such lack of visibility may have a depressive effect on the market price for our common stock.\nThe price of our common stock could continue to be highly volatile, which could result in substantial losses for purchasers of our common stock.\nOur stock price is likely to continue to be volatile. The stock market in general has experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. As a result of this volatility, investors may not be able to sell their common stock at or above the current market price. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including:\n\u00b7\nour ability to enroll patients in clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nresults of the clinical trials, and the results of trials of our competitors or those of other companies in our market sector, and the timing of the release of those results;\n\u00b7\nthe passage of legislation or other regulatory developments in the United States and foreign countries;\n\u00b7\nactual or anticipated variations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n\u00b7\nchanges in the structure of healthcare payment systems, especially in light of current reforms to the U.S. healthcare system;\n\u00b7\nour ability to discover and develop additional product candidates;\n\u00b7\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic collaborations, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u00b7\nour ability to enter into strategic collaborations for the development of our product candidates;\n\u00b7\nmarket conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors and issuance of securities analysts\u2019 research reports or recommendations;\n\u00b7\nsales of our stock by us, our insiders and our other stockholders;\n\u00b7\ntrading volume of our common stock;\n\u00b7\nspeculation in the press or investment community;\n\u00b7\ngeneral economic, industry and market conditions other events or factors, many of which are beyond our control;\n\u00b7\nadditions or departures of key personnel; and\n\u00b7\nintellectual property, product liability or other litigation against us.\nIn addition, the stock market has recently experienced significant volatility with respect to pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other life sciences company stocks. The volatility of pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other life sciences company stocks often does not relate to the operating performance of the companies represented by the stock. As we operate in a single industry, we are especially vulnerable to these factors to the extent that they affect our industry or our product candidates, or to a lesser extent our markets.\nWe are classified as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as well as a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies and smaller reporting companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nSection 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies.\nWe could remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion, (ii) December 31, 2020, (iii) the date that we become a \u201clarge accelerated filer\u201d as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or (iv) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three-year period.\nNotwithstanding the above, we are also currently a smaller reporting company. In the event that we are still considered a smaller reporting company, at such time we ceased being an emerging growth company, the disclosure we will be required to provide in our Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, filings will increase, but will still be less than it would be if we were not considered either an emerging growth company or a smaller reporting company. Specifically, similar to other emerging growth companies, smaller reporting companies are able to provide simplified executive compensation disclosures in their filings; are exempt from the provisions of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requiring that independent registered public accounting firms provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting; and have certain other decreased disclosure obligations in their SEC filings. Decreased disclosures in our SEC filings due to our status as an emerging growth company or a smaller reporting company may make it harder for investors to analyze our results of operations and financial prospects.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock by our existing stockholders in the public market could cause our stock price to fall.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that these sales might occur, could significantly reduce the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise adequate capital through the sale of additional equity securities.\nAs of February 23, 2016, approximately 44% of our outstanding shares are held by directors, executive officers and other affiliates. Although these shares are subject to volume limitations under Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, if these shares of common stock are sold, or if it is perceived that they will be sold, in the public market, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nAs of March 23, 2016, the holders of 9,638,989 shares of our outstanding common stock, or approximately 63% of our total outstanding common stock, are entitled to rights with respect to the registration of their shares under the Securities Act. Registration of these shares under the Securities Act would result in the shares becoming freely tradable without restriction under the Securities Act, except for shares held by affiliates, as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act. Any sales of securities by these stockholders could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nOur operating results may fluctuate significantly.\nWe expect our operating results to be subject to fluctuations due to the unpredictability of our expenses. Our net loss and other operating results will be affected by numerous factors, including:\n\u00b7\nvariations in the level of expenses related to our clinical trials and development programs;\n\u00b7\naddition or termination of clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nregulatory developments affecting our current or future product candidates;\n\u00b7\nour execution of any collaborative, licensing or similar arrangements and the timing of payments we may make or receive under these arrangements; and\n\u00b7\nnature and terms of stock-based compensation grants and any intellectual property infringement lawsuit in which we may become involved.\nFluctuations in our operating results may cause the price of our stock to fluctuate substantially.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock, and, consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation, if any, in the price of our common stock.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividend on our common stock and do not currently intend to do so for the foreseeable future. We currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development, operation and expansion of our business. In addition, any future debt financing arrangement may contain terms prohibiting or limiting the amount of dividends that may be declared or paid on our common stock. Any return to stockholders will therefore be limited to the appreciation of their stock. Therefore, the success of an investment in shares of our common stock will depend upon any future appreciation in their value. There is no guarantee that shares of our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which our stockholders have purchased their shares.\nWe have and will continue to incur significant increased costs as a result of operating as a public company.\nAs a public company, and particularly after we are no longer an emerging growth company, we have and will incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as rules subsequently adopted by the SEC, and the NASDAQ stock market to implement provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, imposes significant requirements on public companies, including requiring establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and changes in corporate governance practices. Further, pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, the SEC has adopted additional rules and regulations in these areas, such as mandatory \u201csay on pay\u201d voting requirements that will apply to us when we cease to be an emerging growth company. Stockholder activism, the current political environment and the current high level of government intervention and regulatory reform may lead to substantial new regulations and disclosure obligations, which may lead to additional compliance costs and may impact the manner in which we operate our business in ways we cannot currently anticipate.\nWe continue to evaluate the rules and regulations applicable to public companies and cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs. These rules and regulations are often subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices.\nIf we fail to maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting in the future, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired, which could harm our operating results, investors\u2019 views of us and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nPursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our management is required to report upon the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting beginning with this Annual Report on Form 10-K. When and if we are a \u201clarge accelerated filer\u201d or an \u201caccelerated filer\u201d and are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d each as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, our independent registered public accounting firm will be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. However, for so long as we remain an emerging growth company, we intend to take advantage of an exemption available to emerging growth companies from these auditor attestation requirements. The rules governing the standards that must be met for management to assess our internal control over financial reporting are complex and require significant documentation, testing, and possible remediation.\nAny failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. In addition, any testing by us conducted in connection with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or any subsequent testing by our independent registered public accounting firm, may reveal deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses or that may require prospective or retroactive changes to our financial statements or identify other areas for further attention or improvement. Inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nIn addition, we may encounter problems or delays in implementing any changes necessary to make a favorable assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. Further, once we are no longer an emerging growth company, we may encounter problems or delays in completing the implementation of any requested improvements and receiving a favorable attestation in connection with the attestation provided by our independent registered public accounting firm. If we cannot favorably assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to provide an unqualified attestation report on our internal controls, investors could lose confidence in our financial information and the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, may delay or prevent an acquisition of us or a change in our management. These provisions include:\n\u00b7\nauthorizing the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval;\n\u00b7\nlimiting the removal of directors by the stockholders;\n\u00b7\ncreating a staggered board of directors;\n\u00b7\nprohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors, which would otherwise allow for less than a plurality of stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\u00b7\nprohibiting stockholder action by written consent, thereby requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;\n\u00b7\neliminating the ability of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders;\n\u00b7\nestablishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at stockholder meetings; and\n\u00b7\nrequiring that any amendment or repeal of our amended and restated bylaws by our stockholders be approved by a vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the votes that all our stockholders would be entitled to cast in an election of directors.\nThese provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, who are responsible for appointing the members of our management. In addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which limits the ability of stockholders owning in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock to merge or combine with us. These provisions would apply even if an offer rejected by our board were considered beneficial by some stockholders. Any provision of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change of control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.\nOur executive officers, directors and principal stockholders, if they choose to act together, have the ability to control all matters submitted to stockholders for approval.\nOur executive officers, directors and stockholders who own more than 5% of our outstanding common stock in the aggregate, beneficially own shares representing approximately 77% of our outstanding capital stock. As a result, if these stockholders were to act together, they would be able to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, as well as our management and affairs. For example, these persons, if they act together, would control the election of directors and approval of any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. This concentration of voting power could delay or prevent an acquisition of our company on terms that other stockholders may desire or result in management of our company that our public stockholders disagree with.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research, about our business, the price of our common stock and our trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock is influenced in part by the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our common stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the price of our common stock would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our common stock could decrease, which might cause the price of our shares and trading volume to decline.\nClaims for indemnification by our directors and officers may reduce our available funds to satisfy successful third-party claims against us and may reduce the amount of money available to us.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws provide that we will indemnify our directors and officers, in each case to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law.\nIn addition, as permitted by Section 145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our amended and restated bylaws, indemnification agreements that we have entered into with our directors and executive officers provide that:\n\u00b7\nWe will indemnify our directors and officers for serving us in those capacities or for serving other business enterprises at our request, to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. Delaware law provides that a corporation may indemnify such person if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the registrant and, with respect to any criminal proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe such person\u2019s conduct was unlawful.\n\u00b7\nWe may, in our discretion, indemnify employees and agents in those circumstances where indemnification is permitted by applicable law.\n\u00b7\nWe are required to advance expenses, as incurred, to our directors and officers in connection with defending a proceeding, except that such directors or officers shall undertake to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification.\n\u00b7\nWe will not be obligated pursuant to our amended and restated bylaws to indemnify a person with respect to proceedings initiated by that person against us or our other indemnitees, except with respect to proceedings authorized by our board of directors or brought to enforce a right to indemnification.\n\u00b7\nThe rights conferred in our amended and restated bylaws are not exclusive, and we are authorized to enter into indemnification agreements with our directors, officers, employees and agents and to obtain insurance to indemnify such persons.\n\u00b7\nNo repeal or modification of the indemnification provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws will diminish or adversely affect the rights of any director, officer, employee or agent under those provisions in respect of any occurrence or matter arising prior to any such repeal or modification.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the state or federal courts located in the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, subject to certain exceptions, the state and federal courts located in the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for any or all intracorporate claims, which shall include claims, including claims in the right of the company, (i) that are based upon a violation of a duty by a current or former director or officer or stockholder in such capacity, or (ii) as to which Title 8 of the Delaware General Corporation Law confers jurisdiction upon the Delaware Court of Chancery. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.", "PERMNO": 15370, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "CLCD"}
