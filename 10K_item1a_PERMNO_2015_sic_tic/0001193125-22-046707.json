{"cik": "860730", "company": "HCA Healthcare, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-18", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIf any of the events discussed in the following risk factors were to occur, our business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows or prospects could be materially, adversely affected. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect us. The COVID-19\npandemic amplifies and exacerbates many of the risks we face in our business operations, including those discussed below. Our business is subject to the following material risks and uncertainties.\nRisks related to the COVID-19\npandemic and other potential pandemics:\nThe COVID-19 pandemic\nis significantly affecting our operations and could affect our business and financial condition. Our liquidity could also be negatively impacted by the COVID-19\npandemic, particularly if the U.S. economy remains unstable for a significant amount of time.\nHHS first declared a PHE due to the COVID-19\npandemic in January 2020 and has since then continuously renewed this declaration. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization designated COVID-19\nas a global pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic\ncontinues to significantly affect our employees, patients, hospitals, communities and business operations, as well as the U.S. economy and financial markets. Although certain economic conditions improved throughout 2021, the pandemic continues to evolve. For example, the spread of differing variants of COVID-19\nled to the reintroduction of certain public health controls during the second half of 2021. The full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic\nwill impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity will depend on future developments that are uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted. We are unable to predict the severity or duration of the pandemic, including whether there will be additional periods of increases in the number of COVID-19\ncases in areas in which we operate, the availability, utilization and effectiveness of medical treatments and vaccines (including booster shots), the efficacy of public health controls, or the impact of any mutations of the virus. Florida and Texas, our two largest markets, have been and may in the future be \u201chot spots\u201d of the COVID-19\npandemic. We are particularly sensitive to the increase in COVID-19\ncases in Texas and Florida, where the pandemic could have a disproportionate effect on our business.\nWe have been working with federal, state and local health authorities to respond to COVID-19 cases\nin the markets we serve and continue to take and support measures to try to limit the spread of the virus and to mitigate the burden on the health care system. For example, we are subject to COVID-19\ndata reporting requirements, and some states are requiring hospitals to maintain a reserve of PPE and mandating COVID-19\nscreening for new patients and certain hospital staff. CMS has made COVID-19\ndata reporting requirements a Medicare condition of participation for hospitals, such that noncompliance with these requirements could result in termination from the Medicare program. We have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs related to protecting the health and well-being and meeting the needs of our patients, employees, medical staff members and contractors, including pandemic pay programs, hoteling our staff and additional scrub laundering. We expect to continue to incur additional costs, which may be significant, as we continue to implement operational changes in response to this pandemic. Further, our management is focused on mitigating the impact of the COVID-19\npandemic, which has required and will continue to require a substantial investment of time and resources across our enterprise, and which may affect management focus and impact our ability to properly prioritize and successfully execute on the Company\u2019s other strategic initiatives.\nAs a front line provider of health care services, we have been and will continue to be impacted by the health and economic effects of COVID-19.\nAlthough we have implemented considerable safety measures, treatment of COVID-19 patients\nhas associated risks to our employees, patients and physicians. These risks, and how clinical staff perceive and respond to them, may adversely affect our operating capacity. Despite considerable efforts to source vital supplies, we have experienced and may continue to experience supply chain disruptions, including delays and price increases in equipment, pharmaceuticals and medical supplies, and supply shortages. Our current PPE inventory is satisfactory, but we cannot be certain that our supplies will remain sufficient in the future. In addition, restrictive measures taken by governmental authorities to address the COVID-19\npandemic have impacted, and may continue to impact, the availability of employed and contract labor staffing for corporate support services, including, but not limited to, coding, billing, collection and other business office functions, which could adversely affect our execution of established control procedures that may not be sufficiently mitigated through execution of our business continuity plans. Continued staffing, equipment, laboratory resources and pharmaceutical and medical supplies shortages may impact our ability to schedule, admit and treat patients. In addition, the impact of labor shortages across the health care industry may result in other health care facilities, such as nursing homes, limiting admissions, which may constrain our ability to discharge patients to\nsuch facilities and further exacerbate the demand on our resources, supplies and staffing. The COVID-19\npandemic has also resulted in an increased number of early retirements in our workforce. The combined impact of these factors, despite our efforts to mitigate their effect, could result in reduced employee morale and increased exposure to labor unrest, work stoppages or other workforce disruptions, which effects may last beyond the duration of the pandemic.\nActions taken by governmental authorities in response to the COVID-19\npandemic, including restrictions on elective procedures, and other restrictive measures, have reduced, and may in the future reduce, the volume of procedures performed at our facilities, as well as the volume of emergency room and physician office visits unrelated to COVID-19.\nWe may be required to cancel elective procedures and close or reduce operating hours at our facilities in the future. Some state and local governments have issued orders or imposed rules affecting hospital capacity in order to prepare for and manage surges in COVID-19\npatients. Although social contact restrictions have eased across the U.S. and most states have lifted moratoriums on non-emergent\nprocedures, some restrictions remain in place. Further closings and restrictions on hours and services may be imposed or re-imposed\nfor an unpredictable amount of time in connection with increasing or fluctuating COVID-19\ncases. We have also selectively suspended elective procedures at certain facilities based upon local COVID-19\nvolume trends, bed capacity and staffing levels. It is unclear whether certain markets, such as Florida and Texas, will continue to experience periods of increases or spikes in the number of COVID-19\ncases. Beginning in 2020 and continuing through 2021, we experienced increased patient acuity as a result of COVID-19\ncases at our hospitals, which led to increased reimbursements. However, the impacts of COVID-19,\nincluding patient acuity levels, in future periods may vary, and could exert unpredictable and potentially negative effects on clinical performance metrics that impact reimbursement levels and could adversely affect our results of operations.\nEven as government or industry-adopted restrictions are lifted, some individuals may choose to postpone medical care (including long-term care) for an undetermined period of time. While patient volumes began rebounding in the second quarter of 2021 as the effects of the pandemic moderated and pandemic-related restrictions and policies were eased, we experienced a resurgence in COVID-19 cases in the latter half of 2021, further impacting the return to pre-pandemic levels. As such, we cannot provide assurances as to the continued recovery and stability of pre-pandemic\npatient volumes or the ultimate impact on demand. Further, our patient volumes may be adversely impacted by the expanded use of telehealth services from other providers as a result of reduced regulatory barriers on the use and reimbursement of telehealth services and individuals becoming more comfortable with receiving remote care. The Company may not be able to timely innovate its strategies and technologies to meet changing consumer demands as a result of the COVID-19\npandemic. It is possible that the COVID-19\npandemic could impact patient behavior beyond the duration of the pandemic.\nBroad economic factors resulting from the current COVID-19 pandemic,\nincluding inflationary pressures, supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, increased unemployment and underemployment rates and reduced consumer spending and confidence, also affect our service mix, revenue mix, payer mix and patient volumes, as well as our ability to collect outstanding receivables. Business closings and layoffs in the areas where we operate may lead to increases in the uninsured and underinsured populations and adversely affect demand for our services, as well as the ability of patients and other payers to pay for services rendered. Any increase in the amount or deterioration in the collectability of patient accounts receivable will adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations, requiring an increased level of working capital. In addition, our results and financial condition may be adversely affected by federal, state or local laws, regulations, orders, or other governmental or regulatory actions addressing the current COVID-19 pandemic\nor otherwise affecting the U.S. health care system in connection with the pandemic, which could result in direct or indirect restrictions to our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. We may also be subject to claims from patients, employees and others exposed to COVID-19 at\nour facilities. Such actions may involve large demands, as well as substantial defense costs, though there is no certainty at this time whether any such claims will be filed or the outcome of such claims if filed. Our professional and general liability insurance, a portion of which is provided through our insurance subsidiary, may not cover all claims against us.\nIf general economic conditions, including inflation, deteriorate or remain volatile or uncertain for an extended period of time, our liquidity and ability to repay our outstanding debt may be harmed and the trading price of our common stock could decline. These factors may affect the availability, terms or timing on which we may obtain any additional funding and our ability to access our cash. There can be no assurance that we will be able to raise additional funds on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nThe foregoing and other continued disruptions to our business as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic\ncould heighten the risks in certain of the other risk factors described in this annual report on Form 10-K,\nany of which could have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.\nWe are unable to predict the ultimate impact of the CARES Act and other existing or future stimulus and relief legislation, if any, or the effect that such legislation and other governmental responses intended to assist providers in responding to COVID-19\nmay have on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. There can be no assurance as to the total amount of financial assistance or types of assistance we will receive, that we will be able to comply with the applicable terms and conditions to retain such assistance, or that we will be able to benefit from provisions intended to increase access to resources and ease regulatory burdens for health care providers.\nIn response to the COVID-19\npandemic, federal and state governments have passed legislation, promulgated regulations and taken other administrative actions intended to assist health care providers in providing care to COVID-19\nand other patients and to provide financial relief to health care providers. Together, the CARES Act, the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement (\u201cPPPHCE\u201d) Act, the CAA, and the ARPA authorize over $186 billion in funding to be distributed to hospitals and other health care providers through the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund (\u201cPHSSEF\u201d), also known as the Provider Relief Fund. These funds are intended to reimburse eligible providers and suppliers for health care-related expenses or lost revenues attributable to the COVID-19\npandemic. HHS made some general distributions of provider relief funding to Medicare providers impacted by COVID-19,\nand also made targeted distributions to specific provider types and industry segments, including providers in areas particularly impacted by COVID-19,\nrural providers, providers of services with lower shares of Medicare reimbursement or who predominantly serve the Medicaid population and providers requesting reimbursement for treatment of uninsured Americans, among others. A portion of the available funding is being distributed to reimburse health care providers that submit claims requests for COVID-19-related treatment,\ntesting, and vaccine administration for uninsured patients at Medicare rates. Recipients of these claims reimbursements must attest to and comply with certain terms and conditions, including confirming that patients are uninsured, limitations on balance billings and not using funds to reimburse expenses or losses that other sources are obligated to reimburse.\nThe CARES Act and related legislation also make other forms of financial assistance available to health care providers. For example, CMS has increased payment under the hospital inpatient PPS by 20% for discharges of individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 and provides an add-on payment for eligible inpatient cases that use certain new products to treat COVID-19. The CARES Act also expanded the Medicare Accelerated and Advance Payment Program, which makes available advance payments of Medicare funds in order to increase cash flow to providers.\nDuring 2020, we received approximately $4.4 billion of accelerated Medicare payments and approximately $1.8 billion in general and targeted distributions from the Provider Relief Fund. During October 2020,\nwe announced our decision to return, or repay early, all of our share of the Provider Relief Fund general and targeted distributions and all of the Medicare accelerated payments. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we returned, or repaid early, approximately $6.1 billion of these funds.\nThe CARES Act and related legislation suspended the Medicare sequestration payment adjustment from May 1, 2020, through December 31, 2021, which would have otherwise reduced payments to Medicare providers by 2% as required by the BCA, but extended sequestration through 2030. Congress further delayed these sequestration cuts through March 31, 2022, and reduced the sequestration adjustment to 1% from April 1 through\nJune 30, 2022, but increased the reductions set for 2030. The APRA, in addition to providing funding for health care providers, increases the federal budget deficit in a manner that triggers an additional statutorily mandated sequestration under the PAYGO Act. As a result, an additional Medicare payment reduction of up to 4% was required to take effect in January 2022. However, Congress has delayed implementation of this payment reduction until 2023.\nBeyond financial assistance, federal and state governments have enacted legislation, established regulations and issued waivers intended to expand access to and payment for telehealth services, increase access to medical supplies and equipment, prioritize review of drug applications to help with shortages of emergency drugs, and ease various legal and regulatory burdens on health care providers. HHS and CMS have announced other flexibilities for health care providers in response to COVID-19,\nsuch as relief from data submission requirements and measure suppression policies for providers participating in certain quality reporting programs. It is unclear how changes to these and other value-based programs will affect our financial condition.\nThere is still a high degree of uncertainty surrounding the ongoing impact of the CARES Act and related legislation passed and other efforts taken in response to the COVID-19\npandemic, and the pandemic continues to evolve. Some of the measures allowing for flexibility in delivery of care and various financial supports for health care providers are available only until funds expire or for the duration of the PHE, and it is unclear whether or for how long the PHE declaration will be extended. The current PHE determination expires April 16, 2022. The HHS Secretary may choose to renew the PHE declaration for successive 90-day\nperiods for as long as the emergency continues to exist and may terminate the declaration whenever he determines that the PHE no longer exists. The federal government may consider additional stimulus and relief efforts, but we are unable to predict whether additional measures will be enacted or their impact. There can be no assurance as to the total amount of financial and other types of assistance we will receive under the CARES Act, PPPHCE Act, the CAA or future legislation, if any, or whether we shall retain, return or repay any future assistance, and it is difficult to predict the impact of such legislation on our operations. Further, there can be no assurance that the terms and conditions of provider relief funding or other relief programs will not change or be interpreted in ways that affect our ability to comply with such terms and conditions in the future (which could affect our ability or willingness to retain assistance), the amount of total stimulus funding we may receive or our eligibility to participate in such stimulus funding. For time periods prior to returning Provider Relief Funds, with respect to future assistance, if any, we do not return, and in those cases where our partners retain such assistance, we will continue to monitor our compliance with the terms and conditions of the Provider Relief Fund, including demonstrating that the distributions received have been used for health care-related expenses or lost revenue attributable to COVID-19.\nIf we are unable to attest to or comply with current or future terms and conditions with respect to any assistance not voluntarily returned for our less-than-wholly owned partnerships, our ability to retain some or all of the distributions received may be impacted. We will continue to assess the potential impact of COVID-19 and\ngovernment responses to the pandemic on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe emergence and effects related to a potential future pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease could adversely affect our operations.\nIf a pandemic, epidemic, outbreak of an infectious disease or other public health crisis were to occur in an area in which we operate, our operations could be adversely affected. Such a crisis could diminish the public trust in health care facilities, especially hospitals that fail to accurately or timely diagnose, or are treating (or have treated) patients affected by infectious diseases. If any of our facilities were involved, or perceived as being involved, in treating patients from such an infectious disease, patients might cancel elective procedures or fail to seek needed care at our facilities, and our reputation may be negatively affected. Patient volumes may decline or volumes of uninsured and underinsured patients may increase, depending on the economic circumstances surrounding the pandemic, epidemic or outbreak. Further, a pandemic, epidemic or outbreak might adversely affect our operations by causing a temporary shutdown or diversion of patients, disrupting or delaying production and delivery of materials and products in the supply chain or causing staffing shortages in our facilities. We have disaster plans in place and operate pursuant to infectious disease protocols, but the potential emergence of a pandemic, epidemic or outbreak, as well as the public\u2019s and the government\u2019s response to the pandemic, epidemic or outbreak, is difficult to predict and could adversely affect our operations.\nRisks related to our indebtedness:\nOur substantial leverage could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, expose us to interest rate risk to the extent of our variable rate debt and prevent us from meeting our obligations.\nWe are highly leveraged. As of December 31, 2021, our total indebtedness was $34.579 billion. As of December 31, 2021, we had availability of $1.920 billion under our senior secured cash flow credit facility and $1.720 billion under our senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility, after giving effect to letters of credit and borrowing base limitations. Our high degree of leverage could have important consequences, some of which may be exacerbated by the impact of the COVID-19\npandemic, including:\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to downturns or adverse changes in general economic, industry or competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulations;\n\u2022\nrequiring a substantial portion of cash flows from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, therefore reducing our ability to use our cash flows to fund our operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities;\n\u2022\nexposing us to the risk of increased interest rates to the extent that our existing unhedged borrowings are at variable rates of interest or we seek to refinance our debt in a rising rate environment;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to make strategic acquisitions or causing us to make nonstrategic divestitures;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, share repurchases, dividends, product or service line development, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes; and\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who are less highly leveraged.\nWe and our subsidiaries have the ability to incur additional indebtedness in the future, subject to the restrictions contained in our senior secured credit facilities and the indentures governing our outstanding notes. If new indebtedness is added to our current debt levels, interest rates and the related risks that we now face could intensify.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may not be able to refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms. If we are unable to do so, we may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions, including the impact of the COVID-19\npandemic, and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We cannot assure you we will maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness.\nIn addition, we conduct our operations through our subsidiaries. Accordingly, repayment of our indebtedness is dependent on the generation of cash flows by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us by dividend, debt repayment or otherwise. Our subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness. Each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity, and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries.\nWe may find it necessary or prudent to refinance our outstanding indebtedness, the terms of which may not be favorable to us. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms, or at all, is directly affected by the then current global economic and financial conditions which affect the availability of debt financing and the\nrates at which such financing is available. In addition, our ability to incur secured indebtedness (which would generally enable us to achieve better pricing than the incurrence of unsecured indebtedness) depends in part on the value of our assets, which depends, in turn, on the strength of our cash flows and results of operations, and on economic and market conditions and other factors.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations or we are unable to refinance our indebtedness, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure our indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. If our operating results and available cash are insufficient to meet our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions, or the proceeds from the dispositions may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due.\nOur debt agreements contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business.\nOur senior secured credit facilities and, to a lesser extent, the indentures governing our outstanding notes contain various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. These covenants limit our and certain of our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred shares;\n\u2022\npay dividends on, repurchase or make distributions in respect of our capital stock or make other restricted payments;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments;\n\u2022\nsell or transfer assets;\n\u2022\ncreate liens;\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets; and\n\u2022\nenter into certain transactions with our affiliates.\nUnder our asset-based revolving credit facility, borrowing availability is subject to a borrowing base of 85% of eligible accounts receivable less customary reserves, with any reduction in the borrowing base commensurately reducing our ability to access this facility as a source of liquidity. In addition, under the asset-based revolving credit facility, when (and for as long as) the combined availability under our asset-based revolving credit facility and the revolving facility under our senior secured cash flow credit facility is less than a specified amount for a certain period of time or, if a payment or bankruptcy event of default has occurred and is continuing, funds deposited into any of our depository accounts will be transferred on a daily basis into a blocked account with the administrative agent and applied to prepay loans under the asset-based revolving credit facility and to collateralize letters of credit issued thereunder.\nUnder our senior secured credit facilities, we are required to satisfy and maintain specified financial ratios. Our ability to meet those financial ratios may be affected by events beyond our control, and there can be no assurance we will continue to meet those ratios. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under both the cash flow credit facility and the asset-based revolving credit facility. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under these senior secured credit facilities, the lenders thereunder could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the senior secured credit facilities to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit, which would also result in an event of default under a significant portion of our other outstanding indebtedness. If we were unable to repay those amounts, the lenders under the senior secured credit facilities could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure such indebtedness. We have pledged a significant portion of our assets under our senior secured credit facilities and that collateral is\nalso pledged as collateral under our first lien notes. If any of the lenders under the senior secured credit facilities accelerate the repayment of borrowings, there can be no assurance there will be sufficient assets to repay the senior secured credit facilities, the first lien notes and our other indebtedness.\nDiscontinuation, reform or replacement of LIBOR may adversely affect our borrowing costs.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $4.740 billion of borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities that bore interest at a floating rate based on LIBOR and $3.640 billion of unfunded commitments under those facilities. The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced in 2017 that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021 and will not compel panel banks to continue to contribute to LIBOR after the end of 2021. However, the ICE Benchmark Administration, in its capacity as administrator of LIBOR, has published a consultation regarding its intention to continue publication of certain LIBOR tenors and subsequently confirmed it expects to cease publication of all remaining LIBOR tenors in June 2023. However, the Federal Reserve Board, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation have encouraged banks to cease entering into new contracts that use U.S. dollar LIBOR as a reference rate no later than December 31, 2021. The Federal Reserve Board, together with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, has chosen the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) as the recommended risk-free reference rate. At this time, it is not possible to predict the effect any discontinuance, modification or other reforms to LIBOR, or the establishment of alternative reference rates such as SOFR, or any other reference rate, will have on us or our borrowing costs.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we also had a $500 million interest rate swap agreement based on LIBOR that is scheduled to expire on December 30, 2022. If LIBOR becomes unavailable, it is unclear how payments under this agreement would be calculated. The International Swaps and Derivatives Association has published a standard protocol addressing the expected discontinuation of LIBOR, but there can be no assurance that such a protocol will be implemented with respect to our swap agreements.\nRisks related to human capital:\nOur operations may be adversely affected by competition for staffing, the shortage of experienced nurses and other health care professionals, vaccine mandates and labor union activity.\nOur operations are dependent on the efforts, abilities and experience of our management and medical support personnel, such as nurses, pharmacists and lab technicians, as well as our physicians. We compete with other health care providers in recruiting and retaining qualified management and personnel responsible for the daily operations of each of our hospitals, including nurses and other nonphysician health care professionals. In some markets, the availability of nurses and other medical support personnel has been a significant operating issue to health care providers, including at certain of our facilities. The COVID-19\npandemic has exacerbated workforce competition and shortages, and may continue to exacerbate workforce competition and shortages beyond the duration of the pandemic. We may be required to continue to enhance wages and benefits to recruit and retain nurses and other medical support personnel or to hire more expensive temporary or contract personnel. As a result, our labor costs could continue to increase and/or our capacity could be negatively impacted. We also depend on the available labor pool of semi-skilled and unskilled employees in each of the markets in which we operate. If there is continued competition for these employees or additional union organizing activity or a significant portion of our employee base unionizes, it is possible our labor costs could increase. When negotiating collective bargaining agreements with unions, whether such agreements are renewals or first contracts, there is the possibility that strikes could occur during the negotiation process, and our continued operation during any strikes could increase our labor costs.\nIn addition, federal and state laws and regulations may increase our costs of maintaining qualified nurses and other medical support personnel. We operate in several states that have adopted mandatory nurse-staffing ratios. If these states reduce mandatory nurse-staffing ratios or additional states in which we operate adopt mandatory nurse-staffing ratios, such changes could significantly affect labor costs and have an adverse impact\non revenues if we are required to limit admissions in order to meet the required ratios. If our labor costs continue to increase, we may not be able to offset these increased costs as a significant percentage of our revenues consists of fixed, prospective payments.\nAdditionally, on November 5, 2021, CMS and the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\u201cOSHA\u201d) published regulations and standards setting forth vaccination requirements for certain U.S. employees. CMS issued a health and safety regulation (\u201cCMS Mandate\u201d) requiring certain covered facilities (including hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers, home health agencies, hospices, providers of outpatient physical therapy and long-term care facilities, in each case, that are Medicare and Medicaid-certified providers) to ensure all staff who work in the covered facility and who provide care, treatment or other services for the facility and/or its patients are fully vaccinated against COVID-19. The CMS Mandate does not provide a testing option for covered staff. OSHA issued an Emergency Temporary Standard (\u201cETS\u201d) mandating that employers with 100 or more employees design, implement, and enforce a mandatory COVID-19 vaccination policy or adopt a policy requiring employees to either receive a COVID-19 vaccination or undergo regular COVID-19 testing and wear a face covering at work. Both the OSHA ETS and the CMS Mandate were the subject of multiple legal challenges and injunction proceedings regarding whether the agencies exceeded their authority in implementing these regulations and standards, with the U.S. Supreme Court ultimately determining whether the ETS and/or CMS Mandate should be stayed pending resolution. On January 13, 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court lifted two injunctions previously staying the CMS Mandate in 24 states. The impact of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision renders the CMS Mandate applicable on a nationwide basis pending further litigation on CMS\u2019s authority. While CMS has extended the compliance deadlines for some states to mid-March 2022, the application of the CMS Mandate could adversely impact the availability of staff to provide services at covered facilities the Company owns, manages or operates. On January 13, 2022, the Supreme Court issued a nationwide injunction staying the implementation of the ETS pending further decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit regarding whether OSHA\u2019s ETS exceeds Congressional authority. In response, on January 25, 2022, OSHA announced its withdrawal of the ETS. Additional vaccine and testing mandates may also be announced by state-run OSHA programs or state and local officials in jurisdictions in which we operate our business and which could adversely impact the availability of staff to provide services at covered facilities the Company owns, manages or operates. The unavailability of such staff, or the inability of the Company to control labor costs, could have a material, adverse effect on our capacity, growth prospects and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to attract, hire, and retain a highly qualified and diverse workforce, including key management.\nThe talents and efforts of our employees, particularly our key management, are vital to our success. Our management team has significant industry experience and would be difficult to replace. In addition, institutional knowledge may be lost in any potential managerial transition. We may be unable to retain them or to attract other highly qualified employees, particularly if we do not offer employment terms that are competitive with the rest of the labor market. Our management is focused on mitigating the impact of the COVID-19\npandemic, which has required and will continue to require a substantial investment of time and resources across our enterprise. Failure to attract, hire, develop, motivate, and retain highly qualified and diverse employee talent, or failure to develop and implement an adequate succession plan for the management team, could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business and our future success.\nOur performance depends on our ability to recruit and retain quality physicians.\nThe success of our hospitals depends in part on the number and quality of the physicians on the medical staffs of our hospitals, the admitting and utilization practices of those physicians, maintaining good relations with those physicians and controlling costs related to the employment of physicians. Although we employ some physicians, physicians are often not employees of the hospitals at which they practice, and, in many of the markets we serve, most physicians have admitting privileges at other hospitals in addition to our hospitals. We continue to face increasing competition to recruit and retain quality physicians. Such physicians may terminate\ntheir affiliation with our hospitals at any time. We anticipate facing increased challenges in this area as the physician population reaches retirement age, especially if there is a shortage of physicians willing and able to provide comparable services. If we are unable to recruit and retain quality physicians to affiliate with our hospitals, our admissions may decrease, our operating performance may decline, and our capacity and growth prospects may be materially adversely affected. If we are unable to provide adequate support personnel or technologically advanced equipment and hospital facilities that meet the needs of those physicians and their patients, they may be discouraged from referring patients to our facilities, admissions may decrease and our operating performance may decline.\nRisks related to technology, data privacy and cybersecurity:\nA cybersecurity incident could result in the compromise of our facilities, confidential data or critical data systems. A cybersecurity incident could also give rise to potential harm to patients; remediation and other expenses; and exposure to liability under HIPAA, consumer protection laws, common law theories or other laws. Such incidents could subject us to litigation and foreign, federal and state governmental inquiries, damage our reputation, and otherwise be disruptive to our business.\nWe, directly and through our vendors and other third parties, collect and store on our networks and devices and third-party technology platforms sensitive information, including intellectual property, proprietary business information and personally identifiable information of our patients and employees. We have made significant investments in technology to adopt and meaningfully use EHR and in the use of medical devices that store sensitive data and are integral to the provision of patient care and to protect our systems, software, equipment, devices, and data from cybersecurity risks. In addition, medical devices manufactured by third parties that are used within our facilities are increasingly connected to the internet, hospital networks and other medical devices. The secure maintenance of this information and technology is critical to our business operations. We have implemented multiple layers of security measures to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of this data and the systems and devices that store and transmit such data. We embed security measures into software and system development processes, utilize current security technologies, and our defenses are monitored and routinely tested internally and by external parties. We vet the security and integrity of third-party technology platforms hosting infrastructure, applications, and data supporting our operations, and set contractual terms holding them to our security standards.\nDespite these efforts, threats from malicious persons and groups, new vulnerabilities and advanced new attacks against information systems and devices against us or our vendors and other third parties create risk of cybersecurity incidents, including ransomware, malware and phishing incidents. We have seen, and believe we will continue to see, widely spread vulnerabilities, such as the Apache Log4j 2 vulnerability reported in December 2021, which could affect our or other parties\u2019 systems. Mitigation and remediation recommendations continue to evolve, and addressing this and other critical vulnerabilities is a priority for us. The volume and intensity of cyberattacks on hospitals and health systems continues to increase. We are regularly the target of attempted cybersecurity and other threats that could have a security impact, including those by third parties to access, misappropriate or manipulate our information or disrupt our operations, and we expect to continue to experience an increase in cybersecurity threats in the future. Moreover, hardware, software or applications we use may have inherent vulnerabilities or defects of design, manufacture or operations or could be inadvertently or intentionally implemented or used in a manner that could compromise information security. There can be no assurance that we or our vendors and other third parties will not be subject to cybersecurity threats and incidents that bypass our or their security measures, impact the integrity, availability or privacy of personal health information or other data subject to privacy laws or disrupt our or their information systems, devices or business, including our ability to provide various health care services. Further, consumer confidence in the integrity and security of personal information and critical operations data in the health care industry generally could be shaken to the extent there are successful cyberattacks at other health care services companies, which could have a material, adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations.\nAs a result, cybersecurity, privacy, physical security and the continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes and practices designed to protect our facilities, information systems and data from attack,\ndamage or unauthorized access remain a priority for us. Our Audit and Compliance Committee includes the topic of cybersecurity risk and information security as one of its standing agenda items, and is frequently updated on management\u2019s ongoing actions to monitor, identify, assess and mitigate significant cybersecurity matters. Committee meetings regularly include a report from our Chief Security Officer to provide an update on (i) activities within our internal cybersecurity defense center to monitor and respond to both internal and third-party cyber events, (ii) ongoing threats that are being monitored and (iii) the current threat level assessment for the Company. As cyber threats continue to evolve, along with their increased volume and sophistication, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any cybersecurity vulnerabilities or incidents. Although to date no cyberattack or other information or security breach, whether experienced by us or a third party, has resulted in material losses or other material consequences to us, there can be no assurance that our controls and procedures in place to monitor and mitigate the risks of cyber threats, including the remediation of critical information security and software vulnerabilities, will be sufficient and/or timely and that we will not suffer material losses or consequences in the future. Additionally, while we have in place insurance coverage designed to address certain aspects of cyber risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise. The occurrence of any of these events could result in (i) harm to patients; (ii) business interruptions and delays; (iii) the loss, misappropriation, corruption or unauthorized access of data; (iv) litigation and potential liability under privacy, security, breach notification and consumer protection laws, common law theories or other applicable laws; (v) reputational damage; and (vi) foreign, federal and state governmental inquiries, any of which could have a material, adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations and harm our business reputation.\nOur operations could be impaired by a failure of our information systems.\nThe performance of our information systems is critical to our business operations. In addition to our shared services initiatives, our information systems are essential to a number of critical areas of our operations, including:\n\u2022\naccounting and financial reporting;\n\u2022\nbilling and collecting accounts;\n\u2022\ncoding and compliance;\n\u2022\nclinical systems and medical devices;\n\u2022\nmedical records and document storage;\n\u2022\ninventory management;\n\u2022\nnegotiating, pricing and administering managed care contracts and supply contracts; and\n\u2022\nmonitoring quality of care and collecting data on quality measures necessary for full Medicare payment updates.\nInformation systems may be vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources, including telecommunications or network failures, human acts such as inadvertent misuse by employees and cyberattacks, including ransomware and data theft, and natural disasters. Moreover, we rely on various third-party technology platforms, which are increasingly important to our business and continue to grow in complexity and scope. Failure to adequately manage implementations of new technology, updates or enhancements of such platforms or interfaces between platforms could place us at a competitive disadvantage, disrupt our operations, and have a material, adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nWe have taken precautionary measures to prevent unanticipated problems that could affect our information systems. Nevertheless, we or our vendors and other third parties that we rely upon may experience system\nfailures and disruptions. The occurrence of any system failure could result in interruptions, delays, the loss or corruption of data and cessations or interruptions in the availability of systems, all of which could have a material, adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations and harm our business reputation.\nHealth care technology initiatives, particularly those related to patient data and interoperability, may adversely affect our operations.\nThe federal government is working to promote the adoption of health information technology and the promotion of nationwide health information exchange to improve health care. For example, HHS incentivizes the adoption and meaningful use of certified EHR technology through its Promoting Interoperability Programs. Eligible hospitals and eligible professionals, including our hospitals and employed professionals, are subject to reduced payments from Medicare if they fail to demonstrate meaningful use of certified EHR technology. As these technologies have become widespread, the focus has shifted to increasing patient access to health care data and interoperability. The 21st\nCentury Cures Act prohibits information blocking by health care providers and certain other entities, which is defined as engaging in activities likely to interfere with the access, exchange or use of electronic health information, except as required by law or specified by HHS as a reasonable and necessary activity. Current and future initiatives related to health care technology and interoperability may require changes to our operations, impose new and complex compliance obligations and require investments in infrastructure. We may be subject to financial penalties or other disincentives or experience reputational damage for failure to comply. It is difficult to predict how these initiatives will affect our relationships with providers and vendors, participation in health care information exchanges or networks, the exchange of patient data, and patient engagement.\nWe may not be reimbursed for the cost of expensive, new technology.\nAs health care technology continues to advance, the price of purchasing such new technology has significantly increased for providers. Some payers have not adapted their payment systems to adequately cover the cost of these technologies for providers and patients. If payers do not adequately reimburse us for these new technologies, we may be unable to acquire such technologies or we may nevertheless determine to acquire or utilize these technologies in order to treat our patients. In either case, our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected.\nRisks related to governmental regulation and other legal matters:\nOur results of operations may be adversely affected by health care reform efforts, including efforts to significantly change the Affordable Care Act. We are unable to predict what, if any, and when additional health reform measures will be adopted or implemented, and the effects and ultimate impact of any such measures are uncertain.\nIn recent years, Congress and certain state legislatures have passed a large number of laws and regulations intended to effect major change within the U.S. health care system, including the Affordable Care Act. The Affordable Care Act affects how health care services are covered, delivered and reimbursed through expanded health insurance coverage, reduced growth in Medicare program spending, reductions in Medicare and Medicaid DSH payments, and the establishment of programs that tie reimbursement to quality and integration. However, the Affordable Care Act has been subject to legislative and regulatory changes and court challenges. For example, effective January 1, 2019, the penalty associated with the individual mandate to maintain health insurance was eliminated. This change resulted in legal challenges to the constitutionality of the individual mandate and the validity of the Affordable Care Act as a whole. However, in June 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court determined that the plaintiffs lacked standing, allowing the law to remain in place.\nThere is uncertainty regarding whether, when and how the Affordable Care Act may be further changed, and how the law will be interpreted and implemented. Changes by Congress or government agencies could eliminate\nor alter provisions beneficial to us, while leaving in place provisions reducing our reimbursement or otherwise negatively impacting our business. However, President Biden has indicated that his administration generally intends to protect and strengthen the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid programs.\nThere is also uncertainty regarding whether, when, and what other health reform initiatives will be adopted and the impact of such efforts on providers and other health care industry participants. Some members of Congress have proposed measures that would expand government-sponsored coverage, including proposals to expand coverage of federally-funded insurance programs as an alternative to private insurance or establish a single-payer system (such reforms often referred to as \u201cMedicare for All\u201d), and some states are considering or have implemented public health insurance options. CMS administrators may grant states additional flexibility in the administration of state Medicaid programs and make changes to Medicaid payment models. Other health reform initiatives and proposals, such as price transparency requirements and the requirements of the No Surprises Act, may impact prices, our relationships with patients, payers or ancillary providers (such as anesthesiologists, radiologists, and pathologists), and our competitive position. Other industry participants, such as private payers and large employer groups and their affiliates, may also introduce financial or delivery system reforms. We are unable to predict the nature and success of such initiatives. Health care reform initiatives, including changes to the Affordable Care Act, may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flow, capital resources, and liquidity.\nChanges in government health care programs may adversely affect our revenues.\nA significant portion of our patient volume is derived from government health care programs, principally Medicare and Medicaid. Specifically, we derived 41.3% of our revenues from the Medicare and Medicaid programs in 2021. Changes in government health care programs, including Medicaid waiver programs, may reduce the reimbursement we receive and could adversely affect our business and results of operations. The Affordable Care Act made significant changes to Medicare and Medicaid, and future health reform efforts or further efforts to significantly change the Affordable Care Act may impact these programs.\nIn recent years, legislative and regulatory changes have resulted in limitations on and, in some cases, reductions in levels of payments to health care providers for certain services under the Medicare program. Congress has established automatic spending reductions that extend through 2030. However, the percentage reduction for Medicare may not be more than 2% for a fiscal year, with a uniform percentage reduction across all Medicare programs. While this reduction has been suspended by the CARES Act and related legislation, it is scheduled to be reinstated April 1, 2022, when it will resume as a 1% reduction. The full 2% reduction will begin July 1, 2022, and the reductions set for 2030 were increased to up to 3%. As a result of the ARPA, an additional Medicare payment reduction of up to 4% was required to take effect in January 2022; however, Congress has delayed implementation of this reduction until 2023. We are unable to predict what other deficit reduction initiatives may be proposed by Congress. These reductions are in addition to reductions mandated by the Affordable Care Act and other laws. Further, from time to time, CMS revises the reimbursement systems used to reimburse health care providers, including changes to the inpatient hospital MS-DRG\nsystem and other payment systems, which may result in reduced Medicare payments. Further, under a site neutrality policy, clinic visit services provided by off-campus\nprovider-based departments that were formerly paid under the outpatient PPS are now paid under the Physician Fee Schedule. The IMPACT Act requires HHS, in conjunction with the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, to propose a unified post-acute care payment model by 2023. A unified post-acute care payment system would pay post-acute care providers, including home health agencies, under a single framework according to a patient\u2019s characteristics, rather than based on the post-acute care setting where the patient receives treatment. CMS has issued final rules reducing Medicare payment rates under the outpatient PPS for drugs obtained under the 340B Drug Pricing Program, although this payment policy has been heavily litigated and is currently before the U.S. Supreme Court. In September 2021, HHS released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices, a report outlining principles for drug pricing reform. The report set forth a variety of potential legislative policies that Congress could pursue and summarized actions underway or under consideration by HHS to advance these principles. CMS may implement further changes to how items or services are reimbursed that result in payment reductions for other services.\nBecause most states must operate with balanced budgets and the Medicaid program is often a state\u2019s largest program, some states have enacted or may consider enacting legislation designed to reduce their Medicaid expenditures. Further, many states have also adopted, or are considering, legislation designed to reduce coverage, enroll Medicaid recipients in managed care programs, and/or impose additional taxes on hospitals to help finance or expand the states\u2019 Medicaid systems. Periods of economic weakness may increase the budgetary pressures on many states, and these budgetary pressures may result in decreased spending, or decreased spending growth, for Medicaid programs and the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program in many states. Some states that provide Medicaid supplemental payments are reviewing these programs or have filed waiver requests with CMS to replace these programs, and CMS has performed and continues to perform compliance reviews of some states\u2019 programs and is considering changes to the requirements for such programs, which could result in Medicaid supplemental payments being reduced or eliminated. Further, legislation and administrative actions at the federal level may significantly alter the funding for, or structure of, the Medicaid program. For example, from time to time, Congress considers proposals to restructure the Medicaid program to involve block grants that would be administered by the states. The prior presidential administration increased state flexibility in the administration of Medicaid programs, including by allowing states to condition enrollment on work or other community engagement or to use a block grant funding structure. However, the current presidential administration issued an executive order directing agencies to re-examine\nmeasures that reduce health insurance coverage or undermine Medicaid programs, and the administration has rescinded approvals of waivers involving certain eligibility and enrollment restrictions, including those allowing for work and community engagement requirements.\nIn some cases, private third-party payers rely on all or portions of Medicare payment systems to determine payment rates. Changes to government health care programs that reduce payments under these programs may negatively impact payments from private third-party payers.\nCurrent or future health care reform and deficit reduction efforts, changes in laws or regulations regarding government health care programs, other changes in the administration of government health care programs and changes by private third-party payers in response to health care reform and other changes to government health care programs could have a material, adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nIf we fail to comply with extensive laws and government regulations, we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations.\nThe health care industry is required to comply with extensive and complex laws and regulations at the federal, state and local government levels relating to, among other things:\n\u2022\nbilling and coding for services and properly handling overpayments;\n\u2022\nappropriateness and classification of level of care provided, including proper classification of inpatient admissions, observation services and outpatient care;\n\u2022\nrelationships with physicians and other referral sources and referral recipients;\n\u2022\nnecessity and adequacy of medical care;\n\u2022\nquality of medical equipment and services;\n\u2022\nqualifications of medical and support personnel;\n\u2022\nthe confidentiality, maintenance, interoperability, exchange, data breach, identity theft and security of health-related and personal information and medical records;\n\u2022\nscreening, stabilization and transfer of individuals who have emergency medical conditions;\n\u2022\nlicensure, certification and enrollment with government programs;\n\u2022\nthe distribution, maintenance and dispensing of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances;\n\u2022\ndebt collection, limits or prohibitions on balance billing and billing for out of network services;\n\u2022\ncommunications with patients and consumers;\n\u2022\npreparing and filing of cost reports;\n\u2022\noperating policies and procedures;\n\u2022\nactivities regarding competitors;\n\u2022\naddition of facilities and services; and\n\u2022\nenvironmental protection.\nAmong these laws are the federal Anti-kickback Statute, EKRA, the federal Stark Law, the FCA and similar state laws. We have a variety of financial relationships with physicians and others who either refer or influence the referral of patients to our hospitals, other health care facilities, laboratories and employed physicians or who are the recipients of referrals, and these laws govern those relationships. The OIG has enacted safe harbor regulations that outline practices deemed protected from prosecution under the Anti-kickback Statute. While we endeavor to comply with the applicable safe harbors, certain of our current arrangements, including joint ventures and financial relationships with physicians and other referral sources and persons and entities to which we refer patients, do not qualify for safe harbor protection. Failure to qualify for a safe harbor does not mean the arrangement necessarily violates the Anti-kickback Statute but may subject the arrangement to greater scrutiny. However, we cannot offer assurance that practices outside of a safe harbor will not be found to violate the Anti-kickback Statute. Allegations of violations of the Anti-kickback Statute may be brought under the federal Civil Monetary Penalty Law, which requires a lower burden of proof than other fraud and abuse laws, including the Anti-kickback Statute.\nOur financial relationships with referring physicians and their immediate family members must comply with the Stark Law by meeting an exception. We attempt to structure our relationships to meet an exception to the Stark Law, but the regulations implementing the exceptions are detailed and complex and are subject to continuing legal and regulatory change. Thus, we cannot provide assurance that every relationship complies fully with the Stark Law. Unlike the Anti-kickback Statute, failure to meet an exception under the Stark Law results in a violation of the Stark Law, even if such violation is technical in nature.\nAdditionally, if we violate the Anti-kickback Statute or Stark Law, or if we improperly bill for our services, we may be found to violate the FCA, either under a suit brought by the government or by a private person under a qui tam\n, or \u201cwhistleblower,\u201d suit. See Item 1, \u201cBusiness - Regulation and Other Factors.\u201d\nWe also operate health care facilities in the United Kingdom and have operations and commercial relationships with companies in other foreign jurisdictions and, as a result, are subject to certain U.S. and foreign laws applicable to businesses generally, including anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act regulates U.S. companies in their dealings with foreign officials, prohibiting bribes and similar practices, and requires that they maintain records that fairly and accurately reflect transactions and appropriate internal accounting controls. In addition, the United Kingdom Bribery Act has wide jurisdiction over certain activities that affect the United Kingdom.\nA variety of state, national, foreign and international laws and regulations apply to the collection, use, retention, protection, security, disclosure, transfer and other processing of personal data. For example, the CCPA, which affords consumers expanded privacy protections such as the right to know what personal information is collected and how it is used, went into effect on January 1, 2020, and was recently significantly amended by the CPRA. California residents also have the right to request that a business delete their personal information unless it is necessary for the business to maintain for certain purposes, to direct a business to correct errors in their personal information, and to restrict the use and disclosure of sensitive information. They have the right to know if their personal information is being sold or shared and the right to opt out of the sale or disclosure. Beginning in 2023, under the CPRA\u2019s amendments, as well as comprehensive privacy legislation passed in Virginia and\nColorado, residents of those states will have additional rights with respect to their personal information, such as a right to opt out of certain processing activities for sensitive data and a right to a portable copy of their personal information. The CPRA creates a new regulator responsible for enforcement of the CPRA, and enforcement priorities of this new regulatory body have yet to be determined. The CCPA and CPRA also provide for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that may increase data breach litigation. Failure to comply with these and any other comprehensive privacy laws passed at the state or federal level may result in regulatory enforcement action and damage to our reputation. The potential effects of such legislation are far-reaching\nand may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses to comply. With Brexit, our United Kingdom operations are no longer subject to the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) but are subject to the UK Data Protection Legislation, which has been amended in connection with Brexit to be functionally similar to the GDPR and which contains stricter privacy restrictions than laws and regulations in the United States and provides for significant fines in the event of violations. These administrative fines are based on a multi-factored approach. Moreover, rules for data transfers outside of the United Kingdom and European Economic Area have changed significantly with Brexit and a recent Court of European Justice decision, and are subject to further revision and updated regulator guidance, making necessary compliance measures challenging to ascertain and implement with respect to our United Kingdom operations. We expect that there will continue to be new laws, regulations, regulatory guidance, and industry standards concerning privacy, data protection and information security proposed and enacted in various jurisdictions, which could impact our operations and cause us to incur substantial costs.\nWe send short message service, or SMS, text messages to patients. While we obtain consent from these individuals to send text messages, federal or state regulatory authorities or private litigants may claim that the notices and disclosures we provide, form of consents we obtain, or our SMS texting practices are not adequate or violate applicable law. In addition, we must ensure that our SMS texting practices comply with regulations and agency guidance under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cTCPA\u201d), a federal statute that protects consumers from unwanted telephone calls, faxes and text messages. While we strive to adhere to strict policies and procedures that comply with the TCPA, the Federal Communications Commission, as the agency that implements and enforces the TCPA, may disagree with our interpretation of the TCPA and subject us to penalties and other consequences for noncompliance. Determination by a court or regulatory agency that our SMS texting practices violate the TCPA could subject us to civil penalties and could require us to change some portions of our business. Even an unsuccessful challenge by patients or regulatory authorities of our activities could result in adverse publicity and could require a costly response from and defense by us. Moreover, if wireless carriers or their trade associations, which issue guidelines for texting programs, determine that we have violated their guidelines, our ability to engage in texting programs may be curtailed or revoked, which could impact our operations and cause us to incur costs related to implementing a workaround solution.\nWe engage in consumer debt collection for HCA-affiliated\nhospitals and certain non-affiliated\nhospitals. We also engage in credit reporting for certain non-affiliated\nhospitals. The federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act and the TCPA restrict the methods that companies may use to contact and seek payment from consumer debtors regarding past due accounts and to report to consumer reporting agencies on the status of those accounts. Many states impose additional requirements on debt collection and credit reporting practices, and some of those requirements may be more stringent than the federal requirements.\nFinally, we are subject to various federal, state and local statutes and ordinances regulating the discharge of materials into the environment. For example, our health care operations generate medical waste, such as pharmaceuticals, biological materials and disposable medical instruments, that must be handled, stored, transported, treated and disposed of in compliance with federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. Environmental regulations also may apply when we build new facilities or renovate existing facilities. If we are found not to be in compliance with such laws and regulations, we may be liable for significant investigation and clean-up\ncosts or be subject to enforcement actions by governmental authorities or lawsuits by\nprivate plaintiffs. Moreover, any changes in the environmental regulatory framework (including legislative or regulatory efforts designed to address climate change) could have a material, adverse effect on our business.\nIf we fail to comply with these or other applicable laws and regulations, which are subject to change, we could be subject to liabilities, including civil penalties, money damages, lapses in reimbursement, the loss of our licenses to operate one or more facilities, exclusion of one or more facilities from participation in the Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state health care programs, civil lawsuits and criminal penalties. In addition, different interpretations or enforcement of, or amendments to, these and other laws and regulations in the future could subject our current or past practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality or could require us to make changes in our facilities, equipment, personnel, services, capital expenditure programs and operating expenses. The costs of compliance with, and the other burdens imposed by, these and other laws or regulatory actions may increase our operational costs, result in interruptions or delays in the availability of systems and/or result in a patient volume decline. We may also face audits or investigations by one or more domestic or foreign government agencies relating to our compliance with these regulations. An adverse outcome under any such investigation or audit, a determination that we have violated these or other laws or a public announcement that we are being investigated for possible violations could result in liability, result in adverse publicity, and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.\nState efforts to regulate the construction or expansion of health care facilities could impair our ability to operate and expand our operations.\nSome states, particularly in the eastern part of the country, require health care providers to obtain prior approval, often known as a CON, for the purchase, construction or expansion of health care facilities, to make certain capital expenditures or to make changes in services or bed capacity. In giving approval, these states consider the need for additional or expanded health care facilities or services. We currently operate health care facilities in a number of states with CON laws or that require other types of approvals for the establishment or expansion of certain facility types or services. The failure to obtain any required CON or other required approval could impair our ability to operate or expand operations. Any such failure could, in turn, adversely affect our ability to attract patients and physicians to our facilities and grow our revenues, which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe may incur additional tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to tax in the United States as well as those states and foreign jurisdictions in which we do business. Changes in tax laws, including increases in tax rates, or interpretations of tax laws by taxing authorities or other standard setting bodies could increase our tax obligations and have a material, adverse impact on our results of operations.\nWe are also subject to examination by federal, state and foreign taxing authorities. Management believes HCA Healthcare, Inc., its predecessors, subsidiaries and affiliates properly reported taxable income and paid taxes in accordance with applicable laws and agreements established with the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d), state and foreign taxing authorities and final resolution of any disputes will not have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position. However, if payments due upon final resolution of any issues exceed our recorded estimates, such resolutions could have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position.\nWe have been and could become the subject of government investigations, claims and litigation.\nHealth care companies are subject to numerous investigations by various government agencies. Further, under the FCA, private parties have the right to bring qui tam\n, or \u201cwhistleblower,\u201d suits against companies that submit false claims for payments to, or improperly retain overpayments from, the government. Some states have adopted similar state whistleblower and false claims provisions. Certain of our individual facilities and/or\naffiliates have received, and other facilities and/or affiliates may receive, government inquiries from, and may be subject to investigation by, federal and state agencies. Depending on whether the underlying conduct in these or future inquiries or investigations could be considered systemic, their resolution could have a material, adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nGovernment agencies and their agents, such as the MACs, fiscal intermediaries and carriers, as well as the OIG, CMS and state Medicaid programs, conduct audits of our health care operations. CMS and state Medicaid agencies contract with RACs and other contractors on a contingency fee basis to conduct post-payment reviews to detect and correct improper payments in the Medicare program, including managed Medicare plans, and the Medicaid programs. RAC denials are appealable; however, there are currently significant delays in the Medicare appeals process, which negatively impacts our ability to appeal RAC payment denials. Private third-party payers may conduct similar post-payment audits, and we also perform internal audits and monitoring. Depending on the nature of the conduct found in such audits and whether the underlying conduct could be considered systemic, the resolution of these audits could have a material, adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nShould we be found out of compliance with applicable laws, regulations or programs, depending on the nature of the findings, our business, our financial position and our results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nWe may be subject to liabilities from claims brought against our facilities, which are costly to defend and may require us to pay significant damages if not covered by insurance.\nWe are subject to litigation relating to our business practices, including claims and legal actions by patients and others in the ordinary course of business alleging malpractice, product liability or other legal theories. Many of these actions seek large sums of money as damages and involve significant defense costs. We insure a portion of our professional liability risks through our insurance subsidiary. Management believes our reserves for self-insured retentions and insurance coverage are sufficient to cover insured claims arising out of the operation of our facilities, although some claims may exceed the scope or amount of the coverage limits of our insurance policies. Our insurance subsidiary has entered into certain reinsurance contracts; however, the subsidiary remains liable to the extent that the reinsurers do not meet their obligations under the reinsurance contracts. If payments for claims exceed actuarially determined estimates, are not covered by insurance, or reinsurers, if any, fail to meet their obligations, our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected.\nRisks related to operations, strategy, demand and competition:\nOur hospitals face competition for patients from other hospitals and health care providers.\nThe health care business is highly competitive, and competition among hospitals and other health care providers for patients has intensified in recent years. Generally, other hospitals in the communities we serve provide services similar to those offered by our hospitals. CMS publicizes on its Care Compare website performance data related to quality measures and data on patient satisfaction surveys that hospitals submit in connection with their Medicare reimbursement. The Care Compare website provides an overall rating that synthesizes various quality measures into a single star rating for each hospital. Federal law provides for the future expansion of the number of quality measures that must be reported. If any of our hospitals achieve poor results (or results that are lower than our competitors) on quality measures or on patient satisfaction surveys, our competitive position could be negatively affected. Further, hospitals are currently required by law to publish online a list of their standard charges for all items and services, including discounted cash prices and payer-specific and de-identified\nnegotiated charges. The No Surprises Act imposes additional price transparency requirements beginning January 1, 2022, including requiring providers to send health plans of insured patients and uninsured patients a good faith estimate of the expected charges and diagnostic codes prior to the scheduled date of the service or item. HHS is deferring enforcement of certain requirements of the No Surprises Act\napplicable to providing estimates for insured individuals. It is not entirely clear how price transparency requirements will affect consumer behavior, our relationships with payers, or our ability to set and negotiate prices, but our competitive position could be negatively affected if our standard charges are higher or are perceived to be higher than the charges of our competitors.\nThe number of freestanding specialty hospitals, surgery centers, emergency departments, urgent care centers and diagnostic and imaging centers in the geographic areas in which we operate has increased. Many individuals are seeking a broader range of services at outpatient facilities as a result of the growing availability of stand-alone outpatient health care facilities, the increase in payer reimbursement policies that restrict inpatient coverage and the increase in the services that can be provided on an outpatient basis, including high margin services. Consequently, most of our hospitals operate in a highly competitive environment, which may put pressure on our pricing, ability to contract with third-party payers and strategy for volume growth. Some of the facilities that compete with our hospitals are physician-owned or are owned by governmental agencies or not-for-profit\ncorporations supported by endowments, charitable contributions and/or tax revenues and can finance capital expenditures and operations on a tax-exempt\nbasis. Recent consolidations of not-for-profit\nhospital entities may intensify this competitive pressure. There is also increasing consolidation in the third-party payer industry, including vertical integration efforts among third-party payers and health care providers, and increasing efforts by payers to influence or direct the patient\u2019s choice of provider by the use of narrow networks or other strategies. Health care industry participants are increasingly implementing physician alignment strategies, such as employing physicians, acquiring physician practice groups and participating in ACOs or other clinical integration models. Other industry participants, such as large employer groups and their affiliates, may intensify competitive pressure and affect the industry in ways that are difficult to predict.\nOur hospitals compete with specialty hospitals and with both our own and unaffiliated freestanding ASCs and other outpatient providers for market share in certain high margin services and for quality physicians and personnel. If ASCs and other outpatient providers are better able to compete in this environment than our hospitals, our hospitals may experience a decline in patient volume, and we may experience a decrease in margin, even if those patients use our providers. In states that do not require a CON or other type of approval for the purchase, construction or expansion of health care facilities or services, competition in the form of new services, facilities and capital spending is more prevalent. Some states that have historically imposed CON or similar prior approval requirements have removed or are considering removing these requirements, which may reduce barriers to entry and increase competition in our service areas. Changes in licensure or other regulations and recognition of new provider types or payment models could also impact our competitive position. If our competitors are better able to attract patients, make capital expenditures and maintain modern and technologically upgraded facilities and equipment, recruit physicians, expand services or obtain favorable third-party payer contracts at their facilities than our hospitals and other providers, we may experience an overall decline in patient volume. See Item 1, \u201cBusiness - Competition.\u201d\nA deterioration in the collectability of uninsured and patient due accounts could adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe primary collection risks for our accounts receivable relate to the uninsured patient accounts and patient accounts for which the primary third-party payer has paid the amounts covered by the applicable agreement, but patient responsibility amounts (exclusions, deductibles and copayments) remain outstanding. Medicare reimburses hospitals for 65% of eligible Medicare bad debts. To be eligible for reimbursement, the amounts claimed must meet certain criteria, including that the debt is related to unpaid deductible or coinsurance amounts and that the hospital first attempted to collect the fees from the Medicare beneficiary.\nThe estimates for implicit price concessions are based upon management\u2019s assessment of historical write-offs and expected net collections, business and economic conditions, trends in federal and state governmental and private employer health care coverage, the rate of growth in uninsured patient admissions and other collection indicators. At December 31, 2021, estimated implicit price concessions of $6.784 billion had been recorded to\nadjust our revenues and accounts receivable to the estimated amounts we expect to collect. The estimated cost of total uncompensated care was $3.350 billion for 2021, $3.483 billion for 2020 and $3.733 billion for 2019.\nAny increase in the amount or deterioration in the collectability of uninsured accounts receivable will adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations. Our facilities may experience growth in total uncompensated care as a result of a number of factors, including conditions impacting the overall economy and unemployment levels, both of which have been, and may in the future be, negatively impacted by the COVID-19\npandemic. Effective January 2019, Congress eliminated the financial penalty associated with the Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual mandate. Further, final rules issued in 2018 expand the availability of association health plans and allow the sale of short-term, limited-duration health plans, neither of which are required to cover all of the essential health benefits mandated by the Affordable Care Act. These changes may impact the number of individuals that elect to obtain public or private health insurance or the scope of such coverage, if purchased. We are unable to predict what, if any, and when such changes will be made in the future.\nWe provide uninsured discounts and charity care for individuals, including for those residing in states that choose not to implement the Medicaid expansion or that modify the terms of the program, for undocumented aliens who are not permitted to enroll in an Exchange or government health care programs and for certain others who may not have insurance. Some patients may choose to enroll in lower cost Medicaid plans or other health insurance plans with lower reimbursement levels. We may also be adversely affected by the growth in patient responsibility accounts as a result of increases in the adoption of health plan structures that shift greater payment responsibility for care to individuals through greater exclusions and copayment and deductible amounts.\nIf our volume of patients with private health insurance coverage declines or we are unable to retain and negotiate favorable contracts with private third-party payers, including managed care plans, our revenues may be reduced.\nBroad economic factors resulting from the COVID-19\npandemic, including inflationary pressures, supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, increased unemployment and underemployment rates and reduced consumer spending and confidence, the continued shift to an outpatient setting and the aging population may impact our revenue mix. Private third-party payers, including HMOs, PPOs and other managed care plans, typically reimburse health care providers at a higher rate than Medicare, Medicaid or other government health care programs. Reimbursement rates are set forth by contract when our facilities are in-network,\nand payers utilize plan structures to encourage or require the use of in-network\nproviders. Revenues derived from private third-party payers (domestic only) accounted for 51.6%, 51.5% and 51.6% of our revenues for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As a result, our ability to maintain or increase patient volumes covered by private third-party payers and to maintain and obtain favorable contracts with private third-party payers significantly affects the revenues and operating results of our facilities.\nPrivate third-party payers, including managed care plans, continue to demand discounted fee structures, and the ongoing trend toward consolidation among payers tends to increase their bargaining power over fee structures. Payers may utilize plan structures such as narrow networks and tiered networks that limit beneficiary provider choices, impose significantly higher cost sharing obligations when care is obtained from providers in a disfavored tier or otherwise shift greater financial responsibility for care to individuals.\nOther health care providers may impact our ability to enter into managed care contracts or negotiate increases in our reimbursement and other favorable terms and conditions. For example, some of our competitors may negotiate exclusivity provisions with managed care plans or otherwise restrict the ability of managed care plans to contract with us. In addition to increasing negotiating leverage of private third-party payers, alignment efforts between third-party payers and health care providers may result in other competitive advantages, such as greater access to performance and pricing data. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to retain and renew our third-party payer contracts and enter into new contracts on terms favorable to us, which may be impacted by price transparency initiatives. Cost-reduction strategies by large employer groups and their affiliates,\nsuch as directly contracting with a limited number of providers, may also limit our ability to negotiate favorable terms in our contracts and otherwise intensify competitive pressure. It is not clear what impact, if any, future health reform efforts or further changes to the Affordable Care Act will have on our ability to negotiate reimbursement increases and participate in third-party payer networks on favorable terms. If we are unable to retain and negotiate favorable contracts with third-party payers or experience reductions in payment increases or amounts received from third-party payers, our revenues may be reduced.\nIn addition, our revenues may be reduced if we experience growth in self-pay\nvolume. In recent years, federal and state legislatures have considered or passed various proposals potentially impacting the size of the uninsured population. The number and identity of states that choose to expand or otherwise modify Medicaid programs and the terms of expansion and other program modifications continue to evolve. These variables, among others, make it difficult to predict the number of uninsured individuals and what percentage of our total revenue will be comprised of self-pay\nrevenues.\nChanges to physician utilization practices and treatment methodologies, third-party payer controls designed to reduce inpatient services or surgical procedures and other factors outside our control that impact demand for medical services may reduce our revenues.\nControls imposed by Medicare, managed Medicare, Medicaid, managed Medicaid and private third-party payers designed to reduce admissions, intensity of services, surgical volumes and lengths of stay, in some instances referred to as \u201cutilization review,\u201d have affected and are expected to increasingly affect our facilities. Utilization review entails the review of the admission and course of treatment of a patient by third-party payers, and may involve prior authorization requirements. The Medicare program also issues national or local coverage determinations that restrict the circumstances under which Medicare pays for certain services. Inpatient utilization, average lengths of stay and occupancy rates continue to be negatively affected by third-party payers\u2019 preadmission authorization requirements, coverage restrictions, utilization review and by pressure to maximize outpatient and alternative health care delivery services for less acutely ill patients. Efforts to impose more stringent cost controls are expected to continue. Additionally, trends in physician treatment protocols and health plan design, such as health plans that shift increased costs and accountability for care to patients, could reduce our surgical volumes and admissions in favor of lower intensity and lower cost treatment methodologies or result in patients seeking care from other providers.\nVolume, admission and case-mix\ntrends may be impacted by other factors beyond our control, such as changes in volume of certain high acuity services, variations in the prevalence and severity of outbreaks of influenza and other illnesses, such as COVID-19,\nand medical conditions, seasonal and severe weather conditions, changes in treatment regimens and medical technology and other advances. Further, our inpatient volumes may decline if various inpatient hospital procedures become eligible for reimbursement by Medicare when performed in outpatient settings. These factors may reduce the demand for services we offer and decrease the reimbursement that we receive. Significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed, cost controls, changes to physician utilization practices, treatment methodologies, reimbursement rates and fees and other factors beyond our control could have a material, adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nWe may encounter difficulty acquiring hospitals and other health care businesses and challenges integrating the operations of acquired hospitals and other health care businesses and become liable for unknown or contingent liabilities as a result of acquisitions.\nA component of our business strategy is acquiring hospitals and other health care businesses. We may encounter difficulty acquiring new facilities or other businesses as a result of competition from other purchasers that may be willing to pay purchase prices that are higher than we believe are reasonable. Antitrust enforcement in the health care industry is currently a priority of the Federal Trade Commission and the DOJ, including with respect to hospital and physician practice acquisitions. Some states require CONs in order to acquire a hospital or\nother facility, or to expand facilities or services. In addition, the acquisition of health care facilities often involves licensure approvals or reviews and complex change of ownership processes for Medicare and other payers. Further, many states have laws that restrict the conversion or sale of not-for-profit\nhospitals to for-profit\nentities. These laws may require prior approval from the state attorney general, advance notification of the attorney general or other regulators and community involvement. Attorneys general in states without specific requirements may exercise broad discretionary authority over transactions involving the sale of not-for-profits\nunder their general obligations to protect the use of charitable assets. These legislative and administrative efforts often focus on the appropriate valuation of the assets divested and the use of the proceeds of the sale by the non-profit\nseller and may include consideration of commitments for capital improvements and charity care by the purchaser. Also, the increasingly challenging regulatory and enforcement environment may negatively impact our ability to acquire health care businesses if they are found to have material unresolved compliance issues, such as repayment obligations. Resolving compliance issues as well as completion of oversight, review or approval processes could seriously delay or even prevent our ability to acquire hospitals or other businesses and increase our acquisition costs.\nWe may be unable to timely and effectively integrate hospitals and other businesses that we acquire with our ongoing operations, or we may experience delays implementing operating procedures and systems. Hospitals and other health care businesses that we acquire may have unknown or contingent liabilities, including liabilities for failure to comply with health care and other laws and regulations, medical and general professional liabilities, workers\u2019 compensation liabilities and tax liabilities. Although we typically exclude significant liabilities from our acquisition transactions and seek indemnification from the sellers for these matters, we could experience difficulty enforcing those obligations, experience liability in excess of any indemnification obtained or otherwise incur material liabilities for the pre-acquisition\nconduct of acquired businesses. Such liabilities and related legal or other costs could harm our business and results of operations.\nOur facilities are heavily concentrated in Florida and Texas, which makes us sensitive to regulatory, economic, public health, environmental and competitive conditions and changes in those states.\nWe operated 182 hospitals at December 31, 2021, and 91 of those hospitals are located in Florida and Texas. Our Florida and Texas facilities\u2019 combined revenues represented 49% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021. This geographic concentration makes us particularly sensitive to regulatory, economic, public health, environmental and competitive conditions in those states. Any material change in the current payment programs or regulatory, economic, public health, environmental or competitive conditions in those states could have a disproportionate effect on our overall business results.\nIn addition, our hospitals in Florida, Texas and other coastal states are located in hurricane-prone areas. In the past, hurricanes have had a disruptive effect on the operations of our hospitals in Florida, Texas and other coastal states and the patient populations in those states. Global climate change could also increase the intensity or frequency of hurricanes in those regions. Our business activities could be harmed by a particularly active hurricane season or even a single storm, and the property insurance we obtain may not be adequate to cover losses from future hurricanes or other natural disasters.\nOur business and operations are subject to risks related to climate change.\nGlobal climate change presents both immediate and long-term physical risks (such as extreme weather conditions) and risks associated with the transition to a low-carbon economy (such as regulatory or technology changes). These changes could result in, for example, temporary declines in the number of patients seeking our services, closures of our hospitals and related facilities, and supply chain disruptions, as well as increased costs of products, commodities and energy (including utilities), and disruptions in our information systems, which in turn could negatively impact our business and results of operations. In addition, certain of our operations and facilities are located in regions that may be disproportionately impacted by the physical risks of climate change (including hurricanes and flooding), and we face the risk of losses incurred as a result of physical damage to our\nhospitals and related facilities and business interruptions caused by such events. We maintain property insurance coverage to address the impact of physical damage to our facilities and for business interruption losses. However, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses and we may experience a material, adverse effect on our results of operations that is not recoverable through our insurance policies. Additionally, if we experience a significant increase in climate-related events that result in material losses we may be unable to obtain similar levels of property insurance coverage in the future. In addition, changes in consumer preferences and additional legislation and regulatory requirements, including those associated with the transition to a low-carbon\neconomy, may increase costs associated with compliance, the operation of our facilities and supplies. Regulations limiting greenhouse gas emissions and energy inputs may also increase in coming years, which may adversely impact us through increased compliance costs for us and our suppliers and vendors.\nThe industry trend toward value-based purchasing may negatively impact our revenues.\nThere is a trend in the health care industry toward value-based purchasing of health care services. These value-based purchasing programs include both public reporting of quality data and preventable adverse events tied to the quality and efficiency of care provided by facilities. Governmental programs including Medicare currently require hospitals to report certain quality data to receive full reimbursement updates. In addition, Medicare does not reimburse for care related to certain preventable adverse events (also called \u201cnever events\u201d), and federal law prohibits the use of federal funds under the Medicaid program to reimburse providers for medical assistance provided to treat HACs. The 25% of hospitals with the worst risk-adjusted HAC scores in the designated performance period receive a 1% reduction in their inpatient PPS Medicare payments the following year.\nHospitals with excess readmission rates for conditions designated by CMS receive a reduction in their inpatient PPS operating Medicare payments for all Medicare inpatient discharges, not just discharges relating to the conditions subject to the excess readmission standard. The reduction in payments to hospitals with excess readmissions can be up to 3% of a hospital\u2019s base payments.\nCMS has implemented a value-based purchasing program for inpatient hospital services that reduces inpatient hospital payments for all discharges by 2% in each federal fiscal year. CMS pools the amount collected from these reductions to fund payments to reward hospitals that meet or exceed certain quality performance standards established by CMS. CMS scores each hospital based on achievement (relative to other hospitals) and improvement (relative to the hospital\u2019s own past performance). Hospitals that meet or exceed the quality performance standards will receive greater reimbursement under the value-based purchasing program than they would have otherwise. In response to the COVID-19\npandemic, CMS is applying a measure suppression policy to certain hospital quality measurement and value-based purchasing programs. The policy is intended to ensure that these programs neither reward nor penalize hospitals based on circumstances caused by the PHE that the measures were not designed to accommodate.\nCMS has developed several alternative payment models that are intended to reduce costs and improve quality of care for Medicare beneficiaries and has signaled its intent to have states apply similar strategies in the Medicaid context. Examples of alternative payment models include bundled payment models in which, depending on whether overall CMS spending per episode exceeds or falls below a target specified by CMS and whether quality standards are met, hospitals may receive supplemental Medicare payments or owe repayments to CMS. Generally, participation in bundled payment programs is voluntary, but CMS currently requires hospitals in selected markets to participate in a bundled payment initiative for specified orthopedic procedures and in a model for end-stage\nrenal disease treatment. In addition, CMS will require certain hospitals to participate in a radiation oncology model beginning as early as January 1, 2023. CMS has indicated that it is developing more voluntary and mandatory bundled payment models. Participation in mandatory or voluntary demonstration projects, particularly demonstrations with the potential to affect payment, may negatively impact our results of operations.\nIn October 2021, the CMS Innovation Center released an outline of its strategy for the next decade, noting the need to accelerate the movement to value-based care and drive broader system transformation. By 2030, the\nCMS Innovation Center aims to have all fee-for-service\nMedicare beneficiaries and the vast majority of Medicaid beneficiaries in an accountable care relationship with providers who are responsible for quality and total medical costs. The CMS Innovation Center signaled its intent to streamline its payment models and to increase provider participation through implementation of more mandatory models.\nThere are also several state-driven value-based care initiatives. For example, some states have aligned quality metrics across payers through legislation or regulation. Some private third-party payers are also transitioning toward alternative payment models or implementing other value-based care strategies. For example, many large private third-party payers currently require hospitals to report quality data, and several private third-party payers do not reimburse hospitals for certain preventable adverse events. Further, we have implemented a policy pursuant to which we do not bill patients or third-party payers for fees or expenses incurred due to certain preventable adverse events.\nWe expect value-based purchasing programs, including programs that condition reimbursement on patient outcome measures, to become more common and to involve a higher percentage of reimbursement amounts. It is unclear whether these and other alternative payment models will successfully coordinate care and reduce costs or whether they will decrease aggregate reimbursement. We are unable at this time to predict our future payments or whether we will be subject to payment reductions under these programs or how this trend will affect our results of operations. If we are unable to meet or exceed the quality performance standards under any applicable value-based purchasing program, perform at a level below the outcomes demonstrated by our competitors, or otherwise fail to effectively provide or coordinate the efficient delivery of quality health care services, our reputation in the industry may be negatively impacted, we may receive reduced reimbursement amounts and we may owe repayments to payers, causing our revenues to decline.\nRisks related to macroeconomic conditions:\nOur overall business results may suffer during periods of general economic weakness.\nThe COVID-19\npandemic has adversely impacted, and may in the future adversely impact, economic conditions in the United States. Budget deficits at federal, state and local government entities have had a negative impact on spending, and may continue to negatively impact spending for health and human service programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and similar programs, which represent significant third-party payer sources for our hospitals. We anticipate that the federal deficit, the growing magnitude of Medicare and Medicaid expenditures and the aging of the U.S. population will continue to place pressure on government health care programs. Other risks we face during periods of economic weakness and high unemployment include potential declines in the population covered under managed care agreements, increased patient decisions to postpone or cancel elective and nonemergency health care procedures (including delaying surgical procedures), which may lead to poorer health and higher acuity interventions, potential increases in the uninsured and underinsured populations, increased adoption of health plan structures that shift financial responsibility to patients and further difficulties in collecting patient receivables for copayment and deductible receivables.\nWe are exposed to market risk related to changes in the market values of securities and interest rates.\nWe are exposed to market risk related to changes in market values of securities. The COVID-19\npandemic has increased volatility of the capital and credit markets and has adversely impacted economic conditions. The investment securities held by our insurance subsidiaries were $541 million at December 31, 2021. These investments are carried at fair value, with changes in unrealized gains and losses being recorded as adjustments to other comprehensive income. At December 31, 2021, we had a net unrealized gain of $16 million on the insurance subsidiaries\u2019 investment securities.\nWe are exposed to market risk related to market illiquidity. Investment securities of our insurance subsidiaries could be impaired by the inability to access the capital markets. Should the insurance subsidiaries\nrequire significant amounts of cash in excess of normal cash requirements to pay claims and other expenses on short notice, we may have difficulty selling these investments in a timely manner or be forced to sell them at a price less than what we might otherwise have been able to in a normal market environment. We may be required to recognize credit-related impairments on long-term investments in future periods should issuers default on interest payments or should the fair market valuations of the securities deteriorate due to ratings downgrades or other issue specific factors.\nWe are also exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates that impact the amount of the interest expense we incur with respect to our floating rate obligations as well as the value of certain investments. We periodically enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to these fluctuations. Our interest rate swap agreements involve the exchange of fixed and variable rate interest payments between two parties, based on common notional principal amounts and maturity dates.\nRisks related to ownership of our common stock:\nThere can be no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends.\nIn January 2018, the Board of Directors initiated a cash dividend program under which the Company commenced a regular quarterly cash dividend. However, in response to the COVID-19\npandemic, the Company took the precautionary step to enhance its financial flexibility by suspending its quarterly dividend program in the second quarter of 2020. In February 2021, the Board of Directors approved the resumption of the Company\u2019s quarterly cash dividend program following evaluation of the Company\u2019s financial position. During 2021, the Board of Directors declared four quarterly dividends of $0.48 per share, or $1.92 per share in the aggregate, on our common stock. On January 26, 2022, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.56 per share on our common stock payable on March 31, 2022 to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 17, 2022.\nThe declaration, amount and timing of such dividends are subject to capital availability and determinations by our Board of Directors that cash dividends are in the best interest of our stockholders and are in compliance with all respective laws and our agreements applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends. Our ability to pay dividends will depend upon, among other factors, our cash flows from operations, our available capital and potential future capital requirements for strategic transactions, including acquisitions, debt service requirements, share repurchases and investing in our existing markets as well as our results of operations, financial condition and other factors beyond our control that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. A reduction in or suspension or elimination of our dividend payments could have a negative effect on our stock price.\nCertain of our investors may continue to have influence over us.\nOn November 17, 2006, HCA Inc. was acquired by a private investor group, including affiliates of HCA founder, Dr. Thomas F. Frist, Jr. and certain other investors. Through their investment in Hercules Holding II and other holdings, certain of the Frist-affiliated investors continue to hold a significant interest in our outstanding common stock (approximately 23% as of January 31, 2022). In addition, pursuant to a shareholders agreement we entered into with Hercules Holding II and the Frist-affiliated investors, certain representatives of these investors have the continued right to nominate certain of the members of our Board of Directors. As a result, certain of these investors potentially have the ability to influence our decisions to enter into corporate transactions (and the terms thereof) and prevent changes in the composition of our Board of Directors or any transaction that requires stockholder approval.", "PERMNO": 76171, "SIC": 8062, "TIC": "HCA"}
