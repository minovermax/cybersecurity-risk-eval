{"cik": "716643", "company": "REGIS CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-08-23", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nAn inability to continue to execute on our strategy and build on foundational initiatives we've implemented could adversely impact our same-store sales and operating results.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to improve sales, as well as both cost of service and product and operating margins. Same-store sales are affected by average ticket and same-store guest visits. A variety of factors affect same-store guest visits, including the guest experience, staffing and retention of stylists and salon leaders, fashion trends, competition, current economic conditions, product assortment, marketing programs and weather conditions. These factors may cause our same-store sales to differ materially from prior periods and from our expectations.\nSince fiscal year 2013, we have gone through significant change as we executed upon a number of foundational initiatives to support and focus on our business strategies to return the Company to sustainable long-term growth and profitability.\nThese foundational changes were disruptive to our business. In fiscal 2014 and 2015, same-store sales declined 4.8% and 0.3%, respectively, compared to the prior year. While fiscal 2016 same-store sales growth of 0.2% represents improved trends, there can be no assurance we will be able to successfully execute on our business strategy in fiscal 2017 and beyond to achieve long-term growth, profitability and a broader scale turn. We will also need to continue to refine our strategy as market dynamics continue to evolve. If our efforts are not effective, our same-store sales, margins and return on invested capital may be adversely affected.\nIn addition, the unexpected loss of any of our executive leadership team members could adversely affect the momentum we have achieved in executing on our business strategies and could adversely affect our business.\nOur business is based on the success of our stylists. It is important for us to attract, train and retain talented stylists and salon leaders.\nGuest loyalty is highly dependent upon the stylists who serve our guests. In order to profitably grow our business, it is important for us to attract, train and retain talented stylists and salon leaders and to adequately staff our salons. Because the salon industry is highly-fragmented and comprised of many independent operators, the market for stylists is highly competitive. In addition, increases in minimum wage requirements may impact the number of stylists considering careers outside the beauty industry. In some markets we have experienced a shortage of qualified stylists. Offering competitive wages, benefits, education and training programs are important elements to attracting and retaining great stylists. In addition, due to challenges facing the for-profit education industry, cosmetology schools, including our joint venture EEG, have experienced declines in enrollment, revenues and profitability in recent years. If the cosmetology school industry sustains further declines in enrollment or some schools close entirely, or if stylists leave the beauty industry, we expect that we would have increased difficulty staffing our salons in some markets. If we are not successful in attracting, training and retaining stylists or in staffing our salons, our same-store sales could decline and our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nChanges in regulatory and statutory laws, such as increases in the minimum wage and changes that make collective bargaining easier, recent changes to overtime requirements, and the costs of compliance and non-compliance with such laws, may result in increased costs to our business.\nWith 9,483 locations and approximately 45,000 employees worldwide, our financial results can be adversely impacted by regulatory or statutory changes in laws. Due to the number of people we employ, laws that increase minimum wage rates, employment taxes, overtime requirements or costs to provide employee benefits may result in additional costs to our Company.\nA number of states and cities in which we do business have recently increased or are considering increasing the minimum wage, with increases generally phased over several years depending upon the size of the employer. The Department of Labor has approved changes, effective December 1, 2016, to the classification of employees deemed to be exempt from the overtime requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act, which are designed to increase the number of employees eligible to receive overtime pay. Increases in minimum wages and overtime pay increase our costs, and our ability to offset these increases through price increases is limited. In fact, increases in minimum wages increased our costs throughout fiscal 2014, 2015 and 2016. In addition, changes in labor laws could increase the likelihood of some or all of our employees being subjected to greater organized labor influence. If a significant portion of our employees were to become unionized, it could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nIncreases in minimum wages, overtime requirements and unionization could also have an adverse effect on the performance of our franchisees, especially if our franchisees are treated as a \"joint employer\" with us by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) or as a large employer under minimum wage statutes because of their affiliation with us. With respect to the NLRB, it is anticipated that its current standard for joint employer relationships may become more lenient and, as such,\nwe may face an increased risk of being alleged to be a joint employer with our franchisees. In addition, we must comply with state employment laws, including the California Labor Code, which has stringent requirements and penalties for non-compliance.\nIn addition to employment laws, we are also subject to a wide range of federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations, including those affecting public companies, product manufacture and sale, and governing the franchisor-franchisee relationship, in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Compliance with new, complex and changing laws may cause our expenses to increase. In addition, any non-compliance with laws or regulations could result in penalties, fines, product recalls and enforcement actions or otherwise restrict our ability to market certain products or attract or retain employees, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to manage cyber threats and protect the security of sensitive information about our guests, employees, vendors or company, we could be subject to business disruption, negative publicity, costly government enforcement actions or private litigation and our reputation could suffer.\nThe nature of our business involves processing, transmission and storage of personal information about our guests as well as employees, vendors and our Company. Cyber-attacks designed to gain access to sensitive information by breaching mission critical systems of large organizations and their third party vendors are constantly evolving, and high profile electronic security breaches leading to unauthorized release of sensitive guest information have occurred at a number of large U.S. companies in recent years. Our efforts, and those of our third party vendors, to protect sensitive guest and employee information may not be successful in preventing a breach in our systems, or detecting and responding to a breach on a timely basis. As a result of a security incident or breach in our systems, our systems could be interrupted or damaged, or sensitive information could be accessed by third parties. If that happened, our guests could lose confidence in our ability to protect their personal information, which could cause them to stop visiting our salons altogether. Such events could lead to lost future sales and adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, as the regulatory environment relating to retailers and other companies' obligations to protect sensitive data becomes stricter, a material failure on our part to comply with applicable regulations could subject us to fines or other regulatory sanctions and potentially to lawsuits. These laws are changing rapidly and vary among jurisdictions. Furthermore, while our franchisees are independently responsible for data security at franchised locations, a breach of guest or vendor data at a franchised location could also negatively affect public perception of our brands. More broadly, our incident response preparedness and disaster recovery planning efforts may be inadequate or ill-suited for a security incident and we could suffer disruption of operations or adverse effects to our operating results.\nWe could be subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and other foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our tax provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are subject to the examination of our income tax returns, payroll taxes and other tax matters by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes and payroll tax accruals. There can be no assurances as to the outcome of these examinations. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical tax provisions and employment taxes. The results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements in the period or periods for which that determination is made.\nOur effective income tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by a number of factors, including changes in the mix of earnings in countries with different statutory tax rates, changes in tax laws, the outcome of income tax audits, and any repatriation of non-U.S. earnings for which we have not previously provided for U.S. taxes.\nChanges to healthcare laws in the U.S. may increase the number of employees who participate in our healthcare plans, which may significantly increase our healthcare costs and negatively impact our operating results.\nWe offer comprehensive healthcare coverage to eligible employees in the United States. Historically, a majority of our eligible employees do not participate in our healthcare plans. Due to changes to healthcare laws in the United States pursuant to the Affordable Care Act (ACA), it is possible that enrollment in the Company\u2019s healthcare plans may increase as employees continue to assess their healthcare alternatives (and as individual penalties for failing to have insurance increase) and if provisions regarding automatic enrollment of new eligible employees become effective in the future. Furthermore, potential fees and or penalties may be assessed as a result of individuals either not being offered healthcare coverage within a limited timeframe or if coverage offered does not meet minimum care and affordability standards. An increase in the number of\nemployees who elect to participate in our healthcare plans, new ACA requirements or if the Company fails to comply with one or more provisions of ACA may significantly increase our healthcare-related costs and negatively impact our operating results.\nWe rely heavily on our management information systems. If our systems fail to perform adequately or if we experience an interruption in their operation, our results of operations may be affected.\nThe efficient operation of our business is dependent on our management information systems. We rely heavily on our management information systems to collect daily sales information and guest demographics, generate payroll information, monitor salon performance, manage salon staffing and payroll costs, inventory control and other functions. Certain of our management information systems are developed and maintained by external vendors, including our POS system. In addition, certain of our systems are outdated or of limited functionality. The failure of our management information systems to perform as we anticipate, or to meet the continuously evolving needs of our business, could disrupt our business and may adversely affect our operating results.\nIf our joint venture with Empire Education Group is unsuccessful, our financial results may be affected.\nWe have a joint venture arrangement with Empire Education Group (EEG), an operator of accredited cosmetology schools. Due to significantly lower financial projections resulting from continued declines in EEG\u2019s enrollment, revenue and profitability we recorded a $13.0 million non-cash impairment charge in the quarter ended December 31, 2015, resulting in a full-impairment of our investment. If EEG is unsuccessful in executing its business plan, or if economic, regulatory and other factors, including declines in enrollment, revenue and profitability continue for the for-profit secondary education market, our financial results may be affected by certain potential liabilities related to this joint venture.\nWe rely on external vendors for products and services critical to our operations.\nOur dependence on vendors exposes us to operational, reputational, financial, and compliance risk. Our vendors are also responsible for the security of certain Company data. In the event that one of our key vendors becomes unable to continue to provide products and services, or their systems fail, are compromised or the quality of their systems deteriorate, we may suffer operational difficulties and financial loss.\nConsumer shopping trends and changes in manufacturer choice of distribution channels may negatively affect both service and product revenues.\nOur North American Value business is located mainly in strip center locations and Walmart Supercenters and the North American Premium business is primarily in mall-based locations. Our salons are partly dependent on the volume of traffic around these locations in order to generate both service and product revenues. We've experienced a proliferation of alternative channels of distribution, like blow dry bars, booth rental facilities, discount brick-and-mortar and online professional products retailers, and manufacturers selling direct to consumers online. Also, product manufacturers may decide to utilize these other distribution channels to a larger extent than in the past and they generally have the right to terminate relationships with us without much advance notice. In some shopping malls, we have experienced declines in traffic due to changes in consumer preferences favoring locations other than malls. These trends could reduce the volume of traffic around our salons, and in turn, our revenues may be adversely affected.\nOur continued success depends in part on the success of our franchisees, who operate independently.\nAs of June 30, 2016, approximately 26% of our salons are franchised locations. We derive revenues associated with our franchised locations from royalties, service fees and product sales to franchised locations. Our financial results are therefore dependent in part upon the operational and financial success of our franchisees. As we increase our focus on our franchise business, our dependence on our franchisees grows.\nWe have limited control over how our franchisees\u2019 businesses are run. Though we have established operational standards and guidelines, they own, operate and oversee the daily operations of their salon locations. If franchisees do not successfully operate their salons in compliance with our standards, our brand reputation and image could be harmed and our financial results could be affected.\nIn addition, our franchisees are subject to the same general economic risks as our Company, and their results are influenced by competition, market trends, and disruptions in their markets due to severe weather and other external events. They may also be limited in their ability to open new locations by an inability to secure adequate financing, especially since many of them are small businesses with much more limited access to financing than our Company, or by the limited supply of favorable real estate for new salon locations. A deterioration in the financial results of our franchisees, or a failure of our franchisees to renew their franchise agreements, could adversely affect our operating results through decreased royalty payments, fees and product revenues.\nIf we are not able to successfully compete in our business markets, our financial results may be affected.\nCompetition on a market by market basis remains challenging as many smaller chain competitors are franchise systems with local operating strength in certain markets and the hair salon industry as a whole is fragmented and highly competitive for customers, stylists and prime locations. Therefore, our ability to attract guests, raise prices and secure suitable locations in certain markets can be adversely impacted by this competition. Our strategies for competing are complicated by the fact that we have multiple brands in multiple segments, which compete on different factors.\nFurthermore, our reputation is critical to our ability to compete and succeed. Our reputation may be damaged by negative publicity on social media or other channels regarding the quality of services we provide. It may also be damaged by factors that are mostly or entirely out of our control, including actions by our franchisees. If we are not able to successfully compete, our ability to grow same-store sales and increase our revenue and earnings may be impaired.\nChanges to interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates may impact our results from operations.\nChanges in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates will have an impact on our expected results from operations. Historically, we have managed the risk related to fluctuations in these rates through the use of fixed rate debt instruments and other financial instruments. In particular, the United Kingdom\u2019s vote in June 2016 to leave the European Union, commonly known as \u201cBrexit,\u201d has increased the volatility of currency exchange rates. If the British pound weakens, it may adversely affect our results of operations.\nFailure to simplify and standardize our operating processes across our brands could have a negative impact on our financial results.\nStandardization of operating processes across our brands, marketing and products will enable us to simplify our operating model and decrease our costs. Failure to do so could adversely impact our ability to grow revenue and realize further efficiencies within our results of operations.\nChanges in our key relationships may adversely affect our operating results.\nWe maintain key relationships with certain companies, including Walmart. In particular, we have 2,808 SmartStyle/Cost Cutters salons within Walmart locations, including 51 salons opened during fiscal year 2016 (net of relocations). The continued operation and growth of this business is dependent on our relationship with Walmart. In addition, our company-owned locations are concentrated with leases with certain major regional and national landlords. Termination, modification or mismanagement, of any of these relationships could significantly reduce our revenues and have a material and adverse impact on our business, our operating results and our ability to grow.\nFailure to control costs may adversely affect our operating results.\nWe must continue to control our expense structure. Failure to manage our cost of product, labor and benefit rates, advertising and marketing expenses, operating lease costs, other store expenses or indirect spending could delay or prevent us from achieving increased profitability or otherwise adversely affect our operating results.\nIf we fail to comply with any of the covenants in our financing arrangements, we may not be able to access our existing revolving credit facility, and we may face an accelerated obligation to repay our indebtedness.\nWe have several financing arrangements that contain financial and other covenants. If we fail to comply with any of the covenants, it may cause a default under one or more of our financing arrangements, which could limit our ability to obtain additional financing under our existing credit facility, require us to pay higher levels of interest or accelerate our obligations to repay our indebtedness.\nChanges in the general economic environment may impact our business and results of operations.\nChanges to the U.S., Canadian and United Kingdom economies have an impact on our business. General economic factors that are beyond our control, such as recession, inflation, deflation, tax rates and policy, energy costs, unemployment trends, extreme weather patterns, other casualty events and other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending, may impact our business. In particular, visitation patterns to our salons can be adversely impacted by increases in unemployment rates and decreases in discretionary income levels.\nBrexit may have economic repercussions, including recession, which could adversely impact our operating results.\nChanges in fashion trends may impact our revenue.\nChanges in consumer tastes, hair product innovation, and fashion trends can have an impact on our financial performance. Our inability to anticipate, gauge and react to changing consumer tastes in a timely manner could adversely impact our revenue.", "PERMNO": 76711, "SIC": 7200, "TIC": "RGS"}
