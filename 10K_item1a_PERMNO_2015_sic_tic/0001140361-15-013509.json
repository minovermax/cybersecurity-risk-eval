RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to other information and risk disclosures contained in this report, we encourage you to consider the risk factors discussed below in evaluating our business. We work to manage and mitigate risks proactively. Nevertheless, the following risk factors, some of which may be beyond our control, could materially impact our results of operations or cause future results to materially differ from current expectations. Please also see \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d in Part II, Item 7.\nWe are dependent upon a continuous supply of raw materials from third party suppliers and would be harmed by a significant, prolonged disruption in supply.\nOur reliance on suppliers and commodity markets to secure thermoplastic resins and other raw materials used in our products exposes us to volatility in the availability of raw materials. In some instances, we depend upon a single source of supply or participate in commodity markets that may be subject to allocations by suppliers. There is no assurance that we could obtain the required raw materials from other sources on as favorable terms. As a result, any significant delay in or disruption of the supply of our raw materials or commodities could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to our customers, substantially increase our cost of materials, require product reformulation or require qualification of new suppliers, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. We believe that our supply management practices are based on an appropriate balancing of the foreseeable risks and the costs of alternative practices and, although we do not anticipate any loss of our supply sources, the unavailability of some raw materials, should it occur, may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nPrice increases in raw materials could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nThe prices for certain raw materials used in our operations have demonstrated volatility over the past few years. The volatility of resin and cotton prices is expected to continue and may be affected by numerous factors beyond our control, including domestic and international economic conditions, labor costs, the price and production levels of oil, competition, import duties and tariffs and currency exchange rates. We attempt to reduce our exposure to increases in those costs through a variety of programs, including opportunistic buying of product in the spot market, entering into contracts with suppliers, and seeking substitute materials. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to offset increased raw material costs through price increases and there may be a delay from quarter to quarter between the timing of raw material cost increases and price increases on our products. If we are unable to offset increased raw material costs, our production costs may increase and our margins may decrease, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nFluctuations in the price, quality and availability of certain portions of our finished goods due to greater reliance on third party suppliers could negatively impact our results of operations.\nBecause we are dependent on third party suppliers for a certain portion of our finished goods, we must obtain sufficient quantities of quality finished goods from our suppliers at acceptable prices and in a timely manner. We have no long-term supply contracts with our key suppliers and our ability to maintain close, mutually beneficial relationships with our third party suppliers is important to the ongoing profitability of our business. Unfavorable fluctuations in the price, quality and availability of these finished goods products could negatively impact our ability to meet the demands of our customers and could result in a decrease in our sales and earnings.\nAs a result of the reduction in overall economic activity, the demand for certain of our products has declined.\nSince certain of our products are used for cleaning buildings and office space as well as general cleaning, as vacancies increase the demand for these products is reduced. Additionally, our distributors, wholesalers and retailers have reduced their investment in inventories. Both of these occurrences have caused shrinkage of available business. A continued reduction in overall economic activity could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur stock price has been, and likely will continue to be, volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock has experienced fluctuations and is likely to fluctuate significantly in the future. Our stock price may fluctuate for a number of reasons, including:\n\u00b7 announcements concerning us or our competitors;\n\u00b7 quarterly variations in operating results;\n\u00b7 introduction or abandonment of new technologies or products;\n\u00b7 divestiture or acquisition of business groups or units;\n\u00b7 limited trading in our stock;\n\u00b7 changes in product pricing policies;\n\u00b7 changes in governmental regulations affecting us; and\n\u00b7 changes in earnings estimates by analysts or changes in accounting policies.\nThese potential factors, as well as general economic, political and market conditions, such as armed hostilities, acts of terrorism, civil disturbances, recessions, international currency fluctuations, or tariffs and other trade barriers, may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock. In addition, stock markets have experienced significant price and volume volatility in the past. This volatility has had a substantial effect on the market prices of securities of many public companies for reasons frequently unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the specific companies. If these broad market fluctuations continue, they may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur common stock is quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board, which may have an unfavorable impact on our stock price and liquidity.\nOur common stock is quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board under the ticker symbol \u201cKATY.\u201d The OTC Bulletin Board is an inter-dealer, over-the-counter market that provides significantly less liquidity than the New York Stock Exchange. Holders of our common stock may be unable to resell their securities at or near their original offering price or at any price. The quotation of our shares on the OTC Bulletin Board may result in a less liquid market available for existing and potential stockholders to trade shares of our common stock, could depress the trading price of our common stock and could have a long-term adverse impact on our ability to raise capital in the future.\nOur inability to implement our strategy of continuously improving our productivity and streamlining our operations could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nDuring the past several years, we have restructured many of our operations in order to maintain a low cost structure, which is essential for us to be competitive in the markets we serve. We must continuously improve our manufacturing efficiencies in order to reduce our overhead structure, as well as develop additional efficiencies within the sourcing/purchasing and administration areas of our operations. The plans and programs we implement for the purpose of improving efficiencies may not have the positive profit-enhancing impact anticipated. In the event we are unable to continue to improve our productivity and streamline our operations, our financial condition and results of operations may be harmed.\nAn increase in interest rates may negatively impact our operating results.\nAs of December 31, 2014, all of our outstanding debt was subject to variable interest rates. An increase in interest rates may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe cost of servicing our debt on which we are required to make interest and principal payments may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition, limit our ability to grow and compete, and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our indebtedness.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had $22.0 million of debt outstanding. Subject to limits contained in the agreements governing our outstanding debt, we may incur additional debt in the future. Our indebtedness places significant demands on our cash resources, which may:\n\u00b7 make it more difficult for us to satisfy our outstanding debt obligations;\n\u00b7 require us to dedicate a substantial portion or even all of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing the amount of our cash flow available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and other general corporate purposes;\n\u00b7 increase the amount of interest expense that we will have to pay because our borrowings are at variable rates of interest which, if increased, will result in higher interest payments;\n\u00b7 limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we compete;\n\u00b7 place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors, some of which have lower debt service obligations and greater financial resources than we do;\n\u00b7 limit our ability to borrow additional funds; and\n\u00b7 increase our vulnerability to existing and future adverse economic and industry conditions.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of principal or interest on our debt, or to refinance such debt, will depend upon our future operating performance, which is subject to general economic and competitive conditions and to financial, business and other factors, many of which we cannot control. There can be no assurance that our business will continue to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt or meet our other cash needs. Should we fail to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to service our debt, we may be required to refinance all or a portion of our existing debt, sell assets at inopportune times or obtain additional financing to meet our debt obligations and other cash needs. We cannot be assured that any such refinancing, sale of assets or additional financing would be possible on terms and conditions, including but not limited to the interest rate, which we would find acceptable.\nWe are obligated to comply with financial and other covenants in our debt agreements that could restrict our operating activities, and the failure to comply with such covenants could result in defaults that accelerate the payment under our debt.\nThe agreements relating to our outstanding debt, including our Credit and Security Agreement (the \u201cBMO Credit Agreement\u201d) with BMO Harris Bank N.A. (\u201cBMO\u201d), contain a number of restrictive covenants that limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u00b7 incur additional debt;\n\u00b7 make certain distributions, investments and other restricted payments;\n\u00b7 limit the ability of restricted subsidiaries to make payments to us;\n\u00b7 enter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u00b7 create certain liens;\n\u00b7 sell assets and if sold, use the proceeds at management\u2019s discretion; and\n\u00b7 consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets.\nOur secured debt also contains other customary covenants, including, among others, provisions relating to the maintenance of the property securing the debt and restricting our ability to pledge assets or create other liens. The failure to comply with the covenants contained in our debt agreements could subject us to default remedies, including the acceleration of all or a substantial portion of our existing indebtedness. If we were to breach any of our debt covenants and did not cure the breach within any applicable cure period, our lender could require us to repay the debt immediately, and/or, could immediately begin proceedings to take possession of the property securing the loan. Our debt arrangements contain cross-default provisions, which means that the lender under those debt arrangements can place us in default and require immediate repayment of its debt if we breach and fail to cure a covenant under certain of our other debt obligations. As a result, any default under our debt covenants could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, our results of operations, our ability to meet our obligations and the market value of our shares.\nIf we are unable to comply with the terms of our debt agreement, we could seek to obtain an amendment to such debt agreement and pursue increased liquidity through additional debt financing and/or the sale of assets. It is possible; however, that we may not be able to obtain amendments from the lender or secure additional debt financing or liquidity through the sale of assets on favorable terms or at all.\nWork stoppages or other labor issues at our facilities or those of our suppliers could adversely affect our operations.\nAt December 31, 2014, we employed 341 persons in our various businesses, of which approximately 52% were subject to a collective bargaining arrangement. As a result, we are subject to the risk of work stoppages and other labor-relations matters. Our union contract will expire in December 2015.\nIf our union employees were to engage in a strike, work stoppage or other slowdown, we could experience a significant disruption of our operations or higher ongoing labor costs. We believe our relationships with our union employees are good, but these relationships could deteriorate. Any failure by us to reach a new agreement upon expiration of such union contracts may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. We are also subject to labor relations issues at entities involved in our supply chain, including both suppliers and those entities involved in transportation and shipping. If any of our suppliers experience a material work stoppage, that supplier may interrupt supply of our necessary production components. This could cause a delay or reduction in our production facilities relating to these products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights adequately or assure that third parties will not claim proprietary rights infringement by us in the future.\nPart of our success depends upon our ability to use and protect proprietary technology and other intellectual property, which generally covers various aspects in the design and manufacture of our products and processes. We own and use tradenames and trademarks worldwide. We rely upon a combination of trade secrets, confidentiality policies, nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements and patent, copyright and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights. The steps we take in this regard may not be adequate to prevent or deter challenges, reverse engineering or infringement or other violation of our intellectual property, and we may not be able to detect unauthorized use or take appropriate and timely steps to enforce our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States.\nWe are not aware of any assertions that our trademarks or tradenames infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties, but we cannot assure that third parties will not claim infringement by us in the future. Any such claim, whether or not it has merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, cause delays in introducing new products in the future or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. As a result, any such claim could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur future performance is influenced by our ability to remain competitive.\nAs discussed in \u201cBusiness - Competition,\u201d we operate in markets that are highly competitive and face substantial competition from numerous competitors in each of our product lines. Our competitive position in the markets in which we participate is subject to external factors. For example, supply and demand for certain of our products is driven by end-use markets and worldwide capacities which, in turn, impact demand for and pricing of our products. Many of our direct competitors are part of large multi-national companies and may have more resources than we do. Any increase in competition may result in lost market share or reduced prices, which could result in reduced gross profit margins. This may impair our ability to grow or even to maintain current levels of sales and earnings. If we are not as cost efficient as our competitors, or if our competitors are otherwise able to offer lower prices, we may lose customers or be forced to reduce prices, which could negatively impact our financial results.\nFailure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\nPursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are required to provide a report by management on internal control over financial reporting, including management\u2019s assessment of the effectiveness of such control. Changes to our business will necessitate ongoing changes to our internal control systems and processes. Internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Therefore, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if we experience difficulties in their implementation, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely harmed, we could fail to meet our reporting obligations and there could be a material adverse effect on our stock price.\nChanges in laws and government regulations affecting environmental compliance and income taxes could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe are subject to many environmental and safety regulations with respect to our operating facilities. Most of our facilities are subject to extensive laws, regulations, rules and ordinances relating to the protection of the environment, including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water and the generation, management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes or other materials. We may incur substantial costs, including fines, damages and criminal penalties or civil sanctions, or experience interruptions in our operations for actual or alleged violations or compliance requirements arising under environmental laws. Our operations could result in violations under environmental laws, including spills or other releases of hazardous substances to the environment. Given the nature of our business, violations of environmental laws may result in restrictions imposed on our operating activities or substantial fines, penalties, damages or other costs, including costs as a result of private litigation. In addition, we may incur significant expenditures to comply with existing or future environmental laws. Costs relating to environmental matters will be subject to evolving regulatory requirements and will depend on the timing of promulgation and enforcement of specific standards that impose requirements on our operations. Costs beyond those currently anticipated may be required under existing and future environmental laws.\nAt any point in time, a number of our tax years are subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions. The results of these audits and negotiations with tax authorities may affect tax positions taken. Additionally, our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted by changes in the geographic mix or level of earnings, which could negatively impact our financial position and results of operations.\nWe are subject to litigation that could adversely affect our operating results.\nFrom time to time we may be a party to lawsuits and regulatory actions relating to our business. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and regulatory proceedings, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings. An unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, regardless of the outcome of any litigation or regulatory proceedings, such proceedings could result in substantial costs and may require that we devote substantial resources to our defense. Further, changes in government regulations both in the United States and Canada could have adverse effects on our business and subject us to additional regulatory actions. We are currently a party to various lawsuits. See Item 3, \u201cLegal Proceedings.\u201d\nWe are primarily self-insured with respect to health insurance and workers\u2019 compensation. If our reserves for health insurance and workers\u2019 compensation claims and other expenses are inadequate, we may incur additional charges if the actual costs of these claims exceed the amounts estimated.\nBecause of high deductibles on our health insurance and workers\u2019 compensation policies, we are effectively self-insured with respect to these coverages. Employee health claims are self-insured except to the extent of stop-loss coverage on large claims. In our financial statements, we maintain a reserve for health insurance and workers\u2019 compensation claims using actuarial estimates from third-party consultants and historical data for payment patterns, cost trends and other relevant factors. We evaluate the accrual rates for our reserves regularly throughout the year and we have in the past made adjustments as needed. Due to the uncertainties inherent in the actuarial process, the amount reserved may differ from actual claim amounts and we may be required to further adjust our reserves in the future to reflect the actual cost of claims and related expenses. If the actual cost of such claims and related expenses exceeds the amounts estimated, we may be required to record additional charges for these claims and/or additional reserves may be required, which would negatively impact our financial position and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to successfully integrate acquisitions into our business and indemnification provisions in our acquisition agreements may not fully protect us.\nWe completed an acquisition in 2014. As a part of our business strategy, we may enter into additional business combinations and acquisitions, although acquisitions require lender approval under our credit agreement. Acquisitions are typically accompanied by a number of risks, including the difficulty of integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired companies, the potential disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management, expenses related to the acquisition and potential unknown liabilities associated with the acquired businesses. Our prior acquisition and any future acquisitions may not ultimately help us achieve our strategic goals and may pose other risks to us, such as require restructurings with facility closures and consolidations. As a result of our previous acquisition, we have added different decentralized operating and accounting systems, resulting in a complex reporting environment. We expect that we will need to continue to modify our accounting policies, internal controls, procedures and compliance programs to provide consistency across all of our operations, in order to increase efficiency and operating effectiveness and improve corporate visibility into our decentralized operations.", "PERMNO": 45890, "SIC": 9995, "TIC": "KATYQ"}
