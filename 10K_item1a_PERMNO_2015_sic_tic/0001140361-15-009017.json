{"cik": "1082510", "company": "UIL HOLDINGS CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nIn addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in the description of these operations contained elsewhere in this report, the financial condition and results of operations of UIL Holdings are subject to various risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are described below. Additional risks, uncertainties and other factors not presently known or currently deemed not to be material may also affect UIL Holdings\u2019 cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe proposed merger of UIL Holdings with Iberdrola USA may cause disruption in our business and, if the proposed merger does not occur, we will have incurred significant expenses, we may need to pay a termination fee under the merger agreement and our stock price may decline.\nOn February 25, 2015, we announced that UIL Holdings had entered into a definitive merger agreement with Iberdrola USA under which Iberdrola USA will acquire UIL Holdings and create a newly listed U.S. publicly traded company. The announcement of the proposed merger, whether or not consummated, may have an impact on our financial performance. The merger agreement generally requires us to operate our business in the ordinary course pending consummation of the proposed merger, but includes certain contractual restrictions on the conduct of our business that may affect our ability to execute on our business strategies and attain our financial goals. Additionally, the announcement of the proposed merger, whether or not consummated, may impact our relationships with employees, suppliers, regulators and other third parties.\nIf the merger agreement is terminated in certain circumstances, UIL Holdings may be required to pay Iberdrola USA a termination fee of $75 million or reimburse Iberdrola USA for its reasonable and documented expenses, subject to a $15 million cap.\nWe may be unable to obtain the approvals required to complete the proposed merger or such approvals may contain material restrictions or conditions which may make it undesirable to complete the proposed merger.\nThe consummation of the proposed merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain customary closing conditions, including the receipt of certain regulatory approvals. If we are unable to obtain these approvals, we would be unable to consummate the proposed merger. Even if we receive such approvals, such approvals may contain conditions on the completion of the proposed merger or require changes to the terms of the proposed merger. Such conditions or changes could have the effect of delaying or denying consummation of the proposed merger or imposing additional costs associated with, or limiting the benefits expected to be derived from, the proposed merger.\nWe cannot predict whether the closing conditions for the proposed merger set forth in the merger agreement will be satisfied or whether the regulatory approvals will be received. As a result, we cannot assure you that the proposed merger will be completed. If the closing conditions, including the receipt of regulatory approvals, for the proposed merger set forth in the merger agreement are not satisfied or waived pursuant to the merger agreement, or if the proposed merger is not completed for any other reason, the market price of our common stock may decline. In addition, if the proposed merger does not occur, we will nonetheless remain liable for expenses that we have incurred related to the proposed merger. The payment of such transaction expenses and the payment of the termination fee and expense reimbursement described above could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, we could be subject to litigation in relation to the proposed merger or in the event the merger is not consummated, which could subject us to liability for damages and result in the incurrence of legal fees.\nWe will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the proposed merger is pending.\nThe work required to complete the proposed merger may place a significant burden on management and internal resources. Management's attention and other company resources may be focused on the proposed merger instead of on day-to-day management activities, including pursuing other opportunities beneficial to us. In addition, while the proposed merger is pending our business operations are generally restricted by the merger agreement to ordinary course of business activities consistent with past practice, which may cause us to forgo otherwise beneficial business opportunities.\nWe may lose management personnel and other key employees and be unable to attract and retain such personnel and employees.\nUncertainties about the effect of the proposed merger on management personnel and employees may impair our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the proposed merger is completed and for a period of time thereafter, which could affect our financial performance.\nLegislation and regulation can significantly affect the structure, cash flows, results of operations and financial condition of our regulated subsidiaries.\nThe rates and authorized returns on equity of UI, CNG, SCG and Berkshire, our regulated subsidiaries, are determined by the FERC, PURA and DPU, as applicable. These commissions also regulate the companies\u2019 accounting, operations, the issuance of certain securities and certain other matters. FERC also regulates the transmission of electric energy, the sale of electric energy at wholesale and certain other matters. The commissions\u2019 policies and regulatory actions could have a material impact on the companies\u2019 cash flows, results of operations and financial condition. Further, while rate regulation is premised on the assumption that rates will be established that are fair, just, and reasonable, regulators have considerable discretion in applying this standard. Thus, the regulatory process does not assure that the Utilities will be able to fully recover their costs or achieve the rate of return allowed by the Connecticut or Massachusetts public utility\n- 15 -\ncommissions and the FERC. In a number of proceedings in recent years, our regulated subsidiaries have been denied recovery, or deferred recovery pending the next general rate case, including denials or deferrals related to major storm costs and construction expenditures. In some instances, denial of recovery may cause the regulated subsidiaries to record an impairment of assets. If the regulated subsidiaries\u2019 costs are not fully and timely recovered through the rates ultimately approved by regulators, our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition, and our ability to earn a return on investment and meet financial obligations, could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, legislation and the regulatory decisions implementing such legislation establish a framework for their operations. Such legislation and regulatory decisions may result in the establishment of revenue requirements that are insufficient for the regulated subsidiaries to maintain customer services at current levels while still earning their allowed return. Legislation and regulatory decisions, including initiatives to promote energy conservation and distributed energy resources, could negatively impact the ability to reach earnings targets and to obtain debt and equity financing at reasonable costs and on acceptable terms. Such decisions could also impact our ability to recover our regulatory assets, including deferred major storm costs. For a further discussion of legislative and regulatory actions, refer to Part II, Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Major Influences on Financial Condition - UIL Holdings Corporation - Legislation and Regulation,\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nUIL Holdings\u2019 liquidity is dependent upon the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends to UIL Holdings, the availability of its short-term credit facility and its ability to access the bank and capital markets.\nUIL Holdings is a holding company and, as such, has no revenue-generating operations of its own. UIL Holdings is dependent on dividends from its subsidiaries and on external financings to provide the cash that is necessary for debt service, to pay administrative costs, to pay common stock dividends to its shareowners and to provide equity contributions to its subsidiaries. Prior to funding UIL Holdings, the subsidiaries have financial obligations that must be satisfied, including among others, their operating expenses, debt service, preferred dividends (in the case of CNG), and obligations to trade creditors. As UIL Holdings\u2019 sources of cash are limited to dividends from its subsidiaries and external financings, its ability to pay its debt obligations and to maintain future cash dividends at the level currently paid to shareowners will be primarily dependent upon sustained earnings from the operations of its subsidiaries.\nFinancial market disruptions could negatively impact our cost of and ability to access capital in the bank and capital markets, thus impacting our ability to meet our financing and liquidity requirements and fund our capital program.\nAll of our financing, liquidity and capital requirements that exceed available cash will be provided by external financing. There is no commitment to provide such financing from any source of funds, other than the short-term credit facility currently available to UIL Holdings and its subsidiaries. We expect to satisfy future external financing needs by the issuance of additional short-term or long-term debt and equity securities. The continued availability of these methods of financing will be dependent on many factors, including conditions in the bank and capital markets and economic conditions generally, as well as the credit ratings, current debt levels and future income and cash flow of UIL Holdings and its subsidiaries. If access to these sources of liquidity becomes constrained, our ability to implement our business strategy could be adversely affected. In addition, a downgrade of our credit ratings or events beyond our control, such as a disruption in global bank and capital markets, could increase our cost of borrowing and cost of capital, or restrict our ability to access the capital markets and negatively affect our ability to maintain and to expand our businesses. See Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note (B), Capitalization and Note (D), Short Term Credit Arrangements\u201d of this Form 10-K for a discussion of UIL Holdings\u2019 financing arrangements.\nIncreases in interest rates could have an adverse impact on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.\nCredit market trends impact the cost of our borrowings. Increases in interest rates could result in increased cost of capital in the issuance of new debt, refinancing of fixed rate debt at maturity, the resetting of rates of the Auction Rate Bonds and the remarketing of tax-exempt bonds. Additionally, we have a short-term credit agreement that permits borrowings at fluctuating interest rates and also permit borrowings for fixed periods of time specified by each borrower at fixed interest rates determined by the Eurodollar interbank market in London (LIBOR). Changes in LIBOR will have\n- 16 -\nan impact on interest expense. For further discussion of our cost of capital and interest rate risk, see Part II, Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources,\u201d and Item 7A, \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,\u201d of this Form 10-K. For further discussion of UIL Holdings\u2019 and its subsidiaries\u2019 revolving credit facilities, see Part II, Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources,\u201d and Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note (D) Short-Term Credit Arrangements.\u201d\nPension and postretirement benefit plans could require significant future contributions to such plans.\nWe provide defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefits for a significant number of employees, former employees and retirees. Financial market disruptions and significant declines in the market values of the investments held to meet the pension and postretirement obligations, discount rate assumptions, participant demographics, and changes in laws and regulations may require us to make significant contributions to the plans. Large funding requirements could adversely impact our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur transmission and distribution systems may not operate as expected, and could require unplanned expenditures, which, if not recovered from our customers, could adversely affect our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur ability to properly operate our transmission and distribution systems is critical to the financial performance of our business. Our transmission and distribution businesses face several operational risks, including the breakdown or failure of or damage to equipment or processes; labor disputes; disruptions in the delivery of electricity and natural gas, including impacts on us or our customers; increased capital expenditure requirements, including those due to environmental regulation; catastrophic events such as fires, explosions, or other similar occurrences; extreme weather conditions beyond equipment and plant design capacity; and other unanticipated operations and maintenance expenses and liabilities. The failure of our transmission and distribution systems to operate as planned may result in increased capital costs, reduced earnings or unplanned increases in operation and maintenance costs. Such costs that are not recoverable from our customers would have an adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may incur substantial capital expenditures and operating expenses in complying with environmental regulations, which, if not recovered from customers, could have an adverse impact on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn complying with existing environmental statutes and regulations and further developments in areas of environmental concern, we may incur substantial capital expenditures for equipment modifications and additions, monitoring equipment and recording devices, as well as additional operating expenses. Environmental damage claims may also arise from the operations of our regulated subsidiaries. If these capital expenditures or potential damage claims are not recovered from customers, they could have an adverse impact on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition. For further discussion of significant environmental issues known to us at this time, see Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note (J), Commitments and Contingencies - Environmental Concerns,\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nIn addition, governmental policy makers, industry representatives and scientists continue to discuss global climate change and potential legislation to reduce greenhouse gases. Due to the high level of uncertainty regarding the character and timing of any legislation or regulations that may be adopted, management is unable to evaluate the potential economic impact of any such measures at this time.\n- 17 -\nEconomic conditions could negatively impact the demand for electricity and natural gas and could impair the financial soundness of customers, which could adversely affect our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition. Such conditions could also impair the financial soundness of our vendors and service providers.\nEconomic conditions impact the demand for electricity and natural gas. If the economic conditions in Connecticut and Massachusetts were to decline, this could cause a reduction in the demand for electricity and natural gas. In addition, economic downturns or periods of high energy supply costs can lead to the development of legislative and regulatory policy designed to promote reductions in energy consumption and increased energy efficiency and self-generation by customers further reducing the demand for electricity and natural gas. The economies of Connecticut and Massachusetts have experienced high unemployment in recent years as evidenced by seasonally-adjusted unemployment rates of 6.4% and 5.5% for Connecticut and Massachusetts, respectively, in December 2014. A period of prolonged economic weakness could impact customers\u2019 ability to pay bills in a timely manner and increase customer bankruptcies, which may lead to increased bad debt expenses or other adverse effects on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, as a result of the continued economic uncertainties affecting the economies of Connecticut, Massachusetts, the United States and other parts of the world, our vendors and service providers could experience serious cash flow problems. As a result, such vendors and service providers may be unable to perform under existing contracts or may significantly increase their prices or reduce their output or performance on future contracts, which could adversely affect our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe loss of key personnel or the inability to hire and retain qualified employees could have an adverse effect on operations.\nCurrently, 35% of the work force, including many experienced workers with specialized skills in constructing and maintaining the electrical and gas infrastructures, is eligible to retire by the end of 2016. The difficulty in finding experienced replacements for these employees, combined with the significant length of time to train such replacements, could lead to an inability to replace all retirees in a timely manner and negatively impact the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to maintain system reliability at its current levels. Additionally, the effective operations of UIL Holdings and its subsidiaries depend on the continued efforts of their respective executive officers, senior management and management personnel. UIL Holdings cannot guarantee that any member of management at the corporate or subsidiary level will continue to serve in any capacity for any particular period of time.\nThe inability of management to maintain good relations and effectively negotiate future collective bargaining agreements with the bargaining units could have an adverse impact on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.\nApproximately 48% of the work force is covered by collective bargaining agreements that expire between March 2015 and November 2018. The inability of management to maintain good relations and effectively negotiate future collective bargaining agreements with the bargaining units could result in increased expenses related to wages and benefits, inefficient and/or ineffective job performance or organized work stoppages, the impact of which could adversely affect our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.\nGrid disturbances, disruption in our networks, pipeline curtailments, security breaches, cyber-attacks, or acts of war or terrorism could negatively impact our operating systems, compromise customer or other information and result in potential financial liability.\nWhile we have not experienced any cyber-attacks that have had material impacts on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition, a disruption or black-out caused by an event that impacts the regional electric grid, regional gas pipelines, or our regulated subsidiaries\u2019 local systems, such as, but not limited to, a transmission facility outage, interstate pipeline curtailments, a security breach, a cyber-attack, an act of war, a geomagnetic disturbance or a terrorist action, could impair our ability to properly manage our data, networks, systems and programs and negatively impact the operation and sustainability of our operating systems.\nFurthermore, any threats or actions that negatively impact the integrity of, security of, or ability to manage our facilities, computer networks, systems, or programs, could cause the information stored there, including confidential customer information or critical operating information, to be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such grid\n- 18 -\ndisturbance, security breach, cyber-attack or act of war or terrorism could result in a significant decrease in revenues, significant expense to repair system damage or security breach, and legal claims or proceedings that could damage our reputation and adversely affect our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.\nWeather could adversely impact our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.\nSevere weather, such as ice and snowstorms, hurricanes and other natural disasters, may cause outages and substantial property damage to our transmission and distribution facilities which may result in additional costs that are generally not insured. The cost of repairing damage to our operating subsidiaries' facilities and the potential disruption of their operations due to such events could be substantial, particularly as customers demand better and quicker response times to outages. In addition, both Connecticut and Massachusetts have established performance standards for utility companies, including UI, CNG and SCG and Berkshire, respectively, relating to storm preparation, including damage assessment, safety and mutual assistance, communication, exercises and restoration in emergency situations. If, upon review, any of our state regulatory authorities finds that our actions were imprudent, some of those restoration costs may not be recoverable from customers and the regulated subsidiaries could be subject to penalties for failure to meet performance standards. The levying of penalties or the inability to recover a significant amount of such restoration costs through the regulatory process could have an adverse impact on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur regulated subsidiaries are subject to significant attention by customers, regulators, legislators and the media, which make them vulnerable to increased regulatory oversight or sanctions.\nBecause utility companies, including our regulated subsidiaries, have large customer bases, are subject to regulation and provide an important service to customers, they are subject to adverse publicity focused on the reliability of their distribution services and the speed with which they are able to respond to electric outages, natural gas leaks and similar interruptions caused by storm damage or other unanticipated events. Adverse publicity of this nature could harm our reputation and those of our regulated subsidiaries, and may make state legislatures, utility commissions and other regulatory authorities less likely to view us and our regulated subsidiaries in a favorable light, and may cause our regulated subsidiaries to be subject to less favorable legislative and regulatory outcomes or increased regulatory oversight. Unfavorable regulatory or legislative outcomes could include more stringent laws and regulations governing our operations, such as reliability and customer service quality standards or vegetation management requirements, as well as fines, penalties or other sanctions or requirements. The imposition of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to complete necessary or desirable gas distribution expansion or infrastructure development projects in a timely manner, which may delay or prevent us from serving our customers or expanding our business.\nAs required by Connecticut\u2019s Comprehensive Energy Strategy, CNG and SCG filed, jointly with Yankee Gas Services Company, a comprehensive natural gas expansion plan (\u201cExpansion Plan\u201d) outlining a structured approach to add approximately 280,000 new gas heating customers (approximately 200,000 of which relate to CNG and SCG) state-wide over the next 10 years. In order to serve new customers to comply with the Expansion Plan, the Gas Companies need to lay significant miles of new pipeline, maintain, expand and potentially upgrade their existing distribution and/or storage infrastructure, and build new gate stations. Various factors may prevent or delay the Gas Companies from completing such projects or make completion more costly, such as the inability to obtain required approval from local or state regulatory and governmental bodies, public opposition to the project, inability to obtain adequate financing, construction delays, cost overruns, and inability to negotiate acceptable agreements relating to rights-of-way, construction or other material development components. As a result, the Gas Companies may not be able to adequately support the proposed customer growth, which would negatively impact their businesses, cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.\nVolatility in the price of natural gas and home heating oil could adversely impact the demand for gas conversions.\nConversion from home heating oil to natural gas requires a significant investment by customers. If the prices of natural gas do not remain sufficiently below the prices of home heating oil, current oil heating customers may elect not to\n- 19 -\nconvert to natural gas. Recent reductions in oil prices demonstrate that it is difficult to predict future home heating costs. In addition, any new regulations imposed on natural gas, particularly on extraction of natural gas from shale formations, could lead to substantial increases in the price of natural gas. Reduced prices for heating oil or increases in in prices for natural gas may cause potential natural gas customers to forgo converting their heating systems to natural gas and as a result, could negatively impact the forecasted growth of the Gas Companies\u2019 businesses, cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.\nNew advances in power generation, energy efficiency, or other technologies that impact the power utility industry could cause an erosion in revenues.\nWith the escalating costs of energy has come the incentive for the development of new technologies for power generation and energy efficiency, and an investment in research and development to make those technologies more efficient and cost-effective. In Connecticut, the state\u2019s Comprehensive Energy Strategy places considerable emphasis on distributed generation, energy efficiency and products that reduce electricity usage. There is potential that distributed generation systems and energy efficiency measures could adversely affect the demand for services of our regulated subsidiaries thus impacting revenues, which would have a negative impact on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are exposed to risks and uncertainties with respect to the Gas Companies and their operations.\nNatural gas distribution activities involve numerous risks that may result in accidents and other operating costs. The Gas Companies depend on gas supply and transportation from gas suppliers on interstate pipelines that are potentially subject to curtailment for various reasons, including loss of supply, failure of equipment, accidents and severe weather. There are also inherent in natural gas distribution activities a variety of hazards, including the risk of explosions on natural gas distribution systems, and other operating risks, all of which could cause financial losses and exposure, significant damage to person and property, environmental contamination and impairment of operations.", "PERMNO": 53663, "SIC": 4931, "TIC": "UIL"}
