{"cik": "1410428", "company": "FORM Holdings Corp.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-30", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur business, financial condition, results of operations and the trading price of our common stock could be materially adversely affected by any of the following risks as well as the other risks highlighted elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Financial Condition and Capital Requirements\nWe may not be able to raise additional capital. Moreover, additional financing may have an adverse effect on the value of the equity instruments held by our stockholders.\nWe may choose to raise additional funds in connection with any potential acquisition of operating businesses or other assets. In addition, we may also need additional funds to respond to business opportunities and challenges, including our ongoing operating expenses, protection of our assets, development of new lines of business and enhancement of our operating infrastructure. While we may need to seek additional funding, we may not be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, the terms of our financings may be dilutive to, or otherwise adversely affect, holders of our common stock. We may also seek additional funds through arrangements with collaborators or other third parties. We may not be able to negotiate arrangements on acceptable terms, if at all. If we are unable to obtain additional funding on a timely basis, we may be required to curtail or terminate some or all of our business plans. Any such financing that we undertake will likely be dilutive to our current stockholders.\nGlobal economic conditions may cause counterparties to our negotiations to delay entering into licensing agreements, product purchase agreements or other business arrangements, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur business plan depends significantly on worldwide economic conditions, and the United States and world economies have recently experienced fluctuating economic conditions. Uncertainty about global economic conditions poses a risk as businesses may postpone spending in response to tighter credit, negative financial news and declines in income or asset values. This response could have a material negative effect on the willingness of parties to enter into revenue generating agreements in a timely manner. Entering into such agreements is critical to our business plan, and our failure to do so could cause material harm to our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards (\u201cNOL\u201ds) of $138,915,000 which expire 20 years from the respective tax years to which they relate. Our ability to utilize our NOLs may be limited under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. The limitations apply if an ownership change, as defined by Section 382, occurs. Generally, an ownership change occurs when certain shareholders increase their aggregate ownership by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage in a testing period (typically three years). Additionally, United States tax laws limit the time during which these carryforwards may be utilized against future taxes. As a result, we may not be able to take full advantage of these carryforwards for federal and state tax purposes. Future changes in stock ownership may also trigger an ownership change and, consequently, a Section 382 limitation.\nRisks Related to our Merger with XpresSpa (the \u201cMerger\u201d)\nWe may not realize the potential value and benefits created by the Merger.\nThe success of the Merger will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the expected potential value and benefits created from integrating our existing businesses with XpresSpa\u2019s business, which includes the maximization of the economic benefits of our strategic vision and plans, cash balances (which, in the case of XpresSpa, would be used for the build-out of new airport locations), financial reporting and analysis functions and legal expertise. The integration process may be complex, costly, and time-consuming. The difficulties of integrating the operations of XpresSpa\u2019s business could include, among others:\n\u00b7 failure to implement our business plan;\n\u00b7 unanticipated issues in integrating the business of both companies;\n\u00b7 loss of key employees with knowledge of our or XpresSpa\u2019s historical business and operations;\n\u00b7 unanticipated changes in applicable laws and regulations; and\n\u00b7 other unanticipated issues, expenses, or liabilities that could impact, among other things, our ability to realize any expected benefits on a timely basis, or at all.\nWe may not accomplish the integration of XpresSpa\u2019s business smoothly, successfully, or within the anticipated costs or time frame. The diversion of the attention of management from our current operations to the integration effort and any difficulties encountered in combining businesses could prevent us from realizing the full expected potential value and benefits to result from the Merger and could adversely affect our business. In addition, the integration efforts could divert our and XpresSpa\u2019s focus and resources from other strategic opportunities and operational matters during the integration process. We are dependent on certain key personnel, and the loss of these key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our success and future prospects largely depend on the skills, experience and efforts of our and XpresSpa\u2019s key personnel, including Andrew D. Perlman, our current Chief Executive Officer and Director, and Edward Jankowski, XpresSpa\u2019s Chief Executive Officer. The loss of Mr. Perlman or Mr. Jankowski or other of our or XpresSpa\u2019s executives, or our failure to retain other key personnel, would jeopardize our ability to execute our strategic plan and materially harm our business.\nOur success will depend in part on relationships with third parties, which relationships may be affected by third-party preferences or public attitudes about the Merger. Any adverse changes in these relationships could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nOur success is dependent on our ability to maintain and renew our and XpresSpa\u2019s business relationships and to establish new business relationships. There can be no assurance that our management will be able to maintain such business relationships, or enter into or maintain new business contracts and other business relationships, on acceptable terms, if at all. The failure to maintain important business relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nOur business and financial condition could be constrained by XpresSpa\u2019s outstanding debt.\nXpresSpa is obligated under the Senior Secured Note payable to Rockmore Investment Master Fund Ltd. (\u201cRockmore\u201d), a related party, which has an outstanding balance of approximately $6,500,000, with a maturity date of May 1, 2018, with an additional one-year extension if both we and Rockmore consent to such extension. The Senior Secured Note accrues interest of 11.24% per annum. XpresSpa has granted Rockmore a security interest in all of its tangible and intangible personal property to secure its obligations under the Senior Secured Note. After the completion of the Merger the debt remains outstanding as an obligation of XpresSpa, but is guaranteed by us.\nMaterial weaknesses may exist when we report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting for purposes of our reporting requirements.\nPrior to the Merger, XpresSpa, as a private company, was not subject to Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\u201cSarbanes-Oxley\u201d). Therefore, XpresSpa\u2019s management and independent auditors were not required to perform an evaluation of XpresSpa\u2019s internal controls over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 in accordance with the provisions of Sarbanes-Oxley. We are required to provide management\u2019s report on internal control over financial reporting in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, as required by Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley. We have not yet assessed the effectiveness of the internal controls for XpresSpa; however, we are not currently aware of any negative indicators.\nBecause the lack of a public market for XpresSpa\u2019s units makes it difficult to evaluate the fairness of the Merger, XpresSpa\u2019s equity holders may have received or receive consideration in the Merger that is greater than or less than the fair market value of XpresSpa\u2019s units.\nThe outstanding equity of XpresSpa is privately held and is not traded in any public market. The lack of a public market makes it difficult to determine the fair market value of XpresSpa. Since the amount of our common stock, preferred stock and warrants to be issued to XpresSpa\u2019s equity holders was determined based on negotiations between the parties, it is possible that the value of our common stock, preferred stock and warrants issued or to be issued in connection with the Merger will be greater than the fair market value of XpresSpa. Alternatively, it is possible that the value of the shares of our common stock, preferred stock and warrants issued or to be issued in connection with the Merger will be less than the fair market value of XpresSpa.\nThe issuance of our securities to XpresSpa equity holders in connection with the Merger diluted the voting power of our current stockholders.\nPursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, we issued to XpresSpa unit holders shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase shares of our common stock, and have issued shares of our preferred stock thereto. Without taking into account any shares of our common stock held by XpresSpa equity holders prior to the completion of the Merger but assuming that all shares held in escrow are released to the former equity holders of XpresSpa, the former equity holders of XpresSpa own approximately 18% of our outstanding common stock (or 33% of our outstanding common stock calculated on a fully diluted basis) and our stockholders prior to the Merger own approximately 82% of our outstanding common stock (or 67% of our outstanding common stock calculated on a fully diluted basis). In addition, the holders of our preferred stock have certain voting rights as specified in the Certificate of Designation of Preferences, Rights and Limitations of FORM Preferred Stock. Accordingly, the issuance of shares of our common stock and our preferred stock to XpresSpa equity holders in connection with the Merger reduced the relative voting power of each share of our common stock held by our current stockholders.\nIf we exercise the option to repay the preferred stock issued in connection with the Merger in stock rather than cash, such repayment may result in the issuance of a large number of shares of common stock which may have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock as well as a dilutive effect.\nPursuant to the terms of the FORM Preferred Stock issued in connection with the Merger, on the seven-year anniversary of the initial issuance date of the shares of FORM Preferred Stock, December 23, 2024, we may repay each share of FORM Preferred Stock, at our option, in cash, by delivery of shares of common stock or through any combination thereof. If we elect to make a payment, or any portion thereof, in shares of common stock, the number of shares deliverable (the \u201cBase Shares\u201d) will be based on the volume weighted average price per share of our common stock for the thirty trading days prior to the date of calculation (the \u201cBase Price\u201d) plus an additional number of shares of common stock (the \u201cPremium Shares\u201d), calculated as follows: (i) if the Base Price is greater than $9.00, no Premium Shares shall be issued, (ii) if the Base Price is greater than $7.00 and equal to or less than $9.00, an additional number of shares equal to 5% of the Base Shares shall be issued, (iii) if the Base Price is greater than $6.00 and equal to or less than $7.00, an additional number of shares equal to 10% of the Base Shares shall be issued, (iv) if the Base Price is greater than $5.00 and equal to or less than $6.00, an additional number of shares equal to 20% of the Base Shares shall be issued and (v) if the Base Price is less than or equal to $5.00, an additional number of shares equal to 25% of the Base Shares shall be issued. Accordingly, if the volume weighted average price per share of our common stock is below $9.00 per share as of the time of repayment and we exercise the option to make such repayment in shares of our common stock, a large number of shares of our common stock may be issued to the holders of the FORM Preferred Stock upon maturity which may have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock. At the seven year maturity date of the FORM Preferred Stock (which shall be the date that is seven years from the closing date of the Merger), we, at our election, may decide to issue shares of our common stock based on the formula set forth above or to re-pay in cash all or any portion of the FORM Preferred Stock.\nOn December 23, 2023, upon the maturity of the FORM Preferred Stock, when determining whether to repay the FORM Preferred Stock in cash or shares of common stock, we expect to consider a number of factors, including our cash position, the price of our common stock and our capital structure at such time. Because we do not have to make a determination as to which option to elect until 2023, it is impossible to predict whether it is more or less likely to repay in cash, stock or a portion of each.\nThe price of our common stock after the Merger may be affected by factors different from those which affected our shares prior to the Merger.\nOur business differs from the business of XpresSpa and, accordingly, our results of operations and the trading price of our common stock following the completion of the Merger may be significantly affected by factors different from those that affected our independent results of operations, as we now conduct activities not undertaken by us prior to the Merger.\nIf any of the events described in \u2018\u2018Risks Related to our Merger with XpresSpa or \u2018\u2018Risks Related to our Business Operations\u2019\u2019 regarding XpresSpa occur, those events could cause the potential benefits of the Merger not to be realized.\nFollowing the completion of the Merger, our current executive officers and certain XpresSpa executive officers and our directors and certain XpresSpa directors direct our business and operations. Additionally, XpresSpa\u2019s business is expected to be an important part of our business following the Merger. As a result, the risks described below in the sections entitled \u2018\u2018Risks Related to our Merger with XpresSpa\u201d or \u201cRisks Related to our Business Operations\u201d regarding XpresSpa herein are among our significant risks. To the extent any of the events described below in either section occur, those events could cause the potential benefits of the Merger not to be realized and the market price of our common stock to decline.\nRisks Related to our Business Operations\nFuture acquisitions or business opportunities could involve unknown risks that could harm our business and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe strive to be a diversified holding company that owns interests in a number of different businesses. We have in the past, and may in the future, acquire businesses or make investments, directly or indirectly through our subsidiaries, that involve unknown risks, some of which will be particular to the industry in which the investment or acquisition targets operate, including risks in industries with which we are not familiar or experienced. Although we intend to conduct appropriate business, financial and legal due diligence in connection with the evaluation of future investment or acquisition opportunities, there can be no assurance that our due diligence investigations will identify every matter that could have a material adverse effect on us. We may be unable to adequately address the financial, legal and operational risks raised by such investments or acquisitions, especially if we are unfamiliar with the relevant industry. The realization of any unknown risks could expose us to unanticipated costs and liabilities and prevent or limit us from realizing the projected benefits of the investments or acquisitions, which could adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, and trading price.\nWe may be unsuccessful in identifying suitable acquisition candidates, which may negatively impact our growth strategy.\nThere can be no assurance given that we will be able to implement our strategy and identify suitable acquisition candidates or consummate future acquisitions on acceptable terms. Our failure to successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates or consummate future acquisitions on acceptable terms could have an adverse effect on our prospects, business activities, cash flow, financial condition, results of operations and stock price.\nAnti-takeover provisions of Delaware law, provisions in our charter and bylaws and our stockholder rights plan could prevent or frustrate attempts by stockholders to change our board of directors or current management and could make a third-party acquisition of control of us difficult.\nWe are a Delaware corporation and, as such, certain provisions of Delaware law could prevent or frustrate attempts by stockholders to change the board of directors or current management, or could delay, discourage or make more difficult a third-party acquisition of control of us, even if the change in control would be beneficial to stockholders or the stockholders regard it as such. We are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL, which prohibits certain \u201cbusiness combination\u201d transactions (as defined in Section 203) with an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d (defined in Section 203 as a 15% or greater stockholder) for a period of three years after a stockholder becomes an \u201cinterested stockholder,\u201d unless the attaining of \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d status or the transaction is pre-approved by our Board of Directors, the transaction results in the attainment of at least an 85% ownership level by an acquirer or the transaction is later approved by our Board of Directors and by our stockholders by at least a 66 2/3 percent vote of our stockholders other than the \u201cinterested stockholder,\u201d each as specifically provided in Section 203. We have also adopted a shareholder rights plan in the form of the Rights Agreement, designed to help protect and preserve our substantial tax attributes primarily associated with our NOLs and research tax credits under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code and related United States Treasury regulations. Although this is not the purpose of the Rights Agreement, it could have the effect of making it uneconomical for a third party to acquire us on a hostile basis.\nThese provisions of the DGCL, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, and the Rights Agreement may delay, discourage or make more difficult certain types of transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over the current market price, and might limit the ability of our stockholders to approve transactions that they think may be in their best interest.\nOur confidential information may be disclosed by other parties.\nWe routinely enter into non-disclosure agreements with other parties, including but not limited to vendors, law firms, parties with whom we are engaged in negotiations, and employees. However, there exists a risk that those other parties will not honor their contractual obligations to not disclose our confidential information. This may include parties who breach such obligations in the context of confidential settlement offers and/or negotiations. In addition, there exists a risk that, upon such breach and subsequent dissemination of our confidential information, third parties and potential licensees may seek to use such confidential information to their advantage and/or to our disadvantage including in legal proceedings in which we are involved. Our ability to act against such third parties may be limited, as we may not be in privity of contract with such third parties.\nWe and our subsidiaries have been, are, and may become involved in litigation that could divert management\u2019s attention and harm our businesses.\nLitigation often is expensive and diverts management\u2019s attention and resources, which could adversely affect our businesses. We may be exposed to claims against us even if no wrongdoing has occurred. Responding to such claims, regardless of their merit, can be time-consuming, costly to defend, disruptive to our management\u2019s attention and to our resources, damaging to our reputation and brand, and may cause us to incur significant expenses. Even if we are indemnified against such costs, the indemnifying party may be unable to uphold its contractual obligations.\nXpresSpa is reliant on international and domestic airplane travel, and the time that airline passengers spend in United States airports post-security. A decrease in airline travel, a decrease in the desire of customers to buy spa services and products, or decreased time spent in airports would negatively impact XpresSpa\u2019s revenues.\nXpresSpa depends upon a large number of airplane travelers with the psychographic propensity for health and wellness, and in particular spa treatments and products, spending significant time post-Transportation Security Administration (\u201cTSA\u201d) security clearance check points.\nIf the number of airline travelers in the United States decreases, if the time that these travelers spend post-TSA security decreases, and/or if travelers ability or willingness to pay for XpresSpa\u2019s products and services diminishes, this could have an adverse effect on XpresSpa\u2019s growth, business activities, cash flow, financial condition and results of operations. Some reasons for these events could include:\n\u2022 terrorist activities impacting either domestic or international travel through airports where XpresSpa operates, causing fear of flying, flight cancellations, or an economic downturn;\n\u2022 a decrease in business spending that impacts business travel, such as a recession;\n\u2022 a decrease in consumer spending that impacts United States leisure travel, such as a recession or a stock market downturn or a change in consumer lending regulations impacting available credit for leisure travel;\n\u2022 an increase in airfare prices that impacts the willingness of United States air travelers to fly, such as an increase in oil prices or heightened taxation from federal or other aviation authorities;\n\u2022 an increase in airplane accident rates, causing United States travelers to decrease the amount that they fly;\n\u2022 scientific studies that malign the use of spa services or the products used in spa services, such as the impact of certain chemicals and procedures on health and wellness; or\n\u2022 streamlined TSA security screening checkpoints, which could decrease the wait time at checkpoints and therefore the time air travelers budget for spending time at the airport.\nXpresSpa\u2019s operating results may fluctuate significantly due to certain factors, some of which are beyond its control.\nXpresSpa\u2019s operating results may fluctuate from period to period significantly because of several factors, including:\n\u2022 the timing and size of new unit openings, particularly the launch of new terminals;\n\u2022 passenger traffic and seasonality of air travel;\n\u2022 changes in the price and availability of supplies;\n\u2022 macroeconomic conditions, both nationally and locally;\n\u2022 changes in consumer preferences and competitive conditions;\n\u2022 expansion to new markets and new locations; and\n\u2022 increases in infrastructure costs including those costs associated with the build-out of new concession locations and renovating existing concession locations.\nXpresSpa\u2019s operating results may fluctuate significantly as a result of the factors discussed above. Accordingly, results for any period are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other period or for any year.\nXpresSpa\u2019s expansion into new airports may present increased risks due to its unfamiliarity with those areas.\nXpresSpa\u2019s growth strategy depends upon expanding into markets where it has little or no meaningful operating experience. Those locations may have demographic characteristics, consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns that are different from those in the markets where its existing operations are located. As a result, new airport terminal operations may be less successful than its concession locations in its current airport terminals. XpresSpa may find it more difficult in new markets to hire, motivate and keep qualified employees who can project its vision, passion and culture. XpresSpa may also be unfamiliar with local laws, regulations and administrative procedures, including the procurement of spa services retail licenses, in new markets which could delay the build-out of new concession locations and prevent it from achieving its target revenues on a timely basis. Operations in new markets may also have lower average revenues or enplanements than in the markets where XpresSpa currently operates. Operations in new markets may also take longer to ramp up and reach expected sales and profit levels, and may never do so, thereby negatively affecting XpresSpa\u2019s results of operations.\nXpresSpa currently relies on a skilled, licensed labor force to provide spa services, and the supply of this labor force is finite. If XpresSpa cannot hire adequate staff for its locations, it will not be able to operate.\nXpresSpa has approximately 720 employees in its locations. Excluding some dedicated retail staff, the majority of these employees are licensed to perform spa services, and hold such licenses as masseuses, nail technicians, aestheticians, barbers and master barbers. The demand for these licensed technicians has been increasing as more consumers gravitate to health and wellness treatments such as spa services. XpresSpa competes not only with other airport-based spa companies but with spa companies outside of the airport for this skilled labor force. In addition, all staff hired by XpresSpa must pass the background checks and security clearances necessary to work in airport locations. If XpresSpa is unable to attract and retain qualified staff to work in its airport locations, its ability to operate will be impacted negatively.\nXpresSpa\u2019s labor force could unionize, putting upward pressure on labor costs.\nCurrently, two XpresSpa locations have a labor force which is unionized. Major players in labor organization, and in particular \u201cUnite Here!\u201d which represents 33,000 employees in the airport concessions and airline catering industries, could target XpresSpa locations for its unionization efforts. In the event of the successful unionization of all of XpresSpa\u2019s labor force, XpresSpa would likely incur additional costs in the form of higher wages, more benefits such as vacation and sick leave, and potentially also higher health care insurance costs.\nXpresSpa competes for new locations in airports, and may not be able to secure new locations.\nXpresSpa participates in the highly competitive and lucrative airport concessions industry, and as a result competes for retail leases with a variety of larger, better capitalized concessions companies as well as smaller, mid-tier and single unit operators. Frequently, an airport includes a spa concept within its retail product set and, in those instances, XpresSpa competes primarily with BeRelax, Terminal Getaway, Massage Bar and 10 Minute Manicure.\nXpresSpa\u2019s leases may be terminated, either for convenience by the landlord or as a result of an XpresSpa default.\nXpresSpa has store locations and kiosks in a number of airports in which the landlord, with prior written notice to XpresSpa, can terminate XpresSpa\u2019s lease, including for convenience or as necessary for airport purposes or operations. If a landlord elects to terminate a lease at an airport, XpresSpa may have to shut down one or more store locations at that airport.\nAdditionally, XpresSpa leases have numerous provisions governing the operation of XpresSpa\u2019s stores. Violation of one or more of these provisions, even unintentionally, may result in the landlord finding that XpresSpa is in default of the lease. Violation of lease provisions may result in fines and, in some cases, termination of a lease.\nXpresSpa\u2019s ability to operate depends on the traffic patterns of the terminals in which it operates, and the cessation or disruption of air traveler traffic in these terminals would negatively impact XpresSpa\u2019s addressable market.\nXpresSpa depends on a high volume of air travelers in its terminals. It is possible that a terminal in which XpresSpa operates could become subject to a lower volume of air travelers, which would significantly impact traffic near and around XpresSpa locations and therefore its total addressable market. Lower volume in a terminal could be caused by:\n\u2022 terminal construction that results in the temporary or permanent closure of a unit, or adversely impacts the volume or pattern of traffic flows within an airport;\n\u2022 an airline utilizing an airport in which XpresSpa operates could abandon that airport or an individual terminal in favor of other airports or terminals, or because it is contracting operations; or\n\u2022 adverse weather conditions could cause damage to the terminal or airport in which XpresSpa operates, resulting in the temporary or permanent closure of a unit.\nFailure to comply with minimum airport concession disadvantaged business enterprise participation goals and requirements could lead to lost business opportunities or the loss of existing business.\nA number of XpresSpa\u2019s leases contain minimum Airport Concession Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (\u201cACDBE\u201d) participation requirements, and bidding on or submitting proposals for new concession contracts often requires that XpresSpa meets or uses good faith efforts to meet certain minimum ACDBE participation requirements. If XpresSpa fails to comply with the minimum ACDBE participation requirements, XpresSpa may be held responsible for a breach of contract, which could result in the termination of a lease and impairment of XpresSpa\u2019s ability to bid on or obtain future concession contracts. To the extent that XpresSpa leases are terminated and XpresSpa is required to shut down one or more store locations, there could be a material adverse impact to its business and results of operations.\nContinued minimum wage increases would negatively impact XpresSpa\u2019s cost of labor.\nXpresSpa compensates its licensed technicians via a formula that includes commissions. As a result, an increase in the minimum wage would increase XpresSpa\u2019s cost of labor.\nIf XpresSpa is unable to protect its customers\u2019 credit card data and other personal information, XpresSpa could be exposed to data loss, litigation and liability, and its reputation could be significantly harmed.\nPrivacy protection is increasingly demanding, and the use of electronic payment methods and collection of other personal information, including order history, travel history and other preferences, exposes XpresSpa to increased risk of privacy and/or security breaches as well as other risks. The majority of XpresSpa\u2019s sales are by credit or debit cards. Additionally, XpresSpa collects and stores personal information from individuals, including its customers and employees.\nXpresSpa may experience security breaches in which credit and debit card information or other personal information is stolen in the future. Although XpresSpa uses secure private networks to transmit confidential information, third parties may have the technology or know-how to breach the security of the customer information transmitted in connection with credit and debit card sales, and its security measures and those of technology vendors may not effectively prohibit others from obtaining improper access to this information. The techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and are often difficult to detect for long periods of time, which may cause a breach to go undetected for an extensive period of time. Advances in computer and software capabilities, new tools, and other developments may increase the risk of such a breach. Further, the systems currently used for transmission and approval of electronic payment transactions, and the technology utilized in electronic payments themselves, all of which can put electronic payment at risk, are determined and controlled by the payment card industry, not by XpresSpa. In addition, contractors, or third parties with whom XpresSpa does business or to whom XpresSpa outsources business operations may attempt to circumvent its security measures in order to misappropriate such information, and may purposefully or inadvertently cause a breach involving such information. If a person is able to circumvent XpresSpa\u2019s security measures or those of third parties, he or she could destroy or steal valuable information or disrupt XpresSpa\u2019s operations. XpresSpa may become subject to claims for purportedly fraudulent transactions arising out of the actual or alleged theft of credit or debit card information, and XpresSpa may also be subject to lawsuits or other proceedings relating to these types of incidents. Any such claim or proceeding could cause XpresSpa to incur significant unplanned expenses, which could have an adverse effect on its business or results of operations. Further, adverse publicity resulting from these allegations could significantly harm its reputation and may have a material adverse effect on it. Although XpresSpa carries cyber liability insurance to protect against these risks, there can be no assurance that such insurance will provide adequate levels of coverage against all potential claims.\nNegative social media regarding XpresSpa could result in decreased revenues and impact XpresSpa\u2019s ability to recruit workers.\nXpresSpa\u2019s affinity among consumers is highly dependent on their positive feelings about the brand, its customer service and the range and quality of services and products that it offers. A negative customer experience that is posted to social media outlets and is distributed virally could tarnish XpresSpa\u2019s brand and its customers may opt to no longer engage with the brand.\nXpresSpa employs people in multiple different jurisdictions, and the employment laws of those jurisdictions are subject to change. In addition, its services are regulated through government-issued operating licenses. Noncompliance with applicable laws could result in employee lawsuits or legal action taken by government authorities.\nXpresSpa must comply with a variety of employment and business practices laws across the United States, Netherlands, and United Arab Emirates. XpresSpa monitors the laws governing its activities, but in the event it does not become aware of a new regulation or fails to comply with a regulation, it could be subject to disciplinary action by governing bodies and potentially employee lawsuits.\nXpresSpa is not currently cash flow positive, and will depend on funding from us to open new locations. In the event that capital is unavailable from us, XpresSpa will not be able to open new locations.\nThroughout its operating history, XpresSpa has not generated sufficient cash from operations to fund its new store development. As a result, it will be dependent upon us to fund its new location growth until such time as it can produce enough cash to profitably fund its own location growth.\nXpresSpa sources, develops and sells products that may result in product liability defense costs and product liability payments.\nThe ingredients in XpresSpa\u2019s products contain ingredients that are deemed to be safe by the United States Federal Drug Administration and the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act. However, there is no guarantee that these ingredients will not cause adverse health effects to some consumers given the wide range of ingredients and allergies amongst the general population. XpresSpa may face substantial product liability exposure for products it sells to the general public or that is uses in its services. Product liability claims, regardless of their merits, could be costly and divert management\u2019s attention, and adversely affect XpresSpa\u2019s reputation and the demand for its products and services. XpresSpa to date has not been named as a defendant in any product liability action.\nThe mobile and/or rugged computing industry is characterized by rapid technological change, and the success of Group Mobile depends upon the frequent enhancement of existing products and services and timely introduction of new products and services that meet Group Mobile\u2019s customers\u2019 needs.\nCustomer requirements for mobile computing products and services are rapidly evolving and technological changes in the industry occur rapidly. To keep up with new customer requirements and distinguish Group Mobile from its competitors in the business of reselling rugged devices, Group Mobile must frequently introduce new products and services and enhancements of existing products and services. Enhancing existing products and services and developing new products and services is a complex and uncertain process. Furthermore, Group Mobile may not be able to launch new or improved products or services before its competition launches comparable products or services. Any of these factors could cause Group Mobile\u2019s business or results of operations to suffer.\nGroup Mobile depends on a small number of OEMs to supply the products and services that it sells and the loss of, or a material change in, a business relationship with a major OEM supplier, could adversely affect our operations, cash flow, and financial position.\nGroup Mobile\u2019s future success is highly dependent on its relationships with a small number of OEM suppliers. Group Mobile\u2019s primary suppliers include Synnex Corporation, Ingram Micro Inc., Xplore Technologies Corporation, and Motion Computing, which combined represent approximately 81% of Group Mobile\u2019s inventory purchases. OEM supplier agreements typically are short-term and may be terminated without cause upon short notice. The loss or deterioration of our relationship with any of our major OEM suppliers, the authorization by OEM suppliers of additional distributors, the sale of products by OEM suppliers directly to our reseller and retail customers and end-users, or our failure to establish relationships with new OEM suppliers or to expand the distribution and supply chain services that we provide OEM suppliers could adversely affect our operations, cash flows, and financial position. In addition, OEM suppliers may face liquidity or solvency issues that in turn could negatively affect our operations, cash flows, and financial position.\nGroup Mobile\u2019s and FLI Charge\u2019s businesses depend upon their ability to keep pace with the latest technological changes and their failure to do so could make Group Mobile and FLI Charge less competitive in their respective industries.\nThe market for Group Mobile\u2019s and FLI Charge\u2019s products and services is characterized by rapid change and technological change, frequent new product innovations, changes in customer requirements and expectations and evolving industry standards. Products using new technologies or emerging industry standards could make Group Mobile\u2019s and FLI Charge\u2019s products and services less attractive. Furthermore, Group Mobile\u2019s and FLI Charge\u2019s competitors may have access to technology not available to Group Mobile and FLI Charge, which may enable them to produce products of greater interest to consumers or at a more competitive cost. Failure to respond in a timely and cost-effective way to these technological developments may result in serious harm to Group Mobile\u2019s and FLI Charge\u2019s businesses and operating results. As a result, Group Mobile\u2019s and FLI Charge\u2019s success will depend, in part, on their ability to develop and market product and service offerings that respond in a timely manner to the technological advances available to Group Mobile\u2019s and FLI Charge\u2019s customers, evolving industry standards and changing preferences.\nIf FLI Charge successfully commercially launches a product, and its product does not achieve widespread market acceptance, it will not be able to generate the revenue necessary to support its business.\nAchieving acceptance of a wire-free recharging system as a preferred method to recharge fixed and mobile electronic devices will be crucial to FLI Charge\u2019s continued success. Consumers and commercial customers will not begin to use or increase the use of FLI Charge\u2019s product unless they agree that the convenience of its solution would be worth the additional expense of purchasing the FLI Charge system. FLI Charge has no history of marketing any product and it and its commercialization partners may fail to generate significant interest in the initial commercial products or any other product it or its partners may develop. These and other factors, including the following factors, may affect the rate and level of the market acceptance:\n\u2022 its products\u2019 price relative to other products or competing methods of recharging;\n\u2022 the effectiveness of its sales and marketing efforts;\n\u2022 the support and rate of acceptance of its technology and solutions including with its joint development partners;\n\u2022 perception by both individual and enterprise users of its system\u2019s convenience, safety and efficiency;\n\u2022 press and blog coverage, social media coverage, and other publicity and public relations; and\n\u2022 regulatory developments related to marketing its products or their inclusion in others\u2019 products.\nIf FLI Charge is unable to achieve or maintain market acceptance, its business would be significantly harmed.\nThe consumer electronics and mobile computing industries are subject to intense competition and rapid technological change, which may result in products or new solutions that are superior to FLI Charge\u2019s technology under development or other future products it may bring to market from time to time. If FLI Charge is unable to anticipate or keep pace with changes in the marketplace and the direction of technological innovation and customer demands, its products may become less useful or obsolete and its operating results will suffer.\nThe consumer electronics and mobile computing industries in general and the power, recharging and alternative recharging segments of that industry in particular are subject to intense and increasing competition and rapidly evolving technologies. Because FLI Charge\u2019s products are expected to have long development cycles, it must anticipate changes in the marketplace and the direction of technological innovation and customer demands. To compete successfully, it will need to demonstrate the advantages of its products and technologies over well-established alternative solutions, products and technologies, as well as newer methods of power delivery and convince consumers and enterprises of the advantages of its products\nand technologies.\nFLI Charge intends to pursue licensing of its wire-free charging technology as a means of commercialization but it may not be able to secure advantageous license agreements.\nFLI Charge is pursuing the licensing of its wire-free technology as a means of commercialization. There can be no assurance that it will be able to achieve partnerships and reach licensing arrangements. Furthermore, the timing and volume of revenue earned from license agreements will be outside of FLI Charge\u2019s control.\nGroup Mobile and FLI Charge could become subject to product liability claims, product recalls, warranty claims, and other potential liability risks that could be expensive, divert management\u2019s attention and harm their businesses.\nThe nature of Group Mobile\u2019s and FLI Charge\u2019s businesses exposes them to potential liability risks that are inherent in the marketing and sale of products used by consumers. Group Mobile or FLI Charge may be held liable if their technology under development now or in the future causes injury or death or is found otherwise unsuitable during usage. Group Mobile\u2019s and FLI Charge\u2019s technology incorporates sophisticated components and computer software. Complex software can contain errors, particularly when first introduced. In addition, new products or enhancements may contain undetected errors or performance problems that, despite testing, are discovered only after installation. In addition, if a product sold by Group Mobile or FLI Charge is defective, whether due to design or manufacturing defects, improper use of the product or other reasons, they or their strategic partners may be required to notify regulatory authorities and/or to recall the product. A required notification to a regulatory authority or recall could result in an investigation by regulatory authorities of their products, which could in turn result in required recalls, restrictions on the sale of the products or other penalties. The adverse publicity resulting from any of these actions could adversely affect the perception of their customers and potential customers. These investigations or recalls, especially if accompanied by unfavorable publicity, could result in substantial costs, loss of revenue and damage to their reputation, each of which would harm their businesses.\nWe have commenced legal proceedings and/or licensing discussions with security, content distribution and/or telecommunications companies. We expect proceedings to be time-consuming, which may adversely affect our ability to operate our business. We expect that licensing discussions may be time consuming and may either, absent any litigation we initiate, fail to lead to a license, or may result in litigations commenced by the potential licensee.\nTo license or otherwise monetize the patent assets that we own, we have commenced legal proceedings and/or attempted to commence licensing discussions with a number of companies, during the course of which we allege that such companies infringe one or more of our patents. The future viability of our licensing program is highly dependent on the outcome of these discussions, and there is a risk that we may be unable to achieve the results we desire from such negotiations and be forced either to accept minimal royalties or commence litigations against the alleged infringer. In addition, the recipients of our licensing overtures have substantially more resources than we do, which could make our licensing efforts more difficult. Furthermore, due to changes in the approach to patent laws around the world it has become much easier for potential licensees to commence proceedings to revoke or otherwise nullify our patents in lieu of engaging in bona fide licensing discussions. There is a real risk that any potential licensee we approach would rather commence proceedings to revoke our patents than engage in any licensing discussions whatsoever.\nWe anticipate that any legal proceedings could continue for several years. While we endeavor, where possible, to engage counsel on a full or partial contingency basis, proceedings may commence that fall outside of contingency arrangements with counsel and may require significant expenditures for legal fees and other expenses. Disputes regarding the assertion of patents and other intellectual property rights are highly complex and technical. Once initiated, we may be forced to litigate against other parties in addition to the originally named defendants. Our adversaries may allege defenses and/or file counterclaims for, among other things, revocation of our patents or file collateral litigations in an effort to avoid or limit liability and damages for patent infringement. If such actions by our adversaries are successful, they may preclude our ability to derive licensing revenue from the patents being asserted.\nThere is a risk that we may be unable to achieve the results we desire from such litigation, which may harm our business. In addition, the defendants in these litigations have substantially more resources than we do, which could make our litigation efforts more difficult.\nThere is a risk that a court will find our patents invalid, not infringed or unenforceable and/or that the USPTO or other relevant patent offices in various countries will either invalidate the patents or materially narrow the scope of their claims during the course of a reexamination, opposition or other such proceeding. In addition, even with a positive trial court verdict, the patents may be invalidated, found not infringed or rendered unenforceable on appeal. This risk may occur either presently or from time to time in connection with future litigations we may bring.\nPatent litigation is inherently risky and the outcome is uncertain. Some of the parties that we believe infringe on our patents are large and well-financed companies with substantially greater resources than ours. We believe that these parties may devote a substantial amount of resources in an attempt to avoid or limit a finding that they are liable for infringing on our patents or, in the event liability is found, to avoid or limit the amount of associated damages. In addition, there is a risk that these parties may file reexaminations or other proceedings with the USPTO or other government agencies in the United States or abroad in an attempt to invalidate, narrow the scope or render unenforceable the patents we own. In addition, as part of our ongoing legal proceedings, the validity and/or enforceability of our patents-in-suit is often challenged in a court or an administrative proceeding.\nWe may not be able to successfully monetize our patents and, thus, we may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of acquisitions from third parties.\nThere is no assurance that we will be able to successfully monetize the patent portfolios that we acquired from third parties. The patents we acquired could fail to produce anticipated benefits, or could have other adverse effects that we currently do not foresee.\nIn addition, the acquisition of a patent portfolio is subject to a number of risks, including, but not limited to the following:\n\u2022 There is a significant time lag between acquiring a patent portfolio and recognizing revenue from those patent assets, if at all. During that time lag, material costs are likely to be incurred that would have a negative effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position.\n\u2022 The integration of a patent portfolio is a time consuming and expensive process that may disrupt our operations. If our integration efforts are not successful, our results of operations could be harmed. In addition, we may not achieve anticipated synergies or other benefits from such acquisition.\nTherefore, there is no assurance that we will be able to monetize an acquired patent portfolio and recoup our investment.\nNew legislation, regulations or court rulings related to enforcing patents could harm our business and operating results.\nIntellectual property is the subject of intense scrutiny by the courts, legislatures and executive branches of governments around the world. Various patent offices, governments or intergovernmental bodies may implement new legislation, regulations or rulings that impact the patent enforcement process or the rights of patent holders and such changes could negatively affect licensing efforts and/or litigations. For example, limitations on the ability to bring patent enforcement claims, limitations on potential liability for patent infringement, lower evidentiary standards for invalidating patents, increases in the cost to resolve patent disputes and other similar developments could negatively affect our ability to assert our patent or other intellectual property rights.\nIt is impossible to determine the extent of the impact of any new laws, regulations or initiatives that may be proposed, or whether any of the proposals will become enacted as laws. Compliance with any new or existing laws or regulations could be difficult and expensive, affect the manner in which we conduct our business and negatively impact our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may seek to internally develop new inventions and intellectual property, which would take time and would be costly. Moreover, the failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights for such inventions would lead to the loss of our investments in such activities.\nPart of our business may include the internal development of new inventions or intellectual property that we may seek to monetize. However, this aspect of our business would likely require significant capital and would take time to achieve. Such activities could also distract our management team from our present business initiatives, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business. There is also the risk that our initiatives in this regard would not yield any viable new inventions or technology, which would lead to a loss of our investments in time and resources in such activities.\nWe cannot be certain that patents will be issued as a result of any future applications, or that any of our patents, once issued, will provide us with adequate protection from competing products. For example, issued patents may be circumvented or challenged, declared invalid or unenforceable, or narrowed in scope. In addition, since publication of discoveries in scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that we will be the first to make our additional new inventions or to file patent applications covering those inventions. It is also possible that others may have obtained or may obtain issued patents that could prevent us from commercializing our products or services or require us to obtain licenses requiring the payment of significant fees or royalties in order to enable us to conduct our business. As to those patents that we may license or monetize, our rights will depend on maintaining our obligations to the third parties under the applicable license agreement, and we may be unable to do so. Our failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights for our inventions would lead to the loss of our investments in such activities, which would have a material and adverse effect on our company.\nMoreover, patent application delays could cause delays in recognizing revenue from our internally generated patents and could cause us to miss opportunities to license patents before other competing technologies are developed or introduced into the market.\nRisks Related to our Capital Stock\nStock prices can be volatile, and this volatility may depress the price of our common stock.\nThe stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations, which have affected the market price of many companies in ways that may have been unrelated to those companies\u2019 operating performance. Furthermore, we believe that our stock price may reflect certain future growth and profitability expectations. If we fail to meet these expectations, then our stock price may significantly decline, which could have an adverse impact on investor confidence. We believe that various factors may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate, perhaps substantially, including, among others, the following:\n\u2022 additions to or departures of our key personnel;\n\u2022 announcements of innovations by us or our competitors;\n\u2022 announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, capital commitments, or new technologies;\n\u2022 new regulatory pronouncements and changes in regulatory guidelines;\n\u2022 developments or disputes concerning our patents and efforts in licensing and/or enforcing our patents;\n\u2022 lawsuits, claims, and investigations that may be filed against us, and other events that may adversely affect our reputation;\n\u2022 changes in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts; and\n\u2022 general and industry-specific economic conditions.\nFuture sales of our shares of common stock by our stockholders could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly, even if our business is otherwise performing well.\nAs of March 30, 2017, we have 19,198,454 shares of common stock issued and outstanding, excluding shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of warrants, options or restricted stock units. As shares saleable under Rule 144 are sold or as restrictions on resale lapse, the market price of our common stock could drop significantly if the holders of shares of restricted stock sell them or are perceived by the market as intending to sell them. This decline in our stock price could occur even if our business is otherwise performing well.\nOwnership of our common stock may be highly concentrated, and it may prevent our existing stockholders from influencing significant corporate decisions and may result in conflicts of interest that could cause our stock price to decline.\nOur and XpresSpa\u2019s executive officers and directors continuing with us beneficially own or control approximately 38% of our common stock on a fully diluted basis. Accordingly, these executive officers and directors, acting individually or as a group, have substantial influence over the outcome of a corporate action requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets or any other significant corporate transaction. These stockholders may also exert influence in delaying or preventing a change in control of us, even if such change in control would benefit our other stockholders. In addition, the significant concentration of stock ownership may adversely affect the market value of our common stock due to investors\u2019 perception that conflicts of interest may exist or arise.\nThe exercise of a substantial number of warrants or options by our security holders may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nShould our warrants outstanding as of March 30, 2017 be exercised, there would be an additional 3,506,679 shares of common stock eligible for trading in the public market. The incentive equity instruments granted to our management, employees, directors and consultants are subject to acceleration of vesting of 75% and 100% (according to the agreement signed with each grantee) upon a subsequent change of control. Such securities, if exercised, will increase the number of issued and outstanding shares of our common stock. Therefore, the sale of the shares of common stock underlying the warrants and options could have an adverse effect on the market price for our securities and/or on our ability to obtain future financing.\nWe have no current plans to pay dividends on our common stock, and our investors may not receive funds without selling their common stock.\nWe have not declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock, nor do we expect to pay any cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. Investors seeking cash dividends should not invest in our common stock for that purpose. We currently intend to retain any additional future earnings to finance our operations and growth and, therefore, we have no plans to pay cash dividends on our common stock at this time. Any future determination to pay cash dividends on our common stock will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will be dependent on our earnings, financial condition, operating results, capital requirements, any contractual restrictions, and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant.\nAccordingly, our investors may have to sell some or all of their common stock in order to generate cash from your investment. You may not receive a gain on your investment when you sell our common stock and may lose the entire amount of your investment.", "PERMNO": 12017, "SIC": 7990, "TIC": "XSPA"}
