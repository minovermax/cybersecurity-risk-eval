{"cik": "1334036", "company": "Crocs, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-23", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the following risk factors and all other information presented within this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risks set forth below are those that our management believes are applicable to our business and the industry in which we operate. These risks have the potential to have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition, liquidity, access to sources of financing, or stock price. The risks included here are not exhaustive and there may be additional risks that are not presently material or known. Because we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment, new risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for us to predict all risk factors, nor can we assess the impact of all such risk factors on our business. Please also refer to the section entitled \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRisks Related to Our Products\nOur success depends substantially on the value of our brand; failure to strengthen and preserve this value, either through our actions or those of our business partners, could have a negative impact on our financial results.\nWe believe much of our success has been attributable to the strength of the Crocs global brand. To be successful in the future, particularly outside of the U.S., where the Crocs global brand may be less well-known or perceived differently, we believe we must timely and appropriately respond to changing consumer demand and leverage the value of our brand across all sales\nchannels. We may have difficulty managing our brand image across markets and international borders as certain consumers may perceive our brand image to be out of style, outdated, or otherwise undesirable. Maintaining, promoting, and growing our brand will depend on our design and marketing efforts, including product innovation and quality, advertising and consumer campaigns, as well as our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment, including our reliance on social media and digital dissemination of advertising campaigns.\nIn the past, several footwear companies, including ours, have experienced periods of rapid growth in revenues and earnings followed by periods of declining sales and losses, and our business may be similarly affected in the future. Consumer demand for our products and our brand equity could also diminish significantly if we fail to preserve the quality of our products, are perceived to act in an unethical or socially irresponsible manner, fail to comply with laws and regulations, or fail to deliver a consistently positive consumer experience in each of our markets.\nAdverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against us, or by us, could also damage our reputation and brand image, undermine consumer confidence in us, and reduce long-term demand for our products, even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operations. Negative claims or publicity involving us, our products, or any of our key employees, endorsers, or business partners could materially damage our reputation and brand image, regardless of whether such claims are accurate. Social media, which accelerates and potentially amplifies the scope of negative publicity, can accelerate, and increase the impact of, negative claims. Further, business incidents that erode consumer trust, such as perceived product safety issues, whether isolated or recurring, in particular incidents that receive considerable publicity or result in litigation, can significantly reduce brand value and have a negative impact on our business and financial results. Additionally, counterfeit reproductions of our products or other infringement of our intellectual property rights, including unauthorized uses of our trademarks by third parties, could harm our brand and adversely impact our business.\nWe face significant competition.\nThe footwear industry is highly competitive. Our competitors include most major athletic and non-athletic footwear companies and retailers with their own private label footwear products. A number of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources, more comprehensive product lines, a broader market presence, longer standing relationships with wholesalers, a longer operating history, greater distribution capabilities, stronger brand recognition, and spend substantially more on product marketing than we do. Our competitors\u2019 greater financial resources and capabilities in these areas may enable them to better withstand periodic downturns in the footwear industry and general economic conditions, compete more effectively on the basis of price and production, launch more extensive or diverse product lines, and more quickly develop new and popular products. Continued demand in the market for casual footwear and readily available offshore manufacturing capacity has also encouraged the entry of new competitors into the marketplace and has increased competition from established companies. Some of our competitors are offering products that are substantially similar, in design and materials, to our products. If we are unable to compete successfully in the future, our sales and profits may decline, we may lose market share, our business and financial results may deteriorate, and the market price of our common stock would likely fall.\nContinuing to rationalize our existing product assortment and introducing new products may be difficult and expensive. If we are unable to do so successfully, our brand may be adversely affected and we may not be able to maintain or grow our current revenue and profit levels.\nTo successfully continue to refine our footwear product line, we must anticipate, understand, and react to the rapidly changing tastes of consumers and provide appealing merchandise in a timely manner. New footwear models that we introduce may not be successful with consumers or our brand may fall out of favor with consumers. If we are unable to anticipate, identify, or react appropriately to changes in consumer preferences, our revenues may decrease, our brand image may suffer, our operating performance may decline, and we may not be able to execute our growth plans.\nIn producing new footwear models, we may encounter difficulties that we did not anticipate during the product development stage. If we are not able to efficiently manufacture new products in quantities sufficient to support wholesale, retail, and e-commerce distribution, we may not be able to recover our investment in the development of new styles and product lines, and we would continue to be subject to the risks inherent to having a limited product line. Even if we develop and manufacture new footwear products that consumers find appealing, the ultimate success of a new style may depend on our pricing. We may introduce products that are not popular, set the prices of new styles too high for the market to bear, or we may not provide the appropriate level of marketing in order to educate the market and potential consumers about our new products. Achieving market acceptance will require us to exert substantial product development and marketing efforts, which could result in a material increase in our selling, general and administrative expenses. There can be no assurance that we will have the resources necessary to undertake such efforts effectively or that such efforts will be successful. Failure to gain market acceptance for new\nproducts could impede our ability to maintain or grow current revenue levels, reduce profits, adversely affect the image of our brand, erode our competitive position, and result in long-term harm to our business and financial results.\nFailure to adequately protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights and counterfeiting of our brand could divert sales, damage our brand image and adversely affect our business.\nWe utilize trademarks, trade names, copyrights, trade secrets, issued and pending patents and trade dress, and design rights on nearly all of our products. We believe that having distinctive marks that are readily identifiable trademarks and intellectual property is important to our brand, our success, and our competitive position. The laws of some countries, for example, China, do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do U.S. laws. We frequently discover products that are counterfeit reproductions of our products or that otherwise infringe on our intellectual property rights. If we are unsuccessful in challenging another party\u2019s products on the basis of trademark or design or utility patent infringement or other infringement, particularly in some foreign countries, or if we are required to change our name or use a different logo, or it is otherwise found that we infringe on others intellectual property rights, continued sales of such competing products by third parties could harm our brand or we may be forced to cease selling certain products, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition, revenues, and results of operations by resulting in the shift of consumer preference away from our products. If our brand is associated with inferior counterfeit reproductions, the integrity and reputation of our brand could be adversely affected. Furthermore, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights are typically met with defenses and counterclaims attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights. We may face significant expenses and liability in connection with the protection of our intellectual property, and if we are unable to successfully protect our rights or resolve intellectual property conflicts with others, our business or financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe also rely on trade secrets, confidential information, and other unpatented proprietary rights and information related to, among other things, the Croslite\u2122 material formulations and product development, particularly where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. Using third-party manufacturers and compounding facilities may increase the risk of misappropriation of our trade secrets, confidential information, and other unpatented proprietary information. The agreements we use in an effort to protect our intellectual property, confidential information, and other unpatented proprietary information may be ineffective or insufficient to prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of such trade secrets and information. A party to one of these agreements may breach the agreement, and we may not have adequate remedies for such breach. As a result, our trade secrets, confidential information, and other unpatented proprietary rights and information may become known to others, including our competitors. Furthermore, our competitors or others may independently develop or discover such trade secrets and information, which would render them less valuable to us.\nFailure to continue to obtain or maintain high-quality endorsers of our products could harm our business.\nWe establish relationships with both celebrity endorsers and design, celebrity, and brand collaborators to develop, evaluate, and promote our products, as well as strengthen our brand. In a competitive environment, the costs associated with establishment and retention of these relationships may increase. If we are unable to maintain current associations and/or to establish new associations in the future, this could adversely affect our brand visibility and strength and result in a negative impact to financial results. In addition, actions taken by celebrity endorsers and collaborators associated with our products that harm the public image and reputations of those endorsers and collaborators could also seriously harm our brand image with consumers and, as a result, could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition.\nWe rely on technical innovation to compete in the market for our products.\nOur success relies on continued innovation in both materials and design of footwear, such as our branded Croslite\u2122 and LiteRide\u2122 materials. Research and development is a key part of our continued success and growth, and we rely on experts to develop and test our materials and products. Croslite\u2122, our branded proprietary closed-cell resin, is the primary raw material used in the vast majority of our footwear and some of our accessories. Croslite\u2122 is carefully formulated to create soft, durable, extremely lightweight, and water-resistant footwear that conforms to the shape of the foot and increases comfort. We continue to invest in research and development in order to refine our materials to enhance these properties and to develop new properties for specific applications. We strive to produce footwear featuring fun, comfort, color, and functionality. If we fail to introduce technical innovation in our products, consumer demand for our products could decline, and if we experience problems with the quality of our products, we may incur substantial expense to remedy the problems.\nRisks Related to the Economy\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had an adverse impact, and may have a future material adverse impact, on our business, operations, liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic drove global uncertainty and disruption and has spread throughout the geographic regions in which we run our business and where our suppliers, third-party manufacturers, retail stores, wholesale customers, and consumers are located. The pandemic has had a material impact on our retail and wholesale channel revenues, predominately in the first half of 2020, and the total impact of the pandemic on us will depend on developments outside of our control, including, among other factors, the duration and spread of the outbreak, actions that may be taken by governmental authorities to contain the outbreak or mitigate its impact, including related restrictions on movement and commercial activities, the economic or other impacts on our wholesale partners, the impact on and recovery time of our supply chain, consequential staffing shortages, manufacturing delays and the uncertainty with respect to the accessibility of additional liquidity or to the capital markets.\nWhile the vast majority of our company-operated stores, our partner stores, and our wholesale partner stores were open as of December 31, 2020, some may close again upon additional COVID-19 outbreaks. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate the length of time of any remaining closures, if further closures will occur, or if consumers will return to purchasing our products at historical levels in retail locations. The inability to sell our products in our retail or wholesale channels has had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations.\nWe also rely upon the facilities of our third-party manufacturers outside of the U.S. to support our business as well as to export our products throughout the world. As a result of COVID-19 and the measures designed to contain the spread of the virus, our third-party manufacturers may not have the materials, capacity, or capability to manufacture our products according to our schedule and specifications, which may negatively impact our ability to manage inventories. If our third-party manufacturers\u2019 operations are curtailed, we may need to seek alternate manufacturing sources, which may be unavailable, more expensive, or face the same constraints. The possibility of and the duration of any production or supply chain disruption, and related financial impact, if any, cannot be estimated at this time. Should any production and distribution closures continue for an extended period of time, the impact on our global supply chain could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. See the risk factor under \u201cRisks Related to International Operations - We depend solely on third-party manufacturers located outside the U.S.\u201d for more information.\nThe effects of COVID-19 could affect our ability to successfully operate in many ways, including, but not limited to, the following factors:\n\u2022the impact of the pandemic on the economies and financial markets of the countries and regions in which we operate, including a prolonged global recession, a decline in consumer confidence and spending, or a further increase in unemployment levels, has resulted, and could continue to result, in consumers having less disposable income and, in turn, decreased sales of our products;\n\u2022\u201cshelter in place\u201d and other similar mandated or suggested isolation protocols, which have disrupted, and could continue to disrupt, our retail locations, partner stores, and brick-and-mortar retailers via store closures or reduced operating hours and decreased retail traffic;\n\u2022difficulty accessing debt and equity on attractive terms, or at all, and a severe disruption and instability in the global financial markets or deterioration in credit and financing conditions may affect our ability to access capital necessary to operate our business;\n\u2022our ability, if necessary, to reduce operating costs and conserve cash;\n\u2022our inability to obtain additional rent and other relief from our landlords if additional retail stores close in response to another outbreak, which may involve litigation or other disruptions;\n\u2022the failure of our wholesale customers, to whom we extend credit, to pay amounts owed to us on time, or at all, particularly if such customers are significantly impacted by COVID-19;\n\u2022the risk that even after the pandemic has initially subsided, fear of COVID-19 re-occurrence could cause customers to avoid public places where our stores and those of our wholesale partners are located such as malls and outlets;\n\u2022operational risk, including, but not limited to, cybersecurity risks as a result of extended remote work arrangements and restrictions on employee travel; and\n\u2022we may be required to revise certain accounting estimates and judgments such as, but not limited to, those related to the valuation of long-lived assets and deferred tax assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nThe rapid development and fluidity of the pandemic precludes any prediction as to the ultimate impact of COVID-19. The full extent of the impact and effects of COVID-19 on our future business, operations, liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations remain uncertain at this time.\nRisks Related to Our Supply Chain\nIf we do not accurately forecast consumer demand, we may have excess inventory to liquidate or have greater difficulty filling our customers\u2019 orders, either of which could adversely affect our business.\nThe footwear industry is subject to cyclical variations, consolidation, contraction and closings, as well as fashion trends, rapid changes in consumer preferences, the effects of weather, general economic conditions, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and other factors affecting consumer demand. In addition, purchase orders from our wholesale customers are generally subject to rights of cancellation and rescheduling by the wholesaler. These factors make it difficult to forecast consumer demand. If we overestimate demand for our products, we may be forced to liquidate excess inventories at discounted prices resulting in losses or lower gross margins. Conversely, if we underestimate consumer demand, we could have inventory shortages, which can result in lower sales, delays in shipments to customers, expedited shipping costs, and adversely affect our relationships with our customers and diminish brand loyalty. Excess inventory, or any failure on our part to satisfy increased demand for our products, could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nOur third-party manufacturing operations must comply with labor, trade, and other laws. Failure to do so may adversely affect us.\nWe require our third-party manufacturers to meet our quality control standards and footwear industry standards for working conditions and other matters, including compliance with applicable labor, environmental, and other laws; however, we do not control our third-party manufacturers or their respective labor practices. A failure by any of our third-party manufacturers to adhere to quality standards or labor, environmental, and other laws could cause us to incur additional costs for our products, generate negative publicity, damage our reputation and the value of our brand, and discourage customers from buying our products. We also require our third-party manufacturers to meet certain product safety standards. A failure by any of our third-party manufacturers to adhere to such product safety standards could lead to a product recall, which could result in critical media coverage; harm our business, brand, and reputation; and cause us to incur additional costs.\nIn addition, if we or our third-party manufacturers violate U.S. or foreign trade laws or regulations, we may be subject to extra duties, significant monetary penalties, the seizure and the forfeiture of the products we are attempting to import, or the loss of our import privileges. Possible violations of U.S. or foreign laws or regulations could include inadequate record keeping of our imported products, misstatements or errors as to the origin, quota category, classification, marketing or valuation of our imported products, and fraudulent visas or labor violations. The effects of these factors could render our conduct of business in a particular country undesirable or impractical and have a negative impact on our operating results. We cannot predict whether additional U.S. or foreign customs quotas, duties, taxes other charges, or restrictions will be imposed upon the importation of foreign produced products in the future or what effect such actions could have on our business or results. See the risk factor under \u201cRisks Related to International Operations - We depend solely on third-party manufacturers located outside the U.S.\u201d for more information.\nWe depend on a number of suppliers for key production materials, and any disruption in the supply of such materials could interrupt product manufacturing and increase product costs.\nWe depend on a number of sources for the primary materials used to make our footwear. We source the elastomer resins that constitute the primary raw materials used in compounding our Croslite\u2122 and LiteRide\u2122 formulations, which we use to produce our various footwear products, from multiple suppliers. If the suppliers we rely on for elastomer resins were to cease production of these materials, we may not be able to obtain suitable substitute materials in time to avoid interruption of our production schedules. We are also subject to market conditions related to supply and demand for our raw materials and any resulting shortages in supply, including those that may be caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. We may have to pay substantially higher prices in the future for the elastomer resins or any substitute materials we use, which would increase our production costs and could have an adverse impact on our product margins. If we are unable to obtain suitable elastomer resins, or if we are unable to procure sufficient quantities of the materials that go into the Croslite\u2122 and LiteRide\u2122 formulations, we may not be able to meet our production requirements in a timely manner or may need to modify our product characteristics,\nwhich could result in less favorable market acceptance, lost potential sales, delays in shipments to customers, strained relationships with customers, and diminished brand loyalty.\nRisks Related to International Operations\nChanges in foreign exchange rates, most significantly but not limited to the Euro, Russian Ruble, Brazilian Real, South Korean Won, Japanese Yen, or other global currencies could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nAs a global company, we have significant revenues and costs denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar (\u201cUSD\u201d). We are exposed to the risk of losses resulting from changes in exchange rates on monetary assets and liabilities within our international subsidiaries that are denominated in currencies other than the subsidiaries\u2019 functional currencies. Likewise, our U.S. companies are also exposed to the risk of losses resulting from changes in exchange rates on monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in a currency other than the USD. We have experienced, and will continue to experience, changes in exchange rates, impacting both our statements of operations and the value of our assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies.\nFurther, our ability to sell our products in foreign markets and the USD value of the sales made in foreign currencies can be significantly influenced by changes in exchange rates. A decrease in the value of foreign currencies relative to the USD could result in lower revenues, gross margin compression, and increased losses from currency exchange rates. Foreign exchange rate volatility could also disrupt the business of the third-party manufacturers that produce our products by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive and more difficult to finance. We pay the majority of our third-party manufacturers, located primarily in Vietnam and China, in USD. In 2020, we experienced decreases of approximately $5.7 million in our Americas segment revenues, primarily as a result of decreases in the value of the Brazilian Real relative to the USD, approximately $3.0 million in our Asia Pacific segment revenues as a result of decreases in the value of Asian currencies relative to the USD, and a decrease of approximately $1.9 million in our EMEA revenues, primarily as a result of decreases in the Russian Ruble relative to the USD. Strengthening of the USD against Asian and European currencies, and various other global currencies, adversely impacts our USD reported results due to the impact on foreign currency translation. While we enter into foreign currency exchange forward contracts to reduce our exposure to changes in exchange rates on monetary assets and liabilities, the volatility of foreign currency exchange rates is dependent on many factors that cannot be forecasted with reliable accuracy and, as a result, our forward contracts may not prove effective in reducing our exposures.\nWe conduct significant business activity outside the U.S., which exposes us to risks of international commerce.\nA significant portion of our revenues is generated from foreign sales. Our ability to maintain the current level of operations in our existing international markets is subject to risks associated with international sales operations. We operate retail stores and sell our products to retailers outside of the U.S. and utilize foreign-based third-party manufacturers. Foreign manufacturing and sales activities are subject to numerous risks, including\n\u2022tariffs, anti-dumping fines, import and export controls, and other non-tariff barriers such as quotas and local content rules;\n\u2022delays associated with the manufacture, transportation, and delivery of products;\n\u2022increased transportation costs due to distance, energy prices, or other factors;\n\u2022delays in the transportation and delivery of goods due to increased security concerns;\n\u2022restrictions on the transfer of funds;\n\u2022restrictions and potential penalties due to privacy laws on the handling and transfer of consumer and other personal information;\n\u2022changes in governmental policies and regulations;\n\u2022political unrest, changes in law, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues like the COVID-19 pandemic, or war, any of which can interrupt commerce;\n\u2022potential violations of U.S. and foreign anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws by our employees, business partners or agents, despite our policies and procedures relating to compliance with these laws;\n\u2022expropriation and nationalization;\n\u2022difficulties in managing foreign operations effectively and efficiently from the U.S.;\n\u2022difficulties in understanding and complying with local laws, regulations, and customs in foreign jurisdictions;\n\u2022longer accounts receivable payment terms and difficulties in collecting foreign accounts receivables;\n\u2022difficulties in enforcing contractual and intellectual property rights;\n\u2022greater risk that our business partners do not comply with our policies and procedures relating to labor, health, and safety; and\n\u2022increased accounting and internal control costs.\nIn addition, we are subject to customs laws and regulations with respect to our export and import activity, which are complex and vary within legal jurisdictions in which we operate. We cannot ensure there will be not be a control failure around customs enforcement despite the precautions we take. We are currently subject to audits by customs authorities. Any failure to comply with customs laws and regulations could be discovered during a U.S. or foreign government customs audit, or customs authorities may disagree with our tariff treatments, and such actions could result in substantial fines and penalties, which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results. In addition, changes to U.S. trade laws may adversely impact our operations. These changes and any changes to the trade laws of other countries may add additional compliance costs and obligations and subject us to significant fines and penalties for non-compliance. Compliance with these and other foreign legal regimes may have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. For more information, please see the risk factors under \u201cRisks Related to International Operations - We depend solely on third-party manufacturers located outside the U.S.\u201d and \u201cRisks Specific to Our Company and Strategy - Our business relies significantly on the use of information technology. A significant disruption to our operational technology or data security breach could harm our reputation and/or our ability to effectively operate our business.\u201d\nFurthermore, as a global company, we are subject to foreign and U.S. laws and regulations designed to combat governmental corruption, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties; criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees; prohibitions on the conduct of our business and on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries; and a materially negative effect on our brand and our operating results. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these foreign and U.S. laws and regulations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, there can be no assurance that our employees, business partners, or agents will not violate our policies.\nWe depend solely on third-party manufacturers located outside of the U.S.\nAll of our footwear products are manufactured by third-party manufacturers, the majority of which are located in Vietnam and China. We depend on the ability of these manufacturers to finance the production of goods ordered, maintain adequate manufacturing capacity, and meet our quality standards. We compete with other companies for the production capacity of our third-party manufacturers, and we do not exert direct control over the manufacturers\u2019 operations. As such, from time to time we have experienced delays or inabilities to fulfill customer demand and orders. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, our largest third-party manufacturer, operating in both Vietnam and China, produced approximately 46%, 38%, and 45%, respectively, and our second largest third-party manufacturer, also operating in both Vietnam and China, produced approximately 22%, 17%, and 15%, respectively, of our footwear unit volume. We cannot guarantee that any third-party manufacturer will have sufficient production capacity, meet our production deadlines, or meet our quality standards. Furthermore, disruption at the facilities of our third-party manufacturing partners as a result of COVID-19, including through the effects of facility closures, reductions in operating hours, labor shortages, and real-time changes in operating procedures, including additional cleaning and disinfection procedures, could have a material adverse effect on our supply chain. See the risk factor under \u201cRisks Related to the Economy - The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and may continue to have, a material adverse impact on our business, operations, liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.\u201d\nForeign manufacturing is subject to additional risks, including transportation delays and interruptions, including those caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, work stoppages, political instability, expropriation, nationalization, foreign currency fluctuations, changing economic conditions, changes in governmental policies and the imposition of tariffs, import and export controls, and other barriers. Because we ceased internal manufacturing in 2018, we can no longer offset any interruption or decrease in supply of our products by increasing production in internal manufacturing facilities, and we may not be able to substitute suitable alternative third-party manufacturers in a timely manner or at acceptable prices. Any disruption in the supply of products from our third-party manufacturers may harm our business and could result in a loss of sales and an increase in production costs, which would adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, manufacturing delays or unexpected demand for our products may require us to use faster, more expensive transportation methods, such as aircraft, which could adversely affect our profit margins. The cost of fuel is a significant component in transportation costs. Increases in the price of petroleum products can increase our transportation costs and adversely affect our product margins.\nIn addition, because our footwear products are manufactured outside the U.S., the possibility of adverse changes in trade or political relations between the U.S. and other countries, political instability, increases in labor costs, changes in international trade agreements and tariffs, adverse weather conditions, or public health issues, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, could significantly interfere with the production and shipment of our products, which would have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results.\nWe, similar to many other companies with overseas operations, import and sell products in other countries that could be impacted by changes to the trade policies of the U.S. and foreign countries (including governmental action related to tariffs, international trade agreements, or economic sanctions). Such changes have the potential to adversely impact our industry and the global demand for our products, and as a result, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nChanges in global economic conditions may adversely affect consumer spending and the financial health of our customers and others with whom we do business, which may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash resources.\nUncertainty about current and future global economic conditions may cause consumers and retailers to defer purchases or cancel purchase orders for our products in response to tighter credit, decreased cash availability, and weakened consumer confidence. Our financial success is sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, both globally and in specific markets, that may adversely affect the demand for our products including recessionary economic cycles, higher interest rates, higher fuel and other energy costs, inflation, increases in commodity prices, higher levels of unemployment, higher consumer debt levels, higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws, public health issues like the COVID-19 pandemic, or other economic factors. If global economic and financial market conditions deteriorate, or remain weak, for an extended period of time, the following factors, among others, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results:\n\u2022Changes in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the USD could have a material impact on our reported financial results.\n\u2022Slower consumer spending may result in our inability to maintain or increase our sales to new and existing customers, cause reduced product orders or product order delays or cancellations from wholesale accounts that are directly impacted by fluctuations in the broader economy, difficulties managing inventories, higher discounts, and lower product margins.\n\u2022If consumer demand for our products declines, we may not be able to profitably operate existing retail stores, due to higher fixed costs of the retail business.\n\u2022A decrease in credit available to our wholesale or distributor customers, product suppliers and other service providers, or financial institutions that are counterparties to our Facility (as defined below) or derivative instruments may result in credit pressures, other financial difficulties, or insolvency for these parties, with a potential adverse impact on our business, our financial results, or our ability to obtain future financing.\n\u2022If our wholesale customers experience diminished liquidity, we may experience a reduction in product orders, an increase in customer order cancellations, and/or the need to extend customer payment terms, which could lead to larger balances and delayed collection of our accounts receivable, reduced cash flows, greater expenses for collection efforts, and increased risk of nonpayment of our accounts receivable.\n\u2022If our manufacturers or other parties in our supply chain experience diminished liquidity, and as a result are unable to fulfill their obligations to us, we may be unable to provide our customers with our products in a timely manner, resulting in lost sales opportunities or a deterioration in our customer relationships.\nRisks Specific to Our Company and Strategy\nWe may be unable to successfully execute our long-term growth strategy, maintain or grow our current revenue and profit levels, or accurately forecast demand and supply for our products.\nOur ability to maintain our revenue and profit levels or to grow in the future depends on, among other things, the continued success of our efforts to maintain our brand image, our ability to bring compelling and profit enhancing footwear offerings to market, our ability to effectively manage or reduce expenses and our ability to expand within our current distribution channels and increase sales of our products into new locations internationally. We are focusing on our core molded footwear heritage by\nnarrowing our product line with an emphasis on higher margin products, as well as developing innovative new casual lifestyle footwear platforms.\nSuccessfully executing our long-term growth and profitability strategy will depend on many factors, including our ability to\n\u2022strengthen and maintain our brand globally;\n\u2022focus on relevant geographies and markets, product innovation, and profitable growth, while maintaining demand for our current offerings;\n\u2022effectively manage our company-operated retail stores to meet operational and financial targets at the retail store level;\n\u2022accurately forecast the global demand for our products, consolidate our distribution and supply chain network to leverage resources, simplify our fulfillment process, and deliver product around the globe efficiently;\n\u2022use and protect the Crocs brand and our other intellectual property in new and existing markets and territories;\n\u2022achieve and maintain a strong competitive position in new and existing markets;\n\u2022attract and retain qualified wholesalers and distributors, including partner store operators;\n\u2022maintain and enhance our social digital marketing capabilities and digital commerce capabilities; and\n\u2022execute multi-channel advertising, marketing, collaboration, and social media campaigns to effectively communicate our message directly to our consumers and employees.\nWhile these strategies, along with other steps to be taken, are intended to improve and grow our business, there can be no assurance this will be the case or that additional steps or accrual of additional material expenses or accounting charges will not be required. If additional steps are required, there can be no assurance that they will be properly implemented or will be successful.\nOur business relies significantly on the use of information technology. A significant disruption to our operational technology or those of our business partners, a privacy law violation, or a data security breach could harm our reputation and/or our ability to effectively operate our business, and our financial results.\nWe rely heavily on the use of information technology systems and networks across all business functions, as do our business partners. The future success and growth of our business depend on streamlined processes made available through information systems, global communications, internet activity, and other network processes. We rely on third-party information services providers worldwide for many of our information technology functions including network, hardware, and software configuration. Additionally, we rely on internal networks and information systems and other technology, including the internet and third-party hosted services, to support a variety of business processes and activities, including procurement and supply chain, manufacturing, distribution, invoicing, and collection of payments. We use information systems for certain human resource activities and to process our employee benefits, as well as to process financial information for internal and external reporting purposes and to comply with various reporting, legal, and tax requirements. Furthermore, the importance of such information technology systems and networks increased in 2020 due to many of our employees working remotely as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We also have outsourced a significant portion of work associated with our finance and accounting, human resources, customer service, and other information technology functions to third-party service providers. Despite our current security and cybersecurity measures, our systems and those of our third-party service providers may be vulnerable to information security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, credit card fraud, phishing, and interruption or loss of valuable business data, and we have been subject to, and will continue to be subject to, various third-party attacks and phishing scams. Any disruption to these systems or networks could result in product fulfillment delays, key personnel being unable to perform duties or communicate throughout the organization, loss of sales, significant costs for data restoration, the inability to interpret data timely to enhance operations, and other adverse impacts on our business and reputation. Denial of service attacks could also materially adversely affect our business.\nWe routinely possess sensitive customer and employee information. Hackers and data thieves are increasingly sophisticated and operate large-scale and complex automated attacks on a daily basis. Any breach of our network may result in the loss of valuable business data, misappropriation of our consumers\u2019 or employees\u2019 personal information, including credit card information, or a disruption of our business. Despite our existing cybersecurity procedures and controls, if our network is breached, it could give rise to unwanted media attention, materially damage our customer relationships, or harm our business, our reputation, and our financial results, which could result in fines or lawsuits. The costs we incur to protect against such information security breaches may materially increase, including increased investment in technology, the costs of compliance with consumer protection laws, and costs resulting from consumer fraud. Our business partners in our supply chain and\ncustomer base also rely significantly on information technology. Despite their existing cybersecurity procedures and controls, if their information systems become compromised, it could, among other things, cause delays in our product fulfillment or reduce our sales, which could harm our business.\nIn addition, the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation, the California Consumer Privacy Act, and other similar evolving privacy laws impose additional obligations on companies regarding the handling of personal data and provide certain individual privacy rights to persons whose data is stored. These regulations may harm or alter the operations of our e-commerce business, add additional compliance costs and obligations, and subject us to significant fines and penalties for non-compliance. Compliance with these and other foreign legal regimes and the associated costs may have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nIf our online e-commerce sites, or those of our customers, do not function effectively, our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected.\nAn increasing amount of our products are sold on our e-commerce sites and third-party e-commerce sites. This shift to e-commerce further accelerated in 2020 as a result of COVID-19. Any failure on our part or on the part of third parties to provide effective, reliable, user-friendly e-commerce platforms that offer a wide assortment of our products could place us at a competitive disadvantage, result in the loss of sales, and could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results. Our e-commerce business may be particularly vulnerable to cyber threats including unauthorized access and denial of service attacks. Sales in our e-commerce channel may also divert sales from our retail and wholesale channels.\nOur financial success depends in part on the strength of our relationships with, and the success of, our wholesale and distributor customers.\nOur financial success is related to the willingness of our current and prospective wholesale and distributor customers to carry our products. We do not have long-term contracts with most wholesale customers, and sales to these customers are generally on an order-by-order basis and subject to cancellation and rescheduling. Our contracts with distributors typically have terms of one to five years and can be terminated or renegotiated if minimum requirements or other terms are not met. If we cannot fill orders in a timely manner, the sales of our products and our relationships may suffer. Alternatively, if our wholesalers or distributors experience diminished liquidity or other financial issues, we may experience a reduction in product orders, an increase in order cancellations and/or the need to extend payment terms, which could lead to larger outstanding balances, delays in collections of accounts receivable, increased expenses associated with collection efforts, increases in bad debt expenses, and reduced cash flows if our collection efforts are unsuccessful. We have recorded material allowances for doubtful accounts in the past and could do so again in the future. Additionally, in 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we recorded $4.1 million of bad debt expense associated with global distributors. Future problems with customers may have a material adverse effect on our product sales, financial condition, results of operations, and our ability to grow our product line.\nOperating company-operated retail stores incurs substantial fixed costs. If we are unable to generate sales, operate our retail stores profitably, or otherwise fail to meet expectations, we may be unable to reduce such fixed costs and avoid losses or negative cash flows.\nOpening and operating company-operated retail stores requires substantial financial commitments, including fixed costs, and are subject to numerous risks including consumer preferences, location, and other factors that we do not control. Declines in revenue and operating performance of our company-operated retail stores could cause us to record impairment charges and have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. During 2020, we opened 11 and closed 27 retail stores, and we operated 351 retail stores at December 31, 2020. Additionally, during 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, our global retail stores were closed for a portion of the year.\nMany of our company-operated retail stores are located in shopping malls and outlet malls, and our success depends in part on obtaining prominent locations and the overall ability of the malls to successfully generate and maintain customer traffic. We cannot control the success of individual malls or store closures by other retailers, which may lead to mall vacancies and reduced customer foot-traffic. In addition, consumer spending and shopping preferences have shifted, and may continue to further shift, away from brick-and-mortar retail to e-commerce channels, both prior to, and as a result of, the COVID-19 pandemic, which may contribute to declining foot-traffic in company-operated retail locations. Continued reduced customer foot-traffic could reduce sales at our company-operated retail stores, including store-in-store locations, or hinder our ability to open retail stores in new markets, which could in turn negatively affect our business and financial results. Similarly, customer foot-traffic as a result of store closures, reduced operating hours, social distancing restrictions, and/or changes in consumer behavior as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic could also have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. In addition, some of our company-operated retail stores occupy street locations that are heavily dependent on customer traffic generated by tourism.\nAny substantial decrease in tourism, resulting from an economic slowdown, political, terrorism, social, or military events, natural disasters, public health issues like the COVID-19 pandemic, or otherwise, is likely to adversely affect sales in our existing stores.\nOur financial results may be adversely affected if substantial investments in businesses and operations fail to produce expected returns.\nFrom time to time, we may invest in business infrastructure, expansion of existing businesses or operations, and acquisitions of new businesses, which require substantial cash investment and management attention. We believe cost effective investments are essential to business growth and profitability; however, significant investments are subject to risks and uncertainties. The failure of any significant investment to provide the returns or profitability we expect, or implementation issues, or the failure to integrate newly acquired businesses could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and divert management attention from more profitable business operations.\nSpecifically, over the last several years, we have implemented numerous information systems designed to support various areas of our business, including a fully-integrated global accounting, operations, and finance enterprise resource planning system, and warehouse management, order management, and internet point-of-sale systems, as well as various interfaces between these systems and supporting back office systems. We have also moved to, and subsequently expanded, a new distribution center in Dayton, Ohio to serve our North American businesses and have planned a new company-operated distribution center in The Netherlands and new third-party operated distribution center in Japan to serve our EMEA and Asia Pacific businesses, respectively. As our business grows, we may also need to make further investments in business systems and distribution capabilities. Issues in implementing or integrating new business operations and new systems with our current operations, failure of these systems to operate effectively, problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems, issues with transitioning to or operating our new distribution centers, cost overruns, or a breach in security of these systems could cause delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of our operations, require significant additional capital investments to remediate, and may have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nWe depend on employees across the globe, the loss of whom would harm our business.\nWe rely on executives and senior management to drive the financial and operational performance of our business. Turnover of executives and senior management can adversely impact our stock price, our results of operations, and our client relationships and may make recruiting for future management positions more difficult or may require us to offer more generous compensation packages to attract top executives. Changes in other key management positions may temporarily affect our financial performance and results of operations as new management becomes familiar with our business. When we experience management turnover, we must successfully integrate any newly hired management personnel within our organization in a timely manner in order to achieve our operating objectives. The key initiatives directed by these executives may take time to implement and yield positive results, and there can be no guarantee they will be successful. If our new executives do not perform up to expectations, we may experience declines in our financial performance and/or delays or failures in achieving our long-term growth strategy.\nFurther, our business depends on our ability to source and distribute products in a timely, efficient, and cost-effective manner. Labor disputes impacting our suppliers, manufacturers, transportation carriers, or ports pose significant threats to our business, particularly if such disputes result in work slowdowns, lockouts, strikes or other disruptions during our peak importing, or manufacturing and selling seasons. Any such disruption could result in delayed or canceled orders by customers, unplanned inventory accumulation or shortages, and increased transportation and labor costs, negatively impacting our results of operations and financial position.\nWe are subject to periodic litigation, which could result in unexpected expenditures of time and resources.\nFrom time to time, we initiate litigation or are called upon to defend ourselves against lawsuits relating to our business. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings. For a detailed discussion of our current material legal proceedings, see Note 17 - Legal Proceedings in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. An unfavorable outcome in any of these proceedings, or any future legal proceedings, could have an adverse impact on our business and financial results. In addition, any significant litigation in the future, regardless of its merits, could divert management\u2019s attention from our operations and result in substantial legal fees. In the past, securities class action litigation has been brought against us. If our stock price is volatile, we may become involved in this type of litigation in the future. Any litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources that are needed to successfully run our business.\nExtreme weather conditions, natural disasters, public health issues, or other events outside of our control could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition.\nThe effects of climate change, natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes, tsunamis, or other adverse weather and climate conditions, and public health issues like the COVID-19 pandemic, whether occurring in the U.S. or abroad, and the consequences and effects thereof, including damage to our supply chain, manufacturing or distribution centers, retail stores, changes in consumer preferences or spending priorities, and energy shortages, have in the past could in the future harm or disrupt our operations or the operations of our vendors, other suppliers, or customers, or result in economic instability that may negatively impact our operating results and financial condition. Additionally, certain catastrophes are not covered by our general insurance policies, which could result in significant unrecoverable losses.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws, and Delaware law contain provisions that could discourage a third party from acquiring us and consequently decrease the market value of an investment in our stock.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws, and Delaware corporate law each contain provisions that could delay, defer, or prevent a change in control of us or changes in our management. These provisions could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for our stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions, which may prevent a change of control or changes in our management that a stockholder might consider favorable. In addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control of us. Any delay or prevention of a change of control or change in management that stockholders might otherwise consider to be favorable could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nFinancial and Accounting Risks\nWe may be required to record impairments of long-lived assets or incur other charges relating to our company-operated retail operations.\nImpairment testing of our retail stores\u2019 long-lived assets requires us to make estimates about our future performance and cash flows that are inherently uncertain. These estimates can be affected by numerous factors, including changes in economic conditions, our results of operations, and competitive conditions in the industry. Due to the fixed-cost structure associated with our retail operations, negative cash flows, or the closure of a store could result in impairment of leasehold improvements, impairment of right-of-use assets, impairment of other long-lived assets, write-downs of inventory, severance costs, significant lease termination costs or the loss of working capital, which could adversely impact our business and financial results. Impairment charges may increase as we continue to evaluate our retail operations. In 2020, we recorded $20.0 million of impairments to our long-lived assets for a retail store in New York City and $1.1 million to our long-lived assets for our former corporate headquarters. The recording of additional impairments in the future may have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results.\nOur quarterly revenues and operating results are subject to fluctuation as a result of a variety of factors, which could increase the volatility of the price of our common stock.\nQuarterly results may also fluctuate as a result of several factors, including new style introductions, general economic conditions, or changes in consumer preferences. Results for any one quarter or year are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year. This could lead to results outside of analyst and investor expectations, which could increase volatility of our stock price.\nOur senior revolving credit facility agreement (as amended to date, the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d) contains financial covenants that require us to maintain certain financial measures and ratios and includes restrictive covenants that limit our ability to take certain actions. A breach of any of those restrictive covenants may cause us to be in default under the Credit Agreement, and our lenders could foreclose on our assets.\nOur Credit Agreement requires us to maintain certain financial covenants. A decline in our operating performance could negatively impact our ability to meet these financial covenants. If we breach any of these restrictive covenants, the lenders could either refuse to lend funds to us or accelerate the repayment of any outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement. We may not have sufficient funds to repay such indebtedness upon a default or be unable to receive a waiver of the default from the lenders. If we are unable to repay the indebtedness, the lenders could initiate a bankruptcy proceeding or collection proceedings with respect to our assets, all of which secure our indebtedness under the Credit Agreement.\nThe Credit Agreement also contains certain restrictive covenants that limit, and in some circumstances prohibit, our ability to, among other things: incur additional debt; sell, lease or transfer our assets; pay dividends on our common stock; make capital expenditures and investments; guarantee debt or obligations; create liens; repurchase our common stock; enter into transactions with our affiliates; and enter into certain merger, consolidation, or other reorganizations transactions. These restrictions could limit our ability to obtain future financing, make acquisitions or needed capital expenditures, withstand the current or future downturns in our business, or the economy in general, conduct operations or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities that may arise, any of which could place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors.\nChanges in the method for determining LIBOR and/or the potential replacement of LIBOR could adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn July 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. It is unclear if at that time LIBOR will cease to exist or if new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021. Our Credit Agreement states that, should LIBOR cease to exist or should another rate become widely recognized as the benchmark rate for USD loans, a rate substantially equivalent to the LIBOR rate in effect prior to its replacement, will be used.\nAt this time, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions convened by the U.S. Federal Reserve, has recommended the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) as a more robust reference rate alternative to U.S. Dollar LIBOR. SOFR is calculated based on short-term repurchase agreements, backed by Treasury securities. SOFR is observed and backward looking, which stands in contrast with LIBOR under the current methodology, which is an estimated forward-looking rate and relies, to some degree, on the expert judgment of submitting panel members. Given that SOFR is a secured rate backed by government securities, it will be a rate that does not take into account bank credit risk, as is the case with LIBOR. SOFR is therefore likely to be lower than LIBOR and is less likely to correlate with the funding costs of financial institutions. Whether or not SOFR attains market traction as a LIBOR replacement tool remains in question.\nIn March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued guidance related to reference rate reform to help facilitate the market transition from existing reference rates to alternative rates. This guidance was available for adoption at the time of its issuance, but we did not adopt it in the year ended December 31, 2020. Further, at this time, it is not possible to predict the effect of any such changes, any establishment of alternative reference rates, or any other reforms to LIBOR that may be enacted in the United Kingdom or elsewhere. Uncertainty as to the nature of such potential changes, alternative reference rates, including SOFR, or other reforms may adversely affect the trading market for LIBOR-based securities, including ours. Furthermore, if LIBOR ceases to exist or a replacement rate is used to determine the interest rate on borrowings under our Credit Agreement, our borrowing cost may increase materially. There is currently no definitive information regarding the future utilization of LIBOR or of any particular replacement rate.\nAs the future of LIBOR at this time is uncertain, the potential effect of any future changes cannot yet be determined but may have an adverse impact on our interest expense and, thus, our results of operations.\nThe risks of maintaining significant cash abroad could adversely affect our cash flows in the U.S., our business, and financial results.\nWe have substantial cash requirements in the U.S., but a significant portion of our cash is generated and held abroad. We generally consider unremitted earnings of subsidiaries operating outside the U.S. to be indefinitely reinvested, and it is not our current intent to change this position. Cash held outside of the U.S. is primarily used for the ongoing operations of the business in the locations in which the cash is held. Most of the cash held outside of the U.S. could be repatriated to the U.S., and under the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Act\u201d), could be repatriated without incurring additional U.S. federal income taxes, although some states will continue to subject cash repatriations to income tax. In some countries, repatriation of certain foreign balances is restricted by local laws and could have adverse tax consequences if we were to move the cash to another country. These limitations may affect our ability to fully utilize our cash resources for needs in the U.S. or other countries and may adversely affect our liquidity.\nChanges in tax laws and unanticipated tax liabilities and adverse outcomes from tax audits or tax litigation could adversely affect our effective income tax rate and profitability.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our effective income tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by a number of factors, including changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws, and the outcome of income tax audits or\ntax litigation in various jurisdictions around the world. We are regularly subject to, and are currently undergoing, audits by tax authorities in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions for prior tax years. Please refer to Note 15 - Commitments and Contingencies and Note 17 - Legal Proceedings in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional details regarding current tax audits. The final outcome of tax audits and related litigation is inherently uncertain and could be materially different than that reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Moreover, we could be subject to assessments of substantial additional taxes and/or fines or penalties relating to ongoing or future audits, which could have an adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. Future changes in domestic or international tax laws and regulations could also adversely affect our effective tax rate or result in higher income tax liabilities. Recent developments, including U.S. tax reform, the European Commission\u2019s investigations of local country tax authority rulings and whether those rulings comply with European Union rules on state aid, as well as the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development\u2019s project on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting, continue to change long-standing tax principles. These and any other additional changes could adversely affect our effective tax rate or result in higher cash tax liabilities.\nWe may fail to meet analyst and investor expectations, which could cause the price of our stock to decline.\nOur common stock is traded publicly and various securities analysts follow our financial results and frequently issue reports on us which include information about our historical financial results as well as their estimates of our future performance. These estimates are based on their own opinions and are often different from management\u2019s estimates or expectations of our business. If our operating results are below the estimates or expectations of public market analysts and expectations of our investors, our stock price could decline.", "PERMNO": 91090, "SIC": 3021, "TIC": "CROX"}
