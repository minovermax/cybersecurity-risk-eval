Risk Factors\n\ufeff\nThe following is a summary of the primary risks associated with the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations, and common stock.\n\ufeff\nRisk Factors Relating to the Corporation\n\ufeff\nReal estate related loans are a significant portion of our loan portfolio.\n\ufeff\nThe Bank offers a variety of loan products, including residential mortgage, consumer, construction and commercial loans. The Bank requires real estate as collateral for many of its loans. At December 31, 2019, approximately 75% ($698.1 million) of its loans were secured by real estate. Loans secured by real estate and the percent of the loan portfolio are reported in Table 14. These real estate loans are located primarily in the Bank\u2019s market area of south central Pennsylvania. Real estate values tend to follow changes in general economic cycles. If a loan becomes delinquent as the result of an economic downturn and the Bank becomes dependent on the real estate collateral as a source of repayment, it is likely that the value of the real estate collateral has also declined. A decline in real estate values means it is possible that the real estate collateral may be insufficient to cover the outstanding balance of a delinquent or foreclosed loan, resulting in a loss to the Bank. In addition, the real estate collateral is concentrated in a small market area of south central Pennsylvania. Localized events such as plant closures or layoffs may affect real estate prices and collateral values and could have a more negative affect on the Bank as compared to other competitors with a more geographically diverse portfolio. As the Bank grows, it is expected that real estate secured loans will continue to comprise a significant part of its balance sheet. Risk of loan default is unavoidable in the banking industry, and Management tries to limit exposure to this risk by carefully monitoring the amount of loans in specific industries and by exercising prudent lending practices and securing appropriate collateral. However, this risk cannot be eliminated and substantial credit losses could result in reduced earnings or losses.\nCommercial loans are a significant portion of our loan portfolio.\n\ufeff\nThe Bank continues to grow its commercial loan portfolio. Commercial purpose loans account for 86% ($796.0 million) of the total loan portfolio. These loans are made to businesses for a variety of commercial purposes and may include fixed and variable rate loans, term loans, and lines of credit. Commercial purpose loans may be secured by real estate, business assets and equipment, personal guarantees, or non-real estate collateral. Commercial purpose loans secured by real estate were $556.8 million at December 31, 2019 and account for 70% of the total commercial loan portfolio. These loans contain all the risks associated with real estate lending as discussed above. In addition, commercial real estate collateral may be more difficult to liquidate for repayment purposes than residential real estate. The repayment of commercial loans is highly dependent upon the success of the business activity and as such maybe more susceptible to risk of loss during a downturn in the economy. Because the Bank\u2019s commercial loan portfolio is concentrated in south-central Pennsylvania, the ability to repay these loans could be affected by deterioration of the economy in this region. As commercial lending continues to be the primary drive of loan growth, these new loans may present additional risk due to a lack of repayment history with the Bank. The Bank attempts to mitigate these risks through its underwriting and loan review process; however, this risk cannot be eliminated and substantial credit losses could result in reduced earnings or losses.\n\ufeff\nThe allowance for loan losses may prove to be insufficient to absorb inherent losses in our loan portfolio.\n\ufeff\nThe Bank maintains an allowance for loan losses that Management believes is appropriate to provide for any inherent losses in the loan portfolio. The amount of the allowance is determined through a periodic review and consideration of several factors, including an ongoing review of the quality, size and diversity of our loan portfolio; evaluation of nonperforming loans; historical loan loss experience; and the amount and quality of collateral, including guarantees, securing the loan.\n\ufeff\nAlthough Management believes the loan loss allowance is adequate to absorb inherent losses in the loan portfolio, such losses cannot be predicted and the allowance may not be adequate. Excessive loan losses could have a material adverse effect on the Bank\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nThe Bank\u2019s lending limit is smaller than many of our competitors, which affects the size of the loans it can offer customers.\n\ufeff\nThe Bank\u2019s lending limit is approximately $20.3 million. Accordingly, the size of the loans that can be offered to customers is less than the size of loans that many of our competitors, with larger lending limits, can offer. This limit affects the Bank\u2019s ability to seek relationships with larger businesses in its market area. Loan amounts in excess of the lending limits can be accommodated through the sale of participations in such loans to other banks. However, there can be no assurance that the Bank will be successful in attracting or maintaining customers seeking larger loans or that it will be able to engage in participation of such loans or on terms favorable to the Bank.\n\ufeff\nThere is strong competition in the Bank\u2019s primary market areas and its geographic diversification is limited.\n\ufeff\nThe Bank encounters strong competition from other financial institutions in its primary market area, which consists of Franklin, Cumberland, Fulton and Huntingdon Counties, Pennsylvania. In addition, established financial institutions not already operating in the Bank\u2019s primary market area may open branches there at future dates or can compete in the market via the Internet. In the conduct of certain aspects of banking business, the Bank also competes with savings institutions, credit unions, mortgage banking companies, consumer finance companies, insurance companies and other institutions, some of which are not subject to the same degree of regulation or restrictions as are imposed upon the Bank. Many of these competitors have substantially greater resources and lending limits and can offer services that the Bank does not provide. In addition, many of these competitors have numerous branch offices located throughout their extended market areas that provide them with a competitive advantage. No assurance can be given that such competition will not have an adverse effect on the Bank\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nChanges in interest rates could have an adverse impact upon our results of operations.\n\ufeff\nThe Bank\u2019s profitability is in part a function of the spread between interest rates earned on investments, loans and other interest-earning assets and the interest rates paid on deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond the Bank\u2019s control, including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and, in particular, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, will influence not only the interest received on loans and investment securities and the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings, but will also affect the Bank\u2019s ability to originate loans and obtain deposits and the value of our investment portfolio. If the rate of interest paid on deposits and other borrowings increases more than the rate of interest earned on loans and other investments, the Bank\u2019s net interest income, and therefore earnings, could be adversely affected. Likewise, the Bank currently has a very low cost of funds that it may be unable to maintain in a raising rate environment. Earnings could also be adversely affected if the rates on loans and other investments fall more quickly than those on deposits and other borrowings. While Management takes measures to guard against interest rate risk, there can be no assurance that such measures will be effective in minimizing the exposure to interest rate risk.\n\ufeff\nUncertainty about the future of LIBOR may adversely affect our business.\n\ufeff\nLIBOR and certain other interest rate \u201cbenchmarks\u201d are the subject of recent national, international, and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. These reforms may cause such benchmarks to perform differently than in the past or have other consequences which cannot be predicted. On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, publicly announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit information to the administrator of LIBOR after 2021. The announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot be guaranteed after 2021. While there is no consensus on what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, a group of market participants convened by the Federal Reserve, the Alternative Reference Rate Committee, has selected the Secured Overnight Financing Rate as its recommended alternative to LIBOR. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York started to publish the Secured Overnight Financing Rate in April 2018. The Secured Overnight Financing Rate is a broad measure of the cost of overnight borrowings collateralized by Treasury securities that was selected by the Alternative Reference Rate Committee due to the depth and robustness of the U.S. Treasury repurchase market. At this time, it is impossible to predict whether the Secured Overnight Financing Rate will become an accepted alternative to LIBOR. The market transition away from LIBOR to an alternative reference rate, such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, is complex and could have a range of adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Management has formed a work group to review the Bank\u2019s exposure to LIBOR, study replacement options and customer communication about the LIBOR change.\n\ufeff\nThe Alternative Reference Rates Committee (\"ARRC\") has proposed that the Secured Overnight Funding Rate (\"SOFR\") replace USD-LIBOR. ARRC has proposed that the transition to SOFR from USD-LIBOR will take place by the end of 2021. The Company has material contracts that are indexed to USD-LIBOR. Industry organizations are currently working on the transition plan. The Corporation is currently monitoring this activity and evaluating the risks involved.\n\ufeff\nOur operational or security systems may experience interruption or breach in security, including cyber-attacks.\n\ufeff\nWe rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business. These systems include our internal network and data systems, as well as those of third party vendors. Any failure, interruption or breach in security or these systems, including a cyber-attack, could result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information. Cyber security risks for financial institutions have significantly increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the Internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists and other external parties, including foreign state actors. Financial services institutions have been subject to, and are likely to continue to be the target of, cyber-attacks, including computer viruses, malicious or destructive code, phishing attacks, denial of service or information or other security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of confidential, proprietary and other information of the institution, its employees or customers or of third parties, or otherwise materially disrupt network access or business operations. Cyber threats could result in unauthorized access, loss or destruction of customer data, unavailability, degradation or denial of service, introduction of computer viruses and other adverse events, causing the Corporation to incur additional costs (such as repairing systems or adding new personnel or protection technologies). Cyber threats may also subject the Corporation to regulatory investigations, litigation or enforcement, require the payment of regulatory fines or penalties or undertaking costly remediation efforts. While we have systems, policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure, interruption or security breach of our information systems, there can be no assurance that any such failures, interruptions or security breaches will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed. The occurrence of any failures, interruptions or security breaches of our information systems could damage our reputation, result in a loss of client business, or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nA large component of fee income is dependent on stock market values.\n\ufeff\nFee income from the Bank\u2019s Investment and Trust Services Department comprises a large percentage of total noninterest income. Fee income from Investment and Trust Services is comprised primarily of asset management fees as measured by the market value of assets under management. As such, the market values are directly related to stock market values. Therefore, any significant change in the value of assets under management due to stock market fluctuations could greatly affect fee income.\n\ufeff\nA large component of fee income is dependent on two deposit services.\n\ufeff\nFee income from the Bank\u2019s debit card is a significant contributor of fee income. As technology changes and consumer payment preferences change it is possible that debit card income does not continue to grow or may decline. The Bank\u2019s overdraft protection program has also been a significant contributor of fee income. It is possible that the usage of this product slows or that regulatory changes effect the fees that can be charged for such services.\n\ufeff\nA large percentage of certificates of deposit have short-term maturities.\n\ufeff\nSeventy percent ($62.3 million) of the Bank\u2019s certificates of deposit are scheduled to mature within one year. If the Bank is unable to retain these deposits, it may require the Bank to access other sources of liquidity that may carry a higher cost. However, these deposits only account for 7.9% of total deposits.\n\ufeff\nA large percentage of deposits may be highly sensitive to changes in interest rates.\n\ufeff\nThirty-eight percent ($429.2 million) of all deposits are in the Bank\u2019s money management product. The interest rate on these deposits generally follows market rates. A large or continuous increase in market rates could result in a rapid increase in the interest expense of these deposits. While the interest rate on this product generally follows market rates, the product is not indexed to a market rate, thereby giving the Bank more control over any rate increases.\n\ufeff\nLiquidity contingency funding is highly concentrated.\n\ufeff\nThe Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh (FHLB). Access to funding through the FHLB is the largest component of the Bank\u2019s liquidity stress testing and contingency funding plans. The ability to access funding from FHLB may be critical if a funding need arises. However, there can be no assurance that the FHLB will be able to provide funding when needed, nor can there be assurance that the FHLB will provide funds to the Bank if its financial condition deteriorates. The inability to access FHLB funding, through a restriction on credit or the failure of the FHLB, could have a materially adverse effect on the Bank\u2019s liquidity management.\n\ufeff\nOur business and financial results could be impacted materially by adverse results in legal proceedings.\n\ufeff\nThe nature of the Corporation\u2019s business generates a certain amount of litigation involving matters arising in the ordinary course of business (and, in some cases, from the activities of companies we have acquired). These legal proceedings, whether founded or unfounded, could result in reputation damage and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation if they are not resolved in a manner favorable to the Corporation. Although we establish legal accruals for legal proceedings when information related to the loss contingencies represented by these matters indicates that both a loss is probable and that the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, we do not have accruals for all legal proceedings where we face a risk of loss. In addition, due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and unpredictability of outcomes of legal proceedings, any amounts that may be accrued or included in estimates of possible losses or ranges of possible losses may not represent the actual loss to the Corporation. We discuss these matters further in Part I Item 3 Legal Proceedings and in Note 20 Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Report.\n\ufeff\nRisk Factors Relating to the Common Stock\n\ufeff\nThe market price of the Corporation\u2019s common stock may be subject to volatility.\nThe Corporation\u2019s common stock trades on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol \u201cFRAF\u201d. The market price of the stock may be subject to fluctuations due to the performance of the Corporation and by fluctuations beyond our control such as general economic or political conditions. Trading volume of the Corporation\u2019s shares is less than that of larger companies and lower trading volume may affect the price.\n\ufeff\nThe Bank's ability to pay dividends to the Corporation is subject to regulatory limitations that may affect the Corporation\u2019s ability to pay dividends to its shareholders.\n\ufeff\nAs a holding company, the Corporation is a separate legal entity from the Bank and does not have significant operations of its own. It currently depends upon the Bank's cash and liquidity to pay dividends to its shareholders. The Corporation cannot assure you that in the future the Bank will have the capacity to pay dividends to the Corporation. Various statutes and regulations limit the availability of dividends from the Bank. It is possible; depending upon the Bank's financial condition and other factors, that the Bank\u2019s regulators could assert that payment of dividends by the Bank to the Corporation would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. In the event that the Bank is unable to pay dividends to the Corporation, the Corporation may not be able to pay dividends to its shareholders.", "PERMNO": 18652, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "FRAF"}
