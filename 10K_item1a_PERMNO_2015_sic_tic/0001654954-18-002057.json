RISK FACTORS.\nForward-Looking and Cautionary Statements\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Prospective investors should carefully consider the following risks and uncertainties and all other information contained or referred to in this Annual Report on Form 10-K before investing in our common stock. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently deem immaterial, also may become important factors that affect us. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose some or all of your investment.\nRisks related to our business\nLegislative and regulatory changes can influence demand for our solutions and could adversely affect our business.\nThe market for our solutions depends in part on the requirements of the SEC and other regulatory bodies. Any legislation or rulemaking substantially affecting the content or method of delivery of documents to be filed with these regulatory bodies could have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, evolving market practices in light of regulatory developments could adversely affect the demand for our solutions. Uncertainty caused by political change in the United States and European Union (particularly Brexit) heightens regulatory uncertainty in these areas. For example, the White House and Congressional leadership have publicly announced a goal of repealing or amending parts of the Dodd Frank Act, as well as certain regulations affecting the financial services industry. New legislation, or a significant change in rules, regulations, directives or standards could reduce demand for our products and services. Regulatory changes could also increase expenses as we modify our products and services to comply with new requirements and retain relevancy, impose limitations on our operations, and increase compliance or litigation expense, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe environment in which we compete is highly competitive, which creates adverse pricing pressures and may harm our business and operating results if we cannot compete effectively.\nCompetition in our businesses is intense. The speed and accuracy with which we can meet customers\u2019 needs, the price of our services and the quality of our products and supporting services are factors in this competition. In our disclosure management business, we compete directly with several other service providers having similar degrees of specialization.\nOur print and financial communications business faces diverse competition from a variety of companies including commercial printers, in-house print operations, direct marketing agencies, facilities management companies, software providers and other consultants. In commercial printing services, we compete with general commercial printers, which are far more numerous than those in the financial printing market.\nThese competitive pressures could reduce our revenue and earnings.\nApproximately 9% of our revenue is generated overseas and if the global financial markets become unstable again, it may adversely impact our revenue.\nApproximately 9% of our annual revenue is generated in Europe. Over the past decade, global financial markets have experienced periods of extreme disruptions, including severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, increases in unemployment rates and uncertainty about economic stability. While the global markets are currently relatively stable, we are unable to predict the timing, likely duration and severity of potential future disruptions in the financial markets and adverse global economic conditions, and if such uncertainty returns and economic conditions again deteriorate, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. The consequences of such adverse effects could include interruptions or delays in our ability to perform services or to get paid for services rendered.\nOur revenue growth rate in the recent period relating to our Platform and Technology business may not be indicative of this business segment\u2019s future performance.\nWe experienced a revenue growth rate of 49% from 2016 to 2017 with respect to our Platform and Technology revenue stream. Much of this increase was due to the success of our ACCESSWIRE business. Our historical revenue growth rate of the Platform and Technology revenue stream is not indicative of future growth, and we may not achieve similar revenue growth rates in future periods. You should not rely on our revenue or revenue growth for any prior quarterly or annual periods as any indication of our future revenue or revenue growth. If we are unable to maintain consistent revenue or revenue growth, our stock price could be volatile, and it may be difficult to achieve and maintain profitability.\nThe success of our cloud-based software largely depends on our ability to provide reliable solutions to our customers. If a customer were to experience a product defect, a disruption in its ability to use our solutions or a security flaw, demand for our solutions could be diminished, we could be subject to substantial liability and our business could suffer.\nOur Platform and Technology solutions are complex and we often release new features. As such, our solutions could have errors, defects, viruses or security flaws that could result in unanticipated downtime for our customers and harm our reputation and our business. Internet-based software frequently contains undetected errors or security flaws when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released. We might from time to time find such defects in our solutions, the detection and correction of which could be time consuming and costly. Since our customers use our solutions for important aspects of their business, any errors, defects, disruptions in access, security flaws, viruses, data corruption or other performance problems with our solutions could hurt our reputation and may damage our customers\u2019 businesses. If that occurs, customers could elect not to renew, could delay or withhold payment to us or may make warranty or other claims against us, which could result in an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts, an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable or the expense and risk of litigation. We could also lose future sales. In addition, a security breach of our solutions could result in our future business prospects being materially adversely impacted.\nA substantial portion of our business is derived from our ACCESSWIRE brand, which is dependent on technology and key partners.\nAs noted, our ACCESSWIRE brand has been vital to the increase in revenue associated with our Platform and Technology revenue stream. ACCESSWIRE is dependent upon a few key partners for news distribution, some of which are also partners that we rely on for other shareholder communications services. A disruption in any of these partnership relationships could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results and the inability to procure new key partners could impact the growth of the ACCESSWIRE brand, particularly with respect to public company news distribution. Furthermore, we acquired software with the acquisition of ACCESSWIRE. Any performance issues with this technology could also have a material adverse impact on our ability to serve our customers and thus our ability to generate revenue.\nFailure to manage our growth may adversely affect our business or operations.\nSince 2013, we have experienced overall growth in our business, customer base, employee headcount and operations, and we expect to continue to grow our business over the next several years. This growth places a significant strain on our executive management team and employees and on our operating and financial systems. To manage our future growth, we must continue to scale our business functions, improve our financial and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures and expand and train our work force. In particular, we grew from 24 employees as of December 31, 2012 to more than 66 employees as of December 31, 2017. We anticipate that additional investments in sales personnel, infrastructure and research and development spending will be required to:\n\u25cf\nscale our operations and increase productivity;\n\u25cf\naddress the needs of our customers;\n\u25cf\nfurther develop and enhance our existing solutions and offerings; and\n\u25cf\ndevelop new technology.\nWe cannot assure you that our controls, systems and procedures will be adequate to support our future operations or that we will be able to manage our growth effectively. We also cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to expand our market presence in the United States and other current markets or successfully establish our presence in other markets. Failure to effectively manage growth could result in difficulty or delays in deploying customers, declines in quality or customer satisfaction, increases in costs, difficulties in introducing new features or other operational difficulties, and any of these difficulties could adversely impact our business performance and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to retain our key employees and attract and retain other qualified personnel, our business could suffer.\nOur ability to grow and our future success will depend to a significant extent on the continued contributions of our key executives, managers and employees. In addition, many of our individual technical and sales personnel have extensive experience in our business operations and/or have valuable customer relationships that would be difficult to replace. Their departure, if unexpected and unplanned for, could cause a disruption to our business. Our competition for these individuals is intense, especially in the markets in which we operate. We may not succeed in identifying, attracting and retaining these personnel. Further, competitors and other entities have in the past recruited and may in the future attempt to recruit our employees, particularly our sales personnel. The loss of the services of our key personnel, the inability to identify, attract and retain qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring qualified personnel, particularly technical and sales personnel, could make it difficult for us to manage our business and meet key objectives, such as the timely introduction of new technology-based products and services, which could harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIf we fail to keep our customers\u2019 information confidential or if we handle their information improperly, our business and reputation could be significantly and adversely affected.\nIf we fail to keep customers\u2019 proprietary information and documentation confidential, we may lose existing customers and potential new customers and may expose them to significant loss of revenue based on the premature release of confidential information. While we have security measures in place to protect customer information and prevent data loss and other security breaches, these measures may be breached as a result of third-party action, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not identified until they are launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures.\nIn addition, our service providers (including, without limitation, hosting facilities, disaster recovery providers and software providers) may have access to our customers\u2019 data and could suffer security breaches or data losses that affect our customers\u2019 information.\nIf an actual or perceived security breach or premature release occurs, our reputation could be damaged and we may lose future sales and customers. We may also become subject to civil claims, including indemnity or damage claims in certain customer contracts, or criminal investigations by appropriate authorities, any of which could harm our business and operating results. Furthermore, while our errors and omissions insurance policies include liability coverage for these matters, if we experienced a widespread security breach that impacted a significant number of our customers for whom we have these indemnity obligations, we could be subject to indemnity claims that exceed such coverage.\nWe must adapt to rapid changes in technology and customer requirements to remain competitive.\nThe market and demand for our products and services, to a varying extent, have been characterized by:\n\u25cf\nTechnological change;\n\u25cf\nFrequent product and service introductions; and\n\u25cf\nEvolving customer requirements.\nWe believe that these trends will continue into the foreseeable future. Our success will depend, in part, upon our ability to:\n\u25cf\nEnhance our existing products and services;\n\u25cf\nSuccessfully develop new products and services that meet increasing customer requirements; and\n\u25cf\nGain market acceptance.\nTo achieve these goals, we will need to continue to make substantial investments in sales and marketing. We may not:\n\u25cf\nHave sufficient resources to make these investments;\n\u25cf\nBe successful in developing product and service enhancements or new products and services on a timely basis, if at all; or\n\u25cf\nBe able to market successfully these enhancements and new products once developed.\nFurther, our products and services may be rendered obsolete or uncompetitive by new industry standards or changing technology.\nOur business could be materially harmed if we do not successfully manage the integration of our recent acquisition of Interwest Transfer Company, Inc.\nOn October 2, 2017, we acquired Interwest Transfer Company, Inc. (\u201cInterwest\u201d). Through this acquisition, we acquired approximately three hundred transfer agent customers. We believe by adding the transfer agency customer base of Interwest, we significantly bolster our platform potential by providing the Interwest customer base the opportunity to utilize our single-sourced, consolidated disclosure and communication offering for disseminating regulatory and other business information to shareholders and the markets. However, there are a number of risks associated with the Interwest acquisition as set forth below:\n\u25cf\nthe difficulty of integrating the operations and personnel of Interwest into our ongoing operations;\n\u25cf\nthe potential disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management;\n\u25cf\nthe management of Interwest, which is located in Salt Lake City, Utah;\n\u25cf\nthe establishment and maintenance of uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies between Issuer Direct and Interwest;\n\u25cf\nthe impairment of relationships with employees and customers of Interwest as a result of any integration of new management personnel;\n\u25cf\nthe potential loss of key employees or clients of Interwest; and\n\u25cf\npotential unknown liabilities or other difficulties associated with Interwest.\nIf we do not manage these risks successfully, it could result in a material adverse impact to our business.\nAdditionally, our business could be harmed if we do not successfully manage the integration of any business that we may acquire in the future.\nIn addition to the specific risks associated with integrating Interwest, as part of our continued business strategy, we will continue to evaluate and acquire as practical other businesses that complement our core capabilities. Certain other areas which may expose the Company to increased risk include:\n\u25cf\nthe difficulty of integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses into our ongoing operations;\n\u25cf\nthe potential disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management;\n\u25cf\nthe difficulty in incorporating acquired technology and rights into our products and technology;\n\u25cf\nunanticipated expenses and delays relating to completing acquired development projects and technology integration;\n\u25cf\na potential increase in our indebtedness and contingent liabilities, which could restrict our ability to access additional capital when needed or to pursue other important elements of our business strategy;\n\u25cf\nthe management of geographically remote units;\n\u25cf\nthe establishment and maintenance of uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies;\n\u25cf\nthe impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of any integration of new management personnel;\n\u25cf\nrisks of entering markets or types of businesses in which we have either limited or no direct experience;\n\u25cf\nthe potential loss of key employees or customers of the acquired businesses; and\n\u25cf\npotential unknown liabilities, such as liability for hazardous substances, or other difficulties associated with acquired businesses.\nNew issuers seeking to raise capital and become SEC registrants may choose to utilize Regulation A+ and we may see a significant decline in the number of filings as part of our current disclosure management business.\nOn March 25, 2015, the Securities and Exchange Commission released its final rules relating to Regulation A+ implemented as part of Title IV of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Acts. Regulation A+ will allow issuers to raise capital based on reduced filing requirements as compared to those required under the Securities Act of 1934, as amended. On June 12, 2015, the OTC Markets Group Inc. announced new rules and standards for issuers seeking to list their securities on the OTCQX and OTCQB pursuant to Regulation A+. As issuers begin to utilize theses new rules and standards, we expect there to be a decline in the number of filings made by our existing customer base. However, we also expect a number of additional equity and debt offerings to occur as a function of the new rules. In the event we are unable to adapt our disclosure management business to address the changes being implemented by Regulation A+ and the OTC Market Group, our disclosure management business may potentially see a material reduction in revenue.\nRevenue from Platform id. subscriptions and many of our service contracts is recognized ratably over the term of the contract or subscription period. As a result, downturns or upturns in sales may not be immediately reflected in our operating results.\nWe generally recognize subscription and support revenue from customers ratably over the terms of their subscription agreements, which are typically on a quarterly or annual cycle and automatically renew for additional periods. As a result, a substantial portion of the revenue we report in each quarter will be derived from the recognition of deferred revenue relating to subscription agreements entered into during previous quarters. Consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any one quarter may not be immediately reflected in our revenue results for that quarter. This decline, however, will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters. Accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our solutions and potential changes in our rate of renewals may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. Our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our subscription revenue through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription term. In addition, we may be unable to adjust our cost structure to reflect the changes in revenue, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe cannot accurately predict subscription renewal or upgrade rates and the impact these rates may have on our future revenue and operating results.\nOur business depends substantially on customers renewing their subscriptions with us, specifically Platform id., and expanding their use of our products. Our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our products after the expiration of their initial subscription period. Given our limited operating history with respect to our Platform and Technology revenue stream, we may be unable to accurately predict our subscription and support revenue retention rate. In addition, our customers may renew for shorter contract lengths, lower prices or fewer users. We cannot accurately predict new subscription or expansion rates and the impact these rates may have on our future revenue and operating results. Our renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including customer dissatisfaction with our service, customers\u2019 ability to continue their operations and spending levels and deteriorating general economic conditions. If our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our products, purchase fewer solutions at the time of renewal, or negotiate a lower price upon renewal, our revenue will decline and our business will suffer. Our future success also depends in part on our ability to sell additional solutions and products, more subscriptions or enhanced editions of our products to our current customers. If our efforts to sell additional solutions and products to our customers are not successful, our growth and operations may be impeded. In addition, any decline in our customer renewals or failure to convince our customers to broaden their use of our products would harm our future operating results.\nWe have incurred operating losses in the past and may do so again in the future\nThe Company has incurred operating losses in the past and may do so again in the future. At December 31, 2017, the Company had $2,774,000 of retained earnings. Although we have generated positive cash flows from operations for the past ten years, there can be no assurances that we will be able to do so in the future. As we continue to invest in our cloud-based technologies and sales and marketing teams, we could experience fluctuations in our cash flows from operations and retained earnings and there are no guarantees that our business can continue to generate the current revenue levels.\nWe have recently begun to transition our business from a services company to a software as a service company, which makes it difficult to predict our future operating results.\nIn 2015, we began our transition from a services company to a software as a service company. As a result of this transition, our ability to forecast our future operating results is limited and subject to a number of uncertainties, including our ability to plan for and model future growth. We have encountered and will encounter risks and uncertainties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly changing industries, such as the risks and uncertainties described herein. If our assumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties (which we use to plan our business) are incorrect or change due to changes in our markets, or if we do not address these risks successfully, our operating and financial results could differ materially from our expectations and our business could suffer.\nWe are subject to general litigation and regulatory requirements that may materially adversely affect us.\nFrom time to time, we may be involved in disputes or regulatory inquiries that arise in the ordinary course of business. We expect that the number and significance of these potential disputes may increase as our business expands and we grow larger. While most of our agreements with customers limit our liability for damages arising from our solutions, we cannot assure you that these contractual provisions will protect us from liability for damages in the event we are sued. Although we carry general liability insurance coverage, our insurance may not cover all potential claims to which we are exposed or may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed. Any claims against us, whether meritorious or not, could be time consuming, result in costly litigation, require significant amounts of management time, and result in the diversion of significant operational resources. Because litigation is inherently unpredictable, we cannot assure you that the results of any of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nNew and existing laws make determining our income tax rate complex and subject to uncertainty.\nThe computation of our provision for income tax is complex, as it is based on the laws of multiple taxing jurisdictions and requires significant judgment on the application of complicated rules governing accounting for tax provisions under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Additionally, the new Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 imposes a one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings. We currently have $1,370,000 in cash earned and held in a subsidiary in the United Kingdom. We are currently evaluating the tax impact of repatriating these funds, however, based on our current best estimate, we do not believe the impact will be material. Additionally, provisions for income tax for interim quarters are based on forecasts of our U.S. and non-U.S. effective tax rates for the year and contain numerous assumptions. Various items cannot be accurately forecasted and future events may be treated as discrete to the period in which they occur. Our provision for income tax can be materially impacted by things such as changes in our business, such as internal restructuring and acquisitions, changes in tax laws and accounting guidance and other regulatory, legislative developments, tax audit determinations, changes in uncertain tax positions, tax deductions attributed to equity compensation and changes in our determination for a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. For all of these reasons, our actual income taxes may be materially different than our provision for income tax.\nWe are subject to U.S. and foreign data privacy and protection laws and regulations as well as contractual privacy obligations, and our failure to comply could subject us to fines and damages and would harm our reputation and business.\nWe manage private and confidential information and documentation related to our customers\u2019 finances and transactions, often prior to public dissemination. The use of insider information is highly regulated in the United States and abroad, and violations of securities laws and regulations may result in civil and criminal penalties. In addition, we are subject to the data privacy and protection laws and regulations adopted by federal, state and foreign legislatures and governmental agencies. Data privacy and protection is highly regulated and may become the subject of additional regulation in the future. Privacy laws restrict our storage, use, processing, disclosure, transfer and protection of non-public personal information by our customers or collected from visitors of our website. We strive to comply with all applicable laws, regulations, policies and legal obligations relating to privacy and data protection. However, it is possible that these requirements may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other rules or our practices. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with federal, state or international laws, including laws and regulations regulating privacy, payment card information, personal health information, data or consumer protection, could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others.\nThe regulatory framework for privacy and data protection issues worldwide is evolving, and various government and consumer agencies and public advocacy groups have called for new regulation and changes in industry practices, including some directed at providers of mobile and online resources in particular. Our obligations with respect to privacy and data protection may become broader or more stringent. If we are required to change our business activities or revise or eliminate services, or to implement costly compliance measures, our business and results of operations could be harmed.\nOur business may be affected by factors outside of our control.\nOur ability to increase sales and deliver and sell our service offerings profitably is subject to a number of risks, including changes to corporate disclosure requirements, regulatory filings and distribution of proxy materials, competitive risks such as the entrance of additional competitors into our market, pricing and competition and risks associated with the marketing of new services in order to remain competitive.\nIf potential customers take a long time to evaluate the use of our products, we could incur additional selling expenses and require additional working capital.\nThe acceptance of our services depends on a number of factors, including the nature and size of the potential customer base, the effectiveness of our system, and the extent of the commitment being made by the potential customer, and is difficult to predict. Currently, our sales and marketing expenses per customer are fairly low. If potential customers take longer than we expect to decide whether to use our services and require that we travel to their sites, present more marketing material, or spend more time in completing the sales process, our selling expenses could increase, and we may need to raise additional capital sooner than we would otherwise need to.\nThe seasonality of business makes it difficult to predict future results based on specific quarters.\nA greater portion of our printing, distribution and solicitation of proxy materials business will be processed during our second quarter. Therefore, the seasonality of our revenue makes it difficult to estimate future operating results based on the results of any specific quarter and could affect an investor\u2019s ability to compare our financial condition and results of operations on a quarter-by-quarter basis. To balance the seasonal activity of print, distribution and solicitation of proxy materials, we will attempt to continue to grow other revenues since they are linked to predictable periodic activity that is cyclical in nature.\nIf we are unable to successfully develop and timely introduce new technology-based products or enhance existing technology-based products, our business may be adversely affected.\nIn the past few years, we have expended significant resources to develop and introduce new technology-based products and improve and enhance our existing technology-based products in an attempt to maintain or increase our sales. The long-term success of new or enhanced technology-based products may depend on a number of factors including, but not limited to, the following: anticipating and effectively addressing customer preferences and demand, the success of our sales and marketing efforts, timely and successful development, changes in governmental regulations and the quality of or defects in our products.\nThe development of our technology-based products is complex and costly, and we typically have multiple technology-based products in development at the same time. Given the complexity, we occasionally have experienced, and could experience in the future, delays in completing the development and introduction of new and enhanced technology-based products. Problems in the design or quality of our products or services may also have an adverse effect on our brand, business, financial condition, and operating results. Unanticipated problems in developing technology-based products could also divert substantial development resources, which may impair our ability to develop new technology-based products and enhancements of such products, and could substantially increase our costs. If new or enhanced product and service introductions are delayed or not successful, we may not be able to achieve an acceptable return, if any, on our development efforts, and our business may be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock; Liquidity Risks\nThe price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly, which could lead to losses for stockholders.\nThe stock prices of smaller public companies can experience extreme price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or out of proportion to the operating performance of such companies. We expect our stock price to be similarly volatile. These broad market fluctuations may continue and could harm our stock price. Any negative change in the public\u2019s perception of our prospects or companies in our market could also depress our stock price, regardless of our actual results. Factors affecting the trading price of our common stock may include:\n\u25cf\nvariations in operating results;\n\u25cf\nannouncements of strategic alliances or significant agreements by the Company or by competitors;\n\u25cf\nrecruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u25cf\nlitigation, legislation, regulation of all or part of our business; and\n\u25cf\nchanges in the estimates of operating results or changes in recommendations by any securities analyst that elect to follow our common stock.\nYou may lose your investment in the shares.\nAn investment in the shares involves a high degree of risk. An investment in shares of our common stock is suitable only for investors who can bear a loss of their entire investment. We paid dividends in 2012, and in part of 2013, and every quarter since the fourth quarter of 2015, but there can be no assurances that dividends will be paid in the future in the form of either cash or stock.\nWe currently have authorized but unissued \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock. Without the vote of our shareholders, the Board of Directors may issue such preferred stock with both economic and voting rights and preferences senior to those of the holders of our common stock. Any such issuances may negatively impact the ultimate benefits to the holders of our common stock in the event of a liquidation event and may have the effect of preventing a change of control and could dilute the voting power of our common stock and reduce the market price of our common stock.\nFuture sales and issuances of our capital stock or rights to purchase capital stock could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to decline.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue up to 20,000,000 shares of common stock. Future sales and issuances of our capital stock or rights to purchase our capital stock could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders. We may sell common stock, convertible securities and other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner as we may determine from time to time. If we sell any such securities in subsequent transactions, investors may be materially diluted. New investors in subsequent transactions could gain rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock.\nWe will continue to incur significantly increased costs and devote substantial management time as a result of operating as a public company.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that would not be incurred as a private company. For example, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act), and are required to comply with the applicable requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as rules and regulations subsequently implemented by the SEC and the New York Stock Exchange, including the establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and changes in corporate governance practices. Compliance with these requirements has increased our legal and financial compliance costs and made some activities more time consuming and costly. Many of these costs recur annually. We expect to incur significant expenses and devote substantial management effort toward ensuring compliance with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. As a result, management\u2019s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nA failure to maintain adequate internal controls over our financial and management systems could cause errors in our financial reporting, which could cause a loss of investor confidence and result in a decline in the price of our common stock.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. In order to maintain and, if required, improve our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting to meet this standard, significant resources and management oversight may be required. If we have a material weaknesses or significant deficiency in our internal control over financial reporting, we may not detect errors on a timely basis and our financial statements may be materially misstated. Effective internal controls are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to prevent fraud. As a result, our failure to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act on a timely basis could result in us being subject to regulatory action and a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, both of which in turn could cause the market value of our common stock to decline and affect our ability to raise capital.\nBecause we are a smaller reporting company, our independent registered public accounting firm did not perform an audit of our internal control over financial reporting for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.", "PERMNO": 75754, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "ISDR"}
