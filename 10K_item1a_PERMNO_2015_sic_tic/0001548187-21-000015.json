{"cik": "1548187", "company": "Soliton, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-04", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nSummary of Risk Factors\nBelow is a summary of the principal factors that make an investment in our Company speculative or risky. This summary does not address all of the risks that we face. Additional discussion of the risks summarized in this risk factor summary, and other risks that we face, can be found below, after this summary, and should be carefully considered, together with other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our other filings with the SEC before making an investment decision in our securities.\nRisk Factors Relating To Our Business And The Industry In Which We Operate:\n\u2022we will require substantial additional funding, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all, and, if not so available, may require us to delay, limit, reduce or cease our operations;\n\u2022RAP utilizes potentially dangerous energy levels and we could face liability for claims related to the RAP device that would be costly and would damage our reputation;\n\u2022we cannot assure you that we will generate revenue or become profitable in the future;\n\u2022the use of lasers to remove tattoos has inherent dangers and our device will be used in conjunction with lasers for tattoo removal;\n\u2022because we have not yet launched the RAP device, we have been using our available capital resources for development of the commercial units and have not yet generated any revenues; therefore, we may not be able to continue as a going concern;\n\u2022the results of our clinical trials may not support our product candidate claims or may result in the discovery of adverse side effects;\n\u2022we utilize a single manufacturer, Sanmina Corporation, for the manufacture of the RAP device and expect to continue to do so for commercial devices. Risks associated with the manufacturing of our products could reduce our gross margins and negatively affect our operating results;\n\u2022we have limited sales, marketing, and distribution capabilities or arrangements, and will need to substantially build-out these capabilities as we move towards commercialization of our products;\n\u2022achieving and maintaining market acceptance of the RAP device for tattoo removal and cellulite could be negatively impacted by many factors, which may prevent us from successfully commercializing the RAP device;\n\u2022all of our near-term indications are elective procedures that will be not be reimbursable and to the extent there is a general reduction in discretionary spending that could result in a reduction in the demand for these services;\n\u2022we have limited brand awareness and there is no assurance that we will be able to achieve brand awareness;\n\u2022the outbreak of the novel strain of coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, has adversely impacted our business, including our commercial launch plans, pre-clinical studies and clinical trials;\n\u2022to date, all of our experience operating the RAP device has been in a clinical or industrial setting and we have had no experience operating in a practitioner's office without supervision by our personnel;\n\u2022our success depends on growing physician adoption and use of our systems and adoption by physicians in cosmetic dermatology and plastic surgery;\n\u2022our success depends in part upon patient satisfaction with the effectiveness of our tattoo removal and cellulite treatments; and\n\u2022security breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability.\nRisk Related To Regulatory Issues\n\u2022there is no guarantee that the FDA will grant 510(k) or de novo clearance or PMA approval of our future products and failure to obtain necessary clearances or approvals for our future products would adversely affect our ability to grow our business; and\n\u2022the Generation 2.0 device, which has been cleared by the FDA for tattoo removal and cellulite, has been updated for commercial launch and requires a special 510(k) filing prior to limited launch.\nRisks Related To Our License Agreement And Intellectual Property\n\u2022we have licensed certain intellectual property rights for our technology from MD Anderson, and if our license agreement with MD Anderson is terminated, our business will be materially harmed; and\n\u2022if we are unable to protect the intellectual property used in our products, others may be able to copy our innovations which may impair our ability to compete effectively in our markets.\nRisks Relating To Our Common Stock\n\u2022your ownership may be diluted if additional capital stock is issued to raise capital, to finance acquisitions or in connection with strategic transactions; and\n\u2022the concentration of our common stock ownership by a single shareholder will limit your ability to influence corporate matters.\nRISK FACTORS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS AND THE INDUSTRY IN WHICH WE OPERATE\nWe will require substantial additional funding, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all, and, if not so available, may require us to delay, limit, reduce or cease our operations.\nWe have used the proceeds from our IPO and subsequent financings to advance our initially approved RAP device through the FDA clearance process and commercial development in preparation for commercial launch with a Generation 2.2 device and to begin building the infrastructure necessary for a commercial entity. The Generation 2.2 device that we intend to offer in our initial commercial launch will have changes from the Generation 2.0 device we submitted under a special 510(k) to the FDA for review and clearance in 2020. The Generation 2.0 device was used for the cellulite trials and was included in our 510(k) filing for cellulite. The changes made to our Generation 2.2 device from Generation 2.0 will necessitate the filing of an additional special 510(k) before being launched. We cannot be certain that the changes we deem appropriate to make to future RAP devices prior to the launch of any of these devices will not require another 510(k) filing. Commercializing and launching medical device products can be expensive. While we believe our current available cash will be sufficient to complete the commercialization and initial launch of our product, we cannot be certain that we will not encounter significant unplanned expenditures. We will require substantial additional future capital in order to complete commercialization, launch and market the device nationwide, build out a sales force and manufacture the device for national rollout. We will continue to require substantial additional capital to continue commercialization activities.\nWe have determined there is material uncertainty about our ability to continue as a going concern; as a result, we could have difficulty finding additional financing.\nOur financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern. We have not generated any revenue from our main operations since inception and have accumulated losses. Our ability to continue our operations depends on our ability to complete equity or debt financings or generate profitable operations. Such financings may not be available or may not be available on reasonable terms. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that could result from the outcome of this uncertainty. If we are unable to raise sufficient capital when needed, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected, and we will need to significantly modify our operational plans to continue as a going concern. If we are unable to continue as a going concern, we might have to liquidate our assets and the values we receive for our assets in liquidation or dissolution could be significantly lower than the values reflected in our financial statements. The inclusion of a material uncertainty explanatory paragraph by our auditors, our lack of positive cash flows and our potential inability to continue as a going concern may materially adversely affect our share price and our ability to raise new capital or to enter into critical contractual relations with third parties.\nWe anticipate needing additional financing over the longer term to execute our business plan and fund operations, which additional financing may not be available on reasonable terms or at all.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had total assets of $33.8 million, including cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $31.8 million. We have an accumulated deficit as of December 31, 2020, of $70.6 million. Our cash on hand of $29.1 million at February 12, 2021 is expected to fund our operations into the third quarter of 2022 but not beyond. We believe that we will require additional capital to mount a national sales and marketing effort and execute our business plan. We cannot give any assurance that we will be able to obtain all the necessary funding that we may need. We may pursue additional funding through various financing sources, including additional public offerings, the issuance of debt securities, fees associated with licensing some or all of our technology, joint ventures with capital partners and project type financing. There can be no assurance that funds will be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If financing is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to further pursue our business plan and we may be unable to continue operations, in which case you may lose some or all of your investment. Alternatively, we may consider changes in our business plan that might enable us to achieve aspects of our business objectives and lead to some commercial success with a smaller amount of capital, but we cannot assure that changes in our business plan will result in revenues or maintain any value in your investment.\nWe have a limited operating history and we expect a number of factors to cause our operating results to fluctuate on an annual basis, which may make it difficult to predict our future performance.\nWe formed our corporation in 2012 without a working RAP prototype. During the first five years of operations, we focused on research and development of a fully-integrated working prototype of the RAP device to remove tattoos. During the past three years, we have focused our efforts on developing a commercial device that would receive FDA clearance to sell and the additional clearance of our product to treat cellulite. We received FDA clearance in May 2019 for tattoo removal and for our 501(k) application for cellulite in January 2021; after such applications our efforts have been focused on refining our commercial device to improve ease of use features necessary for adoption in dermatological and plastic surgery settings. Developing the commercial device for our market launch is expected to be completed in the first half of 2021 in time for our initial launch. Further refinement to the device to develop the Generation 2.3 device, which we plan to roll out nationally in 2022, is anticipated to cost at least an additional $2.5 million and take another year of additional work. Additionally, a high percentage of our expenses will be associated with pre-launch marketing activities as well as fixed costs. We have not yet sold any products, and we may never achieve commercial success with RAP technology. We have limited historical financial data upon which we may base our projected revenue and operating expenses. Our limited operating history makes it difficult for potential investors to evaluate our technology or prospective operations and business prospects. As a pre-commercial stage company, we are subject to all the risks inherent in business development, financing, unexpected expenditures, and complications and delays that often occur in a new business. Investors should evaluate an investment in us in light of the uncertainties encountered by developing companies in a competitive environment. There can be no assurance that our efforts will be successful or that we will ultimately be able to attain profitability.\nRAP utilizes potentially dangerous energy levels and we could face liability for claims related to the RAP device that would be costly and would damage our reputation.\nThe acoustic shockwaves generated by our RAP device are the result of producing and directing electrical energy within the device's hand piece approaching 3,000 volts at 3,000 amps of current. Although the RAP device has been designed in accordance, and has been independently tested and found to comply, with the electrical and other safety requirements for comparable medical devices, we cannot be certain that such design and testing measures have identified every possible mode of failure. An unanticipated failure mode or misuse of the RAP device could potentially expose the operator or patient to\nhazardous and potentially lethal electrical shock and we could face liability for claims of injury or death and our ability to commercialize the RAP device could be materially harmed. In addition, such claims would damage our reputation and hinder our ability to commercialize the RAP device.\nWe cannot assure you that we will generate revenue or become profitable in the future.\nAll of our intended indications may not be cleared by the FDA or become commercially viable or accepted for use. We have incurred significant losses since our inception and expect to experience operating losses and negative cash flow for the foreseeable future. We expect to expend significant resources on hiring of personnel, continued scientific and product research and development, product testing and pre-clinical and clinical investigation, intellectual property development and prosecution, marketing and promotion, capital expenditures, working capital, general and administrative expenses, and fees and expenses associated with our capital raising efforts. We expect to incur costs and expenses related to consulting costs, hiring of scientists, engineers, science and other operational personnel, and the continued development of relationships with strategic partners.\nThe use of lasers to remove tattoos has inherent dangers and our device will be used in conjunction with lasers for tattoo removal.\nOur RAP device uses rapid pulses of designed acoustic shockwaves to dramatically accelerate the removal of tattoos when used in conjunction with existing lasers. Specifically, our technology allows a doctor to treat a patient multiple times in a single office visit and significantly reduce the overall time it takes to remove a tattoo. Recognized and published (see \"Complications of Tattoos and Tattoo Removal: Stop and Think Before you ink;\" Khunger, Molpariya, & Khunger, 2015) adverse events of Q-switched laser tattoo removal include: pain; blistering; crusting; pinpoint hemorrhage; urticarial reaction; hypopigmentation; hyperpigmentation; leukotrichia; local-papule; plaques; darkening of tattoos; photoallergic reactions; systemic reactions; residual pigmentation; ghost images; scarring; and textural changes. These adverse events may be increased when multiple laser passes are used to remove a tattoo in a single session.\nBecause we have not yet launched the RAP device, we have been using our available capital resources for development of the commercial units and have not yet generated any revenues; therefore, we may not be able to continue as a going concern.\nWe are a pre-revenue stage medical device company, and do not expect to generate any revenues until our commercial RAP device (Generation 2.0), cleared by the FDA, has been updated for use in the field as Generation 2.2, had those updates cleared by the FDA, and are sold. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our generating cash flow from sales that are sufficient to fund operations or finding adequate financing to support our operations. To date, we have had no revenues and have relied onthe proceeds from our IPO and subsequent equity offerings. Our sales plan may not be successful in achieving a sustainable business and revenues. We have no arrangements in place for all the anticipated required financing to be able to fully implement our business plan through cash flow breakeven. If we are unable to continue as planned currently, we may have to curtail some or all of our business plan and operations. In such case, investors may lose some or all of their investment.\nOur clinical experience with the RAP device for tattoos is limited to black tattoos with one type of laser, and future trials may not result in similar outcomes.\nTo date, our clinical trial data for tattoo removal is limited to the use of the RAP device in conjunction with Q-Switched lasers treating primarily black tattoos. We do not have clinical data indicating the efficacy of the RAP device in conjunction with shorter pulse \u201cPico-Switched\u201d lasers or in treating tattoo ink colors other than black. Although, based on animal and theoretical models, we believe RAP has the potential to be similarly effective in such instances, we cannot be certain. If it is not as effective in such instances, our ability to successfully commercialize the RAP device could be materially harmed.\nOur clinical experience with the RAP device for cellulite is limited to a single treatment session, and future trials may not result in similar outcomes.\nTo date, our clinical trial data for cellulite is limited to the use of the RAP device in a single treatment session and our business plan assumes that patients will seek subsequent maintenance treatments. We do not have clinical data indicating the efficacy of the RAP device for use in multiple treatment sessions. Although, based on theoretical models, we believe the RAP device has the potential to be more effective in such instances, we cannot be certain. If it is not as effective in such instances, our ability to successfully commercialize the RAP device could be materially limited.\nClinical trials may be necessary to support future product submissions to the FDA. These clinical trials will be expensive and will require the enrollment of large numbers of patients, and suitable patients may be difficult to identify and recruit. Delays or failures in our clinical trials will prevent us from commercializing any modified or new products and will adversely affect our business, operating results and prospects.\nInitiating and completing clinical trials necessary to support any future FDA applications, and additional safety and efficacy data required for a clearance, for our possible future product candidates, will be time-consuming and expensive and the outcome uncertain. Moreover, the results of early clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of future results, and any product we advance into clinical trials may not have favorable results in later clinical trials.\nConducting successful clinical studies will require the enrollment of large numbers of patients, and suitable patients may be difficult to identify and recruit. Patient enrollment in clinical trials and completion of patient participation and follow-up depends on many factors, including the size of the patient population, the nature of the trial protocol, the attractiveness of, or the discomforts and risks associated with, the treatments received by enrolled subjects, the availability of appropriate clinical trial investigators, support staff, and proximity of patients to clinical sites and ability to comply with the eligibility and exclusion criteria for participation in the clinical trial and patient compliance. For example, patients may be discouraged from enrolling in our clinical trials if the trial protocol requires them to undergo extensive post-treatment procedures or follow-up to assess the safety and effectiveness of our products or if they determine that the treatments received under the trial protocols are not attractive or involve unacceptable risks or discomforts.\nDevelopment of sufficient and appropriate clinical protocols to demonstrate safety and efficacy are required and we may not adequately develop such protocols to support clearance and approval. Further, the FDA may require us to submit data on a greater number of patients than we originally anticipated and/or for a longer follow-up period or change the data collection requirements or data analysis applicable to our clinical trials. Delays in patient enrollment or failure of patients to continue to participate in a clinical trial may cause an increase in costs and delays in the approval and attempted commercialization of our products or result in the failure of the clinical trial. In addition, despite considerable time and expense invested in our clinical trials, the FDA may not consider our data adequate to demonstrate safety and efficacy. Such increased costs and delays or failures could adversely affect our business, operating results and prospects.\nIf the third parties on which we rely to conduct our clinical trials and to assist us with pre-clinical development do not perform as contractually required or expected, we may not be able to obtain regulatory clearance or approval for or commercialize our products.\nWe do not have the ability to independently conduct our pre-clinical and clinical trials for our product candidates and future products and we must rely on third parties, such as contract research organizations, medical institutions, clinical investigators and contract laboratories to conduct such trials. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or regulatory obligations or meet expected deadlines, if these third parties need to be replaced, or if the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our pre-clinical development activities or clinical trials may be extended, delayed, suspended or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for, or successfully commercialize, our products on a timely basis, if at all, and our business, operating results and prospects may be adversely affected. Furthermore, our third-party clinical trial investigators may be delayed in conducting our clinical trials for reasons outside of their control.\nThe results of our clinical trials may not support our product candidate claims or may result in the discovery of adverse side effects.\nEven though our first clinical trials are completed, we cannot be certain that their results will support our product candidate claims or that the FDA will agree with our conclusions regarding them. Success in pre-clinical studies and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful, and we cannot be sure that the later trials will replicate the results of prior trials and pre-clinical studies. The clinical trial process may fail to demonstrate that our product candidates are safe and effective for the proposed indicated uses, which could cause us to abandon a product candidate and may delay development of others. Any delay or termination of our clinical trials will delay the filing of our product submissions and, ultimately, our ability to commercialize our product candidates and generate revenues. It is also possible that patients enrolled in clinical trials will experience adverse side effects that are not currently part of the product candidate\u2019s profile.\nWe may be required to suspend or discontinue clinical trials due to side effects or other safety risks that could preclude approval of our products.\nOur clinical trials may be suspended at any time for a number of reasons. We may voluntarily suspend or terminate our clinical trials if at any time we believe that they present an unacceptable risk to participants. In addition, regulatory agencies\nmay order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of our clinical trials at any time if they believe that the clinical trials are not being conducted in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements or that they present an unacceptable safety risk to participants.\nWe utilize a single manufacturer, Sanmina Corporation, for the manufacture of the RAP device and expect to continue to do so for commercial devices. Risks associated with the manufacturing of our products could reduce our gross margins and negatively affect our operating results.\nWe do not have any manufacturing facilities or direct manufacturing personnel. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on Sanmina Corporation for the manufacture of the RAP device for commercial manufacture. Although Sanmina is a large contract manufacturer of medical devices, we are subject to numerous risks relating to our reliance on their manufacturing capabilities. If they encounter problems in manufacturing the RAP device, then our business could be significantly impacted. These problems include:\n\u2022inability to secure product components in a timely manner, in sufficient quantities or on commercially reasonable terms;\n\u2022failure to increase production of the RAP device to meet demand;\n\u2022inability to modify production lines to enable us to efficiently produce future products or implement changes in current products in response to regulatory requirements;\n\u2022difficulty identifying and qualifying alternative manufacturers in a timely manner;\n\u2022inability to establish agreements with future third-party manufacturers or to do so on acceptable terms; or\n\u2022potential damage to or destruction of our manufacturers' equipment or facilities.\nAs demand for our products increases, our manufacturer will need to invest additional resources to purchase components, hire and train employees, and enhance their manufacturing processes. If they fail to increase production capacity efficiently, our sales may not increase in line with our expectations and our operating margins could fluctuate or decline. The RAP device has many parts that are specialized high-voltage components and many of these components are only produced by one supplier and the loss of any of these suppliers, or their inability to provide Sanmina with an adequate supply of materials, could harm our business. For our business strategy to be successful, Sanmina must be able to provide us with components in sufficient quantities, in compliance with regulatory requirements and quality control standards, in accordance with agreed-upon specifications, at acceptable costs and on a timely basis. Future increases in sales of the RAP device could strain the ability of Sanmina to deliver an increasingly large supply of components and RAP systems in a manner that meets these various requirements. We do not have a long-term agreement with Sanmina and contract with Sanmina on a project-to-project basis utilizing a separate purchase order for each engineering project. As such, there is no assurance that Sanmina will continue to provide us with engineering and manufacturing services in the future.\nWe rely on a contract manufacturer, Sanmina Corporation, and our agreement with them requires us to place purchase orders with significant lead times that are noncancellable under the agreement. We may ultimately have to pay for inventory that we don't need if we can't accurately forecast demand.\nOur agreement with our contract manufacturer, Sanmina, requires us to place purchase orders six months in advance and significant portions of these purchase orders are noncancellable once placed. If we are unable to accurately predict demand for our products and place purchase orders that are larger than necessary for actual demand, we will build inventory levels that may ultimately be written off.\nWe have limited experience in assembling and testing our products and may encounter problems or delays in the assembly of our products or fail to meet certain regulatory requirements which could result in an adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nWe have limited experience in assembling and testing our RAP device, and no experience in doing so on a commercial scale. To become profitable, we must assemble and test the RAP device in commercial quantities in compliance with regulatory requirements and at an acceptable cost. Increasing our capacity to assemble and test our products on a commercial scale will require us to improve internal efficiencies. We may encounter a number of difficulties in increasing our assembly and testing capacity, including:\n\u2022managing production yields;\n\u2022maintaining quality control and assurance;\n\u2022providing component and service availability;\n\u2022maintaining adequate control policies and procedures;\n\u2022hiring and retaining qualified personnel; and\n\u2022complying with state, federal and foreign regulations.\nIf we are unable to satisfy commercial demand for our RAP device due to our inability to assemble and test our RAP device, our ability to generate revenue would be impaired, market acceptance of our products could be adversely affected and customers may instead purchase or use our competitors\u2019 products.\nCertain parts used in the manufacturing of our equipment may experience shortages in global supply which could impact our ability to manufacture our device for customers or maintain research and development timelines.\nThere are a number of component parts used in the manufacture of our device that are used by many manufacturers in a variety of products. We will compete with other manufacturers for the supply of these components. Additionally, certain parts that are currently in our design may be discontinued by our supplier requiring us to find alternative parts. This issue may require us to change the design of our device or purchase significant inventories of these parts in order to protect against manufacturing delays. We may not be able to procure alternative components or adequate raw material inventories which would result in an inability to produce our device.\nWe have limited sales, marketing, and distribution capabilities or arrangements, and will need to substantially build-out these capabilities as we move towards commercialization of our products.\nWe do not yet have full sales, marketing, and distribution capabilities or arrangements. To be able to commercialize our potential products, we will need to develop all of the foregoing. We have limited experience in establishing these capabilities, and therefore, we may be unsuccessful in achieving commercialization and earning revenues. We believe that setting up the commercialization parts of the Company will take substantial capital and commitment of time and effort. We may seek development and marketing partners for RAP technology and license technology that is complementary, but not directly associated with RAP technology to others in order to avoid our having to provide the marketing, manufacturing and distribution capabilities within our organization. There can be no assurance that we will find any development and marketing partners or companies that are interested in licensing our technology. If we are unable to establish and maintain adequate sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution capabilities, independently or with others, we will not be able to generate product revenue, and may not become profitable.\nAchieving and maintaining market acceptance of the RAP device for tattoo removal and cellulite could be negatively impacted by many factors, which may prevent us from successfully commercializing the RAP device.\nEven though the RAP device is cleared by the FDA, we may not be successful achieving market acceptance of the RAP device for tattoo removal or cellulite. Many factors could negatively impact our ability to achieve or maintain market acceptance, including:\n\u2022the failure of the RAP device to achieve wide acceptance among people who regret having one or more tattoos or have a tattoo they would like to modify (prospective clients), dermatologists, and key opinion leaders in the tattoo removal community;\n\u2022the failure of the RAP device to achieve wide acceptance among women who would like to treat their cellulite (prospective patients), dermatologists, plastic surgeons, and key opinion leaders in the aesthetic marketplace;\n\u2022possible reluctance by dermatologists to change their current practices because of perceived liability risks arising from the use of new products;\n\u2022perceived risks associated with the use of the RAP device or similar products or technologies generally;\n\u2022our marketing efforts or physician consultations with patients could drive unrealistic expectations of treatment outcome by patients and result in dissatisfaction;\n\u2022the introduction of competitive products and the rate of acceptance of those products as compared to the RAP device;\n\u2022adverse results of future clinical trials relating to the RAP device or similar competitive products; and\n\u2022adverse publicity or other adverse events including any product liability lawsuits.\nIf we are not successful in convincing prospective clients and dermatologists of the benefits of the RAP device then our sales potential, strategic objectives and profitability could be negatively impacted, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIf important assumptions we have made about what prospective clients want and are willing to purchase are inaccurate, our business and operating results may be adversely affected.\nOur business strategy was developed based on a number of important assumptions about prospective clients, including their desire to have one or more tattoos removed, their reasons for not taking action to remove those tattoos to date and their willingness to pay for an improved method of removing their tattoos. These assumptions were based on published secondary research, as well as primary research commissioned by us. This research may be flawed and/or any of the resulting assumptions may prove to be inaccurate. If so, our efforts to commercialize the RAP device, even though cleared by the FDA, may fall short of expectations and you could lose some or all of your investment.\nThe sizes of the markets for our RAP device have not been established with precision, and may be smaller than we estimate.\nOur estimates of the annual total addressable markets for our products, including those under development, are based on a number of internal and third-party estimates. While we believe our assumptions and the data underlying our estimates are reasonable, these assumptions and estimates may not be correct and the conditions supporting our assumptions or estimates may change at any time, thereby reducing the predictive accuracy of these underlying factors. If the actual number of people who would benefit from our products, the price at which we can sell our products, or the annual total addressable market for our products is smaller than we have estimated, it may impair our sales growth and have an adverse impact on our business.\nAll of our near-term indications are elective procedures that will be not be reimbursable and to the extent there is a general reduction in discretionary spending that could result in a reduction in the demand for these services.\nThe decision to undergo a procedure from our systems will be driven by consumer demand. Procedures performed using our systems will be elective procedures, the cost of which must be borne by the patient and are not reimbursable through government or private health insurance. In times of economic uncertainty or recession, individuals often reduce the amount of money that they spend on discretionary items, including aesthetic procedures. The general economic difficulties being experienced and the lack of availability of consumer credit for some of our customers' patients could adversely affect the markets in which we will operate.\nWe expect to operate in a highly competitive market, we may face competition from large, well-established medical device and product manufacturers with significant resources, and we may not be able to compete effectively.\nA method for facilitating multiple laser passes in a single office visit by applying a PFD Patch to the skin was introduced to the market within the last several years. Although we believe, based on currently available published clinical data for the PFD Patch, that the Soliton method is more effective than the PFD Patch, the company that owns the PFD Patch, Merz Pharma, has substantially more resources than Soliton. Furthermore, we have made this assessment based on separate clinical trials with differing protocols, not on a direct head-to-head comparison between the PFD Patch and the Soliton method, so we cannot be certain that the Soliton method is more effective. Also, there are currently a number of laser companies such as Lumenis, Cynosure, Candela and Cutera that market their lasers for tattoo removal and all of these companies have substantially more resources than Soliton. Furthermore, our clinical trials have demonstrated clinically significant improvement in tattoo fading over laser alone. Since we are pursuing FDA clearance for the RAP device to treat tattoos in conjunction with lasers, some of these companies may view our product as a competitive threat. The cellulite removal market is highly competitive and has numerous device companies in the space. The technologies currently being used vary significantly in approach, efficacy and invasiveness to the patient. Endo Pharmaceuticals is launching Qwo\u00ae, a prescription injectible treatment for moderate to severe cellulite dimples in the buttocks. The drug is a collegenase formula that is used to dissolve collagen structures, such as septa. A technology called Cellfina, owned by Merz Pharma, is currently being marketed as a long-term solution for the dimples caused by cellulite. The treatment requires injected anesthesia be given to the patient prior to the portion of the skin to be treated being pulled upward utilizing a suctioning plate. A lance is inserted into the side of the treatment area which is used to slice through the septa that are causing the dimple(s). Cellulaze, a technology owned by Cynosure, delivers a therapy similar to Cellfina using laser energy. A very small cannula (or tube about the size of the tip of a pen) is inserted under the skin. The laser fiber delivers energy directly under the skin. This is intended to increase the thickness and quality of the patient's skin, while simultaneously releasing the septa. BTL Aesthetics owns a technology called Emtone\u2122, which is intended to provide a temporary reduction in the appearance of cellulite. Emtone simultaneously emits both radiofrequency and targeted pressure energy. There are a number of other radiofrequency devices in the market intended to\nprovide a temporary improvement in the appearance of cellulite. Also, there may be numerous companies of which we are not aware that may be working on separate technology for tattoo fading or removal or cellulite treatment. As well, the broader market for energy-based devices in the aesthetic market is becoming more competitive. Over time, we believe this field will become subject to more rapid change and new devices and products will emerge. We may find ourselves in competition with companies that have competitive advantages over us, such as:\n\u2022greater name recognition;\n\u2022established relations with dermatologists;\n\u2022established distribution networks;\n\u2022additional lines of products, and the ability to offer rebates, higher discounts or incentives to gain a competitive advantage; and\n\u2022greater financial and human resources for product development, sales and marketing, and patent litigation.\nAs a result, we may not be able to compete effectively against these companies or their devices and products.\nRapidly changing technology in life sciences could make the products we are developing obsolete.\nThe medical device and life-science industry in general is characterized by rapid and significant technological changes, frequent new product introductions and enhancements and evolving industry standards. Our future success will depend on our ability to continually develop and then improve the products that we design and to develop and introduce new products that address the evolving needs of our customers on a timely and cost-effective basis.\nIf we do not enhance our product offerings through our research and development efforts on a timely basis, we may fail to effectively compete or become profitable.\nIn order to capture and grow market share in the tattoo removal market, we will need to enhance and broaden our product offerings to meet the evolving demands of patients and dermatologists, as well as compete against new technologies. The success of the RAP device or future versions of the RAP device will depend on numerous factors, including our ability to:\n\u2022identify product enhancements that improve performance of tattoo removal and clinicians\u2019 ability to use the device and successfully incorporate those features into our products;\n\u2022develop and introduce future generations of the RAP device in a timely manner;\n\u2022offer products at a price that is competitive with other products then available; and\n\u2022adequately protect our intellectual property and avoid infringing upon the intellectual property rights of third parties.\nWe have in the past experienced, and we may in the future experience, delays in various phases of product development and commercial launch, including engineering, manufacturing, and clinical. Any delays in our anticipated product launches may significantly impede our ability to successfully compete in our markets. In particular, such delays could cause customers to delay or forego purchases of our products. Even if we are able to successfully develop the RAP device or future versions of the RAP device when anticipated, these products may not produce sales in excess of the costs of development, and they may be quickly rendered obsolete by the changing preferences of dermatologists and patients, or the introduction by our competitors of products embodying new technologies or features.\nPotential complications from the RAP device or future versions of the RAP device may not be revealed by our clinical experience or other testing. Undetected errors or defects in the RAP device or future versions of the RAP device could harm our reputation, decrease the market acceptance of the RAP device or expose us to product liability claims.\nOur RAP device is a highly complex device with many potential areas for undetected errors, defects or other complications. We cannot be certain that our clinical and other safety and efficacy testing has revealed all such complications. If such complications emerge in the future, we may not have sufficient resources to address them and our commercialization plans could be materially adversely affected.\nIf we lose key management personnel, or if we fail to recruit additional highly skilled personnel, our ability to expand our operations and increase the size of our company will be impaired, and we may experience loss of markets or market share and we may become less competitive.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had 14 employees, including 13 full-time employees and 1 part-time employee. Because of our small size, growth in accordance with our business plan will place a significant strain on our financial, technical, operational and management resources. As we advance our product candidates through commercial development, launch and post-launch activities, we will need to increase our product development, clinical and administrative headcount to manage these programs.\nWe are highly dependent upon the principal members of our management team, scientific advisory board and consultants. These persons have significant experience not only in development, regulatory, commercialization and business development activities, but also with the RAP system, acoustic energy and the biology of tattoos and cellulite. If we lose one or more of our executive officers or key employees or consultants, our ability to implement our business strategy successfully could be seriously harmed. Any of our executive officers or key employees or consultants may terminate their employment at any time. Replacing executive officers, key employees and consultants may be difficult and may take an extended period of time because of the limited number of individuals in our industry with the breadth of skills and experience required to develop, gain regulatory approval of and commercialize products successfully. Competition to hire and retain employees and consultants from this limited pool is intense, and we may be unable to hire, train, retain or motivate these additional key personnel and consultants. Our failure to retain key personnel or consultants could materially harm our business.\nIn addition, we have scientific and clinical advisors and consultants who assist us in formulating our regulatory and clinical strategies. These advisors are not our employees and may have commitments to, or consulting or advisory contracts with, other entities that may limit their availability to us and typically they will not enter into non-compete agreements with us. If a conflict of interest arises between their work for us and their work for another entity, we may lose their services. In addition, our advisors may have arrangements with other companies to assist those companies in developing products or technologies that may compete with ours.\nIn addition, to meet our obligations as a public company, we may need to increase our general and administrative capabilities. Our management, personnel and systems currently in place may not be adequate to support this future growth. If we are unable to successfully manage this growth and increased complexity of operations, our business may be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to establish good relationships with physicians, our business could be negatively affected.\nOur business model will depend on the distribution of our RAP device into the offices of practicing dermatologists and other physicians. This will require us to build and maintain good relationships with physicians who will have a significant source of patients that will generate treatment revenues for both the physician and the Company. If we are unable to establish good relationships with physicians and maintain them, it will jeopardize both device and replaceable component revenues.\nWe have limited brand awareness and there is no assurance that we will be able to achieve brand awareness.\nWe have achieved limited brand awareness with respect to our RAP technology. There is no assurance that we will be able to achieve brand awareness. In addition, we must develop a successful market for our products in order to complete sales. If we are not able to develop successful markets for our products, then such failure will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe may expend our limited resources to pursue a particular product or indication and fail to capitalize on products or indications that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\nBecause we have limited financial and managerial resources, we focus on specific products, indications and discovery programs. As a result, we may forgo or delay pursuit of other opportunities with others that could have had greater commercial potential. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities. Our spending on current and future research and development programs for specific indications may not yield any commercially viable products. If we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular potential product, we may relinquish valuable rights to that potential product through future collaborations, licenses and other similar arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights to such potential product.\nBusiness disruptions could seriously harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses.\nOur operations could be subject to earthquakes, power shortages, telecommunications failures, water shortages, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics and other natural or man-made disasters or business interruptions, for which we are predominantly self-insured. We rely on third-party manufacturers to produce our products. Our ability to obtain clinical supplies of our products could be disrupted if the operations of these suppliers were affected by a man-made or natural disaster or other business interruption. The occurrence of any of these business disruptions could seriously harm our operations and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses.\nThe outbreak of the novel strain of coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, has adversely impacted our business, including our commercial launch plans, pre-clinical studies and clinical trials.\nPublic health crises such as pandemics or similar outbreaks could adversely impact our business. In response to the spread of COVID-19, we have closed our executive offices with our administrative employees continuing their work outside of our offices. We have also revised our commercial launch plans as a result of the overall impact on the aesthetic market, and we may be required to further revise our plans in the future based on the final impact of COVID-19.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 outbreak, or similar pandemics, we have and may in the future experience disruptions that could severely impact our business, pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, including:\n\u2022delays or difficulties in enrolling patients in our clinical trials;\n\u2022delays or difficulties in clinical site initiation, including difficulties in recruiting clinical site investigators and clinical site staff;\n\u2022increased rates of patients withdrawing from our clinical trials following enrollment as a result of contracting COVID-19, being forced to quarantine;\n\u2022increased rates of non-compliance with follow-up visits with patients failing to attend their clinical trial follow-up visits or clinics closing during the scheduled visit;\n\u2022interruption of key clinical trial activities, such as clinical trial site data monitoring, due to limitations on travel imposed or recommended by federal or state governments, employers and others or interruption of clinical trial subject visits and study procedures (particularly any procedures that may be deemed non-essential), which may impact the integrity of subject data and clinical study endpoints;\n\u2022interruption or delays in the operations of the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory agencies, which may impact approval timelines;\n\u2022interruption of, or delays in receiving, supplies of components for our device and cartridge to our contract manufacturing organization, delays in device manufacturing completion due to staffing shortages, production slowdowns or stoppages and disruptions in delivery systems;\n\u2022limitations on employee resources that would otherwise be focused on the conduct of our pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, including because of sickness of employees or their families, the desire of employees to avoid contact with large groups of people, an increased reliance on working from home or travel disruptions; and\n\u2022general economic pressure on the aesthetic industry that has impacted our ability to launch our products and could further impact our ability to launch our products in the future.\nThese and other factors arising from the COVID-19 pandemic could worsen in countries that are already afflicted with COVID-19, could continue to spread to additional countries, or could return to countries where the pandemic has been partially contained, each of which could further adversely impact our ability to conduct clinical trials and our business generally, and could have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial condition and results.\nIn addition, the trading prices for our common stock and other medical device companies have been highly volatile as a result of the COVID-19 epidemic. As a result, we may face difficulties raising capital through sales of our common stock or such sales may be on unfavorable terms. The COVID-19 outbreak continues to rapidly evolve. The extent to which the outbreak may impact our business, pre-clinical studies and clinical trials will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, such as the ultimate geographic spread of the disease, the duration of the outbreak, travel restrictions and actions to contain the outbreak or treat its impact, such as social distancing and quarantines or lock-downs in the United States and other countries, business closures or business disruptions and the effectiveness of actions taken in the United States and other countries to contain and treat the disease.\nAlthough we actively train our customers on the use of our system, if customers are not trained and/or our products are used by non-physicians, it could result in product misuse and adverse treatment outcomes, which could harm our reputation, result in product liability litigation, distract management and result in additional costs, all of which could harm our business.\nWe market and sell our systems to physicians. In the U.S. and certain international markets, subject to local regulations, physician customers can generally allow nurse practitioners, technicians and other non-physicians to perform aesthetic procedures using our systems under their direct supervision. Although we provide training on the use of our systems as well as the proper post-treatment care, we do not supervise the procedures performed with our systems, nor can we be certain that physicians are directly supervising procedures according to our recommendations. The potential misuse of our systems or failing to adhere to operating guidelines could potentially cause skin damage or underlying tissue damage, which could harm the reputation of our systems and expose us to costly product liability litigation. In addition, patients may not comply with post-treatment guidelines, which could also lead to adverse results and subject us to liability.\nWe offer system training sessions, but we do not require purchasers or operators of our systems to attend training sessions prior to using the device. The lack of required training for operators of our systems and the use of our systems by non-physicians may result in product misuse and adverse treatment outcomes, which could harm our reputation and expose us to costly product liability litigation.\nTo date, all of our experience operating the RAP device has been in a clinical or research and development setting and we have had no experience operating in a practitioner's office without supervision by our personnel.\nWe are introducing the Generation 2.2 device into commercial use by physicians in 2021. To date, utilization of the device on patients has been limited to clinical trials and has not been used by practitioners in a commercial setting. We may encounter issues with the devices that require the physicians to return the device to us for service. We may discover issues with the technology that need to be resolved in the design of the Generation 2.3 device. Should we encounter any material changes to be made, this could delay the planned timing of our national rollout.\nWe may not be able to correctly estimate or control our future operating expenses, which could lead to cash shortfalls.\nOur operating expenses may fluctuate significantly in the future because of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. These factors include:\n\u2022the cost of growing our ongoing commercialization and sales and marketing activities;\n\u2022the costs of manufacturing and maintaining enough inventories of our systems to meet anticipated demand and inventory write-offs related to obsolete products or components;\n\u2022the costs of enhancing the existing functionality and development of new functionalities for our systems;\n\u2022the costs of preparing, filing, prosecuting, defending, and enforcing patent claims and other patent related costs, including litigation costs and the results of such litigation;\n\u2022the variability of RAP procedures being performed between periods;\n\u2022any product liability or other lawsuits and the costs associated with defending them or the results of such lawsuits;\n\u2022the costs to attract and retain personnel with the skills required for effective operations; and\n\u2022the costs associated with being a public company.\nOur budgeted expense levels are based in part on our expectations concerning future revenue from systems sales, products sales and servicing and procedure-based fees. We may be unable to reduce our expenditures in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected shortfalls in revenue. Accordingly, a significant shortfall in market acceptance or demand for our systems and procedures could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition.\nDownturns in the economy or economic uncertainty may reduce patient and customer demand for our systems and services, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur results of operations could be adversely affected by general conditions in the global economy and in the global financial markets. Furthermore, the aesthetic industry in which we operate is particularly vulnerable to unfavorable economic trends. Treatments using our systems involve elective procedures, the cost of which must be borne by patients, and is not reimbursable through government or private health insurance. Economic uncertainty may reduce patient demand for the procedures performed using our systems; if there is not sufficient patient demand for the procedures for which our systems are used, practitioner demand for these systems could drop, further negatively impacting operating results. The decision to undergo a procedure using our systems is driven by consumer demand. In times of economic uncertainty or recession, individuals generally reduce the amount of money that they spend on discretionary items, including aesthetic procedures. If our customers\u2019 patients face economic hardships, our business would be negatively impacted, and our financial performance would be materially harmed in the event that any of the above factors discourage patients from seeking the procedures for which our systems are used. A weak or declining economy could also strain our manufacturers or suppliers, possibly resulting in supply disruption, or cause our customers to delay or stop making payments for our systems or services. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the economic turmoil that has resulted, we expect that some of our customers may experience difficulty in making timely payments or payments at all. Any of the foregoing could harm our business and we cannot anticipate all of the ways in which the economic climate and financial market conditions, including the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, could adversely impact our business. The impact of economic uncertainty on our industry may vary from region to region.\nIt is difficult to forecast our future performance and our financial results may fluctuate unpredictably.\nThe rapid evolution of the markets for medical technologies and aesthetic products make it difficult for us to predict our future performance. Several factors, many of which are outside of our control, may contribute to fluctuations in our financial results, such as:\n\u2022variations in market demand for our systems and services from quarter to quarter;\n\u2022the inability of physicians to obtain the necessary financing to purchase the RAP Device;\n\u2022performance of new indications and system updates, or time required to achieve FDA clearance for new indications;\n\u2022positive or negative media coverage of our systems, positive or negative patient experiences, the procedures or products of our competitors, or our industry generally;\n\u2022our ability to maintain our current, or obtain further, regulatory clearances, approvals or CE Certificates of Conformity;\n\u2022delays in, or failure of, product and component deliveries by our third-party manufacturers or suppliers;\n\u2022seasonal or other variations in patient demand for aesthetic procedures;\n\u2022introduction of new medical aesthetic procedures or products and services that compete with our products and services;\n\u2022changes in accounting rules that may cause restatement of our consolidated financial statements or have other adverse effects; and\n\u2022adverse changes in the economy that reduce patient demand for elective aesthetic procedures.\nOur success depends on growing physician adoption and use of our systems and adoption by physicians in cosmetic dermatology and plastic surgery.\nTattoo removal and cellulite treatment procedures are performed primarily by physicians who practice dermatology or plastic surgery. Our success depends on the willingness of these physicians to adopt our technology and on the growth of tattoo removal and cellulite treatment procedures performed by these physicians within their practice. Our ability to increase the number of physicians willing to make a significant capital expenditure to purchase our systems and make them a significant part of their practices depends on the success of our sales and marketing programs. We must be able to demonstrate that the cost of our systems and the revenue that a physician can derive from performing procedures are compelling when compared to the costs and revenue associated with alternative aesthetic treatments the physician can offer and persuade physicians to purchase our systems instead of those of our competitors, many of whom already have existing relationships with our target physicians. In addition, we believe our marketing programs, including clinical and practice development support, will be critical to increasing utilization and awareness of our systems, but these programs require physician commitment and involvement to\nsucceed. If we are unable to drive adoption and use of our systems by physicians in their practices, our growth and prospects may be adversely affected.\nOur success depends in part upon patient satisfaction with the effectiveness of our tattoo removal and cellulite treatments.\nIn order to generate repeat and referral business, patients must be satisfied with the effectiveness of a tattoo removal or cellulite procedure using one of our RAP devices. If the tattoo removal or cellulite procedure is not done correctly, and/or the patient suffers from complications and other adverse effects, the patient may not be satisfied with the benefits of our RAP device. If patients are not satisfied with the aesthetic benefits of their procedure using one of our systems or feel that it is too expensive for the results obtained, our reputation and future sales will suffer.\nIf there is not sufficient patient demand for our procedures, our financial results and future prospects will be negatively impacted.\nOur procedures are elective aesthetic procedures, the cost of which must be borne by the patient and is not covered by or reimbursable through government or private health insurance. The decision to undergo one of our procedures is thus driven by patient demand, which may be influenced by a number of factors, such as:\n\u2022the success of our sales and marketing programs;\n\u2022the extent to which our physician customers recommend our procedures to their patients;\n\u2022the extent to which our procedures satisfy patient expectations;\n\u2022our ability to properly train our physician customers in the use of our systems so that their patients do not experience excessive discomfort during treatment or adverse side effects;\n\u2022the cost, safety, and effectiveness of our systems versus other aesthetic treatments;\n\u2022consumer sentiment about the benefits and risks of aesthetic procedures generally and our systems in particular;\n\u2022the success of any direct-to-consumer marketing efforts we may initiate; and\n\u2022general consumer confidence, which may be impacted by economic and political conditions outside of our control.\nOur financial performance will be negatively impacted in the event we cannot generate significant patient demand for procedures performed with our systems.\nWe offer credit terms to some qualified customers. In the event that any of these customers default on the amounts payable to us, our financial results may be adversely affected.\nWe may offer credit terms of 30 to 60 days to qualified customers. In the event that there is a default by any of the customers to whom we have provided credit terms, we may recognize bad debt expenses in our general and administrative expenses. If this bad debt expense is material, it could negatively affect our future results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, in the event of deterioration of general business conditions, we may be subject to increased risk of non-payment of our accounts receivables. We may also be adversely affected by bankruptcies or other business failures of our customers, distributors, and potential customers. A significant delay in the collection of accounts receivables or a reduction of accounts receivables collected may impact our liquidity or result in bad debt expenses.\nThe aesthetic equipment market is characterized by rapid innovation. To compete effectively, we must develop and/or acquire new products and services, seek regulatory clearance and maintain regulatory compliance, market new products successfully, and identify new markets for our technology.\nThe aesthetic energy-based treatment equipment market is subject to continuous technological development and product innovation. If we do not continue to innovate and develop new products, services and applications, our competitive position will likely deteriorate as other companies successfully design and commercialize new products, applications and services or enhancements to current products. To continue to grow in the future, we must continue to develop and/or acquire new and innovative aesthetic and medical products, services and applications, identify new markets, and successfully launch any newly developed or acquired product offerings.\nTo successfully expand our product and service offerings, we must, among other things:\n\u2022develop or otherwise acquire new products that either add to, or significantly improve, our current product offerings;\n\u2022obtain regulatory clearance for and adhere to regulatory requirements relating to new products;\n\u2022convince existing and prospective customers that our product offerings are an attractive revenue-generating addition to their practice;\n\u2022sell our product offerings to a broad customer base;\n\u2022identify new markets and alternative applications for our technology;\n\u2022protect existing and future products with defensible intellectual property; and\n\u2022satisfy and maintain all regulatory requirements for commercialization.\nHistorically, product introductions have been a significant component of our financial performance. To be successful in the medical aesthetics industry, we believe we need to continue to innovate. Our business strategy is based, in part, on our expectation that we will continue to increase or enhance our product offerings. We need to continue to devote substantial research and development resources to introduce new products, which can be costly and time-consuming to our organization.\nWe also believe that, to increase revenue from sales of new products, we need to continue to develop our clinical support, further expand and nurture relationships with industry thought leaders, and increase market awareness of the benefits of our new products. However, even with a significant investment in research and development, we may be unable to continue to develop, acquire or effectively launch and market new products and technologies regularly, or at all. If we fail to successfully commercialize new products or enhancements, our business may be harmed.\nWe may be unsuccessful in expanding and managing our direct sales and marketing forces effectively.\nWe will rely on our own direct sales force and in-house marketing organization to sell our systems and services in North America. In order to meet our anticipated sales objectives, we expect to continue to grow our sales and marketing organization over the next several years. There are significant risks involved in building and managing a sales and marketing organization, including risks related to our ability to:\n\u2022 hire qualified individuals as needed;\n\u2022 generate sufficient leads within our target customer group for our sales force;\n\u2022 provide adequate training for the effective sale and marketing of our systems and services;\n\u2022 retain and motivate our direct sales and marketing professionals;\n\u2022 effectively oversee geographically dispersed sales and marketing teams; and\n\u2022 work successfully with local partners.\nOur failure to adequately address these risks could have a material adverse effect on our ability to increase sales and use of our systems and services, which would cause our revenues to be lower than expected and harm our results of operations.\nOur expanded use of social media platforms presents new risks and challenges, which, if not managed properly, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe will implement a robust public relations outreach strategy that incorporates digital media. In addition, as part of our practice-enhancing services, we will provide customers with digital marketing services, including social media strategies, to support the growth of their practices. Negative posts or comments about us or any of our brands on any social networking website could seriously damage our reputation. In addition, the inappropriate use of certain media vehicles could cause brand damage or information leakage or could lead to legal implications from the improper collection and/or dissemination of personally identifiable information.\nThird parties may attempt to reverse engineer or produce counterfeit versions of our devices and cartridges which may negatively affect our revenues and our reputation, or harm patients and subject us to product liability claims.\nThird parties may seek to reverse engineer or develop counterfeit devices or cartridges that are substantially similar or compatible with our systems and available to practitioners at lower prices than our own. Practitioners may be able to make unauthorized use of our systems\u2019 technology using counterfeit cartridges. We could suffer a loss of revenue if counterfeit cartridges are successfully used on our device. In addition, if copies of products that have been reverse engineered or counterfeit products are used with or in place of our own, we could be subject to product liability claims resulting from the use of damaged or defective goods and suffer damage to our reputation.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information, interrupt our business, and expose us to liability.\nWe are currently making, and expect to continue to make, substantial investments in our information technology systems and infrastructure, some of which are significant. Upgrades involve replacing existing systems with successor systems, outsourcing critical information technology to third parties, making changes to existing systems, including the migration of applications to the cloud, or cost-effectively acquiring new systems with new functionality. Implementing new systems carries significant potential risks, including failure to operate as designed, potential loss or corruption of data or information, changes in security processes, cost overruns, implementation delays, disruption of operations, and the potential inability to meet business and reporting requirements. We rely on strategic partners and other service providers to help us with certain significant information technology projects and services. Information technology projects or services frequently are long-term in nature and may take longer to complete and cost more than we expect and may not deliver the benefits we project once they are complete. Furthermore, pursuing multiple initiatives simultaneously could make implementation significantly more challenging. We are aware of inherent risks associated with replacing these systems and outsourcing critical information technology functions and there can be no assurance that we will not experience significant issues with our existing systems prior to implementation, that our technology initiatives will be successfully deployed as planned or that they will be timely implemented without significant disruption to our operations. Any system implementation and transition difficulty may result in operational challenges, reputational harm, and increased costs that could materially and adversely affect our business operations and results of operations.\nIn the ordinary course of our business and to the extent necessary, we will rely on software to control the ongoing use of our systems, collect and aggregate diagnostic data, and collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property and proprietary business information, and certain personally identifiable information of customers, consultants and employees in our data centers and on our networks. The secure processing, maintenance, and transmission of this information is important to our operations and business strategy. We have established physical, electronic, and policy measures to secure our systems in an attempt to prevent a system breach and the theft of data we collect, and we rely on commercially available systems, software, tools, and monitoring in our effort to provide security for our information technology systems and the digital information we collect, process, transmit and store. The third-party providers of such information technology systems and related infrastructure may have or may obtain access to our systems and data within them.\nDespite our security measures, our information technology systems and related infrastructure, and those of our current and any future collaborators, contractors and consultants and other third parties on which we rely, we may be vulnerable to attacks by computer viruses, malware, hackers or breaches due to malfeasance, employee or contractor error, telecommunication or electrical failures, terrorism or other created or natural disasters. The risk of a cyber-attack or cyber intrusion by computer hackers from around the world, including those from foreign governments and terrorists, has greatly increased in number, intensity and sophistication. In addition, the prevalent use of mobile devices that access confidential information increases the risk of data security breaches, which could lead to the loss of confidential information or other intellectual property. The costs to us to mitigate network security problems, bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant, and while we have implemented security measures to protect our data security and information technology systems, our efforts to address these problems may not be successful, and these problems could result in unexpected interruptions, delays, cessation of service and other harm to our business and our competitive position. If such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our business. Moreover, if a computer security breach affects our systems or results in the unauthorized release of personally identifiable information, our reputation could be materially damaged. In addition, such a breach may require notification to governmental agencies, the media or individuals pursuant to various federal and state privacy and security laws, if applicable, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, and its implementing rules and regulations, as well as regulations promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission and state breach notification laws, or the laws of one or more foreign jurisdictions including the\nEuropean Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679. We could also be exposed to a risk of loss or litigation and potential liability, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRISK RELATED TO REGULATORY ISSUES\nThere is no guarantee that the FDA will grant 510(k) or de novo clearance or PMA approval of our future products and failure to obtain necessary clearances or approvals for our future products would adversely affect our ability to grow our business.\nMost of our future products will require FDA clearance of a 510(k) or de novo application or may require FDA approval of a PMA. The FDA may not approve or clear these products for the indications that are necessary or desirable for successful commercialization. Indeed, the FDA may refuse our requests for premarket clearance or PMA of new products, new intended uses or modifications to existing products. Failure to receive clearance or approval for our products would have an adverse effect on our ability to continue or expand our business.\nIf we fail to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals and clearances, or are unable to obtain, or experience significant delays in obtaining FDA clearances or approvals for our future products or product enhancements, our ability to commercially distribute and market these products could suffer.\nOur products are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA and numerous other federal, state and foreign governmental authorities. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes on the basis of the intended use of the device, the risk associated with the use of the device for that indication, as determined by the FDA, and on the controls deemed by the FDA to be necessary to reasonably ensure their safety and effectiveness. Class I devices, which have the lowest level of risk associated with them, are subject to general controls. Class II devices are subject to general controls and special controls, including performance standards. Class III devices, which have the highest level of risk associated with them, are subject to general controls and PMA. Most Class I devices and some Class II devices are exempt from a requirement that the manufacturer submit a premarket notification, or 510(k), and receive clearance from the FDA which is otherwise a premarketing requirement for a Class II device. Class III devices may not be commercialized until a PMA application is submitted to and approved by the FDA.\nThe process of obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals to market a medical device can be costly and time-consuming, and we may not be able to obtain these clearances or approvals on a timely basis, if at all. The FDA will clear marketing of a lower risk medical device through the 510(k) process if the manufacturer demonstrates that the new product is substantially equivalent to other 510(k)-cleared products or through a de novo process if substantial equivalence is not available. High risk devices deemed to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting, or implantable devices, or devices not deemed substantially equivalent to a previously cleared device, require the approval of a PMA. The PMA process is more costly, lengthy and uncertain than the 510(k) or de novo clearance processes. A PMA application must be supported by extensive data, including, but not limited to, technical, pre-clinical, clinical trial, manufacturing and labeling data, to demonstrate to the FDA\u2019s satisfaction the safety and efficacy of the device for its intended use. The FDA also allows the submission of a direct de novo petition. This procedure allows a manufacturer whose novel device is automatically classified into Class III to request down-classification of its medical device into Class I or Class II on the basis that the device presents low or moderate risk, rather than requiring the submission and approval of a PMA application. Prior to the enactment of the FDASIA, a medical device could only be eligible for de novo classification if the manufacturer first submitted a 510(k) premarket notification and received a determination from the FDA that the device was not substantially equivalent. The FDASIA streamlined the de novo classification pathway by permitting manufacturers to request de novo classification directly without first submitting a 510(k) premarket notification to the FDA and receiving a not substantially equivalent determination.\nU.S. legislative or FDA regulatory reforms or changes in internal FDA policies and procedures may make it more difficult and costly for us to obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates and to manufacture, market and distribute our products after approval is obtained.\nFrom time to time, legislation is drafted and introduced in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the regulatory approval, manufacture and marketing of regulated products or the reimbursement thereof. In addition, FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the FDA in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. Any new regulations or revisions or reinterpretations of existing regulations may impose additional costs or lengthen review times of future products. In addition, FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted, or FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations changed, and what the impact of such changes, if any, may be. Any change in the laws or regulations that govern the clearance and approval processes relating to\nour current and future products could make it more difficult and costly to obtain clearance or approval for new products, or to produce, market and distribute existing products. Significant delays in receiving clearance or approval, or the failure to receive clearance or approval for our new products would have an adverse effect on our ability to expand our business.\nModifications to our products may require new regulatory clearances or approvals or may require us to recall or cease marketing our products until clearances or approvals are obtained.\nModifications to our products may require new regulatory approvals or clearances, including 510(k) clearances or PMA's, or require us to recall or cease marketing the modified devices until these clearances or approvals are obtained. The FDA requires device manufacturers to initially make and document a determination of whether or not a modification requires a new approval, supplement or clearance. A manufacturer may determine that a modification could not significantly affect safety or efficacy and does not represent a major change in its intended use, so that no new 510(k) clearance is necessary. However, the FDA can review a manufacturer's decision and may disagree. The FDA may also, on its own initiative, determine that a new 510(k) clearance, de novo submission or PMA approval is required. Once we have a commercialized product, we may make modifications in the future that we believe do not or will not require additional clearances or approvals. If the FDA disagrees and requires new clearances or approvals for these modifications, we may be required to recall and to stop marketing our products as modified, which could require us to redesign our products and harm our operating results. In these circumstances, we may be subject to significant enforcement actions.\nWhere we determine that modifications to our products require a new 510(k) or de novo clearance or PMA application, we may not be able to obtain those additional clearances or approvals for the modifications or additional indications in a timely manner, or at all. Obtaining clearances and approvals can be a time-consuming process, and delays in obtaining required future clearances or approvals would adversely affect our ability to introduce new or enhanced products in a timely manner, which in turn would harm our future growth.\nThe Generation 2.0 device, which has been cleared by the FDA for tattoo removal and cellulite, has been modified for commercial launch as Generation 2.2 and requires a special 510(k) filing, which may not be cleared.\nWe conducted our clinical trials for the acceleration of tattoo removal and cellulite reduction and received premarket clearance based on a device that is not optimized for commercial launch. We have made certain modifications to the cartridge for ease of loading and made improvements in user interface, improvements to extend the life and ease of replacement of the consumable treatment head cartridges to the device (Generation 2.2) intended for limited launch. The changes made to our device from Generation 2.0 to Generation 2.2 will necessitate the filing of an additional special 510(k) before being rolled out nationally. We cannot be certain that the changes we deem appropriate to make to the future RAP device prior to that product's launch will not require another 510(k) filing. While we believe these changes will not affect the therapy delivered by our RAP device, the FDA may require a full 510(k) submission rather than a special to clear these changes or may not clear these changes in a timely manner which could delay our commercial launch.\nEven if our products are cleared or approved by the FDA, if we or our suppliers fail to comply with ongoing FDA requirements, or if we experience unanticipated problems with our products, these products could be subject to restrictions or withdrawal from the market.\nAny product for which we obtain clearance or approval, and the manufacturing processes, reporting requirements, post-approval clinical data and promotional activities for such product, will be subject to continued regulatory review, oversight and periodic inspections by the FDA and other domestic and foreign regulatory bodies. In particular, we and our suppliers are required to comply with the FDA\u2019s QSR which covers the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, control, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, storage and shipping of any product for which we obtain clearance or approval. The FDA enforces the QSR and other regulations through periodic inspections. The failure by us or one of our suppliers to comply with applicable statutes and regulations administered by the FDA, or the failure to timely and adequately respond to any adverse inspection observations or product safety issues, could result in, among other things, any of the following enforcement actions:\n\u2022untitled letters, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;\n\u2022unanticipated expenditures to address or defend such actions;\n\u2022customer notifications for repair, replacement, refunds;\n\u2022recall, detention or seizure of our products;\n\u2022operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;\n\u2022refusing or delaying our requests for premarket clearance or PMA of new products or modified products;\n\u2022operating restrictions;\n\u2022withdrawing premarket clearances on PMA's that have already been granted;\n\u2022refusal to grant export approval for our products; or\n\u2022criminal prosecution.\nIf any of these actions were to occur, it would harm our reputation and cause our product sales and profitability to suffer and may prevent us from generating revenue. Furthermore, our key component suppliers may not currently be or may not continue to be in compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements which could result in our failure to produce our products on a timely basis and in the required quantities, if at all.\nEven if regulatory clearance or approval of a product is granted, such clearance or approval may be subject to limitations on the intended uses for which the product may be marketed and reduce our potential to successfully commercialize the product and generate revenue from the product. If the FDA determines that our promotional materials, labeling, training or other marketing or educational activities constitute promotion of an unapproved use, it could request that we cease or modify our training or promotional materials or subject us to regulatory enforcement actions. It is also possible that other federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action if they consider our training or other promotional materials to constitute promotion of an unapproved use, which could result in significant fines or penalties under other statutory authorities, such as laws prohibiting false claims for reimbursement.\nIn addition, we may be required to conduct costly post-market testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or effectiveness of our products, and we must comply with medical device reporting requirements, including the reporting of adverse events and malfunctions related to our products. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with our products, including unanticipated adverse events or adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, manufacturing problems, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements such as QSR, may result in changes to labeling, restrictions on such products or manufacturing processes, withdrawal of the products from the market, voluntary or mandatory recalls, a requirement to repair, replace or refund the cost of any medical device we manufacture or distribute, fines, suspension of regulatory approvals, product seizures, injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties which would adversely affect our business, operating results and prospects.\nOur products may in the future be subject to product recalls that could harm our reputation, business and financial results.\nThe FDA and similar foreign governmental authorities have the authority to require the recall of commercialized products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture. In the case of the FDA, the authority to require a recall must be based on an FDA finding that there is a reasonable probability that the device would cause serious injury or death. Manufacturers may, under their own initiative, recall a product if any material deficiency in a device is found. A government-mandated or voluntary recall by us or one of our distributors could occur as a result of component failures, manufacturing errors, design or labeling defects or other deficiencies and issues. Recalls of any of our products would divert managerial and financial resources and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The FDA requires that certain classifications of recalls be reported to the FDA within 10 working days after the recall is initiated. Companies are required to maintain certain records of recalls, even if they are not reportable to the FDA. We may initiate voluntary recalls involving our products in the future that we determine do not require notification of the FDA. If the FDA disagrees with our determinations, they could require us to report those actions as recalls. A future recall announcement could harm our reputation with customers and negatively affect our sales. In addition, the FDA could take enforcement action for failing to report the recalls when they were conducted.\nIf our products cause or contribute to a death or a serious injury, or malfunction in certain ways, we will be subject to medical device reporting regulations, which can result in voluntary corrective actions or agency enforcement actions.\nUnder the FDA medical device reporting regulations, medical device manufacturers are required to report to the FDA information that a device has or may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or has malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction of the device or one of our similar devices were to recur. If we fail to report these events to the FDA within the required time frames, or at all, the FDA could take enforcement action against us. Any such adverse event involving our products also could result in future voluntary corrective actions, such as recalls or customer notifications, or agency action, such as inspection or enforcement action. Any corrective action, whether voluntary or involuntary, as well as defending ourselves in a lawsuit, will require the dedication of our time and capital, distract management from operating our business, and may harm our reputation and financial results.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR LICENSE AGREEMENT AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nWe have licensed certain intellectual property rights for our technology from MD Anderson, and if our license agreement with MD Anderson is terminated, our business will be materially harmed.\nWe are a party to a royalty-bearing, worldwide, exclusive license agreement for certain intellectual property rights, including patent rights related to RAP technology, with MD Anderson. If we become insolvent, cannot meet commercial diligence requirements contained in the license agreement, fail to make annual maintenance fee payments, or otherwise materially default without curing the default, the license agreement could be terminated. Furthermore, if we are successful in commercializing and selling the RAP device, we will owe milestone and royalty payments pursuant to this license agreement. If we fail to make those payments in accordance with the license agreement, our license could be terminated. If our license agreement with MD Anderson is terminated, our business will be materially harmed.\nWe may incur substantial costs as a result of litigation or other proceedings relating to patent and other intellectual property rights.\nWe may from time to time seek to enforce our intellectual property rights against infringers when we determine that a successful outcome is probable and may lead to an increase in the value of the intellectual property. The validity of our patents and the patents we have licensed may be challenged in court and in administrative proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (\u201cUSPTO\u201d) and other patent offices outside the United States. These lawsuits and proceedings are expensive and would consume time and resources and divert the attention of managerial and scientific personnel even if we were successful in stopping the infringement of such patents. In addition, there is a risk that the court will decide that such patents are not valid and that we do not have the right to stop the other party from using the inventions. There is also the risk that, even if the validity of such patents is upheld, the court will refuse to stop the other party on the grounds that such other party's activities do not infringe our intellectual property rights.\nIf we are unable to protect the intellectual property used in our products, others may be able to copy our innovations which may impair our ability to compete effectively in our markets.\nThe strength of our patents involves complex legal and scientific questions and can be uncertain. We have nine families of patents. As of December 31, 2020, our patent portfolio was comprised of two granted and 11 pending U.S. patent applications, 29 granted and 69 pending foreign counterpart patent applications, and one pending PCT patent application, each of which we either own directly or of which we are the exclusive licensee. These patent applications may be challenged or fail to result in issued patents, or if issued, these patents and our existing patents may be too narrow to prevent third parties from developing or designing around our intellectual property and in that event, we may lose competitive advantage, which could result in harm to our business.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers.\nAs is common in the medical device industry, we employ individuals who were previously employed at other medical device companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. We may be subject to claims that these employees, or we, have used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information and know-how, the value of our technology and products could be adversely affected.\nIn addition to patented technology, we rely upon, among other things, unpatented proprietary technology, processes, trade secrets and know-how. Any involuntary disclosure to or misappropriation by third parties of our confidential or proprietary information could enable competitors to duplicate or surpass our technological achievements, potentially eroding our competitive position in our market. We seek to protect confidential or proprietary information in part by confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and third parties. While we require all of our employees, consultants, advisors and any third parties who have access to our proprietary know-how, information and technology to enter into confidentiality agreements, we cannot be certain that this know-how, information and technology will not be disclosed or that competitors will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques. These agreements may be terminated or breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such termination or breach. Furthermore, these agreements may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets and know-how in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure.\nIf third parties claim that our products infringe their intellectual property rights, we may be forced to expend significant financial resources and management time defending against such actions and our financial condition and our results of operations could suffer.\nThird parties may claim that our products infringe their patents and other intellectual property rights. Identifying third-party patent rights can be particularly difficult because, in general, patent applications can be maintained in secrecy for at least 18 months after their earliest priority date. Historically, there has been substantial litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights in the medical device and related industries. If a competitor were to challenge our patents, licenses or other intellectual property rights, or assert that our products infringe its patent or other intellectual property rights, we could incur substantial litigation costs, be forced to make expensive changes to our product design, pay royalties or other fees to license rights in order to continue manufacturing and selling our products, or pay substantial damages. Third-party infringement claims, regardless of their outcome, would not only consume our financial resources but also divert our management\u2019s time and effort.\nIf we are unable to protect our new branding trademarks from infringement, our business prospects may be harmed.\nWe currently have applied for a registered trademark for the use of our product brand name in association with our commercial products to be offered in the United States. Although we may take steps to monitor the possible infringement or misuse of our brand name or other trademarks once they are obtained, it is possible that third parties may infringe, dilute or otherwise violate our trademark rights. Any unauthorized use of our trademarks could harm our reputation or commercial interests. In addition, our enforcement against third-party infringers or violators may be unduly expensive and time-consuming, and any remedy obtained may constitute insufficient redress relative to the damages we may suffer. Our business may be materially adversely affected in the event we are unable to protect our trademarks.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR COMMON STOCK\nOur stock price has been and may continue to be sporadically traded and volatile, which could result in substantial losses for investors.\nSince our IPO in February 2019, our stock price has ranged from a high of $29.00 to a low of $4.12, the trading volume in our stock has been limited and sporadic, and the market price of our common stock is likely to continue to be highly volatile and could fluctuate widely in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control. In addition, the securities markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also significantly affect the market price of our common stock.\nYour ownership may be diluted if additional capital stock is issued to raise capital, to finance acquisitions or in connection with strategic transactions.\nWe have in the past and intend in the future to raise funds, finance acquisitions or develop strategic relationships by issuing equity or convertible debt securities, which will reduce the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders. Our Board has the authority, without action or vote of the stockholders, to issue all or any part of our authorized but unissued shares of common stock. We are authorized to issue up to 100,000,000 shares of common stock. Future issuances of common stock would reduce your influence over matters on which stockholders vote and would be dilutive to earnings per share.\nShares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding options or warrants may substantially increase the number of shares available for sale in the public market and depress the price of our common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had a material number of outstanding options and warrants to purchase shares of common stock. To the extent any of these options or warrants are exercised and any additional options or warrants are granted and exercised, there will be further dilution to stockholders and investors. Until the options and warrants expire, these holders will have an opportunity to profit from any increase in the market price of our common stock without assuming the risks of ownership. Holders of options and warrants may convert or exercise these securities at a time when we could obtain additional capital on terms more favorable than those provided by the options or warrants. The exercise of the options and warrants will dilute the voting interest of the owners of presently outstanding shares by adding a substantial number of additional shares of our common stock.\nThe concentration of our common stock ownership by a single shareholder will limit your ability to influence corporate matters.\nOur largest shareholder, Remeditex Ventures, LLC (Remeditex), beneficially owns and will be able to vote in the aggregate a significant percentage of our outstanding common stock. As such, Remeditex, will continue to have the ability to exert significant influence over all corporate activities, including the election or removal of directors and the outcome of tender offers, mergers, proxy contests or other purchases of common stock that could give our stockholders the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market price for their shares of common stock. This concentrated control will limit your ability to influence corporate matters and, as a result, we may take actions that shareholders do not view as beneficial. In addition, such concentrated control could discourage others from initiating changes of control. In such cases, the perception of our prospects in the market may be adversely affected and the market price of our common stock may decline.\nCertain provisions in our organizational documents could enable our Board to prevent or delay a change of control.\nOur organizational documents contain provisions that may have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change of control, or unsolicited acquisition proposals, that a stockholder might consider favorable. These include provisions:\n\u2022prohibiting the stockholders from acting by written consent;\n\u2022requiring advance notice of director nominations and of business to be brought before a meeting of stockholders;\n\u2022requiring a majority vote of the outstanding shares of common stock to amend the bylaws; and\n\u2022limiting the persons who may call special stockholders\u2019 meetings.\nIn addition, Delaware law makes it difficult for stockholders that recently have acquired a large interest in a corporation to cause the merger or acquisition of the corporation against the directors\u2019 wishes. Under Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, a Delaware corporation may not engage in any merger or other business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder except in limited circumstances, including by approval of the corporation\u2019s Board.\nWe have no intention of declaring dividends in the foreseeable future.\nThe decision to pay cash dividends on our common stock rests with our Board and will depend on our earnings, unencumbered cash, capital requirements and financial condition. We do not anticipate declaring any dividends in the foreseeable future, as we intend to use any excess cash to fund our operations. Investors in our common stock should not expect to receive dividend income on their investment, and investors will be dependent on the appreciation of our common stock to earn a return on their investment.\nFailure to maintain effective internal control over our financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could cause our financial reports to be inaccurate.\nWe are required pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or Section 404, to maintain internal control over financial reporting and to assess and report on the effectiveness of those controls. This assessment includes disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting. Our management concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting were, and continue to be, ineffective as of December 31, 2020. We identified material weaknesses in our internal controls due to the lack of segregation of duties, the limitations of our financial accounting system to properly segregate duties and the absence of internal staff with extensive knowledge of SEC financial and GAAP reporting. While management is working to remediate these material weaknesses, there is no assurance that such changes, when economically feasible and sustainable, will remediate the identified material weaknesses or that the controls will prevent or detect future material weaknesses. If we are not able to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, our financial statements, including related disclosures, may be inaccurate, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFailure to continue improving our accounting systems and controls could impair our ability to comply with the financial reporting and internal controls requirements for publicly traded companies.\nAs a public company, we operate in an increasingly demanding regulatory environment, which requires us to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and the related rules and regulations of the SEC. Company responsibilities required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act include establishing corporate oversight and adequate internal control over financial\nreporting and disclosure controls and procedures. Effective internal controls are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to help prevent financial fraud.\nManagement did elect to perform an annual assessment as of December 31, 2020, of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for our first annual report. Our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was, and continues to be, ineffective as of December 31, 2020, due to material weaknesses in our internal controls resulting from a lack of segregation of duties, the limitations of our financial accounting system, and the absence of internal staff with extensive knowledge of SEC financial and GAAP reporting. This annual assessment was performed earlier than required. Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, starting with the second annual report that we would expect to file with the SEC. However, for as long as we remain an emerging growth company (\"EGC\") as defined in the JOBS Act, we have and intend to consider to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We may continue to take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an EGC. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our business and results of operations could be harmed and investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information.\nGENERAL RISK FACTORS\nWe may become subject to legal proceedings that could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFrom time to time and in the ordinary course of our business, we may become involved in various legal proceedings. All such legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and, regardless of the merits of the claims, litigation may be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to our operations and distracting to management. If resolved against us, such legal proceedings could result in excessive verdicts, injunctive relief or other equitable relief that may affect how we operate our business. Similarly, if we settle such legal proceedings, it may affect how we operate our business. Future court decisions, alternative dispute resolution awards, business expansion or legislative activity may increase our exposure to litigation and regulatory investigations. In some cases, substantial non-economic remedies or punitive damages may be sought. Although we maintain liability insurance coverage, there can be no assurance that such coverage will cover any particular verdict, judgment or settlement that may be entered against us, that such coverage will prove to be adequate or that such coverage will continue to remain available on acceptable terms, if at all. If we incur liability that exceeds our insurance coverage or that is not within the scope of the coverage in legal proceedings brought against us, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nEconomic uncertainty or economic deterioration could adversely affect us.\nWhile the global economy is improving since the initial impact of the novel strain of coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, there are still uncertainties surrounding the strength and duration of the recovery that may continue to drive stock market and interest rate volatility and adversely impact consumer confidence, product demand, and our ability to refinance our debt. Economic conditions, along with our operating performance, may also materially and adversely impact our ability to access the financial markets. Accordingly, our future business and financial results are subject to uncertainty. If economic conditions deteriorate in the future, our future revenues and financial results could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur employees and independent contractors, including consultants, manufacturers, distributors, commercial collaborators, service providers and other vendors may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe are exposed to the risk that our employees and independent contractors, including consultants, manufacturers, distributors, commercial collaborators, service providers and other vendors may engage in misconduct or other illegal activity. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional, reckless and/or negligent conduct or other unauthorized activities that violate the laws and regulations of the FDA and other similar regulatory bodies, including those laws that require the reporting of true, complete and accurate information to such regulatory bodies; manufacturing standards; U.S. federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse, data privacy laws and other similar non-U.S. laws; or laws that require the true, complete and accurate reporting of financial information or data. Activities subject to these laws also involve the improper use or misrepresentation of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, the creation of fraudulent data in our nonclinical studies or clinical trials, or illegal misappropriation of product, which could result in regulatory sanctions and cause serious harm to our reputation. It is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct by employees and other third parties, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from\ngovernmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations.\nIn addition, we are subject to the risk that a person or government could allege such fraud or other misconduct, even if none occurred. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business and financial results, including, without limitation, the imposition of significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, disgorgements, individual imprisonment, other sanctions, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings and curtailment of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.\nAs an EGC under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, or JOBS Act, we are permitted to, and intend to, rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements.\nAs an EGC under the JOBS Act, we are permitted to, and intend to, rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements. We are an EGC until the earliest of:\n\u2022the last day of the fiscal year during which we have total annual gross revenues of $1.07 billion or more;\n\u2022the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our IPO;\n\u2022the date on which we have, during the previous 3-year period, issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt; or\n\u2022the date on which we are deemed a \u201clarge accelerated issuer\u201d as defined under the federal securities laws.\nFor so long as we remain an EGC, we will not be required to:\n\u2022have an auditor report on our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;\n\u2022comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor\u2019s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis);\n\u2022submit certain executive compensation matters to shareholders advisory votes pursuant to the \u201csay on frequency\u201d and \u201csay on pay\u201d provisions (requiring a non-binding shareholder vote to approve compensation of certain executive officers) and the \u201csay on golden parachute\u201d provisions (requiring a non-binding shareholder vote to approve golden parachute arrangements for certain executive officers in connection with mergers and certain other business combinations) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010;\n\u2022include detailed compensation discussion and analysis in our filings under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and instead may provide a reduced level of disclosure concerning executive compensation;\n\u2022present more than two years of audited financial statements or two years of related Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\"MD&A\"); and\n\u2022immediately adopt new or revised financial accounting standards under \u00a7107 of the JOBS Act; instead we are eligible to claim longer phase-in periods.\nWe intend to take advantage of all of these reduced reporting requirements and exemptions, including the longer phase-in periods for the adoption of new or revised financial accounting standards under \u00a7107 of the JOBS Act. We have elected to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards, and, therefore, will not be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as public companies that are not EGCs.\nCertain of these reduced reporting requirements and exemptions were already available to us due to the fact that we also qualify as a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d under SEC rules. For instance, smaller reporting companies are not required to obtain an auditor attestation and report regarding management\u2019s assessment of internal control over financial reporting; are not required to provide a compensation discussion and analysis; are not required to provide a pay-for-performance graph or CEO pay ratio disclosure; and may present only two years of audited financial statements and related MD&A disclosure.\nUnder the JOBS Act, we may take advantage of the above-described reduced reporting requirements and exemptions for up to five years after our initial sale of common equity pursuant to a registration statement declared effective under the Securities Act of 1933, or such earlier time that we no longer meet the definition of an EGC. Further, under current SEC rules,\nwe will continue to qualify as a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d for so long as we have a public float (i.e., the market value of common equity held by non-affiliates) of less than $250 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter.\nWe cannot predict if investors will find our securities less attractive due to our reliance on these exemptions.\nTechniques employed by short sellers have in the past and may in the future drive down the market price of our common stock.\nShort selling is the practice of selling securities that the seller does not own but rather has borrowed from a third-party with the intention of buying identical securities back at a later date to return to the lender. The short seller hopes to profit from a decline in the value of the securities between the sale of the borrowed securities and the purchase of the replacement shares, as the short seller expects to pay less in that purchase than it received in the sale. As it is in the short seller\u2019s best interests for the price of the stock to decline, many short sellers publish, or arrange for the publication of, negative opinions regarding the relevant issuer and its business prospects in order to create negative market momentum and generate profits for themselves after selling a stock short. These short attacks have led to selling of shares in the market. Issuers such as Soliton, that have common stock with limited trading volumes and/or have been susceptible to relatively high volatility levels, can be particularly vulnerable to such short seller attacks. In May 2019, our common stock was the subject of a report by a short seller that contained incorrect and misleading information, which report led to a severe decline in our stock price. Although we timely responded to these false and misleading allegations, we cannot assure you that such similar false and misleading articles will not be published again in the future. The publication of any such articles regarding us in the future may bring about a temporary, or possibly long term, decline in the market price of our common stock. If we continue to be the subject of unfavorable allegations, we may have to expend a significant amount of resources to investigate such allegations and/or defend ourselves. While we would strongly defend against any such short seller attacks, we may be constrained in the manner in which we can proceed against the relevant short seller by applicable state law or issues of commercial confidentiality. Such a situation could be costly and time-consuming, and could be distracting for our management team.\nWe may fail to meet our publicly announced guidance or other expectations about our business and future operating results, which could cause our stock price to decline.\nThe Company may provide financial guidance about its business and future operating results. In developing this guidance, the Company\u2019s management must make certain assumptions and judgments about its future operating performance, including but not limited to projected hiring of sales professionals, growth of revenue in the aesthetic device market, increase or decrease of its market share, costs of production of its recently introduced products, and stability of the macro-economic environment in the Company\u2019s key markets. Furthermore, analysts and investors may develop and publish their own projections of the Company\u2019s business, which may form a consensus about the Company\u2019s future performance. The Company\u2019s business results may vary significantly from such guidance or that consensus due to a number of factors, many of which are outside of the Company\u2019s control, and which could adversely affect its operations and operating results. Furthermore, if the Company makes downward revisions of the Company\u2019s previously announced guidance, or if the Company\u2019s publicly announced guidance of future operating results fails to meet expectations of securities analysts, investors or other interested parties, the price of the Company\u2019s common stock could decline.", "PERMNO": 18414, "SIC": 3845, "TIC": "SOLY"}
