RISK FACTORS\nRisk Factors Summary\nBelow is a summary of the principal risks associated with an investment in the Company. This summary should not be relied upon as an exhaustive list of the material risks facing our business.\n\u2022the Merger, the pendency of the Merger Agreement, or our failure to complete the Merger;\n\u2022the impact of the global COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022our ability to deliver popular, high-quality content in a timely manner;\n\u2022the level of demand for our games and products;\n\u2022our ability to meet customer expectations with respect to our brands, games, services, and/or business practices;\n\u2022negative impacts on our business resulting from concerns regarding our workplace, including associated legal proceedings;\n\u2022our ability to attract, retain, and motivate skilled personnel;\n\u2022competition;\n\u2022our reliance on a relatively small number of franchises for a significant portion of our revenues and profits;\n\u2022negative impacts from unionization or attempts to unionize by our workforce;\n\u2022our ability to adapt to rapid technological change and allocate our resources accordingly;\n\u2022the increasing importance of digital sales and the risks of that business model;\n\u2022our ability to effectively manage the scope and complexity of our business;\n\u2022our reliance on third-party platforms, which are also our competitors, for the distribution of products;\n\u2022our dependence on the success and availability of video game consoles manufactured by third parties and our ability to develop commercially successful products for these consoles;\n\u2022the increasing importance of free-to-play games and the risks of that business model;\n\u2022the risks and uncertainties of conducting business outside the U.S., including the need for regulatory approval to operate, the relatively weaker protection for our intellectual property rights, and the impact of cultural differences on consumer preferences;\n\u2022the importance of retail sales to our business and the risks of that business model;\n\u2022our ability to realize the expected benefits of our recent restructuring actions;\n\u2022any difficulties in integrating acquired businesses or realizing the anticipated benefits of strategic transactions;\n\u2022seasonality in the sale of our products;\n\u2022fluctuation in our recurring business;\n\u2022the risk of distributors, retailers, development, and licensing partners or other third parties being unable to honor their commitments or otherwise putting our brand at risk;\n\u2022our reliance on tools and technologies owned by third parties;\n\u2022our use of open source software;\n\u2022risks associated with undisclosed content or features in our games;\n\u2022impact of objectionable consumer- or other third-party-created content on our operating results or reputation;\n\u2022outages, disruptions, or degradations in our services, products, and/or technological infrastructure;\n\u2022any cybersecurity-related attack, significant data breach, fraudulent activity, or disruption of our information technology systems or networks;\n\u2022significant disruption during our live events;\n\u2022catastrophic events;\n\u2022climate change;\n\u2022provisions in our corporate documents and Delaware state law that could delay or prevent a change of control;\n\u2022ongoing legal proceedings, related to workplace concerns and otherwise;\n\u2022increasing regulation in key territories over our business, products, and distribution;\n\u2022changes in government regulation relating to the Internet;\n\u2022our compliance with evolving data privacy laws and regulations;\n\u2022scrutiny regarding the appropriateness of the content in our games and our ability to receive target ratings for certain titles;\n\u2022changes in tax rates and/or tax laws and exposure to additional tax liabilities;\n\u2022fluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u2022changes in financial accounting standards or the application of existing or future standards as our business evolves;\n\u2022insolvency or business failure of any of our business partners; and\n\u2022declines in general economic conditions and related discretionary spending on our products and services.\nThe following are detailed descriptions of our Risk Factors summarized above.\nWe wish to caution the reader that the following important risk factors, and those risk factors described elsewhere in this report or in our other filings with the SEC, could cause our actual results to differ materially from those stated in forward-looking statements contained in this document and elsewhere. These risks are not presented in order of importance or probability of occurrence. Further, the risks described below are not the only risks that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. Any of these risks may have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations, income, revenue, profitability, cash flows, liquidity, or stock price.\nRisks Related to the Merger\nWhile the Merger Agreement is in effect, we are subject to certain interim covenants.\nOn January 18, 2022, we entered into the Merger Agreement with Microsoft and Merger Sub, a wholly owned subsidiary of Microsoft, pursuant to which Microsoft agreed to acquire the Company in an all-cash transaction for $95.00 per share of our issued and outstanding common stock.\nThe Merger Agreement generally requires us to operate our business in the ordinary course, subject to certain exceptions, including as required by applicable law, pending consummation of the Merger, and subjects us to customary interim operating covenants that restrict us, without Microsoft\u2019s approval (such approval not to be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed), from taking certain specified actions until the Merger is completed or the Merger Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms. These restrictions could prevent us from pursuing certain business opportunities that may arise prior to the consummation of the Merger and may affect our ability to execute our business strategies and attain financial and other goals and may impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe announcement and pendency of the Merger may result in disruptions to our business, and the Merger could divert management's attention, disrupt our relationships with third parties and employees, and result in negative publicity or legal proceedings, any of which could negatively impact our operating results and ongoing business.\nIn connection with the pending Merger, our current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with us following the Merger, which may materially adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key personnel and other employees while the Merger is pending. Key employees may depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with us following the Merger, and may depart prior to the consummation of the Merger. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that we will be able to attract and retain key employees to the same extent that we have been able to in the past.\nThe proposed Merger could cause disruptions to our business or business relationships with our existing and potential customers, suppliers, vendors, landlords, and other business partners, and this could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. Parties with which we have business relationships may experience uncertainty as to the future of such relationships and may delay or defer certain business decisions, seek alternative relationships with third parties, or seek to negotiate changes or alter their present business relationships with us. Parties with whom we otherwise may have sought to establish business relationships may seek alternative relationships with third parties.\nThe pursuit of the Merger may place a significant burden on management and internal resources, which may have a negative impact on our ongoing business. It may also divert management\u2019s time and attention from the day-to-day operation of our remaining businesses and the execution of our other strategic initiatives. This could adversely affect our financial results. In addition, we have incurred and will continue to incur other significant costs, expenses, and fees for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the proposed Merger, and many of these fees and costs are payable regardless of whether or not the pending Merger is consummated.\nAny of the foregoing, individually or in combination, could materially and adversely affect our business, our financial condition and our results of operations and prospects.\nThe Merger may not be completed within the expected timeframe, or at all, for a variety of reasons, including the possibility that the Merger Agreement is terminated prior to the consummation of the Merger, and the failure to complete the Merger could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and the market price of our common stock.\nThere can be no assurance that the Merger will be completed in the expected timeframe, or at all. The Merger Agreement contains a number of customary closing conditions that must be satisfied or waived prior to the completion of the Merger, including, among others, (1) the approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement by our stockholders, (2) the absence of any court order or law prohibiting (or seeking to prohibit) the consummation of the Merger, (3) the termination or expiration of any applicable waiting period or periods under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (as amended) and specified approvals under certain other antitrust and foreign investment laws, subject to certain limitations, (4) compliance by us and Microsoft in all material respects with our respective obligations under the Merger Agreement, and (5) subject to specified exceptions and qualifications for materiality, the accuracy of representations and warranties made by us and Microsoft, respectively, as of the signing date and the closing date.\nThere can be no assurance that all required approvals will be obtained or that all closing conditions will otherwise be satisfied (or waived, if applicable), and, if all required approvals are obtained and all closing conditions are satisfied (or waived, if applicable), we can provide no assurance as to the terms, conditions and timing of such approvals or that the Merger will be completed in a timely manner or at all. Many of the conditions to completion of the Merger are not within our or Microsoft\u2019s control, and we cannot predict when or if these conditions will be satisfied (or waived, as applicable). Even if regulatory approval is obtained, it is possible conditions will be imposed that could result in a material delay in, or the abandonment of, the Merger or otherwise have an adverse effect on us.\nThe Merger Agreement contains customary mutual termination rights for us and Microsoft, which could prevent the consummation of the Merger, including if the Merger is not completed by January 18, 2023 (subject to automatic extension first to April 18, 2023, then to July 18, 2023, in each case, to the extent the regulatory closing conditions are the only conditions that remain outstanding).\nThe Merger Agreement also contains customary termination rights for the benefit of each party, including if the other party breaches its representations, warranties, or covenants under the Merger Agreement in a way that would result in a failure of the other party\u2019s condition to closing being satisfied (subject to certain procedures and cure periods). Additionally, the Merger Agreement provides termination rights, if certain conditions are met, including (1) for Microsoft, if our Board of Directors changes its recommendation in favor of the Merger, and (2) for us, if our Board of Directors authorizes entry into a definitive agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement) prior to us receiving stockholder approval of the Merger.\nIf the Merger is not completed within the expected timeframe or at all, we may be subject to a number of material risks, including:\n\u2022the market price of our common stock may decline to the extent that current market prices reflect a market assumption that the Merger will be completed;\n\u2022if the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain specified circumstances, we or Microsoft will be required to pay a termination fee, including that we will be required to pay Microsoft a termination fee of approximately $2.27 billion under specified circumstances, and Microsoft will be required to pay us a reverse termination fee ranging from $2.0 billion to $3.0 billion under specified circumstances;\n\u2022some costs related to the Merger must be paid whether or not the Merger is completed, and we have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant costs, expenses and fees for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the proposed transaction, as well as the diversion of management and resources towards the Merger, for which we will have received little or no benefit if completion of the Merger does not occur; and\n\u2022we may experience negative publicity and/or reactions from our investors, customers, partners, suppliers, vendors, landlords, other business partners and employees\nStockholder litigation could prevent or delay the closing of the pending Merger or otherwise negatively impact our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe may incur additional costs in connection with the defense or settlement of stockholder litigation in connection with the pending Merger. Such litigation may adversely affect our ability to complete the pending Merger. We could incur significant costs in connection with such litigation, including costs associated with the indemnification obligations to our directors and officers. Such litigation may be distracting to management and may require us to incur additional, significant costs. Such litigation could result in the Merger being delayed and/or enjoined by a court of competent jurisdiction, which could prevent the Merger from becoming effective. See Note 22 to the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of complaints filed on February 24, 2022 with respect to the pending Merger.\nBusiness and Industry Risks\nWe are unable to predict the full impact of the global COVID-19 pandemic.\nSince COVID-19 emerged in December 2019 and was declared a pandemic in March 2020, it has extensively impacted global health and the economic environment. The full extent to which the global COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath impacts our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations, income, revenue, profitability, cash flows, liquidity, or stock price continues to depend on numerous evolving factors that we are not able to fully predict, including: the duration and severity of the pandemic and the prevalence and severity of new COVID variants; the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and consumer habits; the impact of governmental, business, and individual actions that have been and will continue to be taken in response to the pandemic; unintended consequences of actions we take, or have taken, in response to the pandemic; the impact of the pandemic on the health or productivity of our employees and external developers, including the ability to develop high-quality and well-received interactive software products and entertainment content and/or to release our products and content in a timely manner with effective quality control; the longer-term impact of substantially-increased remote access to our networks and systems on our ability to prevent, detect, and remedy cyber-attacks or information security incidents while our workforce remains dispersed; the effects on the health, finances and discretionary spending patterns of our consumers, including the ability of our consumers to pay for our products and content; our ability to sell products at assumed prices; the financial impact, supply chain constraints and other strains on the retail customers and distributors on whom we rely to sell our physical products to consumers; the financial impact and strain on platform providers for whose video game consoles and/or on whose networks certain of our products are exclusively available; the financial impact and strain on third-party mobile and web platforms that provide significant online distribution for, and/or provide other services critical for the operation of, a number of our games; the effects on our suppliers who manufacture our physical products and on other third parties with which we partner (e.g., to market or ship our products), including from supply chain disruptions; the effects on our lenders and financial counterparties; the effects on regulatory agencies around the world on which we rely; our ability to continue to develop our emerging businesses, such as advertising; increased volatility in foreign currency exchange rates; the impact of recent and potential upcoming or ongoing large-scale actions by local and federal governments and agencies or similar governing bodies in the U.S. and around the world, the U.S. Federal Reserve, and other central banks around the world, including the impact of any of these actions on the U.S. or world economy or global financial markets; and any other factor which results in disruptions or increased costs associated with the development, production, post-production, marketing and distribution of our products, and/or the digital advertising offered within our content. If adverse effects in these areas from the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic continue or worsen, our business may be negatively impacted. Further, we cannot predict the emergence of new variants, the rise and fall of case rates, or the associated reducing, lifting, and reenacting of stay-at-home orders and other, similar measures to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. As in the case of COVID-19, the occurrence of other epidemics, medical emergencies, and other public health crises outside of our control could have a negative impact on our business. Additionally, stay-at-home orders, the curtailment of certain other forms of entertainment, and other pandemic-related factors that make consumers more inclined to spend time at home may increase demand for our products, and such increase may not be sustained if pandemic-related restrictions and behaviors change. These trends may continue to evolve, and prior trends for revenues, net income, and other financial results and operating metrics, may not be indicative of results for future periods, particularly as pandemic-related factors become less significant.\nOur professional esports leagues (i.e., the Overwatch League and the Call of Duty League) and the franchise teams that make up the leagues generate revenues from live in-person events. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in the cancellation of live in-person events and any continued health and safety concerns with large public gatherings may impact the ability of the teams in our leagues to hold future live in-person events. Prolonged COVID-19 risks could result in teams being unable or unwilling to make continued investments or otherwise participate in our leagues going forward. This, in turn, could result in the loss of future entry fee payments, revenue from advertising, and other future potential league revenues or income, other benefits associated with our esports business, and/or the termination of our leagues. Also, we have provided, and may continue to provide, financial support to the owners of the teams as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Any one of these things could harm our business. Additionally, a prolonged impact of COVID-19 could heighten many of the risk factors included in this Annual Report filed on Form 10-K.\nIf we do not consistently deliver popular, high-quality content in a timely manner, our business may be negatively impacted.\nConsumer preferences for games are usually cyclical and difficult to predict. Even the most successful games can lose consumer audiences over time, and remaining popular is increasingly dependent on the games being refreshed with new content or other enhancements. In order to remain competitive and maximize the chances that consumers select our products as opposed to the various entertainment options available to them and with which we compete, we must continuously develop new products or new content for, or other enhancements to, our existing products. These products or enhancements may not be well-received by consumers, even if well-reviewed and of high quality.\nAdditionally, consumer expectations regarding the quality, performance, and integrity of our products and services are high. Consumers may be critical of our brands, games, services, and/or business practices for a wide variety of reasons, and such negative reactions may not be foreseeable or within our control to manage effectively. For example, we are subject to legal proceedings regarding workplace concerns, as described in Note 22 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and could become subject to additional, similar legal proceedings in the future. These legal proceedings have negatively impacted our public reputation and, as a result, some consumers have elected not to continue subscribing to one of our games, and existing and potential players may decide not to play our games in the future. Some existing sponsors, partners, and advertisers have also elected not to be associated with our brand due to this impact on our reputation, and others may so elect in the future. As another example, if we fail to create fun, fair, and safe playing environments, consumers may engage less with our games. All of this may negatively impact, and in the case of those legal proceedings is negatively impacting, our business.\nOur products and services are complex software programs. We have quality controls in place to detect defects, \u201cbugs,\u201d or other errors in our products and services before they are released. Nonetheless, these quality controls are subject to human error, overriding, and resource or technical constraints. As such, these quality controls and preventative measures may not be effective, and at times have not been successful, in detecting all defects, bugs, or errors in our products and services before they have been released into the marketplace. Our games with online features are frequently updated, increasing the risk that a game may contain errors. If any of these issues occur, consumers may stop playing the game and may be less likely to return to the game as often in the future, which may negatively impact our business. If our games or services, such as our proprietary online gaming platform, do not function as consumers expect, whether because they fail to function as advertised or otherwise, our sales may suffer. The risk that this may occur is particularly pronounced with respect to our games with online features because they involve ongoing consumer expectations, which we may not be able to consistently satisfy.\nNegative reactions to our products and services may not be foreseeable. We also may not effectively manage or respond to these negative perceptions for reasons within or outside of our control. We expect to continue to expend resources to address concerns with our products and services. Negative perceptions could arise despite our efforts, though, and may result in loss of engagement with our products and services, increased scrutiny from government bodies and consumer groups, and/or litigation, any of which could negatively impact our business.\nFurther, delays in product releases or disruptions following the commercial release of one or more new products have negatively impacted, and could in the future negatively impact, our business and reputation and could cause our results of operations to be materially different from expectations. Our ability to meet development schedules depends on numerous factors, some of which are outside of our control, including our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, the time-intensive nature of creative processes, the coordination of large and often dispersed development teams, the complexity of our products and the platforms for which they are developed, and third-party approvals. If we fail to release our products in a timely manner, or if we are unable to continue to extend the life of existing games by adding features and functionality that will encourage continued engagement with the game, our business may be negatively impacted. For example, we are now planning for a later launch for our Overwatch 2 and Diablo IV titles than originally expected, which will delay the uplift to our results that we usually experience following the release of new titles. Any negative impact which occurs during key selling periods, particularly in the fourth quarter of the year, could be especially pronounced.\nAdditionally, the amount of lead time and cost involved in the development of high-quality products is increasing, and the longer the lead time involved in developing a product and the greater the allocation of financial resources to such product, the more critical it is that we accurately predict consumer demand for such product. If our future products do not achieve expected consumer acceptance or generate sufficient revenues upon introduction, we may not be able to recover the substantial up-front development and marketing costs associated with those products.\nWe are experiencing adverse effects related to concerns raised about our workplace.\nAs described below under \u201cWe are subject to legal proceedings regarding workplace concerns that have negatively affected our reputation\u201d and in Note 22 to the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we are subject to legal proceedings regarding workplace concerns. The outcome of these matters remains uncertain, though such matters could be decided unfavorably to the Company and could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations, income, revenue, profitability, cash flows, liquidity, or stock price.\nWe are taking actions to address the concerns of employees and other key stakeholders and the adverse consequences to our business. We are experiencing, and are likely to continue to experience, adverse publicity regarding our Company and executives related to these matters. These matters are having a negative effect on the Company\u2019s business and reputation. If we experience significantly reduced productivity, significant worker protests or strikes in regards to these matters, significant continued loss of sponsors, advertisers or players, or other negative consequences relating to these matters, our business could be materially adversely impacted. We cannot predict the duration and severity of these impacts, and we are continuing to carefully monitor all aspects of our business for such impacts and to take actions to address such concerns.\nIf we do not attract, retain, and motivate skilled personnel, we will be unable to effectively conduct our business.\nOur success depends significantly on our ability to identify, attract, hire, retain, motivate, and utilize the abilities of qualified personnel which includes both our direct employees and talent from other employers such as consultants, agencies, and external developers. This particularly pertains to personnel with the specialized skills needed to create and deliver high-quality, well-received content upon which our business is substantially dependent, as well as to ensure business continuity in areas such as risk management, information security, human resources, and compliance. Our industry is generally characterized by a high level of employee mobility, competitive compensation programs, and aggressive recruiting among competitors for employees with technical, marketing, sales, engineering, product development, creative, and/or management skills, all of which is magnified for us because of our leading position within the industry. We have observed labor shortages, increasing competition for talent, and increasing attrition. We are experiencing increased difficulty in attracting and retaining skilled personnel. For example, we observed a significantly higher turnover rate of our human resources function in 2021. Additionally, recent litigation involving the Company relating to workplace and employee concerns, as further discussed in this Part I, Item 1A \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and Note 22 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and related media attention can be expected to have an adverse effect on our ability to attract and retain employees and has resulted in work stoppages. If we are unable to attract additional qualified personnel or retain and utilize the services of key personnel, we can expect this would adversely affect our business.\nIf consumers prefer products from our competitors, our business may be negatively impacted.\nOur competitors include very large corporations with significantly greater financial, marketing, and product development resources than we have-increasingly including technology companies entering, or expanding their investment in, interactive entertainment. Our larger competitors may be able to leverage their greater financial, technical, personnel, and other resources to provide larger budgets for development and marketing and make higher offers to licensors and developers for commercially desirable properties, as well as adopt more aggressive pricing policies to develop more commercially successful video game products than we do. The proliferation of companies developing for mobile platforms creates similar risks.\nCompetitors may develop content that imitates or competes with our best-selling games, potentially reducing our sales or our ability to charge the same prices we have historically charged for our products. These competing products may take a larger share of consumer spending than anticipated, which could cause product sales to fall below expectations. If we do not continue to develop consistently high-quality and well-received games or new content for or enhancements to those games, if our marketing fails to resonate with our consumers, or if consumers lose interest in a genre of games we produce, our revenues and profit margins could decline. In addition, our own best-selling products could compete with our other games, reducing sales for those other games. Further, a failure by us to develop a high-quality product, or our development of a product that is otherwise not well-received, could potentially result in additional expenditures to respond to consumer demands, harm our reputation, and increase the likelihood that our future products will not be well-received. The increased importance of add-on content to our business amplifies these risks, as add-on content for poorly-received games typically generates lower-than-expected sales. The increased demand for consistent new content releases for, and enhancements to, our products also requires a greater allocation of financial resources to those products.\nWe depend on a relatively small number of franchises for a significant portion of our revenues and profits.\nWe follow a franchise model, and a significant portion of our revenues has historically been derived from products based on a relatively small number of popular franchises. These products are also responsible for a disproportionately high percentage of our profits. For example, in 2021, revenues associated with the Call of Duty, Candy Crush, and Warcraft franchises, collectively, accounted for approximately 82% of our net revenues-and a significantly higher percentage of our operating income. We expect that a relatively limited number of popular franchises will continue to produce a disproportionately high percentage of our revenues and profits. Due to this dependence on a limited number of franchises, the failure to achieve anticipated results by one or more products based on these franchises could negatively impact our business. Additionally, if the popularity of a franchise declines, as has happened in the past with other popular franchises, we may have to write off the unrecovered portion of the underlying intellectual property assets, which could negatively impact our business.\nWe may be impacted by unionization or attempts to unionize by our workforce.\nOur personnel may attempt, successfully or unsuccessfully, to form one or more unions. For example, at Raven Software, one of our studios, the Communications Workers of America has filed a petition to represent a unit of employees, and the National Labor Relations Board will oversee the election process, including a determination of the appropriate set of employees who would be included in any bargaining unit (and thus participate in the election on potential unionization). Work stoppages or strikes could occur within a unionized workforce. While none of our employees are currently unionized, several of our employees have engaged in a strike for one or more days, leading to a business impact. Further disruptions to our workforce could negatively impact our business and lead to delayed product and content releases as well as a potential impact on product quality.\nOur industry is subject to rapid technological change, and if we do not adapt to, and appropriately allocate our resources among, emerging technologies and business models, our business may be negatively impacted.\nTechnology changes rapidly in the interactive entertainment industry. We must continually anticipate and adapt to emerging technologies, such as cloud-based game streaming, and business models, such as free-to-play and subscription-based access to a portfolio of interactive content, to stay competitive. Forecasting the financial impact of these changing technologies and business models is inherently uncertain and volatile. Supporting a new technology or business model may require partnering with a new platform, business, or technology partner, which may be on terms that are less favorable to us than those for traditional technologies or business models. If we invest in the development of interactive entertainment products for distribution channels that incorporate a new technology or business model that does not achieve significant commercial success, whether because of competition or otherwise, we may not recover the often substantial up-front costs of developing and marketing those products, or recover the opportunity cost of diverting management and financial resources away from other products or opportunities. Further, our competitors may adapt to an emerging technology or business model more quickly or effectively than we do, creating products that are technologically superior to ours, more appealing to consumers, or both.\nIf, on the other hand, we elect not to pursue the development of products incorporating a new technology, or otherwise elect not to pursue new business models that achieve significant commercial success, it may have adverse consequences. It may take significant time and expenditures to shift product development resources to that technology or business model, and it may be more difficult to compete against existing products incorporating that technology or using that business model.\nThe increasing importance of digital sales to our business exposes us to the risks of that business model, including greater competition.\nThe proportion of our revenues derived from digital distribution channels, as compared to traditional retail sales, continues to increase. The increased importance of digital online channels in our industry increases our potential competition, as the minimum capital needed to produce and publish a digitally delivered game, particularly a game for a mobile platform, may be significantly less than that needed to produce and publish one that is purchased through retail distribution and is played on a game console or PC. Further, some of the providers of the platforms through which we digitally distribute content are also publishers of their own content distributed on those platforms, and, therefore, a platform provider may give priority to its own products or those of our competitors.\nWe may be unable to effectively manage the scope and complexity of our business, including our expansion into new business models that are untested and into adjacent business opportunities with large, established competitors.\nWe have experienced significant growth in the scope and complexity of our business, including through acquisitions and the development of our esports, advertising, and consumer products businesses. Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to manage this expanded business and our aspirations for continued expansion and growth. We have dedicated resources both to new business models that are largely untested, as is the case with esports, and to adjacent business opportunities in which very large competitors have an established presence, as is the case with our advertising and consumer products businesses. We do not know to what extent our future expansions will be successful. Further, even if successful, our aspirations for growth in our core businesses and these adjacent businesses could create significant challenges for our management, operational, and financial resources. If not managed effectively, this growth could result in the over-extension of our operating infrastructure, and our management systems, information technology systems, and internal controls and procedures may not be adequate to support this growth. Failure by these new businesses or failure to adequately manage our growth in any of these ways may cause damage to our brand or otherwise negatively impact our core business. Further, the success of these new businesses is largely contingent on the success of our underlying franchises, and as such, delays in product releases or a decline in the popularity of a franchise may impact the success of the new businesses adjacent to that franchise.\nDue to our reliance on third-party platforms, platform providers are frequently able to influence our products and costs.\nGenerally, when we develop interactive entertainment software products for hardware platforms offered by companies such as Sony and Microsoft, the physical products are replicated exclusively by that hardware manufacturer or their approved replicator. The agreements with these manufacturers include certain provisions, such as approval rights over all software products and related promotional materials and the ability to change the fee they charge for the manufacturing of products, which allow the hardware manufacturers substantial influence over the cost and the release schedule of such interactive entertainment software products. During a console transition, like the one that occurred in 2020, as described below, these manufacturers may seek to change the terms governing our relationships with them. In addition, because each of the manufacturers is also a publisher of games for its own hardware platforms and may manufacture products for other licensees, a manufacturer may give priority to its own products or those of our competitors. Accordingly, console manufacturers could cause unanticipated delays in the release of our products, as well as increases to projected development, manufacturing, marketing, or distribution costs, any of which could negatively impact our business.\nSony and Microsoft are also platform providers which control the networks over which consumers purchase digital products and services for their platforms and through which we provide online game capabilities for our products. The control that these platform providers have over consumer access to our games, the fee structures and/or retail pricing for products and services for their platforms and online networks and the terms and conditions under which we do business with them could impact the availability of our products or the volume of purchases of our products made over their networks and our profitability. The networks provided by these platform providers are the exclusive means of selling and distributing our content on these platforms. Further, increased competition for limited premium \u201cdigital shelf space\u201d has placed the platform providers in an increasingly better position to negotiate favorable terms of sale. If the platform provider establishes terms that restrict our offerings on its platform, significantly alters the financial terms on which these products or services are offered, or does not approve the inclusion of content on its platform, our business could be negatively impacted. We also derive significant revenues from distribution on third-party mobile and web platforms, such as the Apple App Store, the Google Play Store, and Facebook, which are also our direct competitors, and in some cases the exclusive means through which our content reaches gamers on those platforms, and most of the virtual currency we sell is purchased using these platform providers\u2019 payment processing systems. These platforms also serve as significant online distribution platforms for, and/or provide other services critical for the operation of, a number of our games. If these platforms deny access to our games, modify their current discovery mechanisms, communication channels available to developers, operating systems, terms of service, or other policies (including fees), our business could be negatively impacted. Additionally, if these platform providers change how they label a game\u2019s business model, such as free-to-play, change how they apply content ratings to a game, or change how the personal information of consumers is made available to developers, our business could be negatively impacted. These platform providers or their services may be unavailable or may not function as intended or may experience issues with their in-app purchasing functionality. As has sometimes happened in the past, if any of these events occurs on a prolonged, or even short-term, basis or other similar issues arise that impact players\u2019 ability to access our games, access social features, or make purchases, it may result in lost revenues and otherwise negatively impact our business.\nOur business is highly dependent on the success and availability of video game consoles manufactured by third parties, as well as our ability to develop commercially successful products for these consoles.\nWe derive a substantial portion of our revenues from the sale of products for play on video game consoles manufactured by third parties, such as Sony\u2019s PS4 and PS5, Microsoft\u2019s Xbox One and Series X, and Nintendo\u2019s Switch. Sales of products for consoles accounted for 30% of our consolidated net revenues in 2021. The success of our console business is driven in large part by our ability to accurately predict which consoles will be successful in the marketplace and our ability to develop commercially successful products for these consoles. We also rely on the availability of an adequate supply of these video game consoles (which has been negatively impacted by supply chain issues) and the continued support for these consoles by their manufacturers, including our ability to reach consumers via the online networks operated by these console manufacturers. If increased costs are not offset by higher revenues and other cost efficiencies, our business could be negatively impacted. If the consoles for which we develop new software products or modify existing products do not attain significant consumer acceptance, we may not be able to recover our development costs, which could be significant.\nSony and Microsoft each launched next-generation consoles in 2020. We have released titles that operate on these consoles, and we may continue to develop games for these new console systems. When next-generation consoles are announced or introduced into the market, consumers have typically reduced their purchases of game console entertainment software products for prior-generation consoles in anticipation of purchasing a next-generation console and products for that console. During these periods, sales of the game console entertainment software products we publish may decline until new platforms achieve wide consumer adoption. Console transitions may have a comparable impact on sales of add-on content, amplifying the impact on our revenues. This decline may not be offset by increased sales of products for the next-generation consoles. In addition, as console hardware moves through its life cycle, hardware manufacturers typically enact price reductions, and decreasing prices may put downward pressure on software prices. During console transitions, we may simultaneously incur costs both in continuing to develop, market, and operate titles for prior-generation video game platforms, while also developing and supporting next-generation platforms. As a result, our business and operating results may be more volatile and difficult to predict during console transitions than during other times.\nThe increasing importance of free-to-play games to our business exposes us to the risks of that business model, including the dependence on a relatively small number of consumers for a significant portion of revenues and profits from any given game.\nWe are increasingly dependent on our ability to develop, enhance, and monetize free-to-play games, such as the games in our Candy Crush franchise, Hearthstone, Call of Duty: Warzone\u2122, and Call of Duty: Mobile. As such, we are increasingly exposed to the risks of the free-to-play business model. For example, we may invest in the development of new free-to-play interactive entertainment products that are not successful in building and maintaining a significant player base, in which case our revenues from those products likely will be lower than anticipated and we may not recover our development costs. Further, our business may be negatively impacted if: (1) we are unable to encourage new and existing consumers to purchase our virtual items; (2) we fail to offer monetization features that appeal to these consumers; (3) our platform providers make it more difficult or expensive for players to purchase our virtual items; and/or (4) our free-to-play releases reduce sales of our other games.\nWe are a global company and are subject to the risks and uncertainties of conducting business outside the U.S.\nWe conduct business throughout the world, and we derive a substantial amount of our revenues and profits from international trade, particularly from Europe and Asia. We expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenues and profits and, moreover, that sales in emerging markets in Asia and elsewhere will continue to be an important part of our international sales. As such, we are, and may be increasingly, subject to risks inherent in foreign trade generally, as well as risks inherent in doing business in non-U.S. markets, including increased tariffs and duties, compliance with economic sanctions, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, shipping delays, increases in transportation costs, international political, regulatory and economic developments, unexpected changes to laws, regulatory requirements, and enforcement on us and our platform partners and differing local business practices, all of which may impact profit margins or make it more difficult, if not impossible, for us to conduct business in foreign markets.\nA deterioration in relations between either us or the U.S. and any country in which we have significant operations or sales, or the implementation of government regulations in the U.S. or such a country, could result in the adoption or expansion of trade restrictions, including economic sanctions or absolute prohibitions, that could have a negative impact on our business. For instance, to operate in China, all games must have regulatory approval. A decision by the Chinese government to revoke its approval for any of our games or to decline to approve any products we desire to sell in China in the future could have a negative impact on our business, as could delays in the approval process. Additionally, in the past, legislation has been implemented in China that has required modifications to our products and our business model to satisfy regulatory requirements, such as Chinese regulations that limit the number of hours per week children under the age of 18 can play video games. The future implementation of similar or new laws or regulations in China or any other country in which we have operations or sales may restrict or prohibit the sale of our products or may require engineering modifications to our products and our business model that are not cost-effective, if even feasible at all, or could degrade the consumer experience to the point where consumers cease to purchase such products. Changes in Chinese game approval procedures in 2018 have resulted in reduced rates of approval for games and unclear approval timeframes, making it uncertain as to if and when our new products will be approved for release in China. Further, the continued enforcement of regulations relating to mobile and other games with an online element in China could have a negative impact on our business in China.\nThe laws of some countries either do not protect our products, brands, and intellectual property to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. or are inconsistently enforced. Legal protection of our rights may be ineffective in countries with weaker intellectual property enforcement mechanisms. In addition, certain third parties have registered our intellectual property rights without authorization in foreign countries. Successfully registering such intellectual property rights could limit or restrict our ability to offer products and services based on such rights in those countries. Although we take steps to enforce and police our rights, our practices and methodologies may not be effective against all eventualities.\nIn addition, cultural differences may affect consumer preferences and limit the international popularity of games that are popular in the U.S. or require us to modify the content of the games or the method by which we charge our customers for the games to be successful. If we do not correctly assess consumer preferences in the countries in which we sell our products, it could negatively impact our business.\nWe are also subject to risks that our operations outside the U.S. could be conducted by our employees, contractors, third-party partners, representatives, or agents in ways that violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Anti-Bribery Act, or other similar anti-bribery laws, as well as the 2017 U.K. Criminal Finances Act or other similar financial crime laws. While we have policies, procedures, and training for our employees, intended to secure compliance with these laws, our employees, contractors, third-party partners, representatives, or agents may take actions that violate our policies. Moreover, it may be more difficult to oversee the conduct of any such persons who are not our employees, potentially exposing us to greater risk from their actions.\nThe importance of retail sales to our business exposes us to the risks of that business model.\nWhile the proportion of our revenues derived from traditional retail sales, as compared to revenue from digital distribution channels, continues to decline, retail sales remain important to our business. Such sales are made primarily on a purchase order basis without long-term agreements or other forms of commitments, and due to the increased proportion of our revenue from digital distribution channels, our retail customers and distributors have generally been reducing the levels of inventory they are willing to carry. The loss of, or significant reduction in sales to, any of Activision\u2019s principal retail customers or distributors, including digital distributors, could have adverse consequences.\nWe may not realize the expected benefits of our recent restructuring actions.\nDuring 2019, we began implementing a plan aimed at refocusing our resources on our largest opportunities and removing unnecessary levels of complexity and duplication from certain parts of our business. While we believe this plan enables us to provide better opportunities for talent, and greater expertise and scale over the long term, our ability to achieve the desired and anticipated benefits from the plan is subject to many estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions are also subject to significant economic, competitive, and other uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control.\nAdditionally, there can be no assurance that our business will be more efficient or effective than prior to implementation of the plan, and we do not expect to realize significant net savings as a result of the plan as cost reductions in our selling, general and administrative activities are expected to be offset by increased investment in product development. Any of these consequences could negatively impact our business. In addition, there can be no assurance that additional plans will not be required or implemented in the future.\nWe engage in strategic transactions and may encounter difficulties in integrating acquired businesses or otherwise realizing the anticipated benefits of these transactions.\nAs part of our business strategy, from time to time, we acquire, make investments in, or enter into strategic alliances and joint ventures with, complementary businesses. These transactions may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including: (1) in the case of an acquisition, (i) the potential for the acquired business to underperform relative to our expectations and the acquisition price, (ii) the potential for the acquired business to cause our financial results to differ from expectations in any given period, or over the longer-term, (iii) unexpected tax consequences from the acquisition, or the tax treatment of the acquired business\u2019s operations going forward, giving rise to incremental tax liabilities that are difficult to predict, (iv) difficulty in integrating the acquired business, its operations, and its employees in an efficient and effective manner, (v) any unknown liabilities or internal control deficiencies assumed as part of the acquisition, and (vi) the potential loss of key employees of the acquired businesses; and (2) in the case of an investment, alliance, or joint venture, (i) our ability to cooperate with our partner, (ii) our partner having economic, business, or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours, and (iii) the potential that our partner may be unable to meet its economic or other obligations, which may require us to fulfill those obligations alone.\nFurther, any such transaction may involve the risk that our senior management\u2019s attention will be excessively diverted from our other operations, the risk that our industry does not evolve as anticipated, and that any intellectual property or personnel skills acquired do not prove to be those needed for our future success, and the risk that our strategic objectives, cost savings or other anticipated benefits are otherwise not achieved.\nWe are exposed to seasonality in the sale of our products.\nThe interactive entertainment industry is somewhat seasonal, with the highest levels of consumer demand occurring during the calendar year-end holiday buying season. As a result, our sales, particularly for our Activision segment, receivables, and credit risk, are higher during the fourth quarter of the year, as consumers and retailers increase their purchases in anticipation of the holiday season. Delays in development, approvals or manufacturing could affect the release of products, causing us to miss key selling periods such as the year-end holiday buying season, which could negatively impact our business.\nOur recurring business is subject to fluctuation, and we could see a decline in that portion of our business.\nOur business model includes recurring revenue we deem recurring in nature, such as revenue from subscriptions for World of Warcraft. There is no guarantee that demand for this service will remain at current levels. Consumer demand has declined and fluctuated in the past, and could do so in the future. If consumers lose interest in our services; if we fail to adapt our services to changing markets, distribution channels, and business models; if we discontinue our services; if we, or third parties we rely on, experience network disruptions or outages; if our competitors offer more attractive services; if our advertising and marketing of our service fails; or if there is a general downturn in the market, revenues generated by this service may decline, which could negatively impact our business.\nOur business may be harmed if our distributors, retailers, development, and licensing partners, or other third parties with whom we are affiliated are unable to honor their commitments or act in ways that put our brand at risk.\nIn many cases, our business partners and other third-party affiliates, which may include, among others, individuals or entities affiliated with the esports leagues we operate, are given access to sensitive and proprietary information or control over our intellectual property to provide services and support to our team. These third parties may misappropriate or misuse our information or intellectual property and engage in unauthorized use of it. Further, the failure of these third parties to provide adequate services and technologies or to adequately maintain or update their services and technologies could result in a disruption to our business operations or an adverse effect on our reputation and may negatively impact our business. At the same time, if the media, consumers, or employees raise any concerns about our actions vis-\u00e0-vis third parties including consumers who play our games, this could also damage our reputation or our business. Further, should we terminate our relationship with a third-party affiliate for any reason, we may experience interruptions in our business and incur costs as we transition to a new partner.\nIn developing our games, we rely on tools and technologies owned by third parties.\nIn developing our games, we often use tools and technologies owned by third parties. If entities that own tools and technologies we use are acquired by our competitors we may lose access to such resources. Further, third party tools and technologies we use might be \u201csunsetted\u201d or modified in such a way that would require us to engineer a workaround. Such events could cause delays in our production schedule and we may incur time and cost as we acquire or develop alternative assets.\nWe use open source software in connection with certain of our games and services, which may pose particular risks to our proprietary software, products, and services in a manner that could have a negative impact on our business.\nWe use open-source software in connection with some of the games and services we offer. Some open source software licenses require users who distribute open source software as part of their software to publicly disclose all or part of the source code to such software or make available any derivative works of the open source code on unfavorable terms or at no cost. The terms of various open source licenses have not been interpreted by courts, and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our use of the open source software. Were it determined that our use was not in compliance with a particular license, we may be required to release our proprietary source code, pay damages for breach of contract, re-engineer our games or products, discontinue distribution in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis, or take other remedial action that may divert resources away from our game development efforts, any of which could negatively impact our business. Additionally, the shared nature of open source software may increase the ability of cyber-attackers to discover and exploit vulnerabilities, which may increase the likelihood of a data breach, ransomware, network interruption, or other type of cyber-attack against us or against third parties who may use open source software, such as our platform partners or key vendors, any of which could negatively impact our business.\nOur games may include undisclosed content or features. If our retailers refuse to sell such titles, or consumers refuse to purchase such titles, due to what they perceive to be objectionable undisclosed content, it could have a negative impact on our business.\nThroughout the history of the interactive entertainment industry, many interactive software products have included hidden content and/or hidden gameplay features, some of which have been accessible through the use of in-game codes or other technological means, that are intended to enhance the gameplay experience. In some cases, such undisclosed content or features have been considered to be objectionable. While publishers are required to disclose pertinent hidden content during the Entertainment Software Rating Board (the \u201cESRB\u201d) ratings process, in a few cases, publishers have failed to disclose pertinent content, and the ESRB has required the recall of the game, changed the rating or associated content descriptors originally assigned to the product, required the publisher to change the game or game packaging and/or imposed fines on the publisher. Retailers have on occasion reacted to the discovery of such undisclosed content by removing these games from their stores, refusing to sell them, and demanding that their publishers accept them as product returns. Likewise, some consumers have reacted to the revelation of undisclosed content by refusing to purchase such games, demanding refunds for games they have already purchased, refraining from buying other games published by the Company whose game contained the objectionable material, and, on at least one occasion, filing a lawsuit against the publisher of the product containing such content.\nWe have implemented preventive measures designed to reduce the possibility of objectionable undisclosed content from appearing in the interactive software products we publish. Nonetheless, these preventive measures are subject to human error, circumvention, overriding, and reasonable resource constraints. If an interactive software product we publish is found to contain undisclosed content, we could be subject to any of these consequences.\nOur results of operations or reputation may be harmed as a result of objectionable consumer- or other third-party-created content.\nCertain of our games and esports broadcasts support collaborative online features that allow consumers to communicate with one another and post narrative comments, in real time, that are visible to other consumers. Additionally, certain of our games allow consumers to create and share \u201cuser-generated content\u201d that is visible to other consumers. From time to time, objectionable and offensive consumer content may be distributed within our games and on our broadcasts through these features or to gaming websites or other sites or forums with online chat features or that otherwise allow consumers to post comments. Although we expend resources, and expect to continue to expend resources, to promote positive play, our efforts may not be successful due to scale, limitations of existing technologies, or other factors. We may be subject to lawsuits, governmental regulation or restrictions, and consumer backlash (including decreased sales and harmed reputation), as a result of consumers posting offensive content.\nAdditionally, we have begun to generate revenue through offering advertising within certain of our franchises and in connection with our esports broadcasts. The content of in-game and esports broadcast advertisements may be created and delivered by third-party advertisers without our pre-approval, and, as such, objectionable content may be published in our games or during our esports broadcasts by these advertisers. This objectionable third-party-created content may expose us to regulatory action or claims related to content, or otherwise negatively impact our business. We may also be subject to consumer backlash from comments made in response to postings we make on social media sites such as Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter.\nWe may experience outages, disruptions, or degradations in our services, products, and/or technological infrastructure.\nThe reliable performance of our products and services depends on the continuing operation and availability of our information technology systems and those of our external service providers, including third-party \u201ccloud\u201d computing services. Our games and services are complex software products, and maintaining the sophisticated internal and external technological infrastructure required to reliably deliver these games and services is expensive and complex. The reliable delivery and stability of our products and services has been, and could in the future be, adversely impacted by outages, disruptions, failures, or degradations in our network and related infrastructure, as well as in the online platforms or services of key business partners that offer, support or host our products and services. The reliability and stability of our products and services has been affected by events outside of our control as well as by events within our control, such as the migration of data among data centers and to third-party hosted environments, the performance of upgrades and maintenance on our systems, and online demand for our products and services that exceeds the capabilities of our technological infrastructure.\nIf we or our external business partners were to experience an event that caused a significant system outage, disruption, or degradation or if a transition among data centers or service providers or an upgrade or maintenance session encountered unexpected interruptions, unforeseen complexity, or unplanned disruptions, our products and services may not be available to consumers or may not be delivered reliably and stably. As a result, our reputation and brand may be harmed, consumer engagement with our products and services may be reduced, and our revenue and profitability could be negatively impacted. We do not have redundancy for all our systems and many of our critical applications reside in only one of our data centers, which may make such an event more damaging to us.\nAs our digital business grows, we will require an increasing amount of internal and external technical infrastructure, including network capacity and computing power to continue to satisfy the needs of our players. We are investing, and expect to continue to invest, in our own technology, hardware, and software and the technology, hardware, and software of external service providers to support our business. It is possible that we may fail to scale effectively and grow this technical infrastructure to accommodate increased demands, which may adversely affect the reliable and stable performance of our games and services, therefore negatively impact our business.\nAny cybersecurity-related attack, significant data breach, fraudulent activity, or disruption of the information technology systems or networks on which we rely could negatively impact our business.\nIn the course of our day-to-day business, we and third parties operating on our behalf create, store, and/or use commercially sensitive information, such as the source code and game assets for our interactive entertainment software products and sensitive and confidential information with respect to our customers, consumers, and employees. A malicious cybersecurity-related attack, intrusion, or disruption by hackers (including through spyware, ransomware, viruses, phishing, denial of service, and similar attacks) or other breach of the systems (including harm or improper access due to error by employees or third parties who have authorized access) on which such source code and assets, account information (including personal information), and other sensitive data is stored could lead to piracy of our software, fraudulent activity, disclosure, or misappropriation of, or access to, our customers\u2019, consumers\u2019, or employees\u2019 personal information, or our own business data. Such incidents could also lead to product code-base and game distribution platform exploitation, should undetected viruses, spyware, or other malware be inserted into our products, services, or networks, or systems used by our consumers. We have implemented cybersecurity programs and the tools, technologies, processes, and procedures intended to secure our data and systems, and prevent and detect unauthorized access to, or loss of, our data, or the data of our customers, consumers, or employees. However, because these cyberattacks may remain undetected for prolonged periods of time and the techniques used by criminal hackers and other third parties to breach systems change frequently, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. A data intrusion into a server for a game with online features or for our proprietary online gaming platform could also disrupt the operation of such game or platform. If we are subject to cybersecurity breaches, or a security-related incident that materially disrupts the availability of our products and services, we may have a loss in sales or subscriptions or be forced to pay damages or incur other costs, including from the implementation of additional cyber and physical security measures, or suffer reputational damage. Additionally, although we maintain insurance policies, they may be insufficient to reimburse us for all losses or all types of claims that may be caused by cyberbreaches or system or network disruptions, and it is uncertain whether we will be able to maintain our current level of coverage in the future. Moreover, if there were a public perception that our data protection measures are inadequate, whether or not the case, it could result in reputational damage and potential harm to our business relationships or the public perception of our business model. In addition, such cybersecurity breaches may subject us to legal claims or proceedings, like individual claims and regulatory investigations and actions, including fines, especially if there is loss, disclosure, or misappropriation of, or access to, our customers\u2019 personal information or other sensitive information, or there is otherwise an intrusion into our customers\u2019 privacy.\nAdditionally, many of our games include virtual economies, comprising virtual currencies and assets, which are subject to fraud, exploitation, and abuse. In-game exploits and the use of automated or other fraudulent practices to generate virtual currency or assets illegitimately can detract from players\u2019 enjoyment of our games and can cause loss of revenue and harm to our reputation. Further, the measures we take to remedy abuse and protect against future fraudulent actions can be costly and time-consuming and may negatively impact our operations and financial outlook.\nSignificant disruption during our live events may adversely affect our business.\nWe, as well as the teams in the esports leagues we operate, host live events each year, many of which are attended by a large number of people. There are many risks that are inherent in large gatherings of people, including actual or threatened terrorist attacks or other acts of violence, fire, explosion, protests, and riots, and other safety or security issues, any one of which could result in injury or death to attendees and/or damage to the facilities at which such an event is hosted. While we maintain insurance policies, they may be insufficient to reimburse us for all losses or all types of claims that may be caused by such an event. Moreover, if there were a public perception that the safety or security measures are inadequate at the events we host or events hosted by teams in the esports leagues we operate, whether or not the case, it could result in reputational damage and a decline in future attendance at events hosted by us or those teams. Any one of these things could harm our business.\nCatastrophic events may disrupt our business.\nOur corporate headquarters and our primary corporate data center are located in the Los Angeles, California area, which is near a major earthquake fault. A major earthquake or other catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or information technology systems, impacts the health and safety of our employees or the employees of third-party affiliates and the regulatory agencies we rely on, or otherwise prevents us from conducting our normal business operations, could require significant expenditures to resume operations and negatively impact our business. While we maintain insurance coverage for some of these events, the potential liabilities associated with such events could exceed the insurance coverage we maintain. Further, our system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate to protect us against such events. Any such event could also limit the ability of retailers, distributors, or our other customers to sell or distribute our products.\nClimate change may have an impact on our business.\nRisks related to climate change are increasing in both impact and type. We do not expect significant near-term impacts to our operations as a result of climate change, but long-term impacts remain unknown. There may be business or operational risk due to the significant impacts that climate change could pose to our employees\u2019 lives, consumers\u2019 lives, our supply chain, or other operational disruptions from climate change-related weather events. In addition, rapidly changing customer and regulatory requirements, along with stakeholder expectations, to reduce carbon emissions and otherwise to reduce our environmental footprint could increase our costs of operations to comply or present a risk of loss of business if we are not able to meet those requirements.\nProvisions in our corporate documents and Delaware state law could delay or prevent a change of control.\nOur Fifth Amended and Restated Bylaws contain a provision regulating the ability of shareholders to bring matters for action before annual and special meetings. The regulations on shareholder action could make it more difficult for any person seeking to acquire control of the Company to obtain shareholder approval of actions that would support this effort. In addition, our Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of so-called \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock. This ability of our Board of Directors to issue and fix the rights and preferences of preferred stock could effectively dilute the interests of any person seeking control or otherwise make it more difficult to obtain control.\nRegulatory and Legal Risks\nWe are subject to legal proceedings regarding workplace concerns that have negatively affected our reputation.\nAs described in Note 22 to the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, in July 2021, the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (the \u201cDFEH\u201d) filed a complaint against Activision Blizzard, Blizzard Entertainment, and Activision Publishing alleging violations of the California Fair Employment and Housing Act and the California Equal Pay Act. The Company is separately awaiting court approval of a consent decree with the EEOC settling claims against the Company regarding certain employment practices, while the DFEH has objected to the consent decree. The Company has also been named as a defendant in a shareholder class action and a nominal defendant in shareholder derivative actions involving allegations similar to those alleged in the foregoing matters and is cooperating in an investigation with the SEC with respect to its disclosures on employment matters and related issues. The outcome of these matters remains uncertain, and we could become subject to additional, similar legal proceedings in the future. If such matters are decided unfavorably to the Company, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations, income, revenue, profitability, cash flows, liquidity, or stock price.\nThese legal proceedings have negatively impacted our public reputation and, as a result, some consumers have elected not to continue subscribing to one or more of our games, and existing and potential players may decide not to play our games in the future. Some existing sponsors, partners, and advertisers have also elected not to be associated with our brand due to this impact on our reputation, and others may so elect in the future. The outcome of these matters remains uncertain, though such matters could be decided unfavorably to the Company and could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations, income, revenue, profitability, cash flows, liquidity, or stock price.\nWe are involved in legal proceedings that can have a negative impact on our business.\nFrom time to time, we are involved in claims, suits, investigations, audits, and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business, including with respect to intellectual property, competition and antitrust, regulatory, tax, privacy, labor and employment, compliance, unclaimed property, liability and personal injury, product damage, collection, and/or commercial matters. In addition, negative consumer sentiment about our business practices may result in inquiries or investigations from regulatory agencies and consumer groups, as well as litigation.\nClaims, suits, investigations, audits, and proceedings are inherently difficult to predict, including those referenced above, and their results are subject to significant uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control. Regardless of the outcome, such legal proceedings can have a negative impact on us due to reputational harm, legal costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors. It is also possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings could result in substantial settlements, judgments, fines or penalties, injunctions, criminal sanctions, consent decrees, or orders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services, requiring us to change our development process or other business practices.\nThere is also inherent uncertainty in determining reserves for these matters. Significant judgment is required in the analysis of these matters, including assessing the probability of potential outcomes and determining whether a potential exposure can be reasonably estimated. In making these determinations, we, in consultation with outside counsel, examine the relevant facts and circumstances on a quarterly basis assuming, as applicable, a combination of settlement and litigated outcomes and strategies. Further, it may take time to develop factors on which reasonable judgments and estimates can be based.\nWe regard our software as proprietary and rely on a variety of methods, including a combination of copyright, patent, trademark, and trade secret laws, and employee and third-party non-disclosure agreements, to protect our proprietary rights. We own or license various copyrights, patents, trademarks, and trade secrets. The process of registering and protecting these rights in various jurisdictions is expensive and time-consuming. Further, we are aware that some unauthorized copying and piracy occurs, and if a significantly greater amount of unauthorized copying or piracy of our software products were to occur, it could negatively impact our business. We also cannot be certain that existing intellectual property laws will provide adequate protection for our products in connection with emerging technologies or that we will be able to effectively protect our intellectual property through litigation and other means.\nOur business, products, and distribution are subject to increasing regulation in key territories. If we do not successfully respond to these regulations, our business could be negatively impacted.\nThe video game industry continues to evolve, and new and innovative business opportunities are often subject to new attempts at regulation. As such, legislation is continually being introduced, and litigation and regulatory enforcement actions are taking place, that may affect the way in which we, and other industry participants, may offer content and features, and distribute and advertise our products. These laws, regulations, and investigations are related to protection of minors, gambling, screen time, business models, consumer privacy, cybersecurity, data protection, accessibility, advertising, taxation, payments, intellectual property, distribution, and antitrust, among others.\nFor example, many foreign countries have laws that permit governmental entities to restrict or prohibit marketing or distribution of interactive entertainment software products because of the content therein (and similar legislation has been introduced at one time or another at the federal and state levels in the U.S., including legislation that attempts to impose additional taxes based on content). In addition, certain jurisdictions have laws that restrict or prohibit marketing or distribution of interactive entertainment software products with random digital item mechanics, which some of our online games and services include, or subject such products to additional regulation and oversight, such as reporting to regulators, mandatory disclosure to consumers of item drop rates, and higher age ratings for products that contain such mechanics.\nWe are also subject to laws in a number of jurisdictions concerning the operation and offering of tournaments and games, many of which are still evolving and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. Certain jurisdictions also have laws that restrict or prohibit certain types of esports tournament structures. These laws may have an impact on our ability to offer certain esports competitions and/or to offer consumers of our online and casual games various types of contests and promotional opportunities.\nFurther, the growth and development of electronic commerce, virtual items, and currency may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws that may impose additional burdens or limitations on operations of companies such as ours conducting business through the Internet and mobile devices, including related to screen time. Also, existing laws or new laws regarding the marketing of in-app purchases, regulation of currency, banking institutions, unclaimed property, and money laundering may be interpreted to cover virtual currency or goods. Additionally, laws may limit or prevent the auto-renewal of contracts and subscriptions. Further, the European Commission has recently imposed a large antitrust fine on a number of other game publishers who had been geoblocking certain EU countries. In addition, in 2019 the World Health Organization included \u201cgaming disorder\u201d in the 11th Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11), leading some countries to consider legislation and policies aimed at addressing this issue. Moreover, the public dialogue concerning interactive entertainment may have an adverse impact on our reputation and consumers\u2019 willingness to purchase our products.\nThe adoption and enforcement of legislation that restricts the marketing, content, business model, or sales of our products in countries in which we do business may harm the sales of our products, as the products we are able to offer to our customers and the size of the potential audience for our products may be limited. We may be required to modify certain product development processes or products or alter our marketing strategies to comply with regulations, which could be costly or delay the release of our products. In addition, the laws and regulations affecting our products vary by territory and may be inconsistent with one another, imposing conflicting or uncertain restrictions. Failure to comply with any applicable legislation may also result in government-imposed fines or other penalties, as well as harm to our reputation.\nChange in government regulations relating to the Internet could negatively impact our business.\nWe rely on our consumers\u2019 access to significant levels of Internet bandwidth for the sale and digital delivery of our content and the functionality of our games with online features. Changes in laws or regulations that adversely affect the growth, popularity, or use of the Internet, including laws impacting \u201cnet neutrality\u201d or the availability of bandwidth could impair our consumers\u2019 online video game experiences, decrease the demand for our products and services or increase our cost of doing business. Although certain jurisdictions have implemented laws and regulations intended to prevent Internet service providers from discriminating against particular types of legal traffic on their networks, other jurisdictions may lack such laws and regulations or repeal existing laws or regulations. Given uncertainty around these rules relating to the Internet, including changing interpretations, amendments, or repeal of those rules, coupled with the potentially significant political and economic power of local Internet service providers and the relatively significant level of Internet bandwidth access our products and services require, we could experience discriminatory or anti-competitive practices that could impede our growth, cause us to incur additional expenses, or otherwise negatively impact our business.\nThe laws and regulations concerning data privacy are continually evolving. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could harm our business.\nConsumers play certain of our games online using our own distribution platforms, including Blizzard Battle.net, third-party platforms and networks, through online social platforms, and on mobile devices. We collect and store information about our consumers, including consumers who play these games. In addition, we collect and store information about our employees. We are subject to laws from a variety of jurisdictions regarding privacy and the protection of this information, including the E.U.\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (the \u201cGDPR\u201d), the U.S. Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act, which regulates the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information from children under 13 years of age, the California Consumer Privacy Act, and China\u2019s Personal Information Protection Law, among others. Failure to comply with any of these laws or regulations may increase our costs, subject us to expensive and distracting government investigations, result in substantial fines, and other punitive measures, including restricting or prohibiting the sale of our products, or result in lawsuits and claims against us to the extent these laws include a private right of action.\nData privacy protection laws are rapidly changing and likely will continue to do so for the foreseeable future and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. For example, the E.U. and China have taken a broader view than the U.S. and certain other jurisdictions as to what is considered personal information and has imposed greater obligations under data privacy and protection regulations, including those imposed under the GDPR. The U.S. government, including the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Commerce, various U.S. state governments, and other various national and local governments are continuing to review the need for greater regulation over the collection, sharing, use, or sale of personal information and information about consumer behavior on the Internet and on mobile devices. Complying with emerging and changing laws could require us to incur substantial costs or impact our approach to operating and marketing our games. Due to the rapidly changing nature of these data privacy protection laws, there is not always clear guidance from the respective governments and regulators regarding the interpretation of the law, which may create the risk of an inadvertent violation. Various government and consumer agencies worldwide have also called for new regulation and changes in industry practices. In addition, in some cases, we are dependent upon our platform providers and external data processors to assist us in ensuring compliance with these various types of regulations, and a violation by one of these third parties may also subject us to government investigations and result in substantial fines.\nPlayer interaction with our games is subject to our privacy policies, end user license agreements (\u201cEULAs\u201d), and terms of service. If we fail to comply with our posted privacy policies, EULAs, or terms of service, or if we fail to comply with existing privacy-related or data protection laws and regulations, it could result in proceedings or litigation against us by governmental authorities or others, which could result in fines or judgments against us, damage our reputation, impact our financial condition, and harm our business. If regulators, the media, consumers, or employees raise any concerns about our privacy and data protection or consumer protection practices, even if unfounded, this could also result in fines or judgments against us, damage our reputation, negatively impact our financial condition, or damage our business.\nOur games are subject to scrutiny regarding the appropriateness of their content. If we fail to receive our target ratings for certain titles, or if our retailers refuse to sell such titles due to what they perceive to be objectionable content, it could have a negative impact on our business.\nOur console and PC games are subject to ratings by the ESRB, a self-regulatory body based in the U.S. that provides U.S. and Canadian consumers of interactive entertainment software with ratings information, including information on the content in such software, such as violence, nudity, or sexual content, along with an assessment of the suitability of the content for certain age groups. Certain other countries have also established content rating systems as prerequisites for product sales in those countries. In addition, certain third parties use other ratings systems. For example, Apple uses a proprietary \u201cApp Rating System\u201d and certain online stores, including Google Play, use the International Age Rating Coalition (\u201cIARC\u201d) rating system, whereby ratings are assigned in participating regions through a single application. If we are unable to obtain the ratings we have targeted for our products, it could have a negative impact on our business. In some instances, we may be required to modify our products to meet the requirements of the rating systems, which could delay or disrupt the release of any given product or may prevent its sale altogether in certain territories. Further, if one of our games is \u201cre-rated\u201d for any reason, a ratings organization could require corrective actions, which could include a recall, retailers could refuse to sell it and demand that we accept the return of any unsold or returned copies or consumers could demand a refund for copies previously purchased.\nAdditionally, retailers may decline to sell, and/or consumers may decline to buy, interactive entertainment software containing what they judge to be graphic violence or sexually explicit material or other content that they deem inappropriate for their businesses, whether because a product received a certain rating by the ESRB or other content rating system, or otherwise. If retailers decline to sell our products or consumers decline to buy them based upon their opinion that they contain objectionable themes, graphic violence or sexually explicit material, or other generally objectionable content, we might be required to modify particular titles or forfeit the revenue opportunity of selling such titles.\nFinancial and Economic Risks\nChanges in tax rates and/or tax laws or exposure to additional tax liabilities could negatively impact our business.\nOur income tax liability and effective tax rate could be adversely affected by a variety of factors, including changes in our business, the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in tax laws or tax rulings, changes in interpretations of existing laws, or developments in tax examinations or investigations. Any of these factors could have a negative impact on our business or require us to change the manner in which we operate our business. The tax regimes we are subject to, or operate under, are unsettled and may be subject to significant change. Furthermore, tax authorities may choose to examine or investigate our tax reporting or tax liability, including under transfer pricing or permanent establishment theories. These proceedings may lead to adjustments or proposed adjustments to our income taxes or provisions for uncertain tax positions. Additionally, a number of countries, including the U.S., have been pursuing fundamental changes to the tax laws applicable to multinational companies like us, including changing the U.S. taxation of non-U.S. income, developing new global OECD guidelines, and enacting revenue-based taxes on digital services. If these developments lead to enacted policy changes, it may have an adverse impact on our income tax expense and could negatively impact our business.\nFluctuations in currency exchange rates could negatively impact our business.\nWe transact business in various currencies other than the U.S. dollar and have significant international sales and expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, subjecting us to currency exchange rate risks. A substantial portion of our international sales and expenses are denominated in local currencies, which could fluctuate against the U.S. dollar. Since we have significant international sales but incur the majority of our costs in the U.S., the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, particularly the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, may have an asymmetric and disproportional impact on our business. We have, in the past, utilized currency derivative contracts to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures and managed these exposures with natural offsets. However, there can be no assurance that we will continue our hedging programs, or that we will be successful in managing exposure to currency exchange rate risks whether or not we do so.\nOur reported financial results could be significantly impacted by changes in financial accounting standards or by the application of existing or future accounting standards to our business as it evolves.\nOur reported financial results are impacted by the accounting policies promulgated by the SEC and national accounting standards bodies and the methods, estimates, and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies. Policies affecting revenue recognition have affected, and could further significantly affect, the way we report revenues related to our products and services. We recognize a majority of the revenues from video games that include an online service on a deferred basis over an estimated service period for such games. In addition, we defer the cost of revenues of those products. Further, as we increase our add-on content and add new features to our online services, our estimate of the service period may change, and we could be required to recognize revenues, and defer related costs, over a shorter or longer period of time. As we enhance, expand, and diversify our business and product offerings, the application of existing or future financial accounting standards, particularly those relating to the way we account for revenues and income taxes, could have a significant impact on our reported net revenues, net income, and earnings per share under generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. in any given period.\nThe insolvency or business failure of any of our business partners could negatively impact us.\nOur sales, whether digital or retail, are concentrated in a small number of large customers, which makes us more vulnerable to collection risk if one or more of these large customers becomes unable to pay for our products or seeks protection under the bankruptcy laws. Retailers and distributors in the interactive entertainment industry have from time to time experienced significant fluctuations in their businesses and a number of them have failed. Challenging economic conditions may impair the ability of our customers to pay for products they have purchased and, as a result, our reserves for doubtful accounts and write-off of accounts receivable could increase and, even if increased, may turn out to be insufficient. While we have insurance to protect against a customer\u2019s bankruptcy, insolvency, or liquidation, this insurance typically contains a significant deductible and co-payment obligation and does not cover all instances of non-payment. Further, a payment default or the insolvency or business failure of, other types of business partners could result in disruptions to the manufacturing or distribution of our products or the cancellation of contractual arrangements that we consider to be favorable and could negatively impact our business. In addition, having such a large portion of our total net revenues concentrated in a few customers reduces our negotiating leverage with these customers.\nBecause purchases of our products and services are discretionary spending, if general economic conditions decline, demand for our products and services could decline.\nPurchases of our products and services involve discretionary spending on the part of consumers. Consumers are generally more willing to make discretionary purchases, including purchases of products and services like ours, during periods in which favorable economic conditions prevail. As a result, our products are sensitive to general economic conditions and economic cycles. A reduction or shift in domestic or international consumer spending could result in an increase in our selling and promotional expenses, in an effort to offset that reduction, and could negatively impact our business.", "PERMNO": 79678, "SIC": 7372, "TIC": "ATVI"}
