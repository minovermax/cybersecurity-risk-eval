{"cik": "49826", "company": "ILLINOIS TOOL WORKS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-11", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nThe Company's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows are subject to various risks, including, but not limited to, those set forth below, which could cause actual results to vary materially from recent results or from anticipated future results. These risk factors should be considered together with information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nEconomic Risks\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations and could affect the Company's liquidity. The full and long-term extent of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business depend on future events that continue to be highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the continued measures taken globally to reduce its spread have negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted consumer/customer demand and global supply chains, and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. These measures and the continued volatility of the global economy adversely affected our results of operations for 2020, and while most of our segments achieved strong results in 2021, we are currently unable to quantify the full and long-term impact of the pandemic on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nThe Company has implemented numerous actions in order to focus on the needs of its colleagues and customers, such as redesigning production processes, adjusting shift schedules and assignments and implementing aggressive new workplace sanitation practices and a coordinated response to ensure access to personal protective equipment to minimize infection risk. Further actions may be required in response to evolving conditions such as renewed travel restrictions, quarantine, and stay-at-home orders as well as uncertainty regarding the emergence of new variants and the timing of widespread availability of testing, vaccines and treatments. We cannot predict whether there will be pandemic-related facility closures in the future.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to have the potential to significantly and extendedly alter demand for our products and to disrupt our supply chain as a result of shifts in demand, illness, quarantine, travel restrictions, transportation disruptions, increased border controls or closures, or financial hardship. We have been able to procure the critical raw materials and components necessary to continue production, but prices for some raw materials have increased significantly and there is no guarantee that we will be able to procure critical raw materials in the future without materially adversely impacting our operating margins. A prolonged extension of the conditions resulting from the pandemic could force both customer and supplier bankruptcies, which we expect would adversely impact our results; however, given the uncertainty around the continued duration and breadth of the COVID-19 pandemic, we cannot reasonably estimate the extent of these adverse effects on our operations.\nThe Company has sought to implement a differentiated strategy to manage through the pandemic, including a focus on thoughtful cost management and continued investment in areas of strategic importance in order to maintain optionality and fully participate in the recovery phase. Although some opportunities have already emerged from this strategy, the Company cannot estimate the extent or the timing of the benefits from this strategy, if any. If the Company's strategy does not generate the expected benefits, the Company's long-term financial results could be adversely impacted.\nFurthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to impact the proper functioning of financial and capital markets. If the economic recovery is protracted, we may not be able to access our short-term credit facilities and may be required to seek additional financing sources, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all. If the Company suffers a liquidity shortage, we may be forced to reduce our workforce, decrease or suspend dividend payments or share repurchases, or adopt other measures. We cannot predict the likelihood, timing or the consequences of a future liquidity shortage in our business.\nThe ultimate significance of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business will depend on events that are beyond our control and that we cannot predict. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Company's results are impacted by global economic conditions. Downturns in the markets served by the Company could adversely affect its businesses, results of operations or financial condition.\nThe Company's businesses are impacted by economic conditions around the globe. Slower economic growth, financial market instability, inflation, natural disasters, public health crises (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), labor market challenges, supply chain disruptions, government deficit reduction, sequestration and other austerity measures impacting the\nmarkets the Company serves can adversely affect the Company's businesses by reducing demand for the Company's products and services, limiting financing available to the Company's customers, causing production delays, increasing order cancellations and the difficulty in collecting accounts receivable, increasing price competition, or increasing the risk that counterparties to the Company's contractual arrangements will become insolvent or otherwise unable to fulfill their obligations.\nThe global nature of the Company's operations subjects it to political, economic and social risks that could adversely affect its business, results of operations or financial condition.\nOver 50% of the Company's net sales are derived from customers outside the United States, and the Company currently operates in 52 countries. The risks inherent in the Company's global operations include:\n\u2022fluctuation in currency exchange rates;\n\u2022limitations on ownership or participation in local enterprises;\n\u2022price controls, exchange controls and limitations on repatriation of earnings;\n\u2022transportation delays and disruptions;\n\u2022political, social and economic instability and disruptions;\n\u2022acts of terrorism;\n\u2022the impact of widespread public health crises (such as the COVID-19 pandemic);\n\u2022government embargoes or foreign trade restrictions;\n\u2022the imposition of duties and tariffs and other trade barriers and retaliatory countermeasures;\n\u2022government actions impacting international trade agreements, including the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement;\n\u2022import and export controls;\n\u2022social and labor unrest and current and changing regulatory environments;\n\u2022the potential for expropriation or nationalization of enterprises;\n\u2022difficulties in staffing and managing multi-national operations;\n\u2022multiple and potentially conflicting laws, regulations and policies that are subject to change;\n\u2022limitations on its ability to enforce legal rights and remedies; and\n\u2022potentially adverse tax consequences.\nThe global geopolitical and trade environment has resulted in raw material inflation and potential for increased escalation of domestic and international tariffs and retaliatory trade policies. Further changes in U.S. trade policy (including new or additional increases in duties or tariffs) and retaliatory actions by U.S. trade partners could result in a worsening of economic conditions. If the Company is unable to successfully manage the risks associated with managing and expanding its international businesses, the Company's business, results of operations or financial condition may be adversely impacted.\nA significant fluctuation between the U.S. Dollar and other currencies could adversely impact the Company's operating income.\nAlthough the Company's financial results are reported in U.S. Dollars, a significant portion of its sales and operating costs are realized in other currencies, with the largest concentration of foreign sales occurring in Europe. The Company's profitability is affected by movements of the U.S. Dollar against the Euro and other foreign currencies in which it generates revenues and incurs expenses. Significant long-term fluctuations in relative currency values, and in particular, an increase in the value of the U.S. Dollar against foreign currencies, has had and could have an adverse effect on profitability and financial condition.\nBusiness and Operational Risks\nThe benefits from the Company's enterprise strategy may not be as expected and the Company's financial results could be adversely impacted, or the Company may not meet its long-term financial performance targets.\nAs the Company continues to execute on its enterprise strategy initiatives, it remains focused on the core principles of portfolio discipline, 80/20 Front-to-Back practice excellence, and organic growth. Product line and customer base simplification activities, which are core elements of the Company's 80/20 Front-to-Back process, continue to be applied by the Company's operating divisions and are active elements of the enterprise strategy. Although these activities are expected to improve future operating margins and organic revenue growth, they are also expected to have a negative impact on the Company's overall organic revenue growth in the short term. Additionally, other core activities of the enterprise strategy related to portfolio discipline and organic growth, including customer-back innovation and strategic sales excellence, may not\nhave the desired impact on future operating results. If the Company is unable to realize the expected benefits from its enterprise strategy initiatives, the Company's financial results could be adversely impacted, or the Company may not meet its long-term financial performance targets.\nThe timing and amount of the Company's share repurchases are subject to a number of uncertainties.\nShare repurchases constitute a significant component of the Company's capital allocation strategy. The Company has historically funded its share repurchases with free cash flow and short-term borrowings. The amount and timing of share repurchases will be based on a variety of factors. Important factors that could cause the Company to limit, suspend or delay its share repurchases include unfavorable trading market conditions, the price of the Company's common stock, the nature of other investment opportunities presented to the Company from time to time, regulatory developments relating to share repurchase programs, the ability to obtain financing at attractive rates and the availability of U.S. cash.\nIf the Company is unable to successfully introduce new products, its future growth may be adversely affected.\nThe Company's ability to develop new products based on innovation can affect its competitive position and sometimes requires the investment of significant time and resources. Difficulties or delays in research, development, production or commercialization of new products and services may reduce future revenues and adversely affect the Company's competitive position. If the Company is unable to create sustainable product differentiation, its organic growth may be adversely affected.\nIf the Company is unable to adequately protect its intellectual property, its competitive position and results of operations may be adversely impacted.\nProtecting the Company's intellectual property is critical to its innovation efforts. The Company owns patents, trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks and/or other intellectual property rights related to many of its products, and also has exclusive and non-exclusive license rights under intellectual property owned by others. The Company's intellectual property rights may be challenged or the Company may be unable to maintain, renew or enter into new license agreements with third-party owners of intellectual property on reasonable terms. Unauthorized use of the Company's intellectual property rights by third parties, particularly in countries where property rights are not highly developed or protected, or inability to preserve existing intellectual property rights could adversely impact the Company's competitive position and results of operations.\nThe Company has significant goodwill and other intangible assets, and future impairment of these assets could have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial results.\nThe Company has recorded significant goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets on its balance sheet as a result of acquisitions, including the acquisition of the MTS Test & Simulation business in 2021. A number of factors may result in impairments to goodwill and other intangible assets, including significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, increased competition and significant changes in the use of the assets. Impairment charges could adversely affect the Company's financial condition or results of operations in the periods recognized.\nRaw material price increases and supply shortages could adversely affect results.\nThe supply of raw materials to the Company and to its component parts suppliers could be interrupted for a variety of reasons, including availability and pricing. The Company has experienced supply chain disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and continued disruptions to the supply chain could adversely affect the Company's ability to meet commitments to customers. Prices for raw materials necessary for production have fluctuated significantly in the past and the Company is currently experiencing upward pricing pressure on raw materials such as steel, resins and chemicals. Significant price increases could adversely affect the Company's results of operations and operating margins. In particular, inflation, changes in trade policies, the imposition of duties and tariffs, potential retaliatory countermeasures, public health crises (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) and severe weather events could adversely impact the price or availability of raw materials. The Company may not be able to pass along increased raw material and components parts prices to its customers in the form of price increases or its ability to do so could be delayed. Consequently, its results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nThe Company's defined benefit pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect its results of operations and cash flows.\nThe performance of financial markets and interest rates impact the Company's funding obligations under its defined benefit pension plans. Significant changes in market interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets may increase the Company's funding obligations and adversely impact its results of operations and cash flows.\nIf the Company is unable to protect its information technology infrastructure against service interruptions, data corruption, cyber-based attacks or network security breaches, or if there is a violation of data privacy laws, there could be a negative impact on operating results or the Company may suffer financial or reputational damage.\nThe Company relies on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities, including procurement, manufacturing, distribution, invoicing and collection. These technology networks and systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases or components; power outages; hardware failures; computer viruses; employee error or malfeasance; and attacks by computer hackers, which have continued to increase on a global scale in both magnitude and frequency, taken on novel and unprecedented forms and become more difficult to detect. Minor security breaches have occurred from time to time and are expected to occur in the future. Although the cyber-attacks experienced to date have not had a material impact, future security breaches could result in unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or personal data belonging to our employees, partners, customers or suppliers, which could cause reputational and legal harm as we are subject to data privacy laws, including the EU General Data Protection Regulation, in the various countries in which we operate. If our information technology systems suffer severe damage, disruption, or shutdown, and business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, or if we violate data privacy laws, there could be a negative impact on operating results or the Company may suffer financial or reputational damage.\nStrategic Transaction Risks\nThe Company's acquisition of businesses could negatively impact its profitability and returns.\nThe Company has engaged in various acquisitions in the past, such as the recently completed acquisition of the MTS Test & Simulation business, and could choose to acquire additional businesses in the future. Acquisitions involve a number of risks and financial, accounting, managerial and operational challenges, including the following, any of which could adversely affect the Company's profitability and returns:\n\u2022The acquired business' inability to adapt to the ITW Business Model or otherwise perform in accordance with the Company's anticipated results or timetable, could cause it to under-perform relative to the Company's expectations and the price paid for it.\n\u2022The acquired business could cause the Company's financial results to differ from expectations in any given fiscal period, or over the long term.\n\u2022Acquisition-related earnings charges could adversely impact operating results.\n\u2022The acquired business could place unanticipated demands on the Company's management, operational resources and financial and internal control systems.\n\u2022The Company may assume unknown liabilities, known contingent liabilities that become realized or known liabilities that prove greater than anticipated, internal control deficiencies or exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from the activities of the acquired business. The realization of any of these liabilities or deficiencies may increase the Company's expenses, adversely affect its financial position or cause noncompliance with its financial reporting obligations.\n\u2022As a result of acquisitions, the Company has in the past recorded significant goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets on its balance sheet. If the Company is not able to realize the value of these assets, it may recognize charges relating to the impairment of these assets.\nDivestitures pose the risk of retained liabilities that could adversely affect the Company's financial results.\nThe Company has had significant divestiture activity in the past in accordance with its portfolio management initiative, and it continues portfolio refinements to maintain portfolio discipline. The Company has retained certain liabilities directly or through indemnifications made to the buyers against known and unknown contingent liabilities such as lawsuits, tax liabilities, product liability claims and environmental matters, which could adversely affect the Company's financial results.\nTax, Legal and Regulatory Risks\nUnfavorable tax law changes and tax authority rulings may adversely affect results.\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and in various foreign jurisdictions. Domestic and international tax liabilities are based on the income and expenses in various tax jurisdictions. The Company's effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings among countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets or changes in tax laws. The amount of income taxes is subject to ongoing audits by U.S. federal, state and local tax authorities and by non-U.S. authorities. If these audits result in assessments different from amounts recorded, future financial results may include unfavorable tax adjustments.\nAdverse outcomes in legal proceedings or enforcement actions may adversely affect results.\nThe Company's businesses expose it to potential costs and adverse rulings associated with commercial, intellectual property, toxic tort and other product liability claims. The Company's global operations also subject it to government investigations in numerous countries. We cannot predict the outcome of claims, investigations and lawsuits and we may incur costs, judgments or fines or enter into settlements that could adversely impact our businesses, reputation or future financial results. The Company currently maintains insurance programs consisting of self-insurance up to certain limits and excess insurance coverage for claims over established limits. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain insurance on acceptable terms or that its insurance programs will provide adequate protection against actual losses. In addition, the Company is subject to the risk that one or more of its insurers may become insolvent and become unable to pay claims that may be made in the future. Even if it maintains adequate insurance programs, claims, judgements, fines or settlements could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, liquidity and results of operations and on its ability to obtain suitable, adequate or cost-effective insurance in the future.\nUncertainty related to environmental regulation and industry standards, as well as physical risks of climate change, could impact the Company's results of operations and financial position.\nIncreased public awareness and concern regarding environmental risks, including global climate change, may result in more international, regional and/or federal requirements or industry standards to reduce or mitigate global warming and other environmental risks. These regulations or standards could mandate even more restrictive requirements, such as stricter limits on greenhouse gas emissions and production of single use plastics, than the voluntary commitments that the Company has made or require such changes on a more accelerated time frame. There continues to be a lack of consistent climate legislation, which creates economic and regulatory uncertainty. In addition, the physical risks of climate change may impact the availability and cost of materials and natural resources, sources and supply of energy, product demand and manufacturing and could increase insurance and other operating costs, including, potentially, to repair damage incurred as a result of extreme weather events or to renovate or retrofit facilities to better withstand extreme weather events. If environmental laws or regulations or industry standards are either changed or adopted and impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon the Company or its products, or the Company's operations are disrupted due to physical impacts of climate change, the Company's business, capital expenditures, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position could be negatively impacted.\nThe Company may incur fines or penalties, damage to its reputation or other adverse consequences if its employees, agents or business partners violate anti-bribery, competition, export and import, environmental, human rights or other laws.\nThe Company has a decentralized operating structure under which its individual businesses are allowed significant decision-making autonomy within the Company's strategic framework and internal financial and compliance controls. The Company cannot ensure that its internal controls will always protect against reckless or criminal acts committed by its employees, agents or business partners that might violate U.S. and/or non-U.S. laws, including anti-bribery, competition, export and import, environmental and human rights laws. As recent years have seen a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anti-corruption laws and adoption of new human rights laws, any such improper actions could subject the Company to civil or criminal investigations, could lead to substantial civil or criminal monetary and non-monetary penalties against the Company or its subsidiaries, or could damage its reputation.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
