Risk Factors\nThe following describes certain of the risks and uncertainties we face that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operation, and cause our future results to differ materially from our current results and from those anticipated in our forward-looking statements. These risk factors should be considered together with the other risks and uncertainties described in Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and elsewhere herein. This list of material risk factors is not all-inclusive or necessarily in order of importance.\nRisk Related to our Industry and Business\nDeclines in aluminum prices could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur operating results depend on the market for primary aluminum which can be volatile and subject to many factors beyond our control. The overall price of primary aluminum consists of three components: (i) the base commodity price, which is based on quoted prices on the LME; plus (ii) any regional premium (e.g., the Midwest premium for metal sold in the United States and the European Duty Paid premium for metal sold into Europe); plus (iii) any product premium. Each of these three components has its own drivers of variability.\nThe aluminum price is influenced by a number of factors, including global supply-demand balance, inventory levels, speculative activities by market participants, production activities by competitors, political and economic conditions, as well as production costs in major production regions. These factors can be highly speculative and difficult to predict which can lead to significant volatility in the aluminum price. A deterioration in global economic conditions or a worldwide financial downturn also has the potential to adversely affect future demand and prices for aluminum. Geopolitical uncertainty of any kind, including the United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the European Union (commonly referred to as Brexit), major public health issues (such as an outbreak of a pandemic or epidemic like the novel coronavirus COVID-19) or other unexpected events have the potential to negatively impact business confidence, potentially resulting in reduced global or regional demand for aluminum and increased price volatility. Such events may also impact prices by causing disruptions in our operations, supply chain, or workforce.\nDeclines in aluminum prices could cause us to curtail production at our operations or take other actions to reduce our cost of production, including deferring certain capital expenditures and maintenance costs and implementing workforce reductions. Any deferred costs achieved through such curtailments and other cost cutting measures could ultimately result in higher capital expenditures and maintenance costs than would have been incurred had such costs not been deferred and increase the costs to restore production capacity if market forces warrant. Declines in aluminum prices also negatively impact our liquidity by lowering our borrowing availability under our asset-based revolving credit facilities (due to a lower market value of our inventory and accounts receivable). These factors may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, the amount of cash flow we have available for our capital expenditures and other operating expenses, our ability to access the credit and capital markets and our results of operations.\nExcess capacity and overproduction of aluminum products may materially disrupt world aluminum markets causing price deterioration which, in turn, could adversely impact our sales, margins and profitability.\nGlobal aluminum prices have been significantly depressed in recent years primarily due to large amounts of excess capacity and overproduction in China and other regions. Significant portions of global aluminum production would not be possible without financial and other support and incentives from governments and state-owned entities. This oversupply has caused global aluminum prices to be adversely impacted. Overproduction and the export of heavily subsidized aluminum products may result in depressed prices and, in turn, have a material adverse impact on our operating results, sales, margins and profitability.\nIncreases in energy costs adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nElectrical power represents one of the largest components of our cost of goods sold. As a result, the availability of electricity at competitive prices is critical to the profitability of our operations.\nIn the U.S., our Hawesville and Sebree plants receive all of their electricity requirements under market-based electricity contracts, and our Mt. Holly plant currently receives 75% of its electricity requirements under a market-based electricity contract that is set to expire March 31, 2021. Since November 2019, the price of approximately 30% of Grundartangi\u2019s power requirements has been linked to the market price for power in the Nord Pool power market, which exposes us to price\nvolatility and fluctuations due to factors beyond our control and without any direct relationship to the price of primary aluminum. For example, extreme weather events in mid-February 2021 across the United States resulted in increases to power prices for our Kentucky plants, which could have an adverse effect on our results in the first quarter of 2021. Market-based electricity contracts expose us to market price volatility and fluctuations driven by, among other things, coal and natural gas prices, renewable energy production, regulatory changes and weather events, in each case, without any direct relationship to the price of primary aluminum. There can be no assurance that our market-based power supply arrangements will result in favorable electricity costs. Any increase in our electricity and energy prices not tied to corresponding increases in the LME price could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nDisruptions in our supply of power and other events could adversely affect our operations.\nWe use large amounts of electricity to produce primary aluminum. Any loss or disruption of the power supply which reduces the amperage to our equipment or causes an equipment shutdown would result in a reduction in the volume of molten aluminum produced, and prolonged losses of power may result in the hardening or \"freezing\" of molten aluminum in the pots where it is produced, which could require an expensive and time consuming restart process.\nDisruptions in the supply of electrical power to our facilities can be caused by a number of circumstances, including, but not limited to, unusually high demand, blackouts, equipment or transformer failure, human error, malicious acts, natural disasters, weather events or other catastrophic events. Our market-based power supply arrangements further increase the risk that disruptions in the supply of electrical power to our domestic operations could occur. Under these arrangements, we have greater exposure to transmission line outages, problems with grid stability and limitations on energy import capability. An alternative supply of power in the event of a disruption may not be feasible.\nPower disruptions have had a material negative impact on our results of operations in the past. An equipment failure at our Sebree smelter in May 2018, for example, caused us to lose power to one of the three potlines at Sebree and forced us to temporarily stop production from that potline. We operate our smelters at close to peak amperage. Accordingly, even partial failures of high voltage equipment could affect our production. Disruptions in the supply of electrical power that do not result in production curtailment could cause us to experience pot instability that could decrease levels of productivity and incur losses.\nWe maintain property and business interruption insurance to mitigate losses resulting from catastrophic events, but are required to pay significant amounts under the deductible provisions of those insurance policies. In addition, the coverage under those policies may not be sufficient to cover all losses, or may not cover certain events. Certain of our insurance policies do not cover any losses that may be incurred if our suppliers are unable to provide power under certain circumstances. Certain losses or prolonged interruptions in our operations may trigger a default under certain of our outstanding indebtedness and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nWe may be unable to continue to compete successfully in the highly competitive markets in which we operate.\nWe are engaged in a highly competitive industry. Aluminum also competes with other materials, such as steel, copper, plastics, composite materials and glass, among others, for various applications. Many of our competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial and technical resources than we do. These larger competitors may be better able to withstand reductions in price or other adverse industry or economic conditions. Similarly, many of our competitors have vertically integrated upstream operations with resulting superior cost positions to ours and may be better able to withstand reductions in price or other adverse industry or economic conditions. If we are not able to compete successfully, our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nPublic health pandemics, epidemics or similar public health threats, including the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), could have a material adverse effect on our business, outlook, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nThe global markets in which we operate have been impacted by the recent COVID-19 pandemic. Our business could be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic or other health pandemics, epidemics or similar public health threats in the future.\nOur operating results depend on the market for primary aluminum which can be volatile and subject to many factors beyond our control. The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the global economy and created significant volatility in the primary aluminum industry. Such adverse impacts to the global market include the drop in the LME price for primary aluminum to $1,457 in April 2020 from $1,772 at the start of 2020. However, we have seen some measurable improvement in the global market for aluminum along with an increase in the price for our product and a return to more stability in the market\nin which we operate in recent months. The LME price for primary aluminum averaged $1,702 per tonne for 2020 as compared to an average of $1,792 for 2019, due in part to the impacts that COVID-19 had on the LME price during 2020. Because we sell our product on a one- to three-month lag to current prices, our results reflect the LME price on this one to three month lag basis. Future deterioration in economic conditions and global markets arising from the COVID-19 pandemic could materially and adversely affect future demand and prices for aluminum which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity.\nOur business also depends on the ability of our employees to travel to our aluminum smelting facilities and operate our facilities. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, we have implemented several new policies and procedures to protect the health and safety of our workforce. We restricted both personal and business travel for a period of time during the pandemic, implemented continuous disinfecting of our workplaces, and set up employees whose jobs allow them to work remotely. We have advised all of our employees in proper care and hygiene to prevent the spread of the virus. While these measures serve to reduce the possibility of transmission of the virus within our workplaces, they do not assure that our employees will not contract the virus or bring it into the workplace. Were such an event to be widespread enough, our operations could be disrupted to varying degrees up to and including a shutdown, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, outlook, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic could also interfere with general commercial activity related to our supply chain and customer base, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and operational results. Raw material suppliers, including those we currently use, may not be available or may be delayed in shipments to us, impacting our ability to deliver our products to our customers thereby negatively impacting our operational results and financial condition. Further, if our customers\u2019 businesses are similarly affected, they might delay, reduce or even eliminate purchases from us, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has also created substantial uncertainty and volatility in the financial markets which may impact our ability to access capital and the terms under which we can do so. Our ability to pay interest on and to repay or refinance our debt will depend upon our access to financial markets or other alternative sources of liquidity and future operating performance, any of which may be negatively impacted by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe ultimate severity, magnitude and duration of COVID-19 is uncertain, rapidly changing and hard to predict. The extent to which COVID-19 may adversely impact our business depends on future developments, which are highly uncertain and unpredictable, such as the ultimate duration and scope of the outbreak, the availability and distribution of vaccines domestically and globally, the spread and rise of any different variants of the COVID-19 virus, the pandemic\u2019s impact on our customers and suppliers, how quickly normal economic conditions, operations, and the demand for our products can resume, and whether the pandemic leads to recessionary conditions in any of our key markets or in global markets generally. The potential future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, results of operations and financial performance is difficult to predict and will depend on future developments, and such effects could exist for an extended period of time. While we expect the COVID-19 pandemic to continue to impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial position, the current level of uncertainty over the economic and operational impacts of COVID-19 means the related impact to our business cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.\nTo the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described herein.\nCurtailment of aluminum production at our facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nThe continued operation of our smelters depends on the market for primary aluminum and our underlying costs of production. There can be no assurance that future deterioration in the price of aluminum or increases in our costs of production, including power, will not result in additional production curtailments at our smelters.\nCurtailing production requires us to incur substantial expenses, both at the time of the curtailment and on an ongoing basis. Our facilities are subject to contractual and other fixed costs that continue even if we curtail operations at these facilities. These costs reduce the cost saving advantages of curtailing unprofitable aluminum production. If we are unable to realize the intended cost saving effects of any production curtailment, we may have to seek bankruptcy protection or be forced to divest some or all of our assets. The process of restarting production following curtailment is also expensive and time consuming. As a result, any decision to restart production would likely require market conditions significantly better than the market conditions at the time the decision to curtail was made. Any curtailments of our operations, or actions taken to seek bankruptcy protection or divest some or all of our assets, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nIf we are unable to enter into a new power arrangement for Mt. Holly and/or obtain necessary government approvals, we may choose, or be forced, to further curtail operations at the Mt. Holly plant.\nCASC is currently party to both a power agreement with a third-party supplier (providing 75% of Mt. Holly's power) and Santee Cooper (providing 25% of Mt. Holly's power) to supply the Mt. Holly smelter with all its power needs. Both of these power agreements were set to expire on December 31, 2020 but were extended through March 31, 2021 as we finalize a new three-year power agreement with Santee Cooper that is expected to be effective April 1, 2021. It is expected that under the new power contract with Santee Cooper, 100% of Mt. Holly's electrical power requirements will be supplied from Santee Cooper's generation at cost of service-based rates. The new power with Santee Cooper is expected to provide sufficient energy to allow the smelter to increase its current production to 75% of Mt. Holly's full production capacity. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be successful in finalizing this proposed agreement with Santee Cooper or obtaining all governmental approvals needed in connection therewith. We issued a Working Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) Notice to employees at Mt. Holly in October 2020, which has since been extended through March 31, 2021, of our intent to curtail plant operations if the smelter cannot secure a new power arrangement with Santee Cooper to delivery energy to the plant. If we are unable to secure and finalize this new power agreement with Santee Cooper and obtain all necessary governmental approvals for Mt. Holly, we may choose, or be forced, to further curtail operations at the plant.\nClosure of the Mt. Holly facility would impose various costs on us that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity and could cause us to write down the book value of the Mt. Holly facility. In addition, the ongoing uncertainty regarding the future operation of Mt. Holly may damage our relationships with our customers, suppliers, employees and other stakeholders, whether or not Mt. Holly is ultimately closed. We may need to take actions to terminate certain customer and supply contracts or curtail additional production in advance of any plant closure. Customers and suppliers may also become unwilling to renew existing contracts or enter into new contracts with us. It may also become more difficult to attract and retain employees. Such actions and events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nThe restart of curtailed capacity at our Mt. Holly smelter upon the finalization of the new power agreement with Santee Cooper is subject to certain risks and uncertainties.\nUpon finalization of the proposed new, three-year agreement with Santee Cooper for power at our Mt. Holly smelter and receipt of all necessary governmental approvals, we plan to restart capacity at Mt. Holly that had been previously curtailed. The new power contract with Santee Cooper is expected to provide sufficient energy to allow the smelter to increase its current production to 75% of Mt. Holly's full production capacity. The decision to move forward with this restart is based on certain market assumptions that are subject to risks outside of our control, specifically the LME price of aluminum, raw materials and premiums. Changes in these inputs may result in actual costs and returns that materially differ from the estimated costs and returns and our financial position and results of operations may be negatively affected as a result. Changes in these inputs may\nalso make the Mt. Holly restart project uneconomic and we may decide at any time not to continue to fund this investment.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to restart capacity at Mt. Holly within our projected budget and schedule. In addition to changes in market assumptions, other unforeseen difficulties could increase the cost of the project, delay the project or render the project not feasible. Our ability to finance the project could also be impacted by our cash position and results of operations. Any delay in the completion of the project, unexpected or increased costs or inability to fund the project could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nThe restart of production at our Hawesville smelter is subject to certain risks and uncertainties.\nWe are currently in the process of a multi-year project at our Hawesville, Kentucky aluminum smelter to restart previously curtailed capacity, rebuild two potlines that we had continued to operate past their expected life cycle, and implement new technology across all production. In early 2019, we completed the first phase of this project, which involved restarting production on the three potlines that had been curtailed since 2015 and upgrading the cell technology on these potlines. The second phase of the project involves the rebuilding of the pots from the two potlines that had continued to operate past their expected life cycle and the implementation of certain new technology across all production. These two potlines were taken out of production in February and September 2019, respectively. The rebuild of the first of these potlines was completed in the second quarter of 2020. With the restart of this potline, the Hawesville smelter is currently operating at approximately 80% production capacity. The rebuild of the fifth and final potline at Hawesville is expected to be completed over the next several years, subject to market conditions. The decision to continue with the Hawesville restart project is based on certain market assumptions that are subject to risks outside of our control, specifically the LME price of aluminum, raw materials and premiums. Changes in these inputs may result in actual costs and returns that materially differ from the estimated costs and returns and our financial position and results of operations may be negatively affected as a result. Changes in these inputs may also make the Hawesville restart project uneconomic and we may decide at any time to discontinue the unfinished portions of the project.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to restore Hawesville to full production within our projected budget and schedule. In addition to changes in market assumptions, other unforeseen difficulties could increase the cost of the project, delay the project or render the project not feasible. Our ability to finance the project could also be impacted by our cash position and results of operations. Any delay in the completion of the project, unexpected or increased costs or inability to fund the project could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nIncreases in our raw material costs and disruptions in our supply could adversely affect our business.\nOur business depends upon the adequate supply of alumina, aluminum fluoride, calcined petroleum coke, pitch, carbon anodes and cathodes and other raw materials. For some of these production inputs, such as alumina, coke and pitch, we do not have any internal production and rely on a limited number of suppliers for all of our requirements. Many of our supply agreements are short term or expire in the next few years. There is no assurance that we will be able to renew such agreements on commercially favorable terms, if at all. Certain of our principal raw materials are commodities for which, at times, availability and pricing can be volatile due to a number of factors beyond our control, including general economic conditions, domestic and worldwide demand, labor costs, competition, weather conditions and other transportation delays, major force majeure events, pandemics, tariffs, sanctions and currency exchange rates. Because we rely on a limited number of suppliers, if our suppliers cannot meet their contracted volume commitments or other contractual requirements, it may be difficult for us to source our raw materials from alternative suppliers at commercially reasonable prices or within the time periods required by our operations. If we are unable to source from alternative suppliers, we could be forced to curtail production or use raw materials that do not meet our requirements, which could cause inefficiencies in our operations, increase costs or impact our production capabilities, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nWe are also exposed to price risk for each of these commodities. For example, the pricing under certain of our current alumina supply contracts is based on a published alumina index. As a result, our cost structure is exposed to market fluctuations and price volatility. During 2018, for example, external events in the alumina markets, including the partial curtailment of the Alunorte alumina refinery in Brazil due to environmental concerns following severe weather and U.S. sanctions impacting UC Rusal\u2019s ability to supply alumina to the market, caused significant price volatility. As a result of these events, the alumina index price reached a high of $710 per tonne in April 2018 compared to an average price of $271 per tonne for 2020 and $332 per\ntonne for 2019. From time to time, we manage our exposure to fluctuations in our alumina costs by purchasing certain of our alumina requirements under supply contracts with prices tied to the LME price of aluminum.\nBecause we sell our products based on the LME price for primary aluminum, we are not able to pass on to our customers any increased cost of raw materials that are not linked to the LME price. The availability of our raw materials at competitive prices is critical to the profitability of our operations and increases in pricing and/or disruptions in our supply could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nWe may be unable to realize the expected benefits of our capital projects.\nFrom time to time, we undertake strategic capital projects in order to enhance, expand and/or upgrade our facilities and operational capabilities. For instance, within the past several years, we have undertaken expansion projects at our Sebree, Hawesville, Grundartangi and Vlissingen facilities and are set to begin another project at Mt. Holly upon finalization of the new power agreement. Our ability to complete these projects and the timing and costs of doing so are subject to various risks, many of which are beyond our control. Additionally, the start-up of operations after such projects have been completed is also subject to risk. Our ability to achieve the anticipated increased revenues or otherwise realize acceptable returns on these investments is subject to a variety of market, operational, regulatory and labor-related factors. Any failure to complete these projects, or any delays or failure to achieve the anticipated results from the implementation of any such projects, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nOur failure to maintain satisfactory labor relations could adversely affect our business.\nThe bargaining unit employees at our Grundartangi, Hawesville, Sebree and Vlissingen facilities are represented by labor unions, representing approximately 67% of our total workforce as of December 31, 2020. Our Grundartangi labor agreement is effective through December 31, 2024. Our Vlissingen labor agreement expired on December 1, 2020. Since such time, we have been operating under the terms of the expired agreement while we engage in negotiations regarding the terms of a new agreement. Our Hawesville and Sebree labor agreements are scheduled to expire April 1, 2021 and October 28, 2023, respectively.\nWhile we are hopeful to reach agreement with the labor unions to renew these agreements on acceptable terms, there is no assurance that we will be successful in doing so. If we fail to maintain satisfactory relations with any labor union representing our employees, our labor contracts may not prevent a strike or work stoppage at any of these facilities in the future. As part of any negotiation with a labor union, we may reach agreements with respect to future wages and benefits that may have a material adverse effect on our future business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. In addition, negotiations could divert management attention or result in strikes, lock-outs or other work stoppages. Any threatened or actual work stoppage in the future or inability to renegotiate our collective bargaining agreements could prevent or significantly impair our production capabilities subject to these collective bargaining agreements, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nCertain of our raw material and services contracts contain \"take-or-pay\" obligations.\nWe have obligations under certain contracts to take-or-pay for specified raw materials or services over the term of those contracts regardless of our operating requirements. To the extent that we curtail production at any of our operations, we may continue to be obligated to take or pay for goods or services under these contracts as if we were operating at full production, which reduces the cost savings advantages of curtailing aluminum production. Our financial position and results of operations may also be adversely affected by the market price for such materials or services as we will continue to incur costs under these contracts to meet or settle our contractual take-or-pay obligations. If we were unable to use such materials or services in our operations or sell them at prices consistent with or greater than our contract costs, we could incur significant losses under these contracts. In addition, these commitments may also limit our ability to take advantage of favorable changes in the market prices for such materials and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nWe have historically derived substantially all of our revenue from a small number of customers, and we could be adversely affected by the loss of a major customer or changes in the business or financial condition of our major customers.\nWe have historically derived substantially all of our consolidated net sales from a small number of customers. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we derived approximately 76% of our consolidated net sales from two major customers and we currently have agreements in place to sell a substantial portion of our 2021 production to these same customers. We expect that\nthe rest of our 2021 customer base will remain fairly concentrated among a small number of customers under short-term contracts.\nAny material non-payment or non-performance by one of these customers, a significant dispute with one of these customers, a significant downturn or deterioration in the business or financial condition of any of these customers, early termination of our sales agreement with any of these customers, or any other event significantly negatively impacting the contractual relationship with one of these customers could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. If, in such an event, we are unable to sell the affected production volume to another customer, or we sell the affected production to another customer on terms that are materially less advantageous to us, our revenues could be negatively impacted.\nWe require substantial resources to pay our operating expenses and fund our capital expenditures.\nWe require substantial resources to pay our operating expenses and fund our capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate funds from our operations to pay our operating expenses and fund our capital expenditures and other obligations, our ability to continue to meet these cash requirements in the future could require substantial liquidity and access to sources of funds, including from capital and credit markets.\nIf funding is not available when needed, or is available only on unacceptable terms, we may be unable to respond to competitive pressures, take advantage of market opportunities or fund operations, capital expenditure or other obligations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nInternational operations expose us to political, regulatory, currency and other related risks.\nWe receive a significant portion of our revenues and cash flow from our operations in Iceland and the Netherlands. These operations expose us to risks, including unexpected changes in foreign laws and regulations, political and economic instability, challenges in managing foreign operations, increased costs to adapt our systems and practices to those used in foreign countries, taxes, export duties, currency restrictions and exchange, tariffs and other trade barriers, and the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations. Changes in foreign laws and regulations are generally beyond our ability to control, influence or predict and future adverse changes in these laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nIn addition, we may be exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. As a result, an increase in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar could increase the U.S. dollar cost of our operating expenses which are denominated and payable in those currencies. To the extent we explore additional opportunities outside the U.S., our currency risk with respect to foreign currencies may increase.\nUnpredictable events may interrupt our operations, which may adversely affect our business.\nOur operations may be susceptible to unpredictable events, including accidents, transportation and supply interruptions, labor disputes, equipment failure, information system breakdowns, natural disasters, dangerous weather conditions, river conditions, political unrest and other events. Operational malfunctions or interruptions at one or more of our facilities could result in substantial losses in our production capacity, personal injury or death, damage to our properties or the properties of others, monetary losses and potential legal liability.\nOur market-based power supply arrangements further increase the risk that unpredictable events could lead to changes in the price and/or availability of market power which could significantly impact the profitability and viability of our operations. For example, extreme weather events in mid-February 2021 across the United States resulted in increases to power prices for our Kentucky plants after the occurrence of such events, which could have an adverse effect on our results in the first quarter of 2021. Power generation curtailments, transmission line outages, or limitations on energy import capability that arise from such unpredictable events could also increase power prices, disrupt production or force a curtailment of all or part of the production at our facilities. In addition, unpredictable events that lead to power cost increases may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nIceland, for example, has suffered several natural disasters and extreme weather events, including significant volcanic eruptions and earthquakes which can lead to disruption in power transmission or other impacts to our operations. Insufficient\nrain in Iceland has and could in the future lead to low water levels in the reservoirs which has resulted and may again result in curtailments in power which is provided to our Grundartangi smelter from hydroelectric and geothermal sources.\nWe accept delivery of necessary raw materials to our operations using public infrastructure such as river systems and seaports. Deterioration of such infrastructure and/or other adverse conditions could result in transportation delays or interruptions and increased costs, as occurred during the third quarter of 2017 when lock closures on the Ohio River impacted our alumina supply and forced us to find alternative means to transport alumina to our Kentucky operations at increased cost. Any delay in the delivery of raw materials necessary for our production could impact our ability to operate our plants and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operation.\nFuture unpredictable events may adversely affect our ability to conduct business and may require substantial capital expenditures and operating expenses to remediate damage and restore operations at our production facilities. Although we maintain insurance to mitigate losses resulting from such events, our coverage may not be sufficient to cover all losses, may have high deductibles or may not cover certain events at all. To the extent these losses are not covered by insurance, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe engage in hedging transactions which involve risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and liquidity.\nAs a global producer of primary aluminum, our business is subject to risk of fluctuations in the market prices of primary aluminum, power and foreign currencies, among other things. Therefore, from time to time, we may seek to manage our exposure to these risks through entering into different types of hedging arrangements designed to reduce such risk exposure. However, there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will successfully reduce our risk exposure to these factors. In addition, there may be unforeseen events affecting our business that could lead us to be long in positions that we did not anticipate when such hedging transactions were put into place which in turn could lead to adverse effects on our financial position. Further, we may be required to use a significant amount of liquidity to satisfy collateral margin calls required by our hedging counterparties. Utilizing liquidity to satisfy collateral margin calls may have an impact on the liquidity we have available for our operations and lead to adverse impacts on our financial position\nRisks Related to Indebtedness and Financing\nA deterioration in our financial condition or credit rating could limit our ability to access the credit and capital markets on acceptable terms or to enter into hedging and financial transactions, lead to our inability to access liquidity facilities, and could adversely affect our financial condition and our business relationships.\nOur credit rating has been adversely affected by unfavorable market and financial conditions. Our existing credit rating, or any future negative actions the credit agencies may take affecting our credit rating, could expose us to significant borrowing costs and less favorable credit terms, limiting our ability to access the credit and capital markets, and have an adverse effect on our relationships with customers, suppliers and hedging counterparties. An inability to access the credit and capital markets when needed in order to refinance our existing debt or raise new debt or equity could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nWe may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt service requirements which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had an aggregate of approximately $315.9 million of outstanding debt (including $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due July 1, 2025). Our ability to pay interest on and to repay or refinance our debt will depend upon our access to additional sources of liquidity and future operating performance, which is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, business and other factors, including market prices for primary aluminum, that are beyond our control. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay debt service obligations, refinance our existing debt or to fund our other liquidity needs. If we are unable to meet our debt service obligations or fund our other liquidity needs, we could attempt to restructure or refinance our debt or seek additional equity or debt capital. There can be no assurance that we would be able to accomplish those actions on satisfactory terms, or at\nall. If we are unable to ultimately meet our debt service obligations and fund our other liquidity needs, it may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nOur substantial indebtedness or any future additional indebtedness could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nOur substantial indebtedness and the significant cash flow required to service such debt increases our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions, reduces cash available for other purposes and limits our operational flexibility. Despite our substantial indebtedness, we may incur substantial additional debt in the future. Although the agreements governing our existing debt limit our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to incur additional debt, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions and, under certain circumstances, debt incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. In addition, these agreements may also allow us to incur certain obligations that do not constitute debt as defined in these agreements. To the extent that we incur additional debt or such other obligations, the risks associated with our substantial debt described above, including our possible inability to service and meet our debt or other obligations, would increase.\nWe are subject to interest rate risk, which could adversely affect our borrowing costs, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur industrial revenue bonds (\"IRBs\") and borrowings on our U.S. and Iceland revolving credit facilities as well as the term loan agreement with Glencore Ltd. pursuant to which the Company borrowed $40.0 million (the \"Hawesville Term Loan\") are currently at variable interest rates, and future borrowings required to fund working capital at our businesses, capital expenditures, acquisitions, or other strategic opportunities may be at variable rates, which exposes us to interest rate risk. An increase in interest rates would increase our debt service obligations under our existing debt instruments and potentially any future debt instruments, further limiting cash flow available for other uses. Any increase in interest rates could adversely affect our borrowing costs, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur debt instruments subject us to covenants and restrictions.\nOur existing debt instruments contain various covenants that restrict the way we conduct our business and limit our ability to incur debt, pay dividends and engage in transactions such as acquisitions and investments, among other things, which may impair our ability to obtain additional liquidity and grow our business. Any failure to comply with those covenants would likely constitute a breach under such debt instruments which may result in the acceleration of all or a substantial portion of our outstanding indebtedness and termination of commitments under our revolving credit facility. If our indebtedness is accelerated, we may be unable to repay the required amounts and our secured lenders could foreclose on any collateral securing our secured debt. Any of the foregoing actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nWe depend upon intercompany transfers from our subsidiaries to meet our debt service obligations.\nWe are a holding company and conduct all of our operations through our subsidiaries. As a holding company, our results of operations depend on the results of operations of our subsidiaries. Moreover, our ability to meet our debt service obligations depends upon the receipt of intercompany transfers from our subsidiaries. The ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments or advances to us will depend on their operating results and will be subject to applicable laws and any restrictions or prohibitions on intercompany transfers by those subsidiaries contained in agreements governing the debt or other obligations of such subsidiaries.\nRisks Related to Cybersecurity\nThe failure of our information technology systems, network disruptions, cyber-attacks or other breaches in data security could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.\nWe depend on our information technology systems to effectively manage significant aspects of our business including, without limitation, production process control, metal inventory management, shipping and receiving, and reporting financial and operational results. Any disruptions, delays, or deficiencies in our information systems or network connectivity could result in increased costs, disruptions in our business, and/or adversely affect our ability to timely report our financial results.\nOur information technology systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from circumstances largely beyond our control, including, without limitation, fire, natural disasters, power outages, systems failure, security breaches, and cyber-\nattacks, which include viruses, malware, and ransomware attacks. While we have disaster recovery and business continuity plans in place, if our information technology systems are damaged or interrupted for any reason, and, if the disaster recovery and business continuity plans do not effectively resolve such issues on a timely basis, we may be unable to manage or conduct our business operations, suffer reputational harm, and may be subject to governmental investigations and litigation, any of which may adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nCybersecurity incidents, in particular, are increasing in frequency and continue to become more sophisticated and include, but are not limited to, attempts to gain unauthorized system access to install malicious software such as ransomware or malware, direct fraudulent payments to fictitious vendors, disrupt production process control and financial systems, and release of confidential or otherwise protected information and data.\nDue to the evolving nature of cybersecurity threats, the scope and impact of any incident cannot be predicted. While the Company continually works to safeguard our systems and mitigate potential risks, there is no assurance that such actions will be sufficient to prevent cyber-attacks or security breaches that damage or interrupt access to information systems or networks, compromise confidential or otherwise protected information, destroy or corrupt data, or otherwise disrupt our operations. In addition, we may not be able to contain a targeted cybersecurity incident to any one particular operating location. Furthermore, although the Company does maintain insurance in its operations, such insurance may not cover all liabilities affiliated with any sort of cyber incident or security breach. The occurrence of such events could negatively impact our reputation and our competitive position and could result in litigation with third parties, regulatory action, loss of business, potential liability and increased remediation costs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Such security breaches could also result in a violation of applicable U.S. and international\nprivacy and other laws and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.\nRisks Related to Legal, Regulatory and Compliance Matters\nClimate change, climate change legislation or environmental regulations may adversely impact our operations.\nGovernmental regulatory bodies in the United States and other countries where we operate have adopted, or may in the future adopt, laws or other regulatory changes in response to the potential impacts of climate change. Laws and regulations could have a variety of adverse effects on our business.\nFor example, electricity represents our single largest operating cost and the availability of electricity at competitive prices is critical to the profitability of our operations. Some of the power we purchase in the United States is generated at coal-based power plants, which have been, and are likely to continue to be, significantly impacted by these regulations, including the Paris Agreement, which the United States re-entered on February 19, 2021. Any resulting increase in our operating costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity. Even small increases in power prices could have a disproportionate impact on our business if such price increases are not supported by then current aluminum prices.\nIn addition, as a member of the EEA and a signatory to the Kyoto Protocol, Iceland has implemented legislation to abide by the Kyoto Protocol and Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament (the \"Directive\") which establishes a \"cap and trade\" scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading. Iceland is complying with the Directive by participating in the European Union (\"EU\") Emission Trading System which requires us to purchase carbon dioxide allowances for our Grundartangi smelter. We currently receive approximately 70% of needed emission allowances for the Grundartangi smelter free of charge, although changes to these regulations, or the implementation of new regulations, could cause our cost of allowances to rise or impose other costs.\nThe future impact of these or other potential regulatory changes is uncertain and may be either voluntary or legislated and may impact our operations directly or indirectly through our customers or our supply chain. We may incur increased capital expenditures resulting from compliance with such regulatory changes, increased energy costs, costs associated with a \"cap and trade\" system, increased insurance premiums and deductibles, a change in competitive position relative to industry peers and changes to profit or loss arising from increased or decreased demand for goods produced by us and indirectly, from changes in cost of goods sold. For example, \"cap and trade\" legislation may impose significant additional costs to our power suppliers that could lead to significant increases in our energy costs. In addition, the potential physical impacts of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain and will be particular to the geographic circumstances. These may include changes in rainfall patterns, shortages of water or other natural resources, changing sea levels, changing storm patterns and intensities, and\nchanging temperature levels. Any adverse regulatory and physical changes may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nWe and our suppliers are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nOur operations may impact the environment and our properties may have environmental contamination, which could result in material liabilities to us. We are obligated to comply with various foreign, federal, state and other environmental laws and regulations, including the environmental laws and regulations of the United States, Iceland and the EU. Environmental laws and regulations may expose us to costs or liabilities relating to our manufacturing operations or property ownership. We incur operating costs and capital expenditures on an ongoing basis to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations. We also are currently, and may in the future be, responsible for the cleanup of contamination at some of our current and former facilities or for the amelioration of damage to natural resources. Environmental laws may impose cleanup liability on owners and occupiers of contaminated property, including past or divested properties, regardless of whether the owners or occupiers caused the contamination or whether the activity that resulted in the contamination was lawful at the time it was conducted. Liability may also be imposed on a joint and several basis, such that we may be held responsible for more than our share of the contamination or other damages.\nIf more stringent compliance or cleanup standards under environmental laws or regulations are imposed, previously unknown environmental conditions or damages to natural resources are discovered or alleged, or if contributions from other responsible parties with respect to sites for which we have cleanup responsibilities are not available, we may be subject to additional liability, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Further, additional environmental matters for which we may be liable may arise in the future at our present sites where no problem is currently known, with respect to sites previously owned or operated by us, by related corporate entities or by our predecessors, or at sites that we may acquire or operate in the future. In addition, overall production costs may become prohibitively expensive and prevent us from effectively competing in price sensitive markets if future capital expenditures and costs for environmental compliance or cleanup are significantly greater than expected.\nIn addition, many of our key suppliers are subject to environmental laws and regulations that may affect their costs of production resulting in an increase in the price of the products that we purchase from them. Application of existing and new environmental laws and regulations to us and/or our key suppliers may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nOur operations are subject to a variety of laws that regulate the protection of the health and safety of our employees, and changes in health and safety regulation could result in significant costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nWe are subject to various foreign, federal and state laws that regulate the protection of the health and safety of our workers. Changes in existing laws, possible future laws and regulations or more restrictive interpretations of current laws and regulations by governmental authorities, could cause additional expense, capital expenditures or impose restrictions on our operations. For example, we are subject to the requirements of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\u201cOSHA\u201d). On January 9, 2017, OSHA published a new standard for workplace exposure to beryllium, contained in alumina. The new standard would, among other things, lower the permissible exposure limits and establish new requirements for respiratory protection, personal protective clothing and equipment, medical surveillance, hazard communication, and recordkeeping, among others. Companies are required to comply with various elements of the new standard between March 2018 and March 2020; however, we filed a petition with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit to review the final rule and entered into negotiations with OSHA regarding certain changes to the rule and its application to us. In September 2020, we reached an agreement with OSHA resolving this litigation and addressing all issues related to compliance with the beryllium standard. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations that regulate the protection of the health and safety of our workers, including the beryllium standard, may result in enforcement actions, including orders issued by regulatory or judicial authorities causing operations to cease or be curtailed, which may require corrective measures including capital expenditures, installation of additional equipment or remedial actions. Any such penalties, fines, sanctions or shutdowns could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nChanges in trade laws or regulation may have an adverse effect on our sales margins and profitability.\nOur businesses compete in a global marketplace and are subject to international and national trade laws and regulations. The breadth of these laws and regulations continues to expand. For example, both the European Union and the U.S. impose\nimport tariffs on primary aluminum from certain foreign producers. Our Icelandic and U.S. businesses are currently able to access these respective markets duty-free. Any change to these import duties, including the granting of exemptions, a reduction in the tariff rate or a full repeal of the tariff scheme, could lessen or potentially eliminate the benefit we realize from these tariffs and could negatively impact our profitability. These or other changes in trade laws and regulations could affect the ultimate price we receive for our products, the prices and availability of our raw materials or our ability to access certain markets and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nWe are subject to litigation and may be subject to additional litigation in the future.\nWe are currently, and may in the future become, subject to litigation, arbitration or other legal proceedings with other parties. The outcome of such matters is often difficult to assess or quantify and the cost to defend future proceedings may be significant. If decided adversely to us, these legal proceedings, or others that could be brought against us in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows and results of operations. Furthermore, to the extent we sell or reduce our interest in certain assets, we may give representations and warranties and indemnities for such transactions and we may agree to retain responsibility for certain liabilities related to the period prior to the sale. As a result, we may incur liabilities in the future associated with assets we no longer own or in which we have a reduced interest. For a more detailed discussion of pending litigation, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings and Note 15. Commitments and Contingencies to the consolidated financial statements included herein.\nIn the event of a dispute arising at our foreign operations, we may be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts or arbitral panels, or may not be successful in subjecting foreign persons to the jurisdiction of courts or arbitral panels in the United States. Our inability to enforce our rights and the enforcement of rights on a prejudicial basis by foreign courts or arbitral panels could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.\nOur ability to utilize certain net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income may be significantly limited if we experience an \"ownership change\" under the Internal Revenue Code.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $1,572.9 million which could offset future taxable income. Our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets to offset future federal taxable income may be significantly limited if we experience an \"ownership change\" as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \"Code\"). In general, an ownership change would occur if our \"five-percent shareholders,\" as defined under the Code, collectively increase their ownership in us by more than fifty percentage points over a rolling three-year period. Future transactions in our stock that may not be in our control may cause us to experience such an ownership change and thus limit our ability to utilize net operating losses, tax credits and other tax assets to offset future taxable income.\nRisks Related to Acquisitions\nAcquisitions could disrupt our operations and harm our operating results.\nWe have a history of making acquisitions and we expect to opportunistically seek to make acquisitions in the future. We are subject to numerous risks as a result of our acquisition strategy, including the following:\n\u2022we may spend time and money pursuing acquisitions that do not close;\n\u2022acquired companies may have contingent or unidentified liabilities;\n\u2022it may be challenging for us to manage our existing business as we integrate acquired operations; and\n\u2022we may not achieve the anticipated benefits from our acquisitions.\nWe are subject to numerous risks following the consummation of any acquisition, including, for example, that we may incur costs and expenses associated with any unidentified or potential liabilities, we may not achieve anticipated revenue and cost benefits from the acquisitions and unforeseen difficulties may arise in integrating the acquired operations into our existing operations. Accordingly, our past or future acquisitions might not ultimately improve our competitive position and business\nprospects as anticipated and may subject us to additional liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nRisks Related to Stock Ownership in the Company\nGlencore may exercise substantial influence over us, and they may have interests that differ from those of our other stockholders.\nGlencore beneficially owns approximately 42.9% of our outstanding common stock and all of our outstanding Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. In addition, one of our five directors is a Glencore employee. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we derived approximately 64% of our consolidated sales from Glencore and we expect to sell a significant portion of our production to Glencore in 2021. Century and Glencore enter into various transactions from time to time such as the purchase and sale of primary aluminum, purchase and sale of alumina, tolling agreements as well as forward financial contracts and borrowing and other debt transactions. Because of the interests described above, Glencore may have substantial influence over our business, and, to the extent of their ownership of our common stock, on the outcome of any matters submitted to our stockholders for approval.\nIn addition, certain decisions concerning our operations or financial structure may present conflicts of interest between Glencore and our other stockholders. For example, Glencore may in the future engage in a wide variety of activities in our industry that may result in conflicts of interest with respect to matters affecting us. Glencore may also make investments in businesses that directly or indirectly compete with us, or may pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us.", "PERMNO": 83244, "SIC": 3350, "TIC": "CENX"}
