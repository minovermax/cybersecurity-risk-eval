RISK FACTORS\nRisk Factors\nThe following are certain risk factors that affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Many of these risks are beyond our control. These risk factors are not exhaustive and investors are encouraged to perform their own investigation with respect to our business, financial condition and prospects. You should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this Annual Report, including matters addressed under \u201cCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d If any of the events described below were to actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected and our results could differ materially from expected and historical results, any of which may also adversely affect the holders of our Class A common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nSubstantially all of our revenues are derived from royalty payments that are based on the price at which oil, natural gas and NGLs produced from the acreage underlying our interests are sold. Prices of oil, natural gas and NGLs are volatile due to factors beyond our control. A substantial or extended decline in commodity prices may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur revenues, operating results, free cash flow and the carrying value of our mineral and royalty interests depend significantly upon the prevailing prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs. Historically, oil, natural gas and NGL prices have been volatile and are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply and demand, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nthe domestic and foreign supply of and demand for oil, natural gas and NGLs;\n\u2022\nmarket expectations about future prices of oil, natural gas and NGLs;\n\u2022\nthe level of global oil, natural gas and NGL exploration and production;\n\u2022\nthe cost of exploring for, developing, producing and delivering oil, natural gas and NGLs;\n\u2022\nthe price and quantity of foreign imports and U.S. exports of oil, natural gas and NGLs;\n\u2022\nthe level of U.S. domestic production;\n\u2022\npolitical and economic conditions in oil producing regions, including the Middle East, Africa, South America and Russia;\n\u2022\nthe ability of members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (\u201cOPEC\u201d) to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls;\n\u2022\ntrading in oil, natural gas and NGL derivative contracts;\n\u2022\nthe level of consumer product demand;\n\u2022\nweather conditions and natural disasters;\n\u2022\ntechnological advances affecting energy consumption, energy storage and energy supply;\n\u2022\ndomestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes;\n\u2022\nthe continued threat of terrorism and the impact of military and other action, including U.S. military operations in the Middle East and economic sanctions such as those imposed by the U.S. on oil and gas exports from Iran;\n\u2022\nglobal or national health concerns, including health epidemics such as the coronavirus outbreak at the beginning of 2020;\n\u2022\nthe proximity, cost, availability and capacity of oil, natural gas and NGL pipelines and other transportation facilities;\n\u2022\nthe price and availability of alternative fuels; and\n\u2022\noverall domestic and global economic conditions.\nThese factors and the volatility of the energy markets make it extremely difficult to predict future oil, natural gas and NGL price movements with any certainty. For example, during the past five years, the posted price for West Texas Intermediary (\u201cWTI\u201d) light sweet crude oil has ranged from a low of $26.19 per barrel in February 2016 to a high of $77.41 per barrel in June 2018, and the Henry Hub spot market price of natural gas has ranged from a low of $1.49 per MMBtu in March 2016 to a high of $6.24 per MMBtu in January 2018.\nAny substantial decline in the price of oil, natural gas and NGLs or prolonged period of low commodity prices will materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and free cash flow. In addition, lower oil, natural gas and NGL prices may reduce the amount of oil, natural gas and NGLs that can be produced economically by our operators, which may reduce our operators\u2019 willingness to develop our properties. This may result in our having to make substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved, probable or possible reserves, which could negatively impact our borrowing base and our ability to fund our operations. If this occurs or if production estimates change or exploration or development results deteriorate, the full cost method of accounting principles may require us to write down, as a non-cash charge to earnings, the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties. Our operators could also determine during periods of low commodity prices to shut in or curtail production from wells on our properties. In addition, they could determine during periods of low commodity prices to plug and abandon marginal wells that otherwise may have been allowed to continue to produce for a longer period under conditions of higher prices. Specifically, they may abandon any well if they reasonably believe that the well can no longer produce oil, natural gas or NGLs in commercially paying quantities.\nWe depend on various unaffiliated operators for all of the exploration, development and production on the properties underlying our mineral and royalty interests. Substantially all of our revenue is derived from royalty payments made by these operators. A reduction in the expected number of wells to be drilled on our acreage by these operators or the failure of our operators to adequately and efficiently develop and operate our acreage could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. In particular, a number of our operators have announced a reduction in projected capital expenditures for 2020. The number of new wells drilled in certain of our focus areas has recently decreased, particularly in the STACK play in Oklahoma, and such slower development pace may continue in the future.\nOur assets consist of mineral and royalty interests. Because we depend on third-party operators for all of the exploration, development and production on our properties, we have little to no control over the operations related to our properties. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we received revenues from over 100 operators with approximately 61% coming from the top ten operators on our properties. The failure of our operators to adequately or efficiently perform operations or an operator\u2019s failure to act in ways that are in our best interests could reduce production and revenues. Furthermore, our operators may reduce capital\nexpenditures devoted to exploration, development and production on our properties, which could negatively impact revenues we receive. In particular, due in part to demand from certain investors for energy companies to exercise capital discipline by reducing capital expenditures, a number of our operators have announced a reduction in projected capital expenditures for 2020. The number of new wells drilled in certain of our focus areas has recently decreased, particularly in the STACK play in Oklahoma, and such slower development pace may continue in the future. Moreover, over the last year, many of our operators have announced that they plan to drill fewer wells per section than previously anticipated, due in part to greater well-interference between parent and child wells than previously anticipated and an increased focus on overall field economics in a low commodity price environment.\nIf production on our mineral and royalty interests decreases due to decreased development activities, as a result of the low commodity price environment, limited development capital available, production-related difficulties or otherwise, our results of operations may be adversely affected. Our operators are often not obligated to undertake any development activities other than those required to maintain their leases on our acreage. In the absence of a specific contractual obligation, any development and production activities will be subject to their reasonable discretion (subject to certain implied obligations to develop imposed by the laws of some states). Our operators could determine to drill and complete fewer wells on our acreage than is currently expected. The success and timing of drilling and development activities on our properties, and whether the operators elect to drill any additional wells on our acreage, depends on a number of factors that are largely outside of our control, including:\n\u2022\nthe capital costs required for drilling activities by our operators, which could be significantly more than anticipated;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our operators to access capital;\n\u2022\nprevailing commodity prices;\n\u2022\nthe availability of suitable drilling equipment, production and transportation infrastructure and qualified operating personnel;\n\u2022\nthe operators\u2019 expertise, operating efficiency and financial resources;\n\u2022\napproval of other participants in drilling wells;\n\u2022\nthe operators\u2019 expected return on investment in wells drilled on our acreage as compared to opportunities in other areas;\n\u2022\nthe selection of technology;\n\u2022\nthe selection of counterparties for the marketing and sale of production; and\n\u2022\nthe rate of production of the reserves.\nThe operators may elect not to undertake development activities, or may undertake these activities in an unanticipated fashion, which may result in significant fluctuations in our results of operations and free cash flow. Sustained reductions in production by the operators on our properties may also adversely affect our results of operations and free cash flow. Additionally, if an operator were to experience financial difficulty, the operator might not be able to pay its royalty payments or continue its operations, which could have a material adverse impact on us.\nOur failure to successfully identify, complete and integrate acquisitions could adversely affect our growth and results of operations.\nWe depend partly on acquisitions to grow our reserves, production and free cash flow. Our decision to acquire a property will depend in part on the evaluation of data obtained from production reports and engineering studies, geophysical and geological analyses and seismic data, and other information, the results of which are often inconclusive and subject to various interpretations. The successful acquisition of properties requires an assessment of several factors, including:\n\u2022\nrecoverable reserves;\n\u2022\nfuture oil, natural gas and NGL prices and their applicable differentials;\n\u2022\ndevelopment plans;\n\u2022\nthe operating costs our operators would incur to develop and operate the properties; and\n\u2022\npotential environmental and other liabilities that operators of the properties may incur.\nThe accuracy of these assessments is inherently uncertain and we may not be able to identify attractive acquisition opportunities. In connection with these assessments, we perform a review of the subject properties that we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices, given the nature of our interests. Our review will not reveal all existing or potential problems nor will it permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to assess fully their deficiencies and capabilities. Even if\nwe do identify attractive acquisition opportunities, we may not be able to complete the acquisition or do so on commercially acceptable terms.\nThere is intense competition for acquisition opportunities in our industry. Competition for acquisitions may increase the cost of, or cause us to refrain from, completing acquisitions. Our ability to complete acquisitions is dependent upon, among other things, our ability to obtain debt and equity financing. In addition, these acquisitions may be in geographic regions in which we do not currently hold properties, which could subject us to additional and unfamiliar legal and regulatory requirements. Further, the success of any completed acquisition will depend on our ability to integrate effectively the acquired assets into our existing operations. The process of integrating acquired assets may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of our managerial and financial resources.\nNo assurance can be given that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities, negotiate acceptable terms, obtain financing for acquisitions on acceptable terms or successfully acquire identified targets. Our failure to achieve consolidation savings, to integrate the acquired businesses and assets into our existing operations successfully or to minimize any unforeseen operational difficulties could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and free cash flow. The inability to effectively manage the integration of acquisitions could reduce our focus on subsequent acquisitions and current operations, which, in turn, could negatively impact our growth, results of operations and free cash flow.\nAny acquisitions of additional mineral and royalty interests that we complete will be subject to substantial risks.\nEven if we do make acquisitions that we believe will increase our cash generated from operations, any acquisition involves potential risks, including, among other things:\n\u2022\nthe validity of our assumptions about estimated proved, probable and possible reserves, future production, prices, revenues, capital expenditures, the operating expenses and costs our operators would incur to develop the minerals;\n\u2022\na decrease in our liquidity by using a significant portion of our cash generated from operations or borrowing capacity to finance acquisitions;\n\u2022\na significant increase in our interest expense or financial leverage if we incur debt to finance acquisitions;\n\u2022\nthe assumption of unknown liabilities, losses or costs for which we are not indemnified or for which any indemnity we receive is inadequate;\n\u2022\nmistaken assumptions about the overall cost of equity or debt;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain satisfactory title to the assets we acquire;\n\u2022\nan inability to hire, train or retain qualified personnel to manage and operate our growing business and assets; and\n\u2022\nthe occurrence of other significant changes, such as impairment of oil and natural gas properties, goodwill or other intangible assets, asset devaluation or restructuring charges.\nOur operators\u2019 identified potential drilling locations are susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of their drilling.\nThe ability of our operators to drill and develop identified potential drilling locations depends on a number of uncertainties, including the availability of capital, construction of and limitations on access to infrastructure, inclement weather, regulatory changes and approvals, oil, natural gas and NGL prices, costs, drilling results and the availability of water. Further, our operators\u2019 identified potential drilling locations are in various stages of evaluation, ranging from locations that are ready to drill to locations that will require substantial additional interpretation. The use of technologies and the study of producing fields in the same area will not enable our operators to know conclusively prior to drilling whether oil, natural gas or NGLs will be present or, if present, whether oil, natural gas or NGLs will be present in sufficient quantities to be economically viable. Even if sufficient amounts of oil or natural gas exist, our operators may damage the potentially productive hydrocarbon-bearing formation or experience mechanical difficulties while drilling or completing the well, possibly resulting in a reduction in production from the well or abandonment of the well. If our operators drill additional wells that they identify as dry holes in current and future drilling locations, their drilling success rate may decline and materially harm their business as well as ours.\nWe cannot assure you that the analogies our operators draw from available data from the wells on our acreage, more fully explored locations or producing fields will be applicable to their drilling locations. Further, initial production rates reported by our or other operators in the areas in which our reserves are located may not be indicative of future or long-term production rates. Additionally, actual production from wells may be less than expected. For example, a number of operators have recently announced that newer wells drilled close in proximity to already producing wells have produced less oil and gas than forecast. Because of\nthese uncertainties, we do not know if the potential drilling locations our operators have identified will ever be drilled or if our operators will be able to produce oil, natural gas or NGLs from these or any other potential drilling locations. As such, the actual drilling activities of our operators may materially differ from those presently identified, which could adversely affect our business, results of operation and free cash flow.\nFinally, the potential drilling locations we have identified are based on the geologic and other data available to us and our interpretation of such data. As a result, our operators may have reached different conclusions about the potential drilling locations on our properties, and our operators control the ultimate decision as to where and when a well is drilled.\nWe may experience delays in the payment of royalties and be unable to replace operators that do not make required royalty payments, and we may not be able to terminate our leases with defaulting lessees if any of the operators on those leases declare bankruptcy.\nA failure on the part of the operators to make royalty payments gives us the right to terminate the lease, repossess the property and enforce payment obligations under the lease. If we repossessed any of our properties, we would seek a replacement operator. However, we might not be able to find a replacement operator and, if we did, we might not be able to enter into a new lease on favorable terms within a reasonable period of time. In addition, the outgoing operator could be subject to a proceeding under Title 11 of the United States Code (the \u201cBankruptcy Code\u201d), in which case our right to enforce or terminate the lease for any defaults, including non-payment, may be substantially delayed or otherwise impaired. In general, in a proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code, the bankrupt operator would have a substantial period of time to decide whether to ultimately reject or assume the lease, which could prevent the execution of a new lease or the assignment of the existing lease to another operator. In the event that the operator rejected the lease, our ability to collect amounts owed would be substantially delayed, and our ultimate recovery may be only a fraction of the amount owed or nothing. In addition, if we are able to enter into a new lease with a new operator, the replacement operator may not achieve the same levels of production or sell oil or natural gas at the same price as the operator it replaced.\nAcquisitions and our operators\u2019 development activities of our leases will require substantial capital, and we and our operators may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms or at all.\nThe oil and natural gas industry is capital intensive. We make and expect to continue to make substantial capital expenditures in connection with the acquisition of mineral and royalty interests. To date, we have financed capital expenditures primarily with funding from capital contributions, cash generated by operations, proceeds from our IPO and from the December 2019 Offering and borrowings under our debt arrangements.\nIn the future, we may need capital in excess of the amounts we retain in our business or borrow under our revolving credit facility. We cannot assure you that we will be able to access external capital on terms favorable to us or at all. If we are unable to fund our capital requirements, we may be unable to complete acquisitions, take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation and free cash flow.\nMost of our operators are also dependent on the availability of external debt and equity financing sources to maintain their drilling programs. If those financing sources are not available to the operators on favorable terms or at all, then we expect the development of our properties to be adversely affected. If the development of our properties is adversely affected, then revenues from our mineral and royalty interests may decline.\nOur future success depends on replacing reserves through acquisitions and the exploration and development activities of the operators of our properties. Unless we replace the oil, natural gas and NGLs produced from our properties, our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected.\nProducing oil and natural gas wells are characterized by declining production rates that vary depending upon reservoir characteristics and other factors. Our future oil, natural gas and NGL reserves and our operators\u2019 production thereof and our free cash flow are highly dependent on the successful development and exploitation of our current reserves and our ability to successfully acquire additional reserves that are economically recoverable. Moreover, the production decline rates of our properties may be significantly higher than currently estimated if the wells on our properties do not produce as expected. We may also not be able to find, acquire or develop additional reserves to replace the current and future production of our properties at economically acceptable terms. Aside from acquisitions, we have little to no control over the exploration and development of our properties. If we are not able to replace or grow our oil, natural gas and NGL reserves, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nWe have little to no control over the timing of future drilling with respect to our mineral and royalty interests.\nAs of December 31, 2019, only 17,957 MBoe of our total estimated reserves were proved developed reserves. The remaining 15,131 MBoe, 36,993 MBoe and 22,521 MBoe of our total estimated reserves as of December 31, 2019 were PUDs, probable undeveloped reserves and possible undeveloped reserves, respectively, and may not ultimately be developed or produced by the operators of our properties. Recovery of undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations, and the decision to pursue development of an undeveloped drilling location will be made by the operator and not by us. We generally do not have access to the estimated costs of development of these reserves or the scheduled development plans of our operators. The reserve data included in the reserve report of CG&A assumes that substantial capital expenditures are required to develop the reserves. We cannot be certain that the estimated costs of the development of these reserves are accurate, that development will occur as scheduled or that the results of the development will be as estimated. Delays in the development of our reserves, increases in costs to drill and develop our reserves or decreases in commodity prices will reduce the future net revenues of our estimated undeveloped reserves and may result in some projects becoming uneconomical. In addition, delays in the development of reserves could force us to reclassify certain of our proved undeveloped reserves as unproved reserves.\nProject areas on our properties, which are in various stages of development, may not yield oil, natural gas or NGLs in commercially viable quantities.\nProject areas on our properties are in various stages of development, ranging from project areas with current drilling or production activity to project areas that have limited drilling or production history. If the wells in the process of being completed do not produce sufficient revenues or if dry holes are drilled, our financial condition, results of operations and free cash flow may be adversely affected.\nThe unavailability, high cost or shortages of rigs, equipment, raw materials, supplies or personnel may restrict or result in increased costs for operators related to developing and operating our properties.\nThe oil and natural gas industry is cyclical, which can result in shortages of drilling rigs, equipment, raw materials (particularly water and sand and other proppants), supplies and personnel. When shortages occur, the costs and delivery times of rigs, equipment and supplies increase and demand for, and wage rates of, qualified drilling rig crews also rise with increases in demand. We cannot predict whether these conditions will exist in the future and, if so, what their timing and duration will be. In accordance with customary industry practice, our operators rely on independent third-party service providers to provide many of the services and equipment necessary to drill new wells. If our operators are unable to secure a sufficient number of drilling rigs at reasonable costs, our financial condition and results of operations could suffer. Shortages of drilling rigs, equipment, raw materials, supplies, personnel, trucking services, tubulars, fracking and completion services and production equipment could delay or restrict our operators\u2019 exploration and development operations, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and free cash flow.\nThe marketability of oil, natural gas and NGL production is dependent upon transportation, pipelines and refining facilities, which neither we nor many of our operators' control. Any limitation in the availability of those facilities could interfere with our or our operators\u2019 ability to market our or our operators\u2019 production and could harm our business.\nThe marketability of our or our operators\u2019 production depends in part on the availability, proximity and capacity of pipelines, tanker trucks and other transportation methods, and processing and refining facilities owned by third parties. The amount of oil that can be produced and sold is subject to curtailment in certain circumstances, such as pipeline interruptions due to scheduled and unscheduled maintenance, excessive pressure, physical damage or lack of available capacity on these systems, tanker truck availability and extreme weather conditions. Also, production from our wells may be insufficient to support the construction of pipeline facilities, and the shipment of our or our operators\u2019 oil, natural gas and NGLs on third-party pipelines may be curtailed or delayed if it does not meet the quality specifications of the pipeline owners. The curtailments arising from these and similar circumstances may last from a few days to several months. In many cases, we or our operators are provided only with limited, if any, notice as to when these circumstances will arise and their duration. Any significant curtailment in gathering system or transportation, processing or refining-facility capacity could reduce our or our operators\u2019 ability to market the production from our properties and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and free cash flow. Our or our operators\u2019 access to transportation options and the prices we or our operators receive can also be affected by federal and state regulation-including regulation of oil, natural gas and NGL production, transportation and pipeline safety-as well by general economic conditions and changes in supply and demand. In addition, the third parties on whom we or our operators rely for transportation services are subject to complex federal, state, tribal and local laws that could adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of conducting our business.\nOur derivative activities could result in financial losses and reduce earnings.\nFrom time to time in the past we have used, and in the future we may use, derivative instruments for a portion of our future oil, natural gas and NGL production, including fixed price swaps, collars and basis swaps, to mitigate the risk and resulting impact of commodity price volatility. However, these hedging activities may not be as effective as we intend in reducing the volatility of our cash flows and, if entered into, are subject to the risks that the terms of the derivative instruments will be imperfect, a counterparty may not perform its obligations under a derivative contract, there may be a change in the expected differential between the underlying commodity price in the derivative instrument and the actual price received, our hedging policies and procedures may not be properly followed and the steps we take to monitor our derivative financial instruments may not detect and prevent violations of our risk management policies and procedures, particularly if deception or other intentional misconduct is involved. Further, we may be limited in receiving the full benefit of increases in oil, natural gas and NGL prices as a result of these hedging transactions. The occurrence of any of these risks could prevent us from realizing the benefit of a derivative contract. Further, our hedging activities are not likely to mitigate the entire exposure of our operations to commodity price volatility. To the extent we do not hedge against commodity price volatility, or our hedges are not effective, our results of operations and financial position may be diminished.\nOur estimated reserves are based on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate. Any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves.\nOil, natural gas and NGL reserve engineering is not an exact science and requires subjective estimates of underground accumulations of oil, natural gas and NGLs and assumptions concerning future oil, natural gas and NGL prices, production levels, ultimate recoveries and operating and development costs. As a result, estimated quantities of proved, probable and possible reserves, projections of future production rates and the timing of development expenditures may be incorrect. Our estimates of proved, probable and possible reserves and related valuations as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 were audited by CG&A and our estimates of proved, probable, and possible reserves and related valuations as of December 31, 2017 were prepared by CG&A. CG&A conducted a detailed review of all of our properties for the period covered by its reserve report using information provided by us. Over time, we may make material changes to reserve estimates taking into account the results of actual drilling, testing and production. For example, in connection with the restatement of our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, we also elected to revise our previously reported reserves as of June 30, 2018 in order to properly account for our ownership interests in certain of our properties where there were title discrepancies and calculation errors within our internal reserves tracking software. In addition, certain assumptions regarding future oil, natural gas and NGL prices, production levels and operating and development costs may prove incorrect. A substantial portion of our reserve estimates are made without the benefit of a lengthy production history, which are less reliable than estimates based on a lengthy production history. Any significant variance from these assumptions to actual figures could greatly affect our estimates of reserves and future cash generated from operations. Numerous changes over time to the assumptions on which our reserve estimates are based, as described above, often result in the actual quantities of oil, natural gas and NGLs that are ultimately recovered being different from our reserve estimates.\nFurthermore, the present value of future net cash flows from our proved reserves is not necessarily the same as the current market value of our estimated reserves. In accordance with rules established by the SEC and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the \u201cFASB\u201d), we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on the twelve- month average oil and gas index prices, calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average for the first-day-of-the-month price for each month, and costs in effect on the date of the estimate, holding the prices and costs constant throughout the life of the properties. Actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the present value estimate, and future net present value estimates using then current prices and costs may be significantly less than the current estimate. In addition, the 10% discount factor we use when calculating discounted future net cash flows may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and natural gas industry in general.\nSEC rules could limit our ability to book additional proved undeveloped reserves in the future.\nSEC rules require that, subject to limited exceptions, proved undeveloped reserves may only be booked if they relate to wells scheduled to be drilled within five years after the date of booking. This requirement has limited and may continue to limit our ability to book additional proved undeveloped reserves as the operators of our properties pursue their drilling programs. Moreover, we may be required to write down our proved undeveloped reserves if those wells are not drilled within the required five-year timeframe. Furthermore, we typically do not have access to the drilling schedules of our operators and make our determinations about their estimated drilling schedules from any development provisions in the relevant lease agreement and the historical drilling activity, rig locations, production data and permit trends, as well as investor presentations and other public statements of our operators. Although we believe that our approach in making such determinations is conservative, the accuracy of any such determination is inherently uncertain and subject to a number of assumptions and factors outside of our control,\nincluding but not limited to those described under \u201c-We depend on various unaffiliated operators for all of the exploration, development and production on the properties underlying our mineral and royalty interests. Substantially all of our revenue is derived from royalty payments made by these operators. A reduction in the expected number of wells to be drilled on our acreage by these operators or the failure of our operators to adequately and efficiently develop and operate our acreage could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. In particular, a number of our operators have announced a reduction in projected capital expenditures for 2020. The number of new wells drilled in certain of our focus areas has recently decreased, particularly in the STACK play in Oklahoma, and such slower development pace may continue in the future.\u201d Any significant variance between our estimates and the actual drilling schedules of our operators may require us to write down our proved undeveloped reserves.\nIf oil, natural gas and NGL prices decline to near or below the low levels experienced in 2015 and 2016, we could be required to record impairments of our proved oil, natural gas and NGL properties that would constitute a charge to earnings and reduce our shareholders\u2019 equity.\nAccounting rules require that we review the carrying value of our oil, natural gas and NGL properties for possible impairment at the end of each quarter. Based on specific market factors and circumstances at the time of prospective impairment reviews, and the continuing evaluation of development activities, production data, economics and other factors, we may be required to write down the carrying value of our properties. The net capitalized costs of our proved oil, natural gas and NGL properties are subject to a full cost ceiling limitation for which the costs are not allowed to exceed their related estimated future net revenues discounted at 10%. To the extent capitalized costs of evaluated properties, net of accumulated depreciation, depletion, amortization and impairment, exceed estimated discounted future net revenues of our proved oil, natural gas and NGL reserves, the excess capitalized costs are charged to expense. The risk that we will be required to recognize impairments of our oil, natural gas and NGL properties increases during periods of low commodity prices. In addition, impairments would occur if we were to experience sufficient downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves or the present value of estimated future net revenues. An impairment recognized in one period may not be reversed in a subsequent period even if higher oil, natural gas and NGL prices increase the cost center ceiling applicable to the subsequent period. If we incur impairment charges in the future, our results of operations for the periods in which such charges are taken may be materially and adversely affected.\nConservation measures, technological advances and general concern about the environmental impact of the production and use of fossil fuels could materially reduce demand for oil, natural gas and NGLs and adversely affect our results of operations and the trading market for shares of our Class A common stock.\nFuel conservation measures, alternative fuel requirements, increasing consumer demand for alternatives to oil, natural gas and NGLs, technological advances in fuel economy and energy-generation devices could reduce demand for oil, natural gas and NGLs. The impact of the changing demand for oil, natural gas and NGL services and products may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and free cash flow.\nIt is also possible that the concerns about the production and use of fossil fuels will reduce the number of investors willing to own shares of our Class A common stock, adversely affecting the market price of our Class A common stock. For example, certain segments of the investor community have developed negative sentiment towards investing in our industry. Recent equity returns in the sector versus other industry sectors have led to lower oil and gas representation in certain key equity market indices. In addition, some investors, including investment advisors and certain sovereign wealth, pension funds, university endowments and family foundations, have stated policies to disinvest in the oil and gas sector based on their social and environmental considerations. Certain other stakeholders have also pressured commercial and investment banks to stop financing oil and gas and related infrastructure projects. Such developments, including environmental activism and initiatives aimed at limiting climate change and reducing air pollution, could result in downward pressure on the stock prices of oil and gas companies, including ours.\nWe rely on a few key individuals whose absence or loss could adversely affect our business.\nMany key responsibilities within our business have been assigned to a small number of individuals. We rely on our founders for their knowledge of the oil and natural gas industry, relationships within the industry and experience in identifying, evaluating and completing acquisitions. The loss of their services could adversely affect our business. In particular, the loss of the services of one or more members of our executive team could disrupt our business. Further, we do not maintain \u201ckey person\u201d life insurance policies on any of our executive team or other key personnel. As a result, we are not insured against any losses resulting from the death of these key individuals.\nThe results of exploratory drilling in shale plays will be subject to risks associated with drilling and completion techniques and drilling results may not meet our expectations for reserves or production.\nOur operators use the latest drilling and completion techniques in their operations, and these techniques come with inherent risks. When drilling horizontal wells, operators risk not landing the well bore in the desired drilling zone and straying from the desired drilling zone. When drilling horizontally through a formation, operators risk being unable to run casing through the entire length of the well bore and being unable to run tools and other equipment consistently through the horizontal well bore. Risks that\nour operators face while completing wells include being unable to fracture stimulate the planned number of stages, to run tools the entire length of the well bore during completion operations and to clean out the well bore after completion of the final fracture stimulation stage. In addition, to the extent our operators engage in horizontal drilling, those activities may adversely affect their ability to successfully drill in identified vertical drilling locations. Furthermore, certain of the new techniques that our operators may adopt, such as infill drilling and multi-well pad drilling, may cause irregularities or interruptions in production due to, in the case of infill drilling, offset wells being shut in and, in the case of multi-well pad drilling, the time required to drill and complete multiple wells before these wells begin producing. The results of drilling in new or emerging formations are more uncertain initially than drilling results in areas that are more developed and have a longer history of established production. Newer or emerging formations and areas often have limited or no production history and consequently our operators will be less able to predict future drilling results in these areas.\nUltimately, the success of these drilling and completion techniques can only be evaluated over time as more wells are drilled and production profiles are established over a sufficiently long time period. If our operators\u2019 drilling results are weaker than anticipated or they are unable to execute their drilling program on our properties, our operating and financial results in these areas may be lower than we anticipate. Further, as a result of any of these developments we could incur material write-downs of our oil and natural gas properties and the value of our undeveloped acreage could decline, and our results of operations and free cash flow could be adversely affected.\nAcreage must be drilled before lease expiration, generally within three to five years, in order to hold the acreage by production. Our operators\u2019 failure to drill sufficient wells to hold acreage may result in the deferral of prospective drilling opportunities. In addition, our ORRIs may be lost if the underlying acreage is not drilled before the expiration of the applicable lease or if the lease otherwise terminates.\nLeases on oil and natural gas properties typically have a term of three to five years, after which they expire unless, prior to expiration, production is established within the spacing units covering the undeveloped acres. In addition, even if production or drilling is established during such primary term, if production or drilling ceases on the leased property, the lease typically terminates, subject to certain exceptions.\nAny reduction in our operators\u2019 drilling programs, either through a reduction in capital expenditures or the unavailability of drilling rigs, could result in the expiration of existing leases. If the lease governing any of our mineral interests expires or terminates, all mineral rights revert back to us and we will have to seek new lessees to explore and develop such mineral interests. If the lease underlying any of our ORRIs expires or terminates, our ORRIs that are derived from such lease will also terminate. Any such expirations or terminations of our leases or our ORRIs could materially and adversely affect the growth of our financial condition, results of operations and free cash flow.\nDrilling for and producing oil, natural gas and NGLs are high-risk activities with many uncertainties that may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe drilling activities of the operators of our properties will be subject to many risks. For example, we will not be able to assure our shareholders that wells drilled by the operators of our properties will be productive. Drilling for oil, natural gas and NGLs often involves unprofitable efforts, not only from dry wells but also from wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient oil, natural gas or NGLs to return a profit at then realized prices after deducting drilling, operating and other costs. The seismic data and other technologies used do not provide conclusive knowledge prior to drilling a well that oil, natural gas or NGL is present or that it can be produced economically. The costs of exploration, exploitation and development activities are subject to numerous uncertainties beyond our control and increases in those costs can adversely affect the economics of a project. Further, our operators\u2019 drilling and producing operations may be curtailed, delayed, canceled or otherwise negatively impacted as a result of other factors, including:\n\u2022\nunusual or unexpected geological formations;\n\u2022\nloss of drilling fluid circulation;\n\u2022\ntitle problems;\n\u2022\nfacility or equipment malfunctions;\n\u2022\nunexpected operational events;\n\u2022\nshortages or delivery delays of equipment and services;\n\u2022\ncompliance with environmental and other governmental requirements; and\n\u2022\nadverse weather conditions.\nAny of these risks can cause substantial losses, including personal injury or loss of life, damage to or destruction of property, natural resources and equipment, pollution, environmental contamination or loss of wells and other regulatory penalties. In the event that planned operations, including the drilling of development wells, are delayed or cancelled, or existing wells or development wells have lower than anticipated production due to one or more of the factors above or for any other reason, our financial condition, results of operations and free cash flow may be materially adversely affected.\nOil, natural gas and NGL operations are subject to various governmental laws and regulations. Compliance with these laws and regulations can be burdensome and expensive for our operators, and failure to comply could result in our operators incurring significant liabilities, either of which may impact our operators\u2019 willingness to develop our interests.\nOur operators\u2019 operations on the properties in which we hold interests are subject to various federal, state and local governmental regulations that may change from time to time in response to economic and political conditions. Matters subject to regulation include drilling operations, production and distribution activities, discharges or releases of pollutants or wastes, plugging and abandonment of wells, maintenance and decommissioning of other facilities, the spacing of wells, unitization and pooling of properties and taxation. From time to time, regulatory agencies have imposed price controls and limitations on production by restricting the rate of flow of oil and natural gas wells below actual production capacity to conserve supplies of oil, natural gas and NGLs. In addition, the production, handling, storage and transportation of oil, natural gas and NGLs, as well as the remediation, emission and disposal of oil, natural gas and NGL wastes, by-products thereof and other substances and materials produced or used in connection with oil, natural gas and NGL operations are subject to regulation under federal, state and local laws and regulations primarily relating to protection of worker health and safety, natural resources and the environment. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions on our operators, including administrative, civil or criminal penalties, permit revocations, requirements for additional pollution controls and injunctions limiting or prohibiting some or all of our operators\u2019 operations on our properties. Moreover, these laws and regulations have generally imposed increasingly strict requirements related to water use and disposal, air pollution control and waste management.\nLaws and regulations governing exploration and production may also affect production levels. Our operators must comply with federal and state laws and regulations governing conservation matters, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nprovisions related to the unitization or pooling of the oil and natural gas properties;\n\u2022\nthe establishment of maximum rates of production from wells;\n\u2022\nthe spacing of wells;\n\u2022\nthe plugging and abandonment of wells; and\n\u2022\nthe removal of related production equipment.\nAdditionally, federal and state regulatory authorities may expand or alter applicable pipeline-safety laws and regulations, compliance with which may require increased capital costs for third-party oil, natural gas and NGL transporters. These transporters may attempt to pass on such costs to our operators, which in turn could affect profitability on the properties in which we own mineral and royalty interests.\nOur operators must also comply with laws and regulations prohibiting fraud and market manipulations in energy markets. To the extent the operators of our properties are shippers on interstate pipelines, they must comply with the tariffs of those pipelines and with federal policies related to the use of interstate capacity.\nOur operators may be required to make significant expenditures to comply with the governmental laws and regulations described above and may be subject to potential fines and penalties if they are found to have violated these laws and regulations. We believe the trend of more expansive and stricter environmental legislation and regulations will continue. Please read \u201cBusiness-Regulation of Environmental and Occupational Safety and Health Matters\u201d for a description of the laws and regulations that affect our operators and that may affect us. These and other potential regulations could increase the operating costs of our operators and delay production and may ultimately impact our operators\u2019 ability and willingness to develop our properties.\nFederal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in our operators incurring increased costs, additional operating restrictions or delays and fewer potential drilling locations.\nOur operators engage in hydraulic fracturing. Hydraulic fracturing is a common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons from tight formations, including shales. The process involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. Currently, hydraulic fracturing is generally\nexempt from regulation under the U.S. Safe Drinking Water Act\u2019s (\u201cSDWA\u201d) Underground Injection Control (\u201cUIC\u201d) program and is typically regulated by state oil and gas commissions or similar agencies.\nHowever, several federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process. For example, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d) has asserted regulatory authority pursuant to the SDWA\u2019s UIC program over hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel fuel in fracturing fluids and issued guidance covering such activities. In addition, in June 2016, the EPA published an effluent limit guideline final rule prohibiting the discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and gas extraction facilities to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants. Also, from time to time, legislation has been introduced, but not enacted, in Congress to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. In the event that new federal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where we own mineral or royalty interests, our operators may incur additional costs or permitting requirements to comply with such federal requirements that may be significant and that could result in added delays or curtailment in our operators\u2019 pursuit of exploration, development or production activities, which would in turn reduce the oil, natural gas and NGLs produced from our properties.\nMoreover, some states and local governments have adopted, and other governmental entities are considering adopting, regulations that could impose more stringent permitting, disclosure and well-construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations, including states in which our properties are located. For example, Texas, Colorado and North Dakota, among others, have adopted regulations that impose new or more stringent permitting, disclosure, disposal and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations. States could also elect to prohibit high volume hydraulic fracturing altogether. In addition to state laws, local land use restrictions, such as city ordinances, may restrict drilling in general and/or hydraulic fracturing in particular.\nIn December 2016, the EPA released its final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources. The final report concluded that \u201cwater cycle\u201d activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources under certain limited circumstances.\nIncreased regulation and attention given to the hydraulic fracturing process could lead to greater opposition to, and litigation concerning, oil, natural gas and NGL production activities using hydraulic fracturing techniques. Additional legislation or regulation could also lead to operational delays or increased operating costs for our operators in the production of oil, natural gas and NGLs, including from the developing shale plays, or could make it more difficult for our operators to perform hydraulic fracturing. The adoption of any federal, state or local laws or the implementation of regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing could potentially cause a decrease in our operators\u2019 completion of new oil and natural gas wells on our properties and an associated decrease in the production attributable to our interests, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nImplementation of new Colorado Senate Bill 19-181 may increase costs and limit oil and natural gas exploration and production operations in the state, which could adversely impact future production from our properties and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn April 2019, Senate Bill 19-181 was signed into law in Colorado. This bill reforms the composition of the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission (\u201cCOGCC\u201d), directs the commission to impose more stringent environmental regulations with respect to permitting new oil and gas projects and also required that COGCC study the need for stricter air pollution controls for such projects. The legislation also authorizes Colorado cities and counties to take on an increased role in regulating oil and natural gas operations within their jurisdictions, including in a manner that may be more stringent than state-level rules. The COGCC adopted the first rulemaking under Senate Bill 19-181, regarding flowlines, in November 2019, which requires flowlines be abandoned in whatever manner is \"least impactful\" in balancing a variety of risks. Hearings for rules pursuant to Senate Bill 19-181 are currently planned for the first half of 2020. Proposed regulations regarding wellbore integrity were published in December 2019, and the COGCC is expected to publish final rules sometime during the first quarter of 2020. The COGCC has also stated that it plans to promulgate regulations requiring cumulative impacts and alternative location analyses as part of applications for certain oil and gas facilities, which are expected to be proposed sometime in the first half of 2020. Some local communities have adopted additional restrictions for oil and gas activities, such as requiring greater setbacks, and other groups have sought a cessation of permit issuances entirely until the COGCC publishes new rules in keeping with SB 181. At least one lawsuit has been filed seeking a court order to such effect. Additionally, activist groups have submitted new ballot proposals for the 2020 election year, including proposals for increased drilling setbacks and increased bonding requirements. Any additional restrictions due to implementation of such measures could result in increased operational costs incurred by operators of our properties and limit operations, including due to delays in the state issuing new drilling permits, for exploration and production activities in Colorado, which could significantly impact future exploration and development activities on our properties.\nLegislation or regulatory initiatives intended to address seismic activity could restrict our operators\u2019 drilling and production activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nState and federal regulatory agencies have recently focused on a possible connection between hydraulic fracturing related activities, particularly the underground injection of wastewater into disposal wells, and the increased occurrence of seismic activity, and regulatory agencies at all levels are continuing to study the possible linkage between oil and gas activity and induced seismicity. For example, in 2015, the United States Geological Study identified eight states, including Oklahoma and Texas, with areas of increased rates of induced seismicity that could be attributed to fluid injection or oil and gas extraction.\nIn addition, a number of lawsuits have been filed, most recently in Oklahoma, alleging that disposal well operations have caused damage to neighboring properties or otherwise violated state and federal rules regulating waste disposal. In response to these concerns, regulators in some states are seeking to impose additional requirements, including requirements in the permitting of produced water disposal wells or otherwise to assess the relationship between seismicity and the use of such wells. For example, in October 2014, the Texas Railroad Commission published a new rule governing permitting or re-permitting of disposal wells that would require, among other things, the submission of information on seismic events occurring within a specified radius of the disposal well location, as well as logs, geologic cross sections and structure maps relating to the disposal area in question. If the permittee or an applicant of a disposal well permit fails to demonstrate that the produced water or other fluids are confined to the disposal zone or if scientific data indicates such a disposal well is likely to be or determined to be contributing to seismic activity, then the agency may deny, modify, suspend or terminate the permit application or existing operating permit for that well. The Texas Railroad Commission has used this authority to deny permits for waste disposal wells. In some instances, regulators may also order that disposal wells be shut in.\nThe adoption and implementation of any new laws or regulations that restrict our operators\u2019 ability to use hydraulic fracturing or dispose of produced water gathered from drilling and production activities by limiting volumes, disposal rates, disposal well locations or otherwise, or requiring them to shut down disposal wells, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRestrictions on the ability of our operators to obtain water may have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and free cash flow.\nWater is an essential component of deep shale oil, natural gas and NGL production during both the drilling and hydraulic fracturing processes. Over the past several years, parts of the country, and in particular Texas, have experienced extreme drought conditions. As a result of this severe drought, some local water districts have begun restricting the use of water subject to their jurisdiction for hydraulic fracturing to protect local water supply. If our operators are unable to obtain water to use in their operations from local sources, or if our operators are unable to effectively utilize flowback water, they may be unable to economically drill for or produce oil, natural gas and NGLs from our properties, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and free cash flow.\nOur revolving credit facility has substantial restrictions and financial covenants that may restrict our business and financing activities and our ability to declare dividends.\nThe operating and financial restrictions and covenants in our revolving credit facility restrict, and any future financing agreements likely will restrict, our ability to finance future operations or capital needs, engage, expand or pursue our business activities or pay dividends. Our revolving credit facility restricts, and any future financing agreements likely will restrict, our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur indebtedness;\n\u2022\nissue certain equity securities, including preferred equity securities;\n\u2022\nincur certain liens or permit them to exist;\n\u2022\nengage in certain fundamental changes, including mergers or consolidations;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments, loans, advances, guarantees and acquisitions;\n\u2022\nsell or transfer assets;\n\u2022\nenter into sale and leaseback transactions;\n\u2022\npay dividends to or redeem or repurchase shares from our shareholders;\n\u2022\nmake certain payments of junior indebtedness;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with our affiliates;\n\u2022\nenter into certain restrictive agreements; and\n\u2022\nenter into swap agreements and hedging arrangements.\nOur revolving credit facility restricts our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders or to repurchase shares of our Class A common stock. We also are required under our revolving credit facility to comply with, as of the most recently completed fiscal quarter, (i) a ratio of total net funded debt to consolidated EBITDA not to exceed 4.00 to 1.00, and (ii) a current ratio of not less than 1.00 to 1.00. Our ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants in the future is uncertain and will be affected by the levels of free cash flow and events or circumstances beyond our control, such as a downturn in our business or the economy in general or reduced oil, natural gas and NGL prices. If we violate any of the restrictions, covenants, ratios or tests in our revolving credit facility, a significant portion of our indebtedness may become immediately due and payable, our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders will be inhibited and our lenders\u2019 commitment to make further loans to us may terminate. We might not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient funds to make these accelerated payments. In addition, our obligations under our revolving credit facility are secured by substantially all of our assets, and if we are unable to repay our indebtedness under our revolving credit facility, the lenders can seek to foreclose on our assets.\nThe borrowings under our revolving credit facility expose us to interest rate risk.\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk associated with borrowings under the our revolving credit facility. Our revolving credit facility bears interest at a rate per annum equal to, at our option, the adjusted base rate or the adjusted LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin is based on utilization of our revolving credit facility and ranges from (a) in the case of adjusted base rate loans, 0.750% to 1.750% and (b) in the case of adjusted LIBOR rate loans, 1.750% to 2.750%. LIBOR tends to fluctuate based on multiple facts, including general short-term interest rates, rates set by the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks, the supply of and demand for credit in the London interbank market and general economic conditions. If interest rates increase, so will our interest costs, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions and results of operations.\nOn July 27, 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (the authority that regulates LIBOR) announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. It is unclear whether new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, is considering replacing U.S. dollar LIBOR with a newly created index. It is not possible to predict the effect of these changes, other reforms or the establishment of alternative reference rates in the United States or elsewhere.\nOur debt levels may limit our flexibility to obtain additional financing and pursue other business opportunities.\nOur existing and future indebtedness could have important consequences to us, including:\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain additional financing, if necessary, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other purposes may be impaired, or such financing may not be available on terms acceptable to us;\n\u2022\ncovenants in our existing and future credit and debt arrangements will require us to meet financial tests that may affect our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business, including possible acquisition opportunities;\n\u2022\nour access to the capital markets may be limited;\n\u2022\nour borrowing costs may increase;\n\u2022\nwe will need a substantial portion of our free cash flow to make principal and interest payments on our indebtedness, reducing the funds that would otherwise be available for operations, future business opportunities and payment of dividends to our shareholders; and\n\u2022\nour debt level will make us more vulnerable than our competitors with less debt to competitive pressures or a downturn in our business or the economy generally.\nOur ability to service our indebtedness will depend upon, among other things, our future financial and operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, regulatory and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. If our operating results are not sufficient to service our current or future indebtedness, we will be forced to take actions such as reducing or delaying business activities, acquisitions, investments and/or capital expenditures, selling assets,\nrestructuring or refinancing our indebtedness, or seeking additional equity capital or bankruptcy protection. We may not be able to effect any of these remedies on satisfactory terms or at all.\nA series of risks arising out of the threat of climate change could result in increased operating costs, limit the areas in which oil and natural gas production may occur, and reduce demand for the oil, natural gas and NGLs that our operators produce.\nThe threat of climate change continues to attract considerable attention in the United States and in foreign countries, numerous proposals have been made and could continue to be made at the international, national, regional, and state levels of government to monitor and limit existing emissions of GHGs as well as to restrict or eliminate such future emissions. As a result, our operations as well as the operations of our oil and natural gas exploration and production customers are subject to a series of regulatory, political, litigation, and financial risks associated with the production and processing of fossil fuels and emission of GHGs.\nIn the United States, no comprehensive climate change legislation has been implemented at the federal level. However, following the U.S. Supreme Court finding that GHG emissions constitute a pollutant under the CAA, the EPA has adopted regulations that, among other things, establish construction and operating permit reviews for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources, require the monitoring and annual reporting of GHG emissions from certain petroleum and natural gas system sources in the United States, implement New Source Performance Standards directing the reduction of methane from certain new, modified, or reconstructed facilities in the oil and natural gas sector, and together with the DOT, implementing GHG emissions limits on vehicles manufactured for operation in the United States. For example, in June 2016, the EPA finalized rules that establish new air emission controls for methane emissions from certain new, modified, or reconstructed equipment and processes in the oil and natural gas source category, including production, processing, transmission, and storage activities, otherwise known as Subpart OOOOa. Following the change in administration, there have been attempts to modify these regulations, and litigation is ongoing.\nAdditionally, various states and groups of states have adopted or are considering adopting legislation, regulation or other regulatory initiatives that are focused on such areas as GHG cap and trade programs, carbon taxes, reporting and tracking programs, and restriction of emissions. At the international level, there is an agreement, the United Nations- sponsored \"Paris Agreement,\" for nations to limit their GHG emissions through non-binding, individually-determined reduction goals every five years after 2020, although the United States has announced its withdrawal from such agreement, effective November 4, 2020.\nGovernmental, scientific, and public concern over the threat of climate change arising from GHG emissions has resulted in increasing political risks in the United States, including climate change related pledges made by certain candidates seeking the office of the President of the United States in 2020. Two critical declarations made by one or more candidates running for the Democratic nomination for President include threats to take actions banning hydraulic fracturing of oil and natural gas wells and banning new leases for production of minerals on federal properties, including onshore lands and offshore waters. Other actions that could be pursued by presidential candidates may include the imposition of more restrictive requirements for the establishment of pipeline infrastructure or the permitting of LNG export facilities, as well as, the reversal of the United Sates' withdrawal from the Paris Agreement in November 2020. Litigation risks are also increasing as a number of cities and other local governments have sought to bring suit against the largest oil and natural gas exploration and production companies in state or federal court, alleging among other things, that such companies created public nuisances by producing fuels that contributed to global warming effects, such as rising sea levels, and therefore are responsible for roadway and infrastructure damages as a result, or alleging that the companies have been aware of the adverse effects of climate change for some time but defrauded their investors by failing to adequately disclose those impacts.\nThere are also increasing financial risks for fossil fuel producers as shareholders currently invested in fossil-fuel energy companies concerned about the potential effects of climate change may elect in the future to shift some or all of their investments into non-energy related sectors. Institutional lenders who provide financing to fossil-fuel energy companies also have become more attentive to sustainable lending practices and some of them may elect not to provide funding for fossil fuel energy companies. Additionally, the lending practices of institutional lenders have been the subject of intensive lobbying efforts in recent years, oftentimes public in nature, by environmental activists, proponents of the international Paris Agreement, and foreign citizenry concerned about climate change not to provide funding for fossil fuel producers. Limitation of investments in and financing for fossil fuel energy companies could result in the restriction, delay or cancellation of drilling programs or development or production activities.\nThe adoption and implementation of new or more stringent international, federal or state legislation, regulations or other regulatory initiatives that impose more stringent standards for GHG emissions from the oil and natural gas sector or otherwise restrict the areas in which this sector may produce oil and natural gas or generate the GHG emissions could result in increased costs of compliance or costs of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for oil and natural gas, which could reduce the profitability of our interests. Additionally, political, litigation and financial risks may result in our oil and natural gas operators restricting or cancelling production activities, incurring liability for infrastructure damages as a result of climatic changes, or impairing their\nability to continue to operate in an economic manner, which also could reduce the profitability of our interests. One or more of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nAdditional restrictions on drilling activities intended to protect certain species of wildlife may adversely affect our operators\u2019 ability to conduct drilling activities.\nIn the United States, the Endangered Species Act (the \u201cESA\u201d) restricts activities that may affect endangered or threatened species or their habitats. Similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (the \u201cMBTA\u201d). To the extent species that are listed under the ESA or similar state laws, or are protected under the MBTA, live in the areas where our operators operate, our operators\u2019 abilities to conduct or expand operations could be limited, or our operators could be forced to incur material additional costs. Moreover, our operators\u2019 drilling activities may be delayed, restricted or precluded in protected habitat areas or during certain seasons, such as breeding and nesting seasons.\nIn addition, as a result of one or more settlements approved by the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service (the \u201cFWS\u201d), the agency was required to make a determination on the listing of numerous other species as endangered or threatened under the ESA by the end of the FWS\u2019 2017 fiscal year. The FWS did not make that deadline; however, review is reportedly ongoing. The designation of previously unidentified endangered or threatened species-such as the dunes sagebrush lizard, lesser prairie chicken or greater sage grouse-could cause our operators\u2019 operations to become subject to operating restrictions or bans, and limit future development activity in affected areas. The FWS and similar state agencies may designate critical or suitable habitat areas that they believe are necessary for the survival of threatened or endangered species. Such a designation could materially restrict use of or access to federal, state and private lands.\nOperating hazards and uninsured risks may result in substantial losses to us or our operators, and any losses could adversely affect our results of operations and free cash flow.\nThe operations of our operators will be subject to all of the hazards and operating risks associated with drilling for and production of oil, natural gas and NGLs, including the risk of fire, explosions, blowouts, surface cratering, uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas, NGLs and formation water, pipe or pipeline failures, abnormally pressured formations, casing collapses and environmental hazards such as oil and NGL spills, natural gas leaks and ruptures or discharges of toxic gases. In addition, their operations will be subject to risks associated with hydraulic fracturing, including any mishandling, surface spillage or potential underground migration of fracturing fluids, including chemical additives. The occurrence of any of these events could result in substantial losses to our operators due to injury or loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property, natural resources and equipment, pollution or other environmental damage, clean-up responsibilities, regulatory investigations and penalties, suspension of operations and repairs required to resume operations.\nCompetition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense, which may adversely affect our and our operators\u2019 ability to succeed.\nThe oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive, and the operators of our properties compete with other companies that may have greater resources. Many of these companies explore for and produce oil, natural gas and NGLs, carry on midstream and refining operations, and market petroleum and other products on a regional, national or worldwide basis. In addition, these companies may have a greater ability to continue exploration activities during periods of low oil, natural gas and NGL market prices. Our operators\u2019 larger competitors may be able to absorb the burden of present and future federal, state, local and other laws and regulations more easily than our operators can, which would adversely affect our operators\u2019 competitive position. Our operators may have fewer financial and human resources than many companies in our operators\u2019 industry and may be at a disadvantage in bidding for exploratory prospects and producing oil and natural gas properties. In addition, our ability to acquire additional properties and to discover reserves in the future will be dependent upon our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transaction in a highly competitive environment. Because we have fewer financial and human resources than many companies in our industry, we may be at a disadvantage in bidding for exploratory prospects and producing oil and natural gas properties.\nTitle to the properties in which we have an interest may be impaired by title defects.\nWe are not required to, and under certain circumstances we may elect not to, incur the expense of retaining lawyers to examine the title to our royalty and mineral interests. In such cases, we would rely upon the judgment of oil and gas lease brokers or landmen who perform the fieldwork in examining records in the appropriate governmental office before acquiring a specific royalty or mineral interest. The existence of a material title deficiency can render an interest worthless and can materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and free cash flow. No assurance can be given that we will not suffer a monetary\nloss from title defects or title failure. Additionally, undeveloped acreage has a greater risk of title defects than developed acreage. If there are any title defects in properties in which we hold an interest, we may suffer a financial loss.\nLoss of our or our operators\u2019 information and computer systems, including as a result of cyber attacks, could materially and adversely affect our business.\nWe and our operators rely on electronic systems and networks to control and manage our respective businesses. If any of such programs or systems were to fail for any reason, including as a result of a cyber attacks, or create erroneous information in our or our operators\u2019 hardware or software network infrastructure, possible consequences could be significant, including loss of communication links and inability to automatically process commercial transaction or engage in similar automated or computerized business activities. Although we have multiple layers of security to mitigate risks of cyber attacks, cyber attacks on business have escalated in recent years. Moreover, our operators are becoming increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct certain exploration, development, production and processing activities, including interpreting seismic data, managing drilling rigs, production activities and gathering systems, conducting reservoir modeling and estimating reserves. The U.S. government has issued public warnings that indicate that energy assets might be specific targets of cyber security threats. If our operators become the target of cyberattacks of information security breaches, their business operations may be substantially disrupted, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, our efforts to monitor, mitigate and manage these evolving risks may result in increased capital and operating costs, but there can be no assurance that such efforts will be sufficient to prevent attacks or breaches from occurring.\nA terrorist attack or armed conflict could harm our business.\nTerrorist activities, anti-terrorist efforts and other armed conflicts involving the United States or other countries may adversely affect the United States and global economies and could prevent us from meeting our financial and other obligations. If any of these events occur, the resulting political instability and societal disruption could reduce overall demand for oil, natural gas and NGLs, potentially putting downward pressure on demand for our operators\u2019 services and causing a reduction in our revenues. Oil, natural gas and NGL related facilities could be direct targets of terrorist attacks, and, if infrastructure integral to our operators is destroyed or damaged, they may experience a significant disruption in their operations. Costs for insurance and other security may increase as a result of these threats, and some insurance coverage may become more difficult to obtain, if available at all.\nA deterioration in general economic, business or industry conditions would materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and free cash flow.\nIn recent years, concerns over global economic conditions, energy costs, geopolitical issues, inflation, the availability and cost of credit and slow economic growth in the United States have contributed to economic uncertainty and diminished expectations for the global economy. Meanwhile, continued hostilities in the Middle East and the occurrence or threat of terrorist attacks in the United States or other countries could adversely affect the economies of the United States and other countries. In addition, global or national health concerns, including the outbreak of pandemic or contagious disease, can negatively impact the global economy and demand for oil, natural gas and NGLs. For instance, the recent coronavirus outbreak has adversely affected our business by (i) reducing the demand for oil, NGL and natural gas because of reduced global and national economic activity, leading to lower prices for oil, NGL and natural gas, and (ii) impairing the supply chain of certain of our operators. We cannot accurately predict the duration or magnitude of the effects of the coronavirus outbreak on our business in the future. Concerns about global economic growth have had a significant adverse impact on global financial markets and commodity prices. An oversupply of crude oil in 2015 led to a severe decline in worldwide oil prices. If the economic climate in the United States or abroad deteriorates, worldwide demand for petroleum products could further diminish, which could impact the price at which oil, natural gas and NGLs from our properties are sold, affect the ability of our operators to continue operations and ultimately materially adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and free cash flow.\nRisks Related to Our Class A Common Stock\nBrigham Minerals is a holding company. Brigham Minerals\u2019 sole material asset is its equity interest in Brigham LLC and it is accordingly dependent upon distributions from Brigham LLC to pay taxes, cover its corporate and other overhead expenses and pay any dividends on our Class A common stock.\nBrigham Minerals is a holding company and has no material assets other than its equity interest in Brigham LLC. Please see \u201cOur Corporate Structure.\u201d Brigham Minerals has no independent means of generating revenue. To the extent Brigham LLC has available cash, Brigham LLC is required to make (i) generally pro rata distributions to all its unitholders, including to Brigham\nMinerals, in an amount generally intended to allow such holders to satisfy their respective income tax liabilities with respect to their allocable share of the income of Brigham LLC, based on certain assumptions and conventions, provided that the distribution will be sufficient to allow Brigham Minerals to satisfy its actual tax liabilities and (ii) non pro rata payments to Brigham Minerals in an amount sufficient to cover its corporate and other overhead expenses. In addition, as the sole managing member of Brigham LLC, we will cause Brigham LLC to make pro rata distributions to all of its unitholders, including to Brigham Minerals, in an amount sufficient to allow us to fund dividends to our stockholders in accordance with our dividend policy, to the extent our board of directors declares such dividends. Therefore, although we have paid dividends to our stockholders in the past and expect to pay dividends on our Class A common stock in amounts determined from time to time by our board of directors in the future, our ability to do so may be limited to the extent Brigham LLC and its subsidiaries are limited in their ability to make these and other distributions to us, including due to the restrictions under our revolving credit facility. To the extent that we need funds and Brigham LLC or its subsidiaries are restricted from making such distributions under applicable law or regulation or under the terms of their financing arrangements, or are otherwise unable to provide such funds, it could materially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition.\nThe requirements of being a public company, including compliance with the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, may strain our resources, increase our costs and distract management, and we may be unable to comply with these requirements in a timely or cost-effective manner.\nAs a public company, we need to comply with new laws, regulations and requirements, certain corporate governance provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, related regulations of the SEC and the requirements of the NYSE, with which we were not required to comply as a private company. Complying with these statutes, regulations and requirements will occupy a significant amount of time of our board of directors and management and will significantly increase our costs and expenses. We are required to:\n\u2022\ninstitute a more comprehensive compliance function;\n\u2022\ncomply with rules promulgated by the NYSE;\n\u2022\ncontinue to prepare and distribute periodic public reports in compliance with our obligations under the federal securities laws;\n\u2022\nestablish new internal policies, such as those relating to insider trading; and\n\u2022\ninvolve and retain to a greater degree outside counsel and accountants in the above activities.\nFurthermore, while we generally must comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act for our fiscal year ending December 31, 2020, we are not required to have our independent registered public accounting firm attest to the effectiveness of our internal controls until our first annual report subsequent to our ceasing to be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d within the meaning of Section 2(a)(19) of the Securities Act. Accordingly, we may not be required to have our independent registered public accounting firm attest to the effectiveness of our internal controls until as late as our annual report for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024. Once it is required to do so, our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our controls are documented, designed, operated or reviewed. Compliance with these requirements may strain our resources, increase our costs and distract management, and we may be unable to comply with these requirements in a timely or cost-effective manner.\nIn addition, we expect that being a public company subject to these rules and regulations may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers. We are currently evaluating these rules, and we cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs.\nIf we fail to develop or maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. If one or more material weaknesses emerge related to financial reporting, or if we otherwise fail to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, our ability to accurately report our financial results could be adversely affected. As a result, current and potential stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our Class A common stock.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports, prevent fraud and operate successfully as a public company. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our reputation and operating results would be harmed. We cannot be certain that our efforts to develop and maintain our internal controls will be successful, that we will be able to maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future, that we will be able to comply with\nour obligations under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or that we will not identify material weaknesses related to our financial reporting. For example, in connection with the preparation and review of our unaudited consolidated financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, our management identified certain material weaknesses which have since been remediated. If one or more material weaknesses emerge related to financial reporting in the future, or if we otherwise fail to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, our operating results and ability to meet our reporting obligations may be adversely affected and we may be subject to adverse regulatory consequences. Ineffective internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our Class A common stock. See Item 7. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Internal Control Procedures-Material Weakness and Remediation.\u201d\nOur Sponsors have the ability to direct the voting of a substantial portion of the voting power of our common stock, and their interests may conflict with those of our other stockholders.\nHolders of shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock vote together as a single class on all matters presented to our stockholders for their vote or approval, except as otherwise required by applicable law or our certificate of incorporation. As of February 27, 2020, our Sponsors beneficially own, on a combined basis, approximately 11.3% of our outstanding shares of Class A common stock and 81% of our shares of Class B common stock, representing 39.1% of our combined economic interest and voting power. As a result, on a combined basis, our Sponsors will continue to have significant influence over matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, changes to our organizational documents and significant corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership makes it unlikely that any other holder or group of holders of our Class A common stock will be able to affect the way we are managed or the direction of our business. The interests of our Sponsors with respect to matters potentially or actually involving or affecting us, such as future acquisitions, financings and other corporate opportunities and attempts to acquire us, may conflict with the interests of our other stockholders.\nGiven this concentrated ownership, our Sponsors would have to approve any potential acquisition of us. In addition, certain of our directors are currently employees of our Sponsors. These directors\u2019 duties as employees of our Sponsors may conflict with their duties as our directors, and the resolution of these conflicts may not always be in our or your best interest. Furthermore, we are party to a stockholders\u2019 agreement with our Sponsors. The stockholders\u2019 agreement provides each of our Sponsors with the right to designate a certain number of nominees to our board of directors so long as such Sponsor and its affiliates collectively beneficially own a specified percentage of the outstanding shares of our Class A and Class B common stock. In addition, the stockholders\u2019 agreement provides our sponsors the right to approve certain material transactions so long as our Sponsors and their affiliates beneficially own specified percentages of our outstanding shares of Class A and Class B common stock. Finally, the existence of significant stockholders may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers, delaying or preventing changes in control or changes in management or limiting the ability of our other stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in the best interests of our company. Our Sponsors\u2019 concentration of stock ownership may also adversely affect the trading price of our Class A common stock to the extent investors perceive a disadvantage in owning stock of a company with significant stockholders.\nCertain of our directors have significant duties with, and spend significant time serving, entities that may compete with us in seeking acquisitions and business opportunities and, accordingly, may have conflicts of interest in allocating time or pursuing business opportunities.\nCertain of our directors, who are responsible for managing the direction of our operations and acquisition activities, hold positions of responsibility with other entities (including Warburg Pincus-, Yorktown- and Pine Brook-affiliated entities) that are in the business of identifying and acquiring oil and natural gas properties. For example, two of our directors (Messrs. Holland and Levy) are senior investment professionals of Warburg Pincus, one of our directors (Mr. Keenan) is a Managing Member of Yorktown and one of our directors (Mr. Stoneburner) is a Managing Director of Pine Brook, all of which are in the business of investing in oil and natural gas companies with independent management teams that also seek to acquire oil and natural gas properties. In addition, Mr. Brigham, our executive chairman, is involved with certain other entities involved in the oil and gas industry, including Brigham Operating, Atlas Permian Water, Atlas Permian Sand, Brigham Development and Anthem Ventures. The existing positions held by these directors may give rise to fiduciary or other duties that are in conflict with the duties they owe to us. These directors may become aware of business opportunities that may be appropriate for presentation to us as well as to the other entities with which they are or may become affiliated. Due to these existing and potential future affiliations, they may present potential business opportunities to other entities prior to presenting them to us, which could cause additional conflicts of interest. They may also decide that certain opportunities are more appropriate for other entities with which they are affiliated, and as a result, they may elect not to present those opportunities to us. These conflicts may not be resolved in our favor. For additional discussion of our management\u2019s business affiliations and the potential conflicts of interest of which our stockholders should be aware, see \u201cCertain Relationships and Related Party Transactions, and Director Independence.\u201d\nOur Sponsors and their affiliates are not limited in their ability to compete with us, and the corporate opportunity provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation could enable our Sponsors to benefit from corporate opportunities that might otherwise be available to us.\nOur governing documents provide that our Sponsors and their affiliates (including portfolio investments of our Sponsors and their affiliates) are not restricted from owning assets or engaging in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us and that we renounce any interest or expectancy in any business opportunity that may be from time to time presented to our Sponsors or their respective affiliates. In particular, subject to the limitations of applicable law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, among other things:\n\u2022\npermits our Sponsors and their affiliates and our directors to conduct business that competes with us and to make investments in any kind of property in which we may make investments; and\n\u2022\nprovides that if our Sponsors or their affiliates or any director or officer of one of our affiliates, our Sponsors or their affiliates who is also one of our directors becomes aware of a potential business opportunity, transaction or other matter, they will have no duty to communicate or offer that opportunity to us.\nOur Sponsors or their affiliates may become aware, from time to time, of certain business opportunities (such as acquisition opportunities) and may direct such opportunities to other businesses in which they have invested, in which case we may not become aware of or otherwise have the ability to pursue such opportunity. Further, such businesses may choose to compete with us for these opportunities, possibly causing these opportunities to not be available to us or causing them to be more expensive for us to pursue. In addition, our Sponsors and their affiliates may dispose of oil and natural gas properties or other assets in the future, without any obligation to offer us the opportunity to purchase any of those assets. As a result, our renouncing our interest and expectancy in any business opportunity that may be from time to time presented to our Sponsors and their affiliates could adversely impact our business or prospects if attractive business opportunities are procured by such parties for their own benefit rather than for ours. Please read \u201cDescription of Brigham Minerals, Inc.\u2019s Class A common stock.\u201d\nEach of our Sponsors is an established participant in the oil and natural gas industry and has resources greater than ours, which may make it more difficult for us to compete with our Sponsors with respect to commercial activities as well as for potential acquisitions. We cannot assure you that any conflicts that may arise between us and our stockholders, on the one hand, and our Sponsors, on the other hand, will be resolved in our favor. As a result, competition from our Sponsors and their affiliates could adversely impact our results of operations.\nA significant reduction by our Sponsors of their ownership interests in us could adversely affect us.\nWe believe that our Sponsor\u2019s ownership interests in us provide them with an economic incentive to assist us to be successful. However, our Sponsors are not subject to any obligation to maintain their ownership interest in us and may elect at any time thereafter to sell all or a substantial portion of or otherwise reduce their ownership interest in us. If our Sponsors sell all or a substantial portion of their respective ownership interests in us, they may have less incentive to assist in our success and their affiliate(s) that are expected to serve as members of our board of directors may resign. Such actions could adversely affect our ability to successfully implement our business strategies, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, as well as Delaware law, contain provisions that could discourage acquisition bids or merger proposals, which may adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock and could deprive our investors of the opportunity to receive a premium for their shares.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval in one or more series, designate the number of shares constituting any series, and fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions thereof, including dividend rights, voting rights, rights and terms of redemption, redemption price or prices and liquidation preferences of such series. If our board of directors elects to issue preferred stock, it could be more difficult for a third party to acquire us. In addition, some provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the change of control would be beneficial to our stockholders. Among other things, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws:\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice procedures with regard to stockholder proposals relating to the nomination of candidates for election as directors or new business to be brought before meetings of our stockholders;\n\u2022\nprovide that the authorized number of directors constituting our board of directors may be changed only by resolution of the board of directors;\n\u2022\nprovide that all vacancies, including newly created directorships, may, except as otherwise required by law, the terms of the stockholders\u2019 agreement or, if applicable, the rights of holders of a series of our preferred stock, be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of our directors then in office, even if less than a quorum;\n\u2022\nprovide that our bylaws can be amended by the board of directors;\n\u2022\nprovide that any action required or permitted to be taken by our stockholders must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders and may not be effected by any consent in writing in lieu of a meeting of such stockholders, subject to the rights of the holders of any series of our preferred stock with respect to such series;\n\u2022\nprovide that our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may be amended by the affirmative vote of the holders of not less than 66 2/3% of our then outstanding shares of common stock;\n\u2022\nprovide that special meetings of our stockholders may only be called by our board of directors pursuant to a resolution adopted by the affirmative vote of a majority of the members of the board of directors serving at the time of such vote;\n\u2022\nprovide for our board of directors to be divided into three classes of directors, with each class as nearly equal in number as possible, serving staggered three-year terms, other than directors that may be elected by holders of our preferred stock, if any;\n\u2022\nprovide that the affirmative vote of the holders of not less than 66 2/3% in voting power of all then outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required to remove any or all of the directors from office, and such removal may only be for \u201ccause\u201d; and\n\u2022\nprohibit cumulative voting on all matters.\nFurthermore, the terms of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws are subject to the terms of the stockholders\u2019 agreement. See \u201cCertain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence.\u201d\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, employees or agents to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in each such case subject to such Court of Chancery having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants therein. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock will be deemed to have notice of, and consented to, the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation described in the preceding sentence. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and such persons. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur ability to pay dividends to our stockholders may be limited by our holding company structure, contractual restrictions and regulatory requirements.\nBrigham Minerals is a holding company and has no material assets other than its ownership of Brigham LLC Units, and Brigham Minerals does not have any independent means of generating revenue. To the extent Brigham LLC has available cash, Brigham LLC is required to make (i) generally pro rata distributions to all its unitholders, including to Brigham Minerals, in an amount generally intended to allow such holders to satisfy their respective income tax liabilities with respect to their allocable share of the income of Brigham LLC, based on certain assumptions and conventions, provided that the distribution will be sufficient to allow Brigham Minerals to satisfy its actual tax liabilities and (ii) non-pro rata payments to Brigham Minerals in an amount\nsufficient to cover its corporate and other overhead expenses. In addition, as the sole managing member of Brigham LLC, Brigham Minerals will cause Brigham LLC to make pro rata distributions to all of its unitholders, including to Brigham Minerals, in an amount sufficient to allow it to fund dividends to its stockholders in accordance with its dividend policy, to the extent its board of directors declares such dividends. Brigham LLC is a distinct legal entity and may be subject to legal or contractual restrictions that, under certain circumstances, may limit Brigham Minerals ability to obtain cash from it. If Brigham LLC is unable to make distributions, we may not receive adequate distributions, which could materially and adversely affect our free cash flow and financial position and our ability to fund any dividends.\nAlthough we have paid dividends on our Class A common stock and expect to pay dividends on our Class A common stock in the future, our board of directors will take into account general economic and business conditions, including our financial condition and results of operations, capital requirements, contractual restrictions, including restrictions and covenants contained in our debt agreements, business prospects and other factors that our board of directors considers relevant in determining whether, and in what amounts, to pay such dividends. In addition, our revolving credit facility limits the amount of distributions that Brigham LLC can make to us and the purposes for which distributions could be made. Accordingly, we may not be able to pay dividends even if our board of directors would otherwise deem it appropriate. See \u201cDividend Policy,\u201d \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Capital Requirements and Sources of Liquidity\u201d and \u201cDescription of Brigham Minerals, Inc.\u2019s Class A common stock.\u201d\nIn certain circumstances, Brigham LLC will be required to make tax distributions to the Brigham Unit Holders, including Brigham Minerals, and such tax distributions may be substantial. To the extent Brigham Minerals receives tax distributions in excess of its actual tax liabilities and retains such excess cash, the Original Owners would benefit from such accumulated cash balances if they exercise their Redemption Right.\nPursuant to the Brigham LLC Agreement, to the extent Brigham LLC has available cash (taking into account existing and projected capital expenditures), Brigham LLC is required to make generally pro rata distributions (which we refer to as \u201ctax distributions\u201d), to all its unitholders, including Brigham Minerals, in an amount generally intended to allow the Brigham Unit Holders to satisfy their respective income tax liabilities with respect to their allocable share of the income of Brigham LLC, based on certain assumptions and conventions, provided that tax distributions will be made sufficient to allow Brigham Minerals to satisfy its actual tax liabilities. The amount of such tax distributions will be determined based on certain assumptions, including an assumed individual income tax rate, and will be calculated after taking into account other distributions (including other tax distributions) made by Brigham LLC. Because tax distributions will be made pro rata based on ownership and due to, among other items, differences between the tax rates applicable to Brigham Minerals and the assumed individual income tax rate used in the calculation and requirements under the applicable tax rules that Brigham LLC\u2019s net taxable income be allocated disproportionately to its unitholders in certain circumstances, tax distributions may significantly exceed the actual tax liability for many of the Brigham Unit Holders, including Brigham Minerals. If Brigham Minerals retains the excess cash it receives, the Original Owners would benefit from any value attributable to such accumulated cash balances upon their exercise of the Redemption Right. However, we expect to use such accumulated cash balances to pay dividends in respect of our Class A common stock or to take other steps to eliminate any material cash balances. In addition, the tax distributions Brigham LLC will be required to make may be substantial and may exceed the tax liabilities that would be owed by a similarly situated corporate taxpayer. Funds used by Brigham LLC to satisfy its tax distribution obligations will not be available for reinvestment in our business, except to the extent Brigham Minerals uses the excess cash it receives to reinvest in Brigham LLC for additional units.\nThe U.S. federal income tax treatment of distributions on our Class A common stock to a holder will depend upon our tax attributes and the holder\u2019s tax basis in our stock, which are not necessarily predictable and can change over time.\nDistributions of cash or property on our Class A common stock, if any, will constitute dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes to the extent paid from our current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles. To the extent those distributions exceed our current and accumulated earnings and profits, the distributions will be treated as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of the non-U.S. holder\u2019s tax basis in our Class A common stock and thereafter as capital gain from the sale or exchange of such common stock. Also, if any holder sells our Class A common stock, the holder will recognize a gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized and the holder\u2019s tax basis in such Class A common stock.\nTo the extent that the amount of our distributions is treated as a non-taxable return of capital as described above, such distribution will reduce a holder\u2019s tax basis in the Class A common stock. Consequently, such excess distributions will result in a corresponding increase in the amount of gain, or a corresponding decrease in the amount of loss, recognized by the holder upon the sale of the Class A common stock or subsequent distributions with respect to such stock. Additionally, with regard to U.S. corporate holders of our Class A shares, to the extent that a distribution on our Class A shares exceeds both our current and accumulated earnings and profits and such holder\u2019s tax basis in such shares, such holders would be unable to utilize the corporate\ndividends-received deduction (to the extent it would otherwise be applicable to such holder) with respect to the gain resulting from such excess distribution.\nInvestors in our Class A common stock are encouraged to consult their tax advisors as to the tax consequences of receiving distributions on our Class A shares that are not treated as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nFuture sales of shares of our Class A common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales may occur, could reduce our stock price, and any additional capital raised by us through the sale of equity or convertible securities may dilute your ownership in us.\nCertain of our Original Owners own shares of our Class A common stock and, subject to certain limitations and exceptions, the Original Owners that hold Brigham LLC Units may require Brigham LLC to redeem their Brigham LLC Units for shares of Class A common stock (on a one-for-one basis, subject to conversion rate adjustments for stock splits, stock dividends and reclassification and other similar transactions), and our Original Owners may sell any of such shares of Class A common stock. As of February 27, 2020, we had outstanding 34,181,268 shares of Class A common stock and 22,706,711 shares of Class B common stock, representing approximately 39.9% of our total outstanding shares. In addition, our Sponsors continue to hold 3,856,823 shares of our Class A common stock, representing approximately 11.3% of our total shares of Class A common stock outstanding. The Sponsors are party to a registration rights agreement, which requires us to effect the registration of their shares in certain circumstances. See \u201cOur Corporate Structure\u201d and \u201cCertain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence.\u201d\nWe have previously filed a registration statement with the SEC on Form S-8 providing for the registration of 5,999,600 shares of our Class A common stock issued or reserved for issuance under our equity incentive plan. Subject to the satisfaction of vesting conditions, shares registered under the registration statement on Form S-8 will be available for resale immediately in the public market without restriction.\nWe cannot predict the size of future issuances of our Class A common stock or securities convertible into Class A common stock or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of shares of our Class A common stock will have on the market price of our Class A common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of our Class A common stock (including shares issued in connection with an acquisition), or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices of our Class A common stock.\nOur organizational structure confers certain benefits upon the Original Owners that will not benefit the holders of our Class A common stock to the same extent as it will benefit the Original Owners.\nOur organizational structure confers certain benefits upon the Original Owners that do not benefit the holders of our Class A common stock to the same extent as it will benefit the Original Owners. Brigham Minerals is a holding company and has no material assets other than its ownership of Brigham LLC Units. As a consequence, our ability to declare and pay dividends to the holders of our Class A common stock is subject to the ability of Brigham LLC to provide distributions to us. If Brigham LLC makes such distributions, the Original Owners will be entitled to receive equivalent distributions from Brigham LLC on a pro rata basis. However, because we must pay taxes, amounts ultimately distributed as dividends to holders of our Class A common stock are expected to be less on a per share basis than the amounts distributed by Brigham LLC to the Original Owners on a per unit basis. This and other aspects of our organizational structure may adversely impact the future trading market for our Class A common stock.\nWe may issue preferred stock whose terms could adversely affect the voting power or value of our Class A common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designations, preferences, limitations and relative rights, including preferences over our Class A common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our board of directors may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of our preferred stock could adversely impact the voting power or value of our Class A common stock. For example, we might grant holders of a class or series of our preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we might assign to holders of our preferred stock could affect the residual value of our Class A common stock.\nFor as long as we are an emerging growth company, we will not be required to comply with certain reporting requirements, including those relating to accounting standards and disclosure about our executive compensation, that apply to other public companies.\nWe are classified as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under the JOBS Act. For as long as we are an emerging growth company, which may be up to five full fiscal years, unlike other public companies, we will not be required to, among other things: (i) provide an auditor\u2019s attestation report on management\u2019s assessment of the effectiveness of our system of internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; (ii) comply with any new requirements adopted by the PCAOB requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor\u2019s report in which the auditor would be required to provide additional information about the audit and the financial statements of the issuer; (iii) provide certain disclosure regarding executive compensation required of larger public companies; or (iv) hold nonbinding advisory votes on executive compensation. We may remain an emerging growth company until December 31, 2024, although we will lose that status sooner if we have more than $1.07 billion of revenues in a fiscal year, have more than $700 million in market value of our Class A common stock held by non-affiliates, or issue more than $1 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period.\nTo the extent that we rely on any of the exemptions available to emerging growth companies, you will receive less information about our executive compensation and internal control over financial reporting than issuers that are not emerging growth companies. If some investors find our Class A common stock to be less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our Class A common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nIf securities or industry analysts adversely change their recommendations regarding our Class A common stock or if our operating results do not meet their expectations, our stock price could decline.\nThe trading market for our Class A common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. Moreover, if one or more of the analysts who cover our company downgrades our Class A common stock or if our operating results do not meet their expectations, our stock price could decline.\nBecause we have elected to take advantage of the extended transition period pursuant to Section 107 of the JOBS Act, our financial statements may not be comparable to those of other public companies.\nSection 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can use the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This permits an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We are choosing to take advantage of this extended transition period and, as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for private companies. Accordingly, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates, and our stockholders and potential investors may have difficulty in analyzing our operating results by comparing us to such companies.", "PERMNO": 18515, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "MNRL"}
