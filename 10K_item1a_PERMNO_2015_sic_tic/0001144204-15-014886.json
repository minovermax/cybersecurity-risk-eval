{"cik": "763907", "company": "FIRST UNITED CORP/MD/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-09", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe significant risks and uncertainties related to us, our business and our securities of which we are aware are discussed below. You should carefully consider these risks and uncertainties before making investment decisions in respect of our securities. Any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects and could negatively impact the market price of our securities. If any of these risks materialize, you could lose all or part of your investment in the Corporation. Additional risks and uncertainties that we do not yet know of, or that we currently think are immaterial, may also impair our business operations. You should also consider the other information contained in this annual report, including our financial statements and the related notes, before making investment decisions in respect of our securities.\nRisks Relating to First United Corporation and its Affiliates\nFirst United Corporation\u2019s future success depends on the successful growth of its subsidiaries.\nThe Corporation\u2019s primary business activity for the foreseeable future will be to act as the holding company of the Bank and its other direct and indirect subsidiaries. Therefore, the Corporation\u2019s future profitability will depend on the success and growth of these subsidiaries. In the future, part of our growth may come from buying other banks and buying or establishing other companies. Such entities may not be profitable after they are purchased or established, and they may lose money, particularly at first. A new bank or company may bring with it unexpected liabilities, bad loans, or bad employee relations, or the new bank or company may lose customers.\nInterest rates and other economic conditions will impact our results of operations.\nOur results of operations may be materially and adversely affected by changes in prevailing economic conditions, including declines in real estate values, rapid changes in interest rates and the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government. Our profitability is in part a function of the spread between the interest rates earned on assets and the interest rates paid on deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities (i.e., net interest income), including advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta (the \u201cFHLB\u201d). Interest rate risk arises from mismatches (i.e., the interest sensitivity gap) between the dollar amount of repricing or maturing assets and liabilities. If more assets reprice or mature than liabilities during a falling interest rate environment, then our earnings could be negatively impacted. Conversely, if more liabilities reprice or mature than assets during a rising interest rate environment, then our earnings could be negatively impacted. Fluctuations in interest rates are not predictable or controllable. There can be no assurance that our attempts to structure our asset and liability management strategies to mitigate the impact on net interest income of changes in market interest rates will be successful in the event of such changes.\n[14]\nThe majority of our business is concentrated in Maryland and West Virginia, much of which involves real estate lending, so a decline in the real estate and credit markets could materially and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nMost of the Bank\u2019s loans are made to borrowers located in Western Maryland and Northeastern West Virginia, and many of these loans, including construction and land development loans, are secured by real estate. Approximately 12%, or $99 million, of total loans are real estate acquisition construction and development projects that are secured by real estate. Accordingly, a decline in local economic conditions would likely have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations, and the impact on us would likely be greater than the impact felt by larger financial institutions whose loan portfolios are geographically diverse. We cannot guarantee that any risk management practices we implement to address our geographic and loan concentrations will be effective to prevent losses relating to our loan portfolio.\nThe national and local economies were significantly and adversely impacted by the banking crisis and resulting economic recession that began around 2008, and these conditions have caused, and continue to cause, a host of challenges for financial institutions, including the Bank. For example, these conditions have made it more difficult for real estate owners and owners of loans secured by real estate to sell their assets at desirable times and prices. Not only has this impacted the demand for credit to finance the acquisition and development of real estate, but it has also impaired the ability of banks, including the Bank, to sell real estate acquired through foreclosure. In the case of real estate acquisition, construction and development projects that we have financed, these challenging economic conditions have caused some of our borrowers to default on their loans. Because of the deterioration in the market values of real estate collateral caused by the recession, banks, including the Bank, have been unable to recover the full amount due under their loans when forced to foreclose on and sell real estate collateral. As a result, we have realized significant impairments and losses in our loan portfolio, which have materially and adversely impacted our financial condition and results of operations. These conditions and their consequences are likely to continue until the nation fully recovers from the recent economic recession. Management cannot predict the extent to which these conditions will cause future impairments or losses, nor can it provide any assurances as to when, or if, economic conditions will improve.\nThe Bank\u2019s concentrations of commercial real estate loans could subject it to increased regulatory scrutiny and directives, which could force us to preserve or raise capital and/or limit future commercial lending activities.\nThe Federal Reserve, the FDIC, and the other federal banking regulators issued guidance in December 2006 entitled \u201cConcentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending, Sound Risk Management Practices\u201d directed at institutions who have particularly high concentrations of CRE loans within their lending portfolios. This guidance suggests that these institutions face a heightened risk of financial difficulties in the event of adverse changes in the economy and CRE markets. Accordingly, the guidance suggests that institutions whose concentrations exceed certain percentages of capital should implement heightened risk management practices appropriate to their concentration risk. The guidance provides that banking regulators may require such institutions to reduce their concentrations and/or maintain higher capital ratios than institutions with lower concentrations in CRE.\nThe Bank may experience loan losses in excess of its allowance, which would reduce our earnings.\nThe risk of credit losses on loans varies with, among other things, general economic conditions, the type of loan being made, the creditworthiness of the borrower over the term of the loan and, in the case of a collateralized loan, the value and marketability of the collateral for the loan. Management of the Bank maintains an allowance for loan losses based upon, among other things, historical experience, an evaluation of economic conditions and regular reviews of delinquencies and loan portfolio quality. Based upon such factors, management makes various assumptions and judgments about the ultimate collectability of the loan portfolio and provides an allowance for loan losses based upon a percentage of the outstanding balances and for specific loans when their ultimate collectability is considered questionable. If management\u2019s assumptions and judgments prove to be incorrect and the allowance for loan losses is inadequate to absorb future losses, or if the bank regulatory authorities require us to increase the allowance for loan losses as a part of its examination process, our earnings and capital could be significantly and adversely affected. Although management continually monitors our loan portfolio and makes determinations with respect to the allowance for loan losses, future adjustments may be necessary if economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used or adverse developments arise with respect to our non-performing or performing loans. Material additions to the allowance for loan losses could result in a material decrease in our net income and capital, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nThe market value of our investments could decline.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had classified a cost basis of $231.7 million and a market value of $221.1 million of our investment securities as available-for-sale pursuant to FASB Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) Topic 320, Investments - Debt and Equity Securities, relating to accounting for investments. Topic 320 requires that unrealized gains and losses in the estimated value of the available-for-sale portfolio be \u201cmarked to market\u201d and reflected as a separate item in shareholders\u2019 equity (net of tax) as accumulated other comprehensive loss. There can be no assurance that future market performance of our investment portfolio will enable us to realize income from sales of securities. Shareholders\u2019 equity will continue to reflect the unrealized gains and losses (net of tax) of these investments. Moreover, there can be no assurance that the market value of our investment portfolio will not decline, causing a corresponding decline in shareholders\u2019 equity.\n[15]\nManagement believes that several factors could affect the market value of our investment portfolio. These include, but are not limited to, changes in interest rates or expectations of changes, the degree of volatility in the securities markets, inflation rates or expectations of inflation and the slope of the interest rate yield curve (the yield curve refers to the differences between shorter-term and longer-term interest rates; a positively sloped yield curve means shorter-term rates are lower than longer-term rates). Also, the passage of time will affect the market values of our investment securities, in that the closer they are to maturing, the closer the market price should be to par value. These and other factors may impact specific categories of the portfolio differently, and management cannot predict the effect these factors may have on any specific category.\nThe Volcker Rule may require the Bank to dispose of certain investments by July 21, 2015, which could result in a significant charge to earnings.\nOn December 10, 2013, the SEC, the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and other financial regulatory agencies issued final regulations to implement the Volcker Rule. Among other things, these regulations prohibit banking entities from acquiring or retaining an \u201cownership interest\u201d in a \u201ccovered fund\u201d, as such terms are defined in the regulations. A banking entity that owns such an interest must dispose of it no later than July 21, 2015. Although the agencies stated in their final rule release that debt securities evidencing typical extensions of credit (i.e., those that provide for payment of stated principal and interest calculated at a fixed rate or at a floating rate based on an index or interbank rate) do not generally meet the definition of an \u201cownership interest\u201d, the agencies\u2019 release contains a statement to the effect that all collateralized debt obligations (\u201cCDOs\u201d) backed by trust preferred securities are prohibited investments under the Volcker Rule. Subsequently, on January 14, 2014, the agencies issued an interim final rule that exempts a CDO if (i) the issuer was established, and the CDO was originally issued, before May 19, 2010, (ii) the banking entity investor reasonably believes that the offering proceeds received by the issuer were invested primarily in trust preferred securities or subordinated debt instruments issued prior to May 19, 2010 by a depository institution holding company that satisfied certain criteria at the time of issuance, and (iii) the banking entity investor acquired the CDO on or before December 10, 2013. The agencies\u2019 rule releases create significant uncertainty with respect to whether the Volcker Rule will be applied to CDOs that are backed by non-bank trust preferred securities but that take the form of debt securities evidencing typical extensions of credit, because the agencies did not, in making the statement that CDOs backed by trust preferred securities are generally prohibited investments, acknowledge or otherwise address the fact that an investment must, as a threshold matter, meet the definition of \u201cownership interest\u201d before it can be characterized as a prohibited investment.\nAt December 31, 2014, the Bank owns $37.1 million in aggregate principal amount of promissory notes that are collateralized primarily by trust preferred securities and/or subordinated debt instruments issued by insurance entities and that provide for the payment of stated principal and interest at rates tied to LIBOR. These promissory notes are held in the Bank\u2019s investment portfolio and, as of December 31, 2014, are classified as available-for-sale. The Bank has analyzed these promissory notes under the final Volcker Rule regulations and has concluded that they are not prohibited investments because they do not exhibit, on a current, future, or contingent basis, any of the characteristics of an equity, partnership or other similar interest in the issuers identified in the Volcker Rule\u2019s definition of \u201cownership interest\u201d. If the FDIC were to disagree with the Bank\u2019s conclusion and determine that these promissory notes constitute prohibited \u201cownership interests\u201d, then the Bank would be required to dispose of them on or before January 21, 2015, likely at a considerable loss due to their current market values.\nImpairment of investment securities, goodwill, or deferred tax assets could require charges to earnings, which could result in a negative impact on our results of operations.\nIn assessing whether the impairment of investment securities is other-than-temporary, management considers the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and the intent and ability to retain our investment in the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value in the near term. See the discussion under the heading \u201cEstimates and Critical Accounting Policies - Other-Than-Temporary Impairment of Investment Securities\u201d in Item 7 of Part II of this annual report for further information.\nUnder current accounting standards, goodwill is not amortized but, instead, is subject to impairment tests on at least an annual basis or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. A decline in the price of the Corporation\u2019s common stock or occurrence of a triggering event following any of our quarterly earnings releases and prior to the filing of the periodic report for that period could, under certain circumstances, cause us to perform a goodwill impairment test and result in an impairment charge being recorded for that period which was not reflected in such earnings release. In the event that we conclude that all or a portion of our goodwill may be impaired, a non-cash charge for the amount of such impairment would be recorded to earnings. Such a charge would have no impact on tangible capital. At December 31, 2014, we had recorded goodwill of $11.0 million, representing approximately 10% of shareholders\u2019 equity. See the discussion under the heading \u201cEstimates and Critical Accounting Policies - Goodwill\u201d in Item 7 of Part II of this annual report for further information.\nIn assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Assessing the need for, or the sufficiency of, a valuation allowance requires management to evaluate all available evidence, both negative and positive, including the recent trend of quarterly earnings. Positive evidence necessary to overcome the negative evidence includes whether future taxable income in sufficient amounts and character within the carryback and carry forward periods is available under the tax law, including the use of tax planning strategies. When negative evidence (e.g., cumulative losses in recent years, history of operating loss or tax credit carry forwards expiring unused) exists, more positive evidence than negative evidence will be necessary. At December 31, 2014, our net deferred tax assets were $23.3 million.\n[16]\nThe impact of each of these impairment matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe operate in a competitive environment, and our inability to effectively compete could adversely and materially impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe operate in a competitive environment, competing for loans, deposits, and customers with commercial banks, savings associations and other financial entities. Competition for deposits comes primarily from other commercial banks, savings associations, credit unions, money market and mutual funds and other investment alternatives. Competition for loans comes primarily from other commercial banks, savings associations, mortgage banking firms, credit unions and other financial intermediaries. Competition for other products, such as securities products, comes from other banks, securities and brokerage companies, and other non-bank financial service providers in our market area. Many of these competitors are much larger in terms of total assets and capitalization, have greater access to capital markets, and/or offer a broader range of financial services than those that we offer. In addition, banks with a larger capitalization and financial intermediaries not subject to bank regulatory restrictions have larger lending limits and are thereby able to serve the needs of larger customers.\nIn addition, changes to the banking laws over the last several years have facilitated interstate branching, merger and expanded activities by banks and holding companies. For example, the GLB Act revised the BHC Act and repealed the affiliation provisions of the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, which, taken together, limited the securities and other non-banking activities of any company that controls an FDIC insured financial institution. As a result, the ability of financial institutions to branch across state lines and the ability of these institutions to engage in previously-prohibited activities are now accepted elements of competition in the banking industry. These changes may bring us into competition with more and a wider array of institutions, which may reduce our ability to attract or retain customers. Management cannot predict the extent to which we will face such additional competition or the degree to which such competition will impact our financial conditions or results of operations.\nThe banking industry is heavily regulated; significant regulatory changes could adversely affect our operations.\nOur operations will be impacted by current and future legislation and by the policies established from time to time by various federal and state regulatory authorities. The Corporation is subject to supervision by the Federal Reserve. The Bank is subject to supervision and periodic examination by the Maryland Commissioner of Financial Regulation, the West Virginia Division of Banking, and the FDIC. Banking regulations, designed primarily for the safety of depositors, may limit a financial institution\u2019s growth and the return to its investors by restricting such activities as the payment of dividends, mergers with or acquisitions by other institutions, investments, loans and interest rates, interest rates paid on deposits, expansion of branch offices, and the offering of securities or trust services. The Corporation and the Bank are also subject to capitalization guidelines established by federal law and could be subject to enforcement actions to the extent that either is found by regulatory examiners to be undercapitalized. It is not possible to predict what changes, if any, will be made to existing federal and state legislation and regulations or the effect that such changes may have on our future business and earnings prospects. Management also cannot predict the nature or the extent of the effect on our business and earnings of future fiscal or monetary policies, economic controls, or new federal or state legislation. Further, the cost of compliance with regulatory requirements may adversely affect our ability to operate profitably.\nThe full impact of the Dodd-Frank Act is unknown because significant rule making efforts are still required to fully implement all of its requirements, but it will likely materially increase our regulatory expenses.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act represents a comprehensive overhaul of the financial services industry within the United States and affects the lending, investment, trading and operating activities of all financial institutions. Significantly, the Dodd-Frank Act includes the following provisions that affect the Bank:\n\u00b7 It established the CFPB, which has rulemaking authority over many of the statutes governing products and services offered to Bank customers. The creation of the CFPB will directly impact the scope and cost of products and services offered to consumers by the Bank and may have a significant effect on its financial performance.\n\u00b7 It revised the FDIC\u2019s insurance assessment methodology so that premiums are assessed based upon the average consolidated total assets of the Bank less tangible equity capital.\n\u00b7 It permanently increased deposit insurance coverage to $250,000.\n\u00b7 It authorized the Federal Reserve to set debit interchange fees in an amount that is \u201creasonable and proportional\u201d to the costs incurred by processors and card issuers. Under the final rule issued by the Federal Reserve, there is a cap of $0.21 per transaction (with a maximum of $.24 per transaction permitted if certain requirements are met). Implementation of these caps went into effect on October 1, 2011.\n[17]\n\u00b7 It imposes proprietary trading restrictions on insured depository institutions and their holding companies that prohibit them from engaging in proprietary trading except in limited circumstances, and prevents them from owning equity interests in excess of three percent (3%) of a bank\u2019s Tier 1 capital in private equity and hedge funds.\nBased on the text of the Dodd-Frank Act and the implementing regulations (both effective and yet-to-be-published), it is anticipated that the costs to banks may increase or fee income may decrease significantly, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity.\nThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau may reshape the consumer financial laws through rulemaking and enforcement of the prohibitions against unfair, deceptive and abusive business practices. Compliance with any such change may impact our business operations.\nThe CFPB has broad rulemaking authority to administer and carry out the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act with respect to financial institutions that offer covered financial products and services to consumers. The CFPB has also been directed to adopt rules identifying practices or acts that are unfair, deceptive or abusive in connection with any transaction with a consumer for a consumer financial product or service, or the offering of a consumer financial product or service. The concept of what may be considered to be an \u201cabusive\u201d practice is new under the law. The full scope of the impact of this authority has not yet been determined as the CFPB has not yet released significant supervisory guidance.\nAs discussed above, the CFPB issued several rules in 2013 relating to mortgage operations and servicing, including a rule requiring mortgage lenders to make a reasonable and good faith determination based on verified and documented information that a consumer applying for a mortgage loan has a reasonable ability to repay the loan according to its terms, or to originate \u201cqualified mortgages\u201d that meet specific requirements with respect to terms, pricing and fees. These new rules will likely require the Bank to dedicate significant personnel resources and could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nBank regulators and other regulations, including the Basel III Capital Rules, may require higher capital levels, impacting our ability to pay dividends or repurchase our stock.\nThe capital standards to which we are subject, including the standards created by the Basel III Capital Rules, may materially limit our ability to use our capital resources and/or could require us to raise additional capital by issuing common stock. The issuance of additional shares of common stock could dilute existing stockholders.\nWe may be adversely affected by other recent legislation.\nAs discussed above, the GLB Act repealed restrictions on banks affiliating with securities firms and it also permitted certain bank holding companies to become financial holding companies. Financial holding companies are permitted to engage in a host of financial activities, and activities that are incidental to financial activities, that are not permitted for bank holding companies who have not elected to become financial holding companies, including insurance and securities underwriting and agency activities, merchant banking, and insurance company portfolio investment activities. The Corporation terminated its financial holding company election in September 2014, and this election and the GLB Act may increase the competition that we face from other entities that provide financial products and services. It is not possible to predict the full effect that the GLB Act will have on us.\nThe federal Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires management of every publicly traded company to perform an annual assessment of the company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting and to report on whether the system is effective as of the end of the company\u2019s fiscal year. If our management were to discover and report significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, then the market value of our securities and shareholder value could decline.\nThe USA Patriot Act requires certain financial institutions, such as the Bank, to maintain and prepare additional records and reports that are designed to assist the government\u2019s efforts to combat terrorism. This law includes sweeping anti-money laundering and financial transparency laws and required additional regulations, including, among other things, standards for verifying client identification when opening an account and rules to promote cooperation among financial institutions, regulators and law enforcement entities in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money laundering. If we fail to comply with this law, we could be exposed to adverse publicity as well as fines and penalties assessed by regulatory agencies.\nCustomer concern about deposit insurance may cause a decrease in deposits held at the Bank.\nWith increased concerns about bank failures, customers increasingly are concerned about the extent to which their deposits are insured by the FDIC. Customers may withdraw deposits from the Bank in an effort to ensure that the amount they have on deposit with us is fully insured. Decreases in deposits may adversely affect our funding costs and net income.\n[18]\nThe Bank\u2019s funding sources may prove insufficient to replace deposits and support our future growth.\nThe Bank relies on customer deposits, advances from the FHLB, lines of credit at other financial institutions and brokered funds to fund our operations. Although the Bank has historically been able to replace maturing deposits and advances if desired, no assurance can be given that the Bank would be able to replace such funds in the future if our financial condition or the financial condition of the FHLB or market conditions were to change. Our financial flexibility will be severely constrained and/or our cost of funds will increase if we are unable to maintain our access to funding or if financing necessary to accommodate future growth is not available at favorable interest rates. Finally, if we are required to rely more heavily on more expensive funding sources to support future growth, our revenues may not increase proportionately to cover our costs. In this case, our profitability would be adversely affected.\nRecent rulemaking efforts by the Federal Reserve may negatively impact our non-interest income.\nOn November 12, 2009, the Federal Reserve announced the final rules amending Regulation E that prohibit financial institutions from charging fees to consumers for paying overdrafts on automated teller machine and one-time debit card transactions, unless a consumer consents, or opts-in, to the overdraft service for those types of transactions. Compliance with this regulation is effective July 1, 2010 for new consumer accounts and August 15, 2010 for existing consumer accounts. These new rules negatively impacted the Banks\u2019 non-interest income in 2013 and 2014 may continue to do so in future periods.\nIn addition, the Federal Reserve has issued rules pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act governing debit card interchange fees that apply to institutions with greater than $10 billion in assets. Although we are not subject to these rules, market forces may effectively require the Bank to adopt a debit card interchange fee structure that complies with these rules, in which case our non-interest income for future periods could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe loss of key personnel could disrupt our operations and result in reduced earnings.\nOur growth and profitability will depend upon our ability to attract and retain skilled managerial, marketing and technical personnel. Competition for qualified personnel in the financial services industry is intense, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel. Our current executive officers provide valuable services based on their many years of experience and in-depth knowledge of the banking industry and the market areas we serve. Due to the intense competition for financial professionals, these key personnel would be difficult to replace and an unexpected loss of their services could result in a disruption to the continuity of operations and a possible reduction in earnings.\nThe Bank\u2019s lending activities subject the Bank to the risk of environmental liabilities.\nA significant portion of the Bank\u2019s loan portfolio is secured by real property. During the ordinary course of business, the Bank may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans. In doing so, there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties. If hazardous or toxic substances are found, the Bank may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage. Environmental laws may require the Bank to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected property\u2019s value or limit the Bank\u2019s ability to use or sell the affected property. In addition, future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase the Bank\u2019s exposure to environmental liability. Although the Bank has policies and procedures to perform an environmental review before initiating any foreclosure action on real property, these reviews may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to claims and the costs of defensive actions, and such claims and costs could materially and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur customers may sue us for losses due to alleged breaches of fiduciary duties, errors and omissions of employees, officers and agents, incomplete documentation, our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, or many other reasons. Also, our employees may knowingly or unknowingly violate laws and regulations. Management may not be aware of any violations until after their occurrence. This lack of knowledge may not insulate us from liability. Claims and legal actions will result in legal expenses and could subject us to liabilities that may reduce our profitability and hurt our financial condition.\nWe may not be able to keep pace with developments in technology.\nWe use various technologies in conducting our businesses, including telecommunication, data processing, computers, automation, internet-based banking, and debit cards. Technology changes rapidly. Our ability to compete successfully with other financial institutions may depend on whether we can exploit technological changes. We may not be able to exploit technological changes, and any investment we do make may not make us more profitable.\n[19]\nSafeguarding our business and customer information increases our cost of operations. To the extent that we, or our third party vendors, are unable to prevent the theft of or unauthorized access to this information, our operations may become disrupted, we may be subject to claims, and our net income may be adversely affected.\nOur business depends heavily on the use of computer systems, the Internet and other means of electronic communication and recordkeeping. Accordingly, we must protect our computer systems and network from break-ins, security breaches, and other risks that could disrupt our operations or jeopardize the security of our business and customer information. Moreover, we use third party vendors to provide products and services necessary to conduct our day-to-day operations, which exposes us to risk that these vendors will not perform in accordance with the service arrangements, including by failing to protect the confidential information we entrust to them. Any security measures that we or our vendors implement, including encryption and authentication technology that we use to effect secure transmissions of confidential information, may not be effective to prevent the loss or theft of our information or to prevent risks associated with the Internet, such as cyber-fraud. Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography, or other developments could permit unauthorized persons to gain access to our confidential information in spite of the use of security measures that we believe are adequate. Any compromise of our security measures or of the security measures employed by our vendors of our third party could disrupt our business and/or could subject us to claims from our customers, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to First United Corporation\u2019s Securities\nThe shares of common stock, Series A Preferred Stock, and the Warrant are not insured.\nThe shares of the Corporation\u2019s common stock, the shares of its Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A (the \u201cSeries A Preferred Stock\u201d), and its outstanding warrant to purchase 326,323 shares of common stock (the \u201cWarrant\u201d) are not deposits and are not insured against loss by the FDIC or any other governmental or private agency.\nThere is no market for the Series A Preferred Stock or the Warrant, and the common stock is not heavily traded.\nThere is no established trading market for the shares of the Series A Preferred Stock or the Warrant. The Corporation does not intend to apply for listing of the Series A Preferred Stock on any securities exchange or for inclusion of the Series A Preferred Stock in any automated quotation system. The common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, but shares of the common stock are not heavily traded. Securities that are not heavily traded can be more volatile than stock trading in an active public market. Factors such as our financial results, the introduction of new products and services by us or our competitors, and various factors affecting the banking industry generally may have a significant impact on the market price of the shares the common stock. Management cannot predict the extent to which an active public market for any of the Corporation\u2019s securities will develop or be sustained in the future. Accordingly, holders of the Corporation\u2019s securities may not be able to sell such securities at the volumes, prices, or times that they desire.\nBecause of the Corporation\u2019s participation in the Troubled Asset Relief Program, the Corporation is subject to several restrictions relating to shares of its capital stock, including restrictions on its ability to declare or pay dividends on and repurchase shares.\nOn January 30, 2009, the Corporation participated in the Troubled Asset Relief Program Capital Purchase Program (the \u201cTARP CPP\u201d) of the U.S. Department of the Treasury (the \u201cTreasury\u201d) by issuing 30,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock and the Warrant to the Treasury in exchange for $30,000,000. These securities were issued pursuant to a Securities Purchase Agreement - Standard Terms, or Purchase Agreement, the terms of which limit the Corporation\u2019s ability to declare or pay dividends on shares of its capital stock. Specifically, the terms of the Series A Preferred Stock prohibit the Corporation from declaring or paying any dividends or making other distributions on the outstanding shares of its common stock, and from repurchasing, redeeming or otherwise acquiring shares of its common stock, if the Corporation is in arrears on any quarterly cash dividend due on the Series A Preferred Stock. In 2010, at the request of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond (the \u201cReserve Bank\u201d), the Corporation elected to defer regularly scheduled quarterly dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock. In April 2014, the Corporation received approval from the Reserve Bank to terminate that deferral by making the quarterly dividend payments due in May 2014, and it thereafter received approvals to pay the quarter dividends due in August 2014, November 2014 and February 2015. For the foreseeable future, the Corporation\u2019s ability to make each future quarterly dividend payment due under the Series A Preferred Stock will depend on its receipt of an approval from the Reserve Bank. In addition, it should be noted that the Corporation\u2019s ability to make future quarterly dividend payments will depend in large part on its receipt of dividends from the Bank, and the Bank may pay dividends only with the prior approval of the FDIC and the Maryland Commissioner. As a result of these limitations, no assurance can be given that the Corporation will make the quarterly dividend payments due under the Series A Preferred Stock in any future quarter. If the Corporation and/or the Bank do not receive the approvals necessary for the Corporation to make a future quarterly dividend payment, then Corporation would be prohibited from paying cash dividends on or making other distributions with respect to the shares of its common stock.\n[20]\nThe Corporation and the Bank have entered into informal agreements with their regulators that limit their ability to pay dividends and make other distributions on outstanding securities.\nThe Corporation has entered into an informal agreement with the Reserve Bank pursuant to which it agreed to obtain the Reserve Bank\u2019s approval before paying dividends on outstanding shares of its common stock or on outstanding shares of its Series A Preferred Stock, making interest payments under the Corporation\u2019s junior subordinated debentures (\u201cTPS Debentures\u201d) underlying the trust preferred securities issued by the Trusts, or taking any other action that would reduce regulatory capital. The Bank has entered into a similar agreement with the FDIC and the Maryland Commissioner. These agreements give our regulators the ability to prohibit a proposed dividend payment, or any other distribution with respect to outstanding securities, including the repurchase of stock, at a time or times when applicable banking and corporate laws would otherwise permit such a dividend or distribution. There is no requirement that our regulators take consistent approaches when exercising their powers under these agreements. For example, even though the Reserve Bank might approve the payment of a particular dividend, that dividend could be effectively prohibited by the FDIC and/or the Maryland Commissioner if the Corporation intended to fund that dividend through a dividend by the Bank and the FDIC and/or the Maryland Commissioner were to deny the Bank\u2019s dividend request. Similarly, even though the FDIC and the Maryland Commissioner might approve a dividend by the Bank to the Corporation, the Reserve Bank could prevent the Corporation from using that dividend to make a distribution to the holders of its outstanding common stock, Series A Preferred Stock, or outstanding TPS Debentures. These agreements increase the likelihood that we will realize the other risks discussed below related to our ability to pay dividends and make other distributions.\nThe Corporation\u2019s ability to pay dividends on its capital securities is also subject to the terms of the outstanding TPS Debentures, which prohibit the Corporation from paying dividends during an interest deferral period.\nIn March 2004, the Corporation issued approximately $30.9 million of TPS Debentures to Trust I and Trust II in connection with the sales by those Trusts of $30.0 in mandatorily redeemable preferred capital securities to third party investors. Between December 2009 and January 2010, the Corporation issued approximately $10.8 million of TPS Debentures to Trust III in connection with the sale by Trust III of approximately $10.5 million in mandatorily redeemable preferred capital securities to third party investors. The terms of the TPS Debentures require the Corporation to make quarterly payments of interest to the Trusts, as the holders of the TPS Debentures, although the Corporation has the right to defer payments of interest for up to 20 consecutive quarterly periods. An election to defer interest payments does not constitute an event of default under the terms of the TPS Debentures. The terms of the TPS Debentures prohibit the Corporation from declaring or paying any dividends or making other distributions on, or from repurchasing, redeeming or otherwise acquiring, any shares of its common stock or shares of its Series A Preferred Stock if the Corporation elects to defer quarterly interest payments under the TPS Debentures. In addition, a deferral election will require the Trusts to likewise defer the payment of quarterly dividends on their related trust preferred securities.\nIn 2010, at the request of the Reserve Bank, the Corporation elected to defer regularly scheduled quarterly interest payments under the TPS Debentures, and this deferral required the Trusts to defer regular quarterly dividend payments on their trust preferred securities. In February 2014, the Corporation received approval from the Reserve Bank to terminate that deferral by making the quarterly interest payments due to the Trusts in March 2014, and the Corporation thereafter received approvals to make the quarterly interest payments due in June 2014, September 2014, December 2014 and March 2015. For the foreseeable future, the Corporation\u2019s ability to make each future quarterly interest payment will depend on its receipt of an approval from the Reserve Bank. In addition, it should be noted that the Corporation\u2019s ability to make future quarterly interest payments under the TPS Debentures will depend in large part on its receipt of dividends from the Bank, and the Bank may pay dividends only with the prior approval of the FDIC and the Maryland Commissioner. As a result of these limitations, no assurance can be given that the Corporation will make the quarterly interest payments due under the TPS Debentures in any future quarter. If the Corporation and/or the Bank do not receive the approvals necessary for the Corporation to make any future quarterly interest payment, then the Corporation would be prohibited from paying cash dividends on or making other distributions with respect to the shares of its common stock or the shares of its Series A Preferred Stock.\nIf the Corporation fails to make six quarterly dividend payments on the Series A Preferred Stock, then the holders thereof would have the right to elect up to two additional directors to the Corporation\u2019s Board of Directors.\nThe terms of the Series A Preferred Stock permit the Corporation to defer the payment of quarterly dividends, but, in that case, undeclared dividends will continue to accrue and must be paid in full at the time the Corporation terminates the dividend deferral. The terms further provide that whenever, at any time or times, dividends payable on the outstanding shares of the Series A Preferred Stock have not been paid for an aggregate of six quarterly dividend periods or more, whether or not consecutive, the authorized number of directors then constituting the Corporation\u2019s Board of Directors will automatically be increased by two. Thereafter, holders of the Series A Preferred Stock, together with holders of any outstanding stock having voting rights similar to the Series A Preferred Stock, voting as a single class, will be entitled to fill the vacancies created by the automatic increase by electing up to two additional directors (the \u201cPreferred Stock Directors\u201d) at the next annual meeting (or at a special meeting called for the purpose of electing the Preferred Stock Directors prior to the next annual meeting) and at each subsequent annual meeting until all accrued and unpaid dividends for all past dividend periods have been paid in full. The Corporation currently does not have any outstanding stock with voting rights on par with the Series A Preferred Stock.\n[21]\nApplicable banking and Maryland laws impose additional restrictions on the ability of the Corporation and the Bank to pay dividends and make other distributions on their capital securities, and, in any event, the payment of dividends is at the discretion of the boards of directors of the Corporation and the Bank.\nIn the past, the Corporation\u2019s ability to pay dividends to shareholders has been largely dependent upon the receipt of dividends from the Bank. Since December 2009, the Corporation had used its cash to pay dividends. In December 2010, however, the Corporation contributed substantially all of its excess cash to the Bank to strengthen the Bank\u2019s capital levels. Accordingly, in the event that the Corporation desires to pay cash dividends on the common stock and/or the Series A Preferred Stock in the future, and assuming such dividends are then permitted under the terms of the Series A Preferred Stock and the TPS Debentures, the Corporation will likely need to rely on dividends from the Bank to pay such dividends, and there can be no guarantee that the Bank will be able to pay such dividends. Both federal and state laws impose restrictions on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends. Under Maryland law, a state-chartered commercial bank may pay dividends only out of undivided profits or, with the prior approval of the Maryland Commissioner, from surplus in excess of 100% of required capital stock. If, however, the surplus of a Maryland bank is less than 100% of its required capital stock, cash dividends may not be paid in excess of 90% of net earnings. In addition to these specific restrictions, bank regulatory agencies have the ability to prohibit proposed dividends by a financial institution which would otherwise be permitted under applicable regulations if the regulatory body determines that such distribution would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. Banks that are considered \u201ctroubled institution\u201d are prohibited by federal law from paying dividends altogether. Notwithstanding the foregoing, shareholders must understand that the declaration and payment of dividends and the amounts thereof are at the discretion of the Corporation\u2019s Board of Directors. Thus, even at times when the Corporation is not prohibited from paying cash dividends on its capital securities, neither the payment of such dividends nor the amounts thereof can be guaranteed.\nThe Corporation\u2019s Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws and Maryland law may discourage a corporate takeover.\nThe Corporation\u2019s Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation (the \u201cCharter\u201d) and its Amended and Restated Bylaws, as amended (the \u201cBylaws\u201d) contain certain provisions designed to enhance the ability of the Corporation\u2019s Board of Directors to deal with attempts to acquire control of the Corporation. First, the Board of Directors is classified into three classes. Directors of each class serve for staggered three-year periods, and no director may be removed except for cause, and then only by the affirmative vote of either a majority of the entire Board of Directors or a majority of the outstanding voting stock. Second, the board has the authority to classify and reclassify unissued shares of stock of any class or series of stock by setting, fixing, eliminating, or altering in any one or more respects the preferences, rights, voting powers, restrictions and qualifications of, dividends on, and redemption, conversion, exchange, and other rights of, such securities. The board could use this authority, along with its authority to authorize the issuance of securities of any class or series, to issue shares having terms favorable to management to a person or persons affiliated with or otherwise friendly to management. In addition, the Bylaws require any shareholder who desires to nominate a director to abide by strict notice requirements.\nMaryland law also contains anti-takeover provisions that apply to the Corporation. The Maryland Business Combination Act generally prohibits, subject to certain limited exceptions, corporations from being involved in any \u201cbusiness combination\u201d (defined as a variety of transactions, including a merger, consolidation, share exchange, asset transfer or issuance or reclassification of equity securities) with any \u201cinterested shareholder\u201d for a period of five years following the most recent date on which the interested shareholder became an interested shareholder. An interested shareholder is defined generally as a person who is the beneficial owner of 10% or more of the voting power of the outstanding voting stock of the corporation after the date on which the corporation had 100 or more beneficial owners of its stock or who is an affiliate or associate of the corporation and was the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of 10% percent or more of the voting power of the then outstanding stock of the corporation at any time within the two-year period immediately prior to the date in question and after the date on which the corporation had 100 or more beneficial owners of its stock. The Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act applies to acquisitions of \u201ccontrol shares\u201d, which, subject to certain exceptions, are shares the acquisition of which entitle the holder, directly or indirectly, to exercise or direct the exercise of the voting power of shares of stock of the corporation in the election of directors within any of the following ranges of voting power: one-tenth or more, but less than one-third of all voting power; one-third or more, but less than a majority of all voting power or a majority or more of all voting power. Control shares have limited voting rights.\nAlthough these provisions do not preclude a takeover, they may have the effect of discouraging, delaying or deferring a tender offer or takeover attempt that a shareholder might consider in his or her best interest, including those attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the common stock. Such provisions will also render the removal of the Board of Directors and of management more difficult and, therefore, may serve to perpetuate current management. These provisions could potentially adversely affect the market prices of the Corporation\u2019s securities.", "PERMNO": 77889, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "FUNC"}
