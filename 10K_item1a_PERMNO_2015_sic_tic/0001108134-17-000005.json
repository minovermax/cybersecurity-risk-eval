{"cik": "1108134", "company": "BERKSHIRE HILLS BANCORP INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-01", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe risks set forth below, in addition to the other risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, may adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition, and operating results. In addition to the risks set forth below and the other risks described in this annual report, there may also be additional risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to the Company or that the Company currently deems to be immaterial that could materially and adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition or operating results. As a result, past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. Further, to the extent that any of the information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K constitutes forward-looking statements, the risk factors set forth below also are cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company.\nLending\nDeterioration in the Housing Sector, Commercial Real Estate, and Related Markets May Adversely Affect Business and Financial Results.\nReal estate lending is a major business activity for the Company. Real estate market conditions affect the value and marketability of real estate collateral, and they also affect the cash flows, liquidity, and net worth of many borrowers whose operations and finances depend on real estate market conditions. Adverse conditions in the Company's market areas could reduce growth rates, affect the ability of our customers to repay their loans, and generally affect the Company's financial condition and results of operations. In December, 2015 federal regulators issued a statement to remind financial institutions of existing guidance on prudent risk management of commercial real estate lending through economic cycles. Housing sector prices in certain markets and property types continued to escalate in 2016, raising the potential for bubbles. Potential increases in interest rates could increase capitalization rates which could adversely affect commercial property appraisals and collateral value.\nThe Company\u2019s Emphasis on Commercial Lending May Expose the Company to Increased Lending Risks, Which Could Hurt Profits.\nThe Company emphasizes commercial lending, which generally exposes the Company to a greater risk of nonpayment and loss because repayment of such loans often depends on the successful operations and income stream of the borrowers. Commercial loans are historically more susceptible to delinquency, default, and loss during economic downturns. Commercial lending involves larger loan sizes and larger relationship exposures, with greater potential impact on profits in the event of adverse loan performance. The majority of the Company\u2019s commercial loans are secured by real estate and subject to the previously discussed real estate risk factors. Commercial lending sometimes involves construction or other development financing, which is dependent on the future success of new operations. Commercial lending activities have extended across wider parts of its New England and New York /New Jersey markets into areas where the Company has less business experience. The Company\u2019s asset based lending group depends on the Company\u2019s processes for monitoring liquid loan collateral and maintaining appropriate borrowing base collateral cushions to protect these loans in the event of the borrower\u2019s financial distress. The Company has expanded and re-engineered its small business loan origination process in order to accelerate growth. The acquisitions of Firestone Financial, 44 Business Capital, and First Choice Bank have expanded the Company\u2019s commercial lending outside of the Northeast and involve customers and business operations more removed from its traditional customer base and operating organization. Additionally, the Company has expanded its wholesale purchases of loans and loan participations with other banks in its markets and outside of its markets, including participations in shared national credits. Geographic expansion may result in new risks not recognized by the company or which it is unfamiliar with monitoring or resolving.\nThe Company is subject to a variety of risks in connection with any sale of loans it may conduct.\nIn connection with the Company\u2019s sale of one or more loan portfolios, it may make certain representations and warranties to the purchaser concerning the loans sold and the procedures under which those loans have been originated and serviced. If any of these representations and warranties are invalid, the Company may be required to indemnify the purchaser for any related losses, or it may be required to repurchase part or all of the effected loans. The Company may also be required to repurchase loans as a result of borrower fraud or in the event of early payment default by the borrower on a loan it has sold. If the Company is required to make any indemnity payments\nor repurchases and does not have a remedy available to it against a solvent counterparty, the Company may not be able to recover its losses resulting from these indemnity payments and repurchases. Consequently, the Company\u2019s results of operations may be adversely affected. The Company\u2019s ability to maintain seller/servicer relationships with government agencies and government backed entities may be jeopardized in the event of the emergence of one or more of the above risks. Demand for the Company\u2019s loans in the secondary markets could also be affected by these risks, which could lead to a reduction in related business activities.\nIn addition, the Company must report as held for sale any loans that it has undertaken to sell, whether or not a purchase agreement for the loans has been executed. The Company may therefore be unable to ultimately complete a sale for part or all of the loans it classifies as held for sale. Management must exercise its judgment in determining when loans must be reclassified from held for investment status to held for sale status under applicable accounting guidelines. Any failure to accurately report loans as held for sale could result in restatements and regulatory investigations and monetary penalties. Any of these actions could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. Reclassifying loans from held for investment to held for sale also requires that the affected loans be marked to the lower of cost or fair value. As a result, any loans classified as held for sale may be adversely affected as a result of changes in fair value resulting from changes in interest rates and by changes in the borrower\u2019s creditworthiness. The Company may be required to reduce the value of any loans it marks as held for sale, which could adversely affect its results of operations.\nNew Regulations Could Restrict the Company\u2019s Consumer Lending Activities. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (\"CFPB\") issued a rule designed to clarify for lenders how they can avoid monetary damages under the Dodd-Frank Act, which would hold lenders accountable for ensuring a borrower\u2019s ability to repay a mortgage. Loans that meet this \u201cqualified mortgage\u201d definition will be presumed to have complied with the new ability-to-repay standard. The CFPB\u2019s rule on qualified mortgages could limit the Company's ability or desire to make certain types of loans or loans to certain borrowers, or could make it more expensive and/or time consuming to make these loans, which could limit growth or profitability. CFPB rules on other types of consumer lending could similarly affect the cost and profitability of other consumer lending activities.\nThe Company is exposed to risk of environmental liability when it takes title to property. In the course of its business, the Company may foreclose on and take title to real estate. As a result, the Company could be subject to environmental liabilities with respect to these properties. The Company may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination or may be required to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic substances or chemical releases at a property. The costs associated with investigation or remediation activities could be substantial. In addition, if the Company is the owner or former owner of a contaminated site, the Company may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property. If the Company becomes subject to significant environmental liabilities, its business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOperating\nExpansion, Growth, and Acquisitions Could Negatively Impact Earnings If Not Successful.\nThe Company plans to grow organically, by geographic expansion, through business line expansion, and through acquisitions. The Company has recently expanded into new geographic markets and anticipates continued expansion into additional geographic markets. The success of this expansion depends on the Company's ability to continue to maintain and develop an infrastructure appropriate to support and integrate such growth. Also, success depends on the acceptance by customers in these new markets and, in the case of expansion through acquisitions, success depends on many factors, including the long-term recruitment and retention of key personnel and acquired customer relationships. Profitability depends on whether the income generated in the new markets will offset the increased expenses of operating a larger entity, with more staff, more locations, and more product offerings. The Company implemented certain expense restructuring activities, related in part to the rationalization of acquired operations. Such activities expose the Company to risk that revenues may be affected or that changes in operations may result in inefficiencies or control deficiencies that could contribute to financial or market share losses.\nThe Company continues to identify and evaluate opportunities to expand through acquisition of banks, branches, finance companies, insurance agencies, and wealth management firms. Merger and acquisition activities are subject\nto a number of risks, including lending, operating, and integration risks. Such growth requires careful due diligence, evaluation of risks, and projections of future operations and financial conditions. Actual results may differ from expectations and could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations. Acquisitions often involve the negotiation and execution of extensive merger agreements, which may lead to litigation risks or operating constraints.\nThe Company has recruited executive and business line management to support its growth and expansion, and it has absorbed management of acquired operations. The integration of new management exposes the Company to retention risks, operating risks, and financial risks. Such recruitment can affect the retention of new and old business, and can also be affected by competitive reactions and other relationship risks in retaining accounts.\nRegulatory examinations may result in the identification of operating matters requiring attention, undisclosed deficiencies related to regulatory compliance, deficiencies resulting from the integration and subsequent activities of acquired operations, or impacts on existing business operations which are being integrated with the acquired operations. Deficiencies related to regulatory compliance may result in changes that affect operating revenues and costs, including the scope or scale of business activities and/or potential future expansion initiatives. As a privately held company, Firestone was not previously subject to bank regulatory supervision and the integration of its operations required additional compliance initiatives for existing and acquired operations. Additional compliance activities were necessary to integrate the SBA lending operations of 44 Business Capital as a division of Berkshire Bank, the financial advisory operations of Ronald N. Lazzaro, P.C., and the mortgage banking operations of First Choice Loan Services as a subsidiary of Berkshire Bank.\nThe Company has grown to have total assets that are approaching the $10 billion threshold for additional Dodd Frank regulatory requirements. These regulations affect revenues and operating costs, and introduce additional compliance requirements. If additional investments in growth are not sufficiently profitable, some profitability metrics may be reduced. The Company may also face additional acquisition approval requirements, and growth plans could be slowed if expected approvals are not obtained.\nCompetition From Financial Institutions and Other Financial Service Providers May Adversely Affect the Company\u2019s Growth and Profitability.\nCompetition in the banking and financial services industry is intense. Larger banking institutions have substantially greater resources and lending limits and may offer certain services not offered by the Company. Local competitors with excess capital may accept lower returns on new business. There is increased competition by out-of-market competitors through the internet and mobile technology. Federal regulations and financial support programs may in some cases favor competitors. Competition includes competition for banking teams and talent. Competition creates risk that revenues, earnings, or market share could be adversely affected by the loss of talent.\nMarket Changes May Adversely Affect Demand For The Company\u2019s Services and Impact Revenue, Costs, and Earnings.\nChannels for servicing the Company\u2019s customers are evolving rapidly, with less reliance on traditional branch facilities, more use of online and mobile banking, and demand for universal bankers and other relationship managers who can service multiple product lines. The Company has an ongoing process for evaluating the profitability of its branch system and other office and operational facilities. The identification of unprofitable operations and facilities can lead to restructuring charges and introduce the risk of disruptions to revenues and customer relationships. The Company competes with larger providers who are rapidly evolving their service channels and escalating the costs of evolving the service process.\nThe Company is Subject to Security and Operational Risks Relating to the Use of Technology that Could Damage the Company's Reputation and Business.\nSecurity breaches of confidential information in our technology platforms could expose the Company to possible liability and damage its reputation. Any compromise of data security could also deter customers from using the Company's internet banking services. The Company relies on industry standard internet security and authentication systems to effect secure transmission of data. These precautions may not protect the Company's security systems from compromises or breaches and could result in damage to its reputation and business. The Company utilizes\nthird party core banking software, in addition to other outsourced data processing. If third party providers encounter difficulties or if the Company has difficulty in communicating and/or transmitting with such third parties, it could significantly affect its ability to adequately process and account for customer transactions, which could significantly affect its business operations. The Company utilizes file encryption in designated internal systems and networks and are subject to certain state and federal regulations regarding how the Company manages data security. The Company's enterprise governance risk and compliance function includes a framework of controls, policies and technologies to monitor and protect information from cyberattacks, mishandling, and loss, together with safeguards related to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information. Natural disasters and disaster recovery risks could affect its operating systems, which could affect its reputation. The Company's business continuity program addresses crisis management, business impact, and data and systems recovery. Potential problems with the management of technology security and operational risks may affect regulatory compliance, which could affect operating costs and expansion plans.\nThe Company Faces Cybersecurity Risks, Including Denial of Service Attacks, Hacking and Identity Theft that Could Result in the Disclosure of Confidential Information or the Creation of Unauthorized Transactions, Which Could Adversely Affect the Company\u2019s Business or Reputation and Create Significant Legal and Financial Exposure.\nThe Company\u2019s computer systems and network infrastructure are subject to security risks and could be susceptible to cyber-attacks, such as denial of service attacks, hacking, terrorist activities or identity theft. Financial services institutions and companies engaged in data processing have reported breaches in the security of their websites or other systems, some of which have involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information, destroy data, steal financial assets, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems, often through the introduction of computer viruses or malware, cyber-attacks and other means. Denial of service attacks have been launched against a number of large financial services institutions. As a growing regional bank, the Company may be subject to similar attacks in the future. Hacking and identity theft risks could cause serious reputational harm and possible financial loss to the Company. Cyber threats are rapidly evolving and the Company may not be able to anticipate or prevent all such attacks.\nThe Company may incur increasing costs in an effort to minimize these risks and could be held liable for any security breach or loss. Despite efforts to ensure the integrity of its systems, the Company will not be able to anticipate all security breaches of these types, and the Company may not be able to implement effective preventive measures against such security breaches. The techniques used by cyber criminals change frequently and can originate from a wide variety of sources, including outside groups such as external service providers, organized crime affiliates, terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments. Those parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers or other users of the Company\u2019s systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to its data or that of its clients or to conduct unauthorized financial transactions.\nThese risks may increase in the future as the Company continues to increase its mobile-payment and other internet-based product offerings and expands its internal usage of web-based products and applications. A successful penetration or circumvention of system security could cause serious negative consequences to the Company, including significant disruption of operations, misappropriation of confidential information of the Company or that of its customers, or damage to computers or systems of the Company or those of its customers and counterparties. A security breach could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws, financial loss to the Company or to its customers, loss of confidence in the Company\u2019s security measures, significant litigation exposure, and harm to the Company\u2019s reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nThe Company needs to stay current on technological changes in order to compete and meet customer demands.\nThe financial services market, including banking services, is undergoing rapid changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. In addition to better serving customers, the effective use of technology increases efficiency and may enable the Company to reduce costs. The Company\u2019s future success may depend, in part, on its ability to use technology to provide products and services that provide convenience to customers and to create additional efficiencies in its operations. Some of the Company\u2019s competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements than it currently has. The Company may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these\nproducts and services to its customers. As a result, the Company\u2019s ability to effectively compete to retain or acquire new business may be impaired, and its business, financial condition or results of operations, may be adversely affected.\nFinancial and Operating Counterparties Expose the Company to Risks.\nThe Company's use of derivative financial instruments exposes us to financial and contractual risks with counterparties. The Company maintains correspondent bank relationships, manage certain loan participations, engage in securities and funding transactions, and undergo other activities with financial counterparties that are customary to its industry. The Company also utilizes services from major vendors of technology, telecommunications, and other essential operating services. There is financial and operating risk in these relationships, which the Company seeks to manage through internal controls and procedures, but there are no assurances that the Company will not experience loss or interruption of its business as a result of unforeseen events with these providers. The Company's expanded mortgage banking operations have also exposed us to more counterparty transactions including the use of third parties to participate in the management of interest rate risk and mortgage sales and hedging. Financial and operational risks are inherent in these counterparty relationships. The Company could experience losses if there are failures in the controls or accounting, including those related to derivatives activities or if there are performance failures by any counterparties. The risk of loss is increased when interest rates change suddenly and if the intended hedging objectives are not achieved as a result of market or counterparty behaviors.\nThe Company May Not Be Able to Attract and Retain Skilled People.\nThe Company's success depends, in large part, on its ability to attract new employees, retain and motivate its existing employees, and continue to compensate employees competitively. Competition for the best people can be intense and the Company may not be able to hire or retain appropriately qualified individuals. As a result of expense restructuring activities, the Company could experience challenges in the retention of existing employees.\nControls and Procedures May Fail or Be Circumvented.\nManagement regularly reviews and updates the Company\u2019s internal controls, disclosure requirements and practices, and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure or circumvention of the controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nLiquidity\nThe Company's Wholesale Funding Sources May Prove Insufficient to Replace Deposits at Maturity and Support Operations and Future Growth.\nThe Company must maintain sufficient funds to respond to the needs of depositors and borrowers. As a part of its liquidity management, the Company uses a number of funding sources in addition to deposit growth and cash flows from loans and investments. These sources include Federal Home Loan Bank advances, proceeds from the sale of loans, and liquidity resources at the holding company. The Company uses brokered deposits both to support ongoing growth and to provide enhanced deposit insurance to support large dollar commercial relationships. The Company's financial flexibility will be severely constrained if the Company is unable to maintain access to wholesale funding or if adequate financing is not available to accommodate future growth at acceptable costs. Finally, if the Company is required to rely more heavily on more expensive funding sources to support future growth, revenues may not increase proportionately to cover costs. In this case, operating margins and profitability would be adversely affected. Turbulence in the capital and credit markets may adversely affect liquidity and financial condition and the willingness of certain counterparties and customers to do business with the Company.\nThe Company's Ability to Service Our Debt, Pay Dividends, and Otherwise Pay Obligations as They Come Due Is Substantially Dependent on Capital Distributions from the Bank, and These Distributions Are Subject to Regulatory Limits and Other Restrictions.\nA substantial source of holding company income is the receipt of dividends from the Bank, from which the Company services debt, pay obligations, and pay shareholder dividends. The availability of dividends from the\nBank is limited by various statutes and regulations. It is possible, depending upon the financial condition of the Bank and other factors, that the applicable regulatory authorities could assert that payment of dividends or other types of payments are an unsafe or unsound practice. If the Bank is unable to pay dividends to us, the Company may not be able to service debt, pay our obligations, or pay dividends on its common stock. The inability to receive dividends from the Bank would adversely affect its business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nSecondary mortgage market conditions could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nIn December 2016, the Company acquired First Choice Bank and its mortgage banking subsidiary, First Choice Loan Services. The Company has also expanded its recruitment and re-engineered its mortgage banking activities (including a systems conversion) and changed its management of this function. In addition to being affected by interest rates, the secondary mortgage markets are also subject to investor demand for residential mortgage loans and increased investor yield requirements for these loans. These conditions may fluctuate or worsen in the future. As a result, a prolonged period of secondary market illiquidity may reduce the Company\u2019s loan production volumes and could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations.\nSecondary markets are significantly affected by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae (collectively, the \u201cAgencies\u201d) for loan purchases that meet their conforming loan requirements. The Company cannot provide assurance that the Agencies will not materially limit purchases of conforming loans due to capital constraints, a change in the criteria for conforming loans or other factors. Additionally, various proposals have been made to reform the U.S. residential mortgage finance market, including the role of the Agencies. The exact effects of any such reforms are not yet known, but they may limit the Company\u2019s ability to sell conforming loans, As a result, its ability to fund, and thus originate, additional mortgage loans may be adversely affected, which would adversely affect its results of operations.\nInterest Rates\nMarket Interest Rate Conditions Could Adversely Affect Results of Operations and Financial Condition.\nNet interest income is the Company's largest source of income. Changes in interest rates can affect the level of net interest income and other elements of net income. The Company\u2019s interest rate sensitivity is discussed in more detail in Item 7A of this report. The Company principally manages interest rate risk by managing its volume and mix of earning assets and funding liabilities and through the use of derivative financial instruments. In a changing interest rate environment, the Company may not be able to manage this risk effectively. If the Company is unable to manage interest rate risk effectively, its business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed. Changes in interest rates can also affect the demand for the Company\u2019s products and services, and the supply conditions in the U.S. financial and capital markets. Changes in the level of interest rates may negatively affect the Company\u2019s ability to originate real estate loans, the value of its assets and its ability to realize gains from the sale of assets, all of which ultimately affect earnings.\nIn recent years the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s policy has been to maintain interest rates at historically low levels through its targeted federal funds rate and the purchase of mortgage-backed securities. Although the Federal Reserve Board has recently increased target interest rates, market interest rates on the loans the Company has originated and the yields on securities it has purchased since 2008 have been lower than in prior years. The Company\u2019s ability to reduce its interest expense is limited at current interest rate levels while the average yield on its interest-earning assets may continue to decrease. A continuation of a low interest rate environment may adversely affect its net interest income, which would have an adverse effect on its profitability.\nSecurities Market Values\nDeclines in the Value of Certain Investment Securities Could Require Write-Downs, Which Would Reduce Earnings.\nUnrealized losses on investment securities can result from changes in interest rates, credit spreads and liquidity issues in the marketplace, along with changes in the credit profile of individual securities issuers. A continued decline in the value of these securities or other factors could result in an other-than-temporary impairment write-down which would reduce earnings. The Company\u2019s investment in equity securities and non-investment grade debt\nsecurities present heightened credit and price risks. Some of the Company\u2019s securities are locally originated economic development bonds. These securities could become impaired due to adverse economic and real estate market conditions which also affect loan risk. The Company has an investment in the stock of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston (\"FHLBB\"). If the capitalization of a Federal Home Loan Bank, including the FHLBB, became substantially diminished it could result in a write-down which would reduce earnings. Future regulatory pronouncements could affect the securities portfolio and its carrying value.\nTaxation\nChanges in Tax Preference Items May Affect Results of Operations.\nThe Company\u2019s effective income tax rate is lower than the statutory rate. The benefit of tax preference items includes benefits related to the Bank\u2019s increased equity ownership in investment tax credit entities discussed below in the Income Tax Expense section of Item 7. Higher tax expense due to planned or unplanned changes in tax preference items may result in lower profitability. Quarterly results depend on the timing of investments and accounting principles for income tax expense recognition, and quarterly results may vary significantly from annual results.\nChanges in Federal Tax Policy May Affect Results of Operations.\nProposals are under consideration for major changes in U.S. tax law. These include potential reductions in the corporate tax rate, but changes may also be made to deductions and other major aspects of U.S. tax law. Any reductions in the tax rate could require a write-down of the deferred tax asset. Changes could affect the Company\u2019s financial results and also could affect the profitability of tax preferred investments. Changes that affect customers, including the deductibility of interest expense and potential new border taxes, could have negative impacts on economic conditions, customer behaviors, and the Company\u2019s profitability.\nRegulatory\nLegislative and Regulatory Initiatives May Affect Business Activities and Increase Operating Costs.\nThe potential exists for additional federal or state laws and regulations regarding lending, funding practices, capital, and liquidity standards. In addition, new laws, regulations, and other regulatory changes may also increase compliance costs and affect business and operations. Moreover, the FDIC sets the cost of FDIC insurance premiums, which can affect profitability.\nThe Company is required by federal and state regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support operations. Regulatory capital requirements and their impact on the Company may change. It may need to raise additional capital in the future to support operations and continued growth. The Company's ability to raise capital, if needed, will depend on conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside of its control, and financial performance. If the Company cannot raise additional capital when needed, it could affect operations and the execution of the strategic plan, which includes further expanding operations through internal growth and acquisitions.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act made extensive changes in the regulation of insured depository institutions. In addition to eliminating the OTS and creating the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Dodd-Frank Act, among other things, directed changes in the way that institutions are assessed for deposit insurance, mandated the imposition of more rigorous consolidated capital requirements on savings and loan holding companies, required originators of certain securitized loans to retain a percentage of the risk for the transferred loans, stipulated regulatory rate-setting for certain debit card interchange fees, repealed restrictions on the payment of interest on commercial demand deposits, and contained a number of reforms related to mortgage originations. The impact of many of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act is ongoing as further regulations are promulgated. The Company expects that the Dodd-Frank Act will, at a minimum, result in increased regulatory burden, compliance costs and interest expense for the Company. New laws, regulations, and other regulatory changes, along with negative developments in the financial industry and the domestic and international credit markets, may significantly affect the markets in which the Company does business, the markets for and value of its loans and investments, and ongoing operations, costs and profitability. For more information, see \u201cRegulation and Supervision\u201d in Item 1 of this report.\nThe Long-term Impact of the Changing Regulatory Capital Requirements and New Capital Rules is Uncertain.\nThe federal banking agencies have adopted proposals that have substantially amended the regulatory risk-based capital rules applicable to the Bank and the Company. The amendments implemented the \u201cBasel III\u201d regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act. The new rules apply regulatory capital requirements to both the Bank and the consolidated Company. The amended rules included new minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratios, which became effective in January 2015, with certain requirements being phased in at the beginning of 2016, and refined the definition of what constitutes \u201ccapital\u201d for purposes of calculating those ratios.\nThe new minimum capital level requirements applicable to the Bank and the Company include: (i) a new common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6% (increased from 4%); (iii) a total risk-based capital ratio of 8% (unchanged from current rules); and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4% for all institutions. The amended rules also establish a \u201ccapital conservation buffer\u201d of 2.5% above the new regulatory minimum capital ratios, and would result in the following minimum ratios: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%; (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5%; and (iii) a total capital ratio of 10.5%. The new capital conservation buffer requirement will be phased in beginning in January 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and will increase each year until fully implemented in January 2019. An institution will be subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the buffer amount. These limitations will establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions.\nThe Basel III changes and other regulatory capital requirements result in generally higher regulatory capital standards. The application of more stringent capital requirements to the Bank and the consolidated Company could, among other things, result in lower returns on invested capital, require the raising of additional capital, and result in regulatory actions if the Company failed to comply with such requirements. Furthermore, the imposition of liquidity requirements in connection with the implementation of Basel III could result in having to lengthen the term of funding, restructure the Company's business models, and/or increase holdings of liquid assets. Implementation of changes to asset risk weightings for risk based capital calculations, items included or deducted in calculating regulatory capital and/or additional capital conservation buffers could result in management modifying its business strategy and could further limit the Company's ability to make distributions, including paying out dividends or buying back shares.\nProvisions of the Company's Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, and Delaware Law, as Well as State and Federal Banking Regulations, Could Delay or Prevent a Takeover of Us by a Third Party.\nProvisions in the Company's certificate of incorporation and bylaws, the corporate law of the State of Delaware, and state and federal regulations could delay, defer or prevent a third party from acquiring us, despite the possible benefit stockholders, or otherwise adversely affect the price of its common stock. These provisions include: limitations on voting rights of beneficial owners of more than 10 percent of common stock; supermajority voting requirements for certain business combinations; the election of directors to staggered terms of three years; and advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the Company's Board of Directors and for proposing matters that stockholders may act on at stockholder meetings. In addition, the Company is subject to Delaware laws, including one that prohibits us from engaging in a business combination with any interested stockholder for a period of three years from the date the person became an interested stockholder unless certain conditions are met. These provisions may discourage potential takeover attempts, discourage bids for the Company's common stock at a premium over market price or adversely affect the market price of, and the voting and other rights of the holders of, its common stock. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors other than the candidates nominated by the Board.\nSignificant Accounting Estimates May Not Be Realized in Accordance with Original Estimates.\nThe Allowance for Loan Losses May Prove to be Insufficient to Absorb Losses in The Loan Portfolio.\nLike all financial institutions, the Company maintains an allowance for loan losses which is its estimate of the probable losses that are inherent in the loan portfolio as of the financial statement date. The allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover actual loan losses, and future provisions for loan losses could materially and adversely affect operating results. The accounting measurements related to impairment and the loan loss allowance\nrequire significant estimates which are subject to uncertainty and changes relating to new information and changing circumstances. Additionally, the allowance can only reflect those losses which are reasonably estimable.\nAccordingly, at any time, there may be probable losses inherent in the portfolio but which are not reasonably estimable until additional information emerges which can form the basis for a reasonable estimate. State and\nfederal regulators, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the allowance for loan losses through additional provisions for loan losses charged to expense, or to decrease the allowance for loan losses through loan charge-offs, net of recoveries. Any such additional provisions for loan losses or charge-offs, as required by these regulatory agencies, could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations.\nEstimates Related to Accounting for Acquired Loans May Differ From Actual Results.\nUnder generally accepted principles for business combinations, there is no loan loss allowance initially recorded for acquired loans, which are recorded at net fair value on the acquisition date. This net fair value generally includes embedded loss estimates for acquired loans with deteriorated credit quality. These estimates are based on projections of expected cash flows for these problem loans, which in many cases rely on estimates deriving from the liquidation of collateral. If the projections are inadequate, the fair value estimates may exceed the actual collectability of the balances, and this may result in the related loans being considered by the Company Berkshire as impaired, which would result in a reduction in interest income. The tangible book value recorded by the Company is based in part on these estimates, and if fair value estimates differ from actual collectability and subsequent earnings may differ from original estimates. Measures of tangible book value and earnings impacts of business combinations are frequently used in evaluating the merits and value of business combinations. The Company has recorded significant income resulting from collections of acquired impaired loans which exceeded the fair value estimates originally established. Additionally, accounting for acquired loans involves ongoing assessments of the timing and amount of expected loan collections. Numerous assumptions and estimates are integral to purchased loan accounting, and actual results could be different from prior estimates.\nAcquisitions Have Resulted in Significant Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Which if they Become Impaired Would be Required to be Written Down, Resulting in a Negative Impact on Earnings.\nThe initial recording and subsequent impairment testing of goodwill and other intangible assets requires subjective judgments about the estimates of the fair value of assets acquired. Factors that may significantly affect the estimates include specific industry or market sector conditions, changes in revenue growth trends, customer behavior, competitive forces, cost structures and changes in discount rates. It is possible that future impairment testing could result in an impairment of the value of goodwill or intangible assets, or both. If the Company determines impairment exists at a given point in time, earnings and the book value of the related intangible asset(s) will be reduced by the amount of the impairment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the results of impairment testing on goodwill and adjusted deposit intangible assets have no impact on tangible book value or regulatory capital levels. These are non-GAAP financial measures. They are not a substitute for GAAP measures and should only be considered in conjunction with the Company\u2019s GAAP financial information.\nMergers and Acquisitions\nAcquisitions may disrupt the Company\u2019s business and dilute stockholder value.\nThe Company completed its acquisition of First Choice Bank and First Choice Loan Services in December 2016. The Company regularly evaluates merger and acquisition opportunities with other financial institutions and financial services companies. As a result, negotiations may take place and future mergers or acquisitions involving cash, debt, or equity securities may occur from time to time. The Company seeks acquisition partners that offer either significant market presence or the potential to expand its market footprint and improve profitability through economies of scale or expanded services.\nAcquiring other banks, businesses, or branches may have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial results and may involve various other risks commonly associated with acquisitions, including, among other things:\n\u2022\ndifficulty in estimating the value of the target company\n\u2022\npayment of a premium over book and market values that may dilute the Company\u2019s tangible book value and earnings per share in the short and long term;\n\u2022\nexposure to unknown or contingent liabilities, or asset quality problems, of the target company;\n\u2022\nlarger than anticipated merger-related expenses;\n\u2022\ndifficulty and expense of integrating the operations and personnel of the target company, and retaining key employees and customers;\n\u2022\ninability to realize the expected revenue increases, cost savings, increases in geographic or product presence, and/or other projected benefits; and\n\u2022\npotential diversion of Company management\u2019s time and attention.\nIf the Company is unable to successfully integrate an acquired company, the anticipated benefits may not be realized fully or may take longer to realize than expected. A significant decline in asset valuations or cash flows may also cause us not to realize expected benefits.\nAdditional discussion about the risk of acquisitions is included above in the discussion of Operating Risk.\nTrading of the Company's Common Stock\nThe Trading History of The Company\u2019s Common Stock Is Characterized By Low Trading Volume. The Value of Your Investment May be Subject To Sudden Decreases Due To the Volatility of the Price of the Common Stock.\nThe level of interest and trading in the Company\u2019s stock depends on many factors beyond the Company's control. The market price of the Company's common stock may be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to numerous factors, including, but not limited to, the factors discussed in other risk factors and the following: actual or anticipated fluctuations in operating results; changes in interest rates; changes in the legal or regulatory environment; press releases, announcements or publicity relating to the Company or its competitors or relating to trends in its industry; changes in expectations as to future financial performance, including financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts and investors; future sales of its common stock; changes in economic conditions in the marketplace, general conditions in the U.S. economy, financial markets or the banking industry; and other developments affecting competitors or us. These factors may adversely affect the trading price of the Company's common stock, regardless of actual operating performance, and could prevent stockholders from selling their common stock at a desirable price.\nIn the past, stockholders have brought securities class action litigation against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities. The Company could be the target of similar litigation in the future, which could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources.", "PERMNO": 88280, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "BHLB"}
