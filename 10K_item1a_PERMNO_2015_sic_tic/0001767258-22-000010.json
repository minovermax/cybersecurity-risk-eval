{"cik": "1767258", "company": "XPEL, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-28", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThis Annual Report contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including the risks we face as described below and elsewhere in this Annual Report. See \u201cCautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nOperational Risks\nA material disruption from our suppliers, or our inability to obtain a sufficient supply of product from alternate suppliers, could cause us to be unable to meet customer demands or increase our costs.\nIf any of our sources of supply were to deteriorate or operations were to be disrupted as a result of disagreements with one or more of our suppliers, COVID-19, significant equipment failures, natural disasters, earthquakes, power outages, fires, explosions, terrorism, adverse weather conditions, labor disputes or other reasons, we may be unable to fill customer orders or otherwise meet customer demand for our products. Any such disruption or failure by us to obtain a sufficient supply of our products to\nsatisfy customer demand could increase our costs and reduce our sales, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur suppliers have been subject to various supply chain disruptions. While these supply chain disruptions have not yet slowed the delivery of products, any such disruption could cause us to not be able to meet demand due to a lack of inventory and/or cause a significant increase in costs of raw materials and shipping costs. Our ability to produce and timely deliver our products may be materially impacted in the future if these supply chain disruptions continue or worsen. In addition, because of rising costs, we may be forced to increase the price of our products to our customers, or we may have to reduce our gross margins on the products that we sell.\nPursuant to the entrotech agreement between us and entrotech, we had engaged entrotech as a primary supplier for our automotive paint protection film products. During the year ended December 31, 2021, approximately 75% of our annual inventory purchases were purchased from entrotech.\nOn January 20, 2022, we gave notice to entrotech that the Company would not extend the term of the entrotech Agreement in its current form. Accordingly, the entrotech Agreement will terminate on March 21, 2022. The Company intends to enter into a new supply agreement with entrotech; however, we cannot assure you that we will be successful in entering into a new agreement. If we are unable to reach a new agreement with entrotech, we will not have a long-term supply agreement with entrotech, and entrotech could stop manufacturing products for us at any time. If entrotech unilaterally ceased supplying us, our operations would likely be impacted if the Company\u2019s alternate suppliers were unable to meet demand.\nWe rely on one distributor of our products and services in China. The loss of this relationship, or a material disruption in sales by this distributor, could severely harm our business.\nThe Company distributes all of its products in China through one distributor, with sales to such distributor representing approximately 18% of our consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021. The China Distributor places orders with us on a prepaid basis at a price set by us, which we may change with 30 days\u2019 notice. The China Distributor then generates orders, sells and distributes our products to its end customers in China.\nAny failure by the China Distributor to perform its obligations, including a failure to procure sufficient orders of our products to satisfy customer demand or a failure to adequately market our products, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nBecause of our dependence on the China Distributor, any loss of our relationship or any adverse change in the financial health of such distributor that would affect its ability to distribute our products may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nA significant percentage of our revenue is generated from our business in China, a market that is associated with certain risks.\nMaintaining a strong position in the Chinese market is a key component of our global growth strategy. During the year ended December 31, 2021, approximately 18% of our consolidated revenue was generated in China, more than any other country outside of the U.S. in which we operate, and we expect to continue to expand our business in China. However, there are risks generally associated with doing business in China, including:\nSignificant political and economic uncertainties\nHistorically, the Chinese government has exerted substantial influence over the business activities of private companies. Under its current leadership, the Chinese government has been pursuing economic\nreform policies that encourage private economic activity and greater economic decentralization. There is no assurance, however, that the Chinese government will continue to pursue these policies, or that it will not significantly alter these policies from time to time without notice. Furthermore, the Chinese government continues to exercise significant control over the Chinese economy through regulation and state ownership. Changes in China\u2019s laws, regulations or policies, including those affecting taxation, currency, imports, or the nationalization of private enterprises could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, government actions in the future could have a significant effect on economic conditions in China or particular regions thereof, and could require us to divest ourselves of any interest we then hold in Chinese properties.\nTrade policy\nIn 2018, the U.S. government took the stance that China was engaged in unfair trade practices, and instituted a series of tariffs and other trade barriers on China in response. Though the U.S. and China reached a phase one agreement in January 2020, tension persists between the two countries. Although the current U.S. administration has continued to enforce the phase one agreement, the future of U.S. and Chinese trade relations is uncertain. If the current agreement is abandoned, changed or violated by either party, we could be forced to increase the sales price of our products, reduce margins, or otherwise suffer from trade restrictions or changes in policy levied by the U.S. or Chinese governments, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nLimited recourse in China\nWhile the Chinese government has enacted a legal regime surrounding corporate governance and trade, its history of implementing such laws and regulations is limited. It is unclear how successful any attempt to enforce commercial claims or resolve commercial disputes will be. The resolution of any such dispute may be subject to the exercise of considerable discretion by the Chinese government and its agencies and forces unrelated to the legal merits of a particular matter or dispute may influence their determination.\nAdditionally, any rights we may have to specific performance, or to seek an injunction under China law are severely limited, and without a means of recourse by virtue of the Chinese legal system, we may be unable to prevent these situations from occurring. The occurrence of any such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nUncertain interpretation of law\nThere are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of the laws and regulations in the greater China area, including, but not limited to, the laws and regulations governing our business. China\u2019s laws and regulations are frequently subject to change due to rapid economic and social development and many of them were newly enacted within the last ten years. The effectiveness of newly enacted laws, regulations or amendments may be delayed, resulting in detrimental reliance by foreign investors. New laws and regulations that affect existing and proposed future businesses may also be applied retroactively.\nThe Chinese government has broad discretion in dealing with violations of laws and regulations, including levying fines, revoking business permits and other licenses and requiring actions necessary for compliance. In particular, licenses and permits issued or granted to our Company by relevant governmental bodies may be revoked at a later time by higher regulatory bodies. We cannot predict the effect of the interpretation of existing or new Chinese laws or regulations on our businesses. We cannot assure you that our current ownership and operating structure would not be found to be in violation of any current or future Chinese laws or regulations. As a result, we may be subject to sanctions, including fines, and could be required to restructure our operations or cease to provide certain services. In addition, any litigation in China may be protracted and result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and\nmanagement attention. Any of these or similar actions could significantly disrupt our business operations or restrict us from conducting a substantial portion of our business operations, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe loss of one or more of our key personnel, or our failure to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future, could harm our business.\nWe currently depend on the continued services and performance of our executive officers, Ryan L. Pape, our President and Chief Executive Officer, Barry R. Wood, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Mathieu Moreau, our Senior Vice President, Sales and Product, none of whom has an employment agreement. Loss of key personnel, including members of management as well as key product development, marketing, and sales personnel, could disrupt our operations and have an adverse effect on our business. As we continue to grow, we cannot guarantee that we will continue to attract the personnel we need to maintain our competitive position. As we grow, the incentives to attract, retain, and motivate employees may not be as effective as in the past. If we do not succeed in attracting, hiring, and integrating effective personnel, or retaining and motivating existing personnel, our business could be adversely affected.\nThe preparation of our financial statements will involve the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions, and our financial statements may be materially affected if such estimates, judgments and assumptions prove to be inaccurate.\nFinancial statements prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d or \u201cGAAP\u201d) require the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts. Different estimates, judgments and assumptions reasonably could be used that would have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements, and changes in these estimates, judgments and assumptions are likely to occur from period to period in the future. Significant areas of accounting requiring the application of management\u2019s judgment include, but are not limited to, determining the fair value of our assets and the timing and amount of cash flows from our assets. These estimates, judgments and assumptions are inherently uncertain and, if they prove to be wrong, we face the risk that charges to income will be required. Any such charges could significantly harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and the price of our securities. Estimates and assumptions are made on an ongoing basis for the following: revenue recognition, capitalization of software development costs, impairment of long-lived assets, inventory reserves, allowances for doubtful accounts, fair value for business combinations, and impairment of goodwill.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we continually evaluate our internal controls and make improvements as deemed necessary. During the fourth fiscal quarter, we identified and fully remediated a material weakness in our internal controls related to user access controls to our financial system as part of this process. We may identify further significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting for future fiscal years. The failure to remediate significant deficiencies and material weaknesses or to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in the future could adversely affect the accuracy and timeliness of our financial reporting and could result in material misstatements in our financial statements.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting. We continually evaluate our internal controls and make changes and improvements as necessary. During the fourth fiscal quarter, management identified a material weakness in our internal controls related to user access controls to our financial system. This material weakness was fully remediated as of December 31, 2021. There were no errors or misstatements in our financial statements resulting from this identified material weakness. A material weakness is defined as a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented\nor detected on a timely basis. Any failure to maintain or implement new or improved controls, or any difficulties we encounter in their implementation, could result in additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies and could result in material misstatements in our financial statements. Furthermore, any failure in the effectiveness of our system of internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse impact on our ability to report our financial results in an accurate and timely manner and, as a result, our investors, regulators, customers and other business partners may lose confidence in our business or our financial reports, and our access to capital markets may be adversely affected. Any of the foregoing effects could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and operating cash flows.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe are highly dependent on the automotive industry. A prolonged or material contraction in automotive sales and production volumes could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAutomotive sales and production are cyclical and depend on, among other things, general economic conditions, consumer spending, vehicle demand and preferences (which can be affected by a number of factors, including fuel costs, employment levels and the availability of consumer financing). As the volume of automotive production and the mix of vehicles produced fluctuate, the demand for our products may also fluctuate. Prolonged or material contraction in automotive sales and production volumes, or significant changes in the mix of vehicles produced, could cause our customers to reduce purchases of our products and services, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAutomobile manufacturers continue to experience a global semiconductor shortage which has affected production of vehicles and, in turn, the inventory of vehicles at new car dealerships. To the extent that this shortage persists, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFluctuations in the cost and availability of raw materials, equipment, labor and transportation could cause manufacturing delays, increase our costs and/or impact our ability to meet customer demand.\nThe price and availability of key components used to manufacture our products may fluctuate significantly. Any fluctuations in the cost and availability of any of our products and/or any interruptions in the delivery of our products could harm our gross margins and our ability to meet customer demand. If we are unable to successfully mitigate these cost increases, supply interruptions and/or labor shortages, our results of operations could be affected.\nThe after-market automotive product supply business is highly competitive. Competition presents an ongoing threat to the success of our Company.\nWe face significant competition from a number of companies, many of whom have greater financial, marketing and technical resources than us, as well as regional and local companies and lower-cost manufacturers of automotive and other products. Such competition may result in pressure on our profit margins and limit our ability to maintain or increase the market share of our products.\nAdditionally, as we introduce new products and as our existing products evolve, or as other companies introduce new products and services, we may become subject to additional competition. Our principal competitors have significantly greater resources than we do. This may allow our competitors to respond more effectively than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in market\nrequirements. Our competitors may also develop products, features, or services that are similar to ours or that achieve greater market acceptance, may undertake more far-reaching and successful product development efforts or marketing campaigns, or may adopt more aggressive pricing policies. Certain competitors could use strong or dominant positions in one or more markets to gain a competitive advantage against us.\nWe believe that our ability to compete effectively depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control, including:\n\u2022the usefulness, ease of use, performance, and reliability of our products compared to our competitors;\n\u2022the timing and market acceptance of products, including developments and enhancements to our products or our competitors\u2019 products;\n\u2022customer service and support efforts;\n\u2022marketing and selling efforts;\n\u2022our financial condition and results of operations;\n\u2022acquisitions or consolidation within our industry, which may result in more formidable competitors;\n\u2022our ability to attract, retain, and motivate talented employees;\n\u2022our ability to cost-effectively manage and grow our operations;\n\u2022our ability to meet the demands of local markets in high-growth emerging markets, including some in which we have limited experience; and\n\u2022our reputation and brand strength relative to that of our competitors.\nIf we are unable to differentiate or successfully adapt our products, services and solutions from competitors, or if we decide to cut prices or to incur additional costs to remain competitive, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nHarm to our reputation or the reputation of one or more of our products could have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe believe that maintaining and developing the reputation of our products is critical to our success and that the importance of brand recognition for our products increases as competitors offer products similar to our products. We devote significant time and incur substantial marketing and promotional expenditures to create and maintain brand loyalty as well as increase brand awareness of our products. Adverse publicity about us or our brands, including product safety or quality or similar concerns, whether real or perceived, could harm our image or that of our brands and result in an adverse effect on our business, as well as require resources to rebuild our reputation.\nOur revenue and operating results may fluctuate, which may make our results difficult to predict and could cause our results to fall short of expectations.\nAs a result of the rapidly changing nature of the markets in which we compete, our quarterly and annual revenue and operating results may fluctuate from period to period. These fluctuations may be caused by a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. For example, changes in industry or third-party specifications may alter our development timelines and consequently our ability to deliver and monetize new or updated products and services. Other factors that may cause fluctuations in our revenue and operating results include:\n\u2022any failure to maintain strong customer relationships;\n\u2022any failure of significant customers, including distributors, to renew their agreements with us;\n\u2022variations in the demand for our services and products and the use cycles of our services and products by our customers;\n\u2022changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors; and\n\u2022general economic, industry and market conditions and those conditions specific to our business.\nFor these reasons and because the market for our services and products is relatively new and rapidly changing, it is difficult to predict our future financial results.\nIf the model of selling vehicles through dealerships in North America changes dramatically, our revenue could be impacted.\nGenerally, most vehicles in North America are sold through franchised new car dealerships. These dealerships have a strong profit motive and are historically very good at selling accessories and other products. Going forward, if the dealership model were to change in the form of fewer franchised dealerships, or the possibility of manufacturer owned distribution, the prospects in this channel may diminish. Manufacturer-owned sales of new cars might become harder to penetrate or more streamlined with fewer opportunities to sell accessories. This would make us more reliant on our independent installer, retail-oriented channel, which would require more internal efforts and financial resources to create consumer awareness.\nIf ride-sharing or alternate forms of vehicle ownership gain in popularity, our revenue could be impacted.\nIf ride-sharing or alternate forms of vehicle ownership including rental, ride-sharing, or peer-to-peer car sharing gain in popularity, consumers may own fewer vehicles per household, which would reduce our revenue. More vehicles entering a ride-sharing or car-sharing fleet could have an uncertain impact on our revenue as consumers could be less interested in accessorizing vehicles they own that are in the ride-sharing fleet.\nTechnology could render the need for some of our products obsolete.\nWe derive the majority of our revenue from surface and paint protection films, with the majority of products applied on painted surfaces of vehicles. If automotive paint technology were to improve substantially, such that newer paint did not chip, scratch or was generally not as susceptible to damage, our revenue could be impacted.\nSimilarly, our automotive and architectural window films could be impacted by changes or enhancements from automotive manufacturers or window manufacturers that would reduce the need for our products.\nStrategic Risks\nIf changes to our existing products or introduction of new products or services do not meet our customers\u2019 expectations or fail to generate revenue, we could lose our customers or fail to generate any revenue from such products or services and our business may be harmed.\nWe may introduce significant changes to our existing products or develop and introduce new and unproven products or services, including using products with which we have little or no prior development or operating experience. The trend of the automotive industry towards autonomous vehicles and car- and ride-sharing services may result in a rapid increase of new and untested products in the aftermarket automotive industry. If new or enhanced products fail to attract or retain customers or to generate sufficient revenue, operating margin, or other value to justify certain investments, our business may be\nadversely affected. If we are not successful with new approaches to monetization, we may not be able to maintain or grow our revenue as anticipated or recover any associated development costs.\nWe depend on our relationships with independent installers and new car dealerships and their ability to sell and service our products. Any disruption in these relationships could harm our sales.\nThe largest portion of our products are distributed through independent installers and new car dealerships. We do not have direct control over the management or the business of these independent installers and new car dealerships, except indirectly through terms as negotiated with us. Should the terms of doing business with them change, our business may be disrupted, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nBecause some of our independent installer and new car dealership customers also may offer our competitors\u2019 products, our competitors may incent such customers to favor their products. We do not have long-term contracts with a majority of these independent installers and new car dealerships, and these customers are not obligated to purchase specified amounts of our products but instead buy from us on a purchase order basis. Consequently, the independent installers and new car dealerships may terminate their relationships with us or materially reduce their purchases of our products with little or no notice. If we were to lose any significant independent installers or new car dealerships, for any reason, including if an independent installer and new car dealership acquired or were acquired by a competitor such that they became a direct competitor, then we would need to obtain one or more new independent installers or new car dealerships to cover the particular location or product line, which may not be possible on favorable terms or at all.\nWe may not be able to identify, finance and complete suitable acquisitions and investments, and any completed acquisitions and investments could be unsuccessful or consume significant resources.\nOur business strategy is expected to continue to include acquiring businesses and making investments that complement our existing business. We expect to analyze and evaluate the acquisition of strategic businesses or product lines with the potential to strengthen our industry position or enhance our existing set of product and service offerings. We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates, obtain financing or have sufficient cash necessary for acquisitions or successfully complete acquisitions in the future. Acquisitions and investments may involve significant cash expenditures, debt issuance, equity issuance, operating losses and expenses. Acquisitions involve numerous other risks, including:\n\u2022diversion of management time and attention from daily operations;\n\u2022difficulties integrating acquired businesses, technologies and personnel into our business;\n\u2022difficulties in obtaining and verifying the financial statements and other business information of acquired businesses;\n\u2022inability to obtain required regulatory approvals;\n\u2022potential loss of key employees, key contractual relationships or key customers of acquired companies or of ours;\n\u2022assumption of the liabilities and exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired companies; and\n\u2022dilution of interests of holders of our common stock through the issuance of equity securities or equity-linked securities.\nIf we are unable to maintain our network of sales and distribution channels, it could adversely affect our net sales, profitability and the implementation of our growth strategy.\nOur ability to continue to grow our business depends on our ability to maintain effective sales and distribution channels in each of the markets in which we operate. We make use of a variety of distribution channels, including independent installers, new car dealerships, distributors and franchisees. We believe that this network of distribution channels enables us to efficiently reach consumers at a variety of points of sale. If we are not able to maintain our sales and distribution channels, we could experience a decline in sales, as well as reduced market share, as consumers may decide to purchase competing products that are more easily obtainable. The failure to deliver our products in accordance with our delivery schedules could harm our relationships with independent installers and new car dealerships, distributors and franchisees, which could adversely affect our net sales, profitability and the implementation of our growth strategy.\nIf we are unable to retain and acquire new customers, our financial performance may be materially and adversely affected.\nOur financial performance and operations are dependent on retaining our current customers and acquiring new customers. A number of factors could negatively affect our customer retention or acquisition. For example, potential customers may request products or services that we currently do not provide and may be unwilling to wait until we can develop or source such additional products or services.\nOther factors that affect our ability to retain or acquire new customers include customers\u2019 increasing use of competing products or services, our failure to develop and introduce new and improved products or new products or services not achieving a high level of market acceptance, changes in customer preference or customer sentiment about the quality or usefulness of our products and services, including customer service, consolidation or vertical integration of our customers, adverse changes in our products mandated by legislation, regulatory authorities, or litigation, including settlements or consent decrees, and technical or other problems preventing us from delivering our products in a rapid and reliable manner.\nIf we are unable to retain and acquire new customers, our financial performance may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe are exposed to political, regulatory, economic and other risks that arise from operating a multinational business.\nSales outside of the U.S. for the year ended December 31, 2021 accounted for approximately 48% of our consolidated revenue. Accordingly, our business is subject to the political, regulatory, economic and other risks that are inherent in operating in numerous countries. These risks include:\n\u2022changes in general economic and political conditions in countries where we operate, particularly in emerging markets;\n\u2022relatively more severe economic conditions in some international markets than in the U.S.;\n\u2022the difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through non-U.S. legal systems;\n\u2022the difficulty of communicating and monitoring standards and directives across our global facilities;\n\u2022the imposition of trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements, restrictions, tariffs or exchange controls;\n\u2022the possibility of terrorist action affecting us or our operations;\n\u2022the threat of nationalization and expropriation;\n\u2022difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations in non-U.S. labor markets;\n\u2022changes in tax treaties, laws or rulings that could have a material adverse impact on our effective tax rate;\n\u2022limitations on repatriation of earnings;\n\u2022the difficulty of protecting intellectual property in non-U.S. countries; and\n\u2022changes in and required compliance with a variety of non-U.S. laws and regulations.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks. We cannot assure you that these and other factors will not have a material adverse effect on our international operations or on our business as a whole.\nVolatility in currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur financial statements reflect translation of items denominated in non-U.S. currencies to U.S. dollars. Therefore, if the U.S. dollar strengthens in relation to the principal non-U.S. currencies from which we derive revenue as compared to a prior period, our U.S. dollar-reported revenue and income will effectively be decreased to the extent of the change in currency valuations and vice-versa. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, most notably the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other various foreign currencies in markets where we operate, could continue to have a material adverse effect on our reported revenue in future periods. In addition, currency variations could have a material adverse effect on margins on sales of our products in countries outside of the U.S.\nIf we fail to manage our growth effectively, our business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer.\nWe have experienced rapid growth over the last several years and we believe we will continue to grow at a rapid pace. This growth has put significant demands on our processes, systems and personnel. We have made and we expect to make further investments in additional personnel, systems and internal control processes to help manage our growth. In addition, we have sought to, and may continue to seek to grow through strategic acquisitions. Our growth strategy may place significant demands on our management and our operational and financial infrastructure. Our ability to manage our growth effectively and to integrate new technologies and acquisitions into our existing business will require us to continue to expand our operational, financial and management information systems and to continue to retain, attract, train, motivate and manage key employees. Growth could strain our ability to develop and improve our operational, financial and management controls, enhance our reporting systems and procedures, recruit, train and retain highly skilled personnel, maintain our quality standards and maintain our customer satisfaction.\nManaging our growth will require significant expenditures and allocation of valuable management resources. If we fail to achieve the necessary level of efficiency in our organization as it grows or if we are unable to successfully manage and support our rapid growth and the challenges and difficulties associated with managing a larger, more complex business, this could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows, and the market value of our shares could also decline.\nLegal, Regulatory and Compliance Risks\nThe Company may incur material losses and costs as a result of product liability and warranty claims.\nThe Company faces an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims if the use of its products results, or is alleged to result, in personal injury and/or property damage. If the Company manufactures a defective product, it may experience material product liability losses. Whether or not its products are\ndefective, the Company may incur significant costs to defend product liability claims. It also could incur significant costs in correcting any defects, lose sales and suffer damage to its reputation. Product liability insurance coverage may not be adequate for the liabilities and may not continue to be available on acceptable terms.\nThe Company is also subject to product warranty claims in the ordinary course of business. If the Company sells poor-quality products or uses defective materials, the Company may incur unforeseen costs in excess of what it has reserved in its financial statements. These costs could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, operating cash flows and ability to make required debt payments.\nWe sell our products under limited warranties. We have established a liability reserve under these warranties based on a review of historical warranty claims. Our liability reserve for warranties as of the year ended December 31, 2021 was $75,329. The warranty reserve may not be sufficient to cover the costs associated with future warranty claims. A significant increase in these costs could adversely affect the Company\u2019s operating results for future periods in which these additional costs materialize. Warranty reserves may need to be adjusted from time to time in the future if actual warranty claim experience differs from estimates. Any of the foregoing matters could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, operating cash flows and ability to make required debt payments.\nViolations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-corruption laws outside the U.S. could have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, and similar anti-corruption laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other persons for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Recent years have seen a substantial increase in anti-bribery law enforcement activity, with more frequent and aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings by both the U.S. Department of Justice and the SEC, increased enforcement activity by non-U.S. regulators and increases in criminal and civil proceedings brought against companies and individuals. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws. We operate in many parts of the world that are recognized as having governmental and commercial corruption and in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. We cannot assure you that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or third-party intermediaries. In the event that we believe or have reason to believe that our employees or agents have or may have violated applicable anti-corruption laws, including the FCPA, we may be required to investigate or have outside counsel investigate the relevant facts and circumstances, which can be expensive and require significant time and attention from senior management. Violations of these laws may require self-disclosure to governmental agencies and result in criminal or civil sanctions, which could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur failure to satisfy international trade compliance regulations, and changes in U.S. government sanctions, could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur global operations require importing and exporting goods and technology across international borders on a regular basis. Our policy mandates strict compliance with U.S. and non-U.S. trade laws applicable to our products. Nonetheless, our policies and procedures may not always protect us from actions that would violate U.S. or non-U.S. laws. Any improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal penalties, including material monetary fines, or other adverse actions including denial of import or export privileges, and could damage our reputation and business prospects.\nChanges in U.S. administrative policy, including changes to existing trade agreements and any resulting changes in international relations, could adversely affect our financial performance.\nAs a result of changes to U.S. administrative policy, among other possible changes, there may be (i) changes to existing trade agreements; (ii) greater restrictions on free trade generally; and (iii) significant increases in tariffs on goods imported into the United States. The United States, Mexico and Canada signed the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (\"U.S.MCA\"), the successor agreement to the North American Free Trade Agreement (\"NAFTA\"). The U.S.MCA became effective on July 1, 2020. On January 15, 2020, the United States signed the \"Phase 1\" trade agreement with China. It remains unclear what the U.S. administration or foreign governments, including China, will or will not do with respect to tariffs, the U.S.MCA or other international trade agreements and policies. A trade war, other governmental action related to tariffs or international trade agreements, changes in U.S. social, political, regulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade, manufacturing, development and investment in the territories and countries where we currently manufacture and sell products or any resulting negative sentiments towards the United States could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nChanges in the United Kingdom's economic and other relationships with the European Union could adversely affect us.\nOn January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom withdrew from the European Union. Pursuant to the Withdrawal Agreement Bill, the United Kingdom remained in the European Union's free market and customs union until December 31, 2020. After sometimes bitter negotiations, the two sides agreed to a new trade deal on December 24, 2020. The new deal contains new rules for how the United Kingdom and European Union will live, work and trade together. On January 1, 2021, the United Kingdom formally withdrew from the European Union.\nWe have significant operations in both the European Union and the United Kingdom. In the year ended December 31, 2021, our European Union (excluding the United Kingdom) and United Kingdom sales totaled $19,605,415 and $7,714,395, respectively. Expressed as a percentage of total consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021, these figures represented 7.6% and 3.0%, respectively. If modifications to existing terms of the agreement between the United Kingdom and the European Union were to occur, the changes could negatively impact our competitive position, supplier and customer relationships and financial performance.\nIntellectual property challenges may hinder our ability to develop and market our products, and we may incur significant costs in our efforts to successfully avoid, manage, defend and litigate intellectual property matters.\nProprietary technologies, customer relationships, trademarks, trade names and brand names are important to our business. Intellectual property protection, however, may not preclude competitors from developing products similar to ours or from challenging our names or products. Further, as we expand on a multi-national level and in some jurisdictions where the protection of intellectual property rights is less robust, the risk of competitors duplicating our proprietary technologies increases. We may need to spend significant resources monitoring our intellectual property rights, and we may or may not be able to detect infringement by third parties. Assertions by or against us relating to intellectual property rights, and any inability to protect these rights, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may face design limitations or liability associated with the use of products for which patent ownership or other intellectual property rights are claimed.\nFrom time to time we are subject to claims or inquiries regarding alleged unauthorized use of a third party\u2019s intellectual property and cannot be certain that the conduct of our business does not and will not\ninfringe the intellectual property rights of others. An adverse outcome in any intellectual property litigation could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require us to license technology or other intellectual property rights from others, require us to comply with injunctions to cease marketing or using certain products or brands, or require us to redesign, re-engineer, or re-brand certain products or packaging, any of which could affect our business, financial condition and operating results. Third-party intellectual property rights may also make it more difficult or expensive for us to meet market demand for particular product or design innovations. If we are required to seek licenses under patents or other intellectual property rights of others, we may not be able to acquire these licenses on acceptable terms, if at all. In addition, the cost of responding to an intellectual property infringement claim, in terms of legal fees and expenses and the diversion of management resources, whether or not the claim is valid, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFailure, inadequacy, or breach of our information technology systems, infrastructure, and business information or violations of data protection laws could result in material harm to our business and reputation.\nA great deal of confidential information owned by us is stored in our information systems, networks, and facilities or those of third parties. This includes valuable trade secrets and intellectual property, corporate strategic plans, marketing plans, customer information, and personally identifiable information, such as employee information (collectively, \u201cconfidential information\u201d). We also rely to a large extent on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems, infrastructure, and hardware (together \u201cIT systems\u201d), some of which are within our control and some of which are within the control of third parties, to accumulate, process, store, and transmit large amounts of confidential information and other data. We are subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations around the world related to privacy, data protection, and data security. Maintaining the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our IT systems and confidential information is vital to our business.\nIT systems are vulnerable to system inadequacies, operating failures, service interruptions or failures, security breaches, malicious intrusions, or cyber-attacks from a variety of sources. Cyber-attacks are growing in their frequency, sophistication, and intensity, and are becoming increasingly difficult to detect, mitigate, or prevent. Cyber-attacks come in many forms, including the deployment of harmful malware, exploitation of vulnerabilities, denial-of-service attacks, the use of social engineering, and other means to compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our IT systems, confidential information, and other data. Breaches resulting in the compromise, disruption, degradation, manipulation, loss, theft, destruction, or unauthorized disclosure or use of confidential information, or the unauthorized access to, disruption of, or interference with our products and services, can occur in a variety of ways, including but not limited to, negligent or wrongful conduct by employees or others with permitted access to our systems and information, or wrongful conduct by hackers, competitors, certain governments, or other current or former company personnel.\nThe failure or inadequacy of our IT systems, the compromise, disruption, degradation, manipulation, loss, theft, destruction, or unauthorized disclosure or use of confidential information, or the unauthorized access to, disruption of, or interference with our products and services that rely on IT systems, could impair our ability to secure and maintain intellectual property rights; result in a product manufacturing interruption or failure, or in the interruption or failure of products or services that rely on IT systems; damage our operations, customer relationships, or reputation; and cause us to lose trade secrets or other competitive advantages. Unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable information could expose us to significant sanctions for violations of data privacy laws and regulations around the world and could damage public trust in our company. For example, the European Union adopted the GDPR in 2018. The GDPR requires companies to meet new requirements regarding the handling of personal data, including its use, protection and transfer and the ability of persons whose data is stored to correct or delete such data about themselves. Failure to meet the GDPR requirements could result in penalties of up to 40% of annual worldwide revenue. The GDPR also confers a private right of action on certain individuals and\nassociations. In addition, the state of California\u2019s California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d) became effective in January 2020 and has similar requirements to GDPR.\nTo date, system inadequacies, operating failures, unauthorized access, service interruptions or failures, security breaches, malicious intrusions, cyber-attacks, and the compromise, disruption, degradation, manipulation, loss, theft, destruction, or unauthorized disclosure or use of confidential information have not had a material impact on our consolidated results of operations. We continue to implement measures in an effort to protect, detect, respond to, and minimize or prevent these risks and to enhance the resiliency of our IT systems; however, these measures may not be successful. If they are not successful, any of these events could result in material financial, legal, business, or reputational harm to our business.\nLiquidity Risks\nWe may seek to incur substantially more indebtedness in the future.\nOur business strategy may include incurring more indebtedness in the future. We recently increased the amount of our revolving credit facility to $75.0 million, of which $25.0 million was outstanding as of December 31, 2021. Our degree of leverage could have important consequences for the holders of our Common Stock, including increasing our vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions; requiring a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, therefore reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities; restricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures, limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, product development, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes; and limiting our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who are less highly leveraged. Any of the above consequences could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe cannot be certain that additional financing will be available on reasonable terms when required, or at all.\nFrom time to time, we may need additional financing. Our ability to obtain additional financing, if and when required, will depend on investor demand, our operating performance, the condition of the capital markets, and other factors. To the extent we draw on credit facilities, if any, to fund certain obligations, we may need to raise additional funds and we cannot assure investors that additional financing will be available to us on favorable terms when required, or at all. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, equity-linked or debt securities, those securities may have rights, preferences, or privileges senior to the rights of our Common Stock, and existing stockholders may experience dilution.\nRisks Relating to Common Stock\nIf research analysts issue unfavorable commentary or downgrade our Common Stock, the price of our Common Stock and their trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our Common Stock may depend in part on the research and reports that research analysts publish about us and our business. If we do not maintain adequate research coverage, or if one or more analysts who covers us downgrades our Common Stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the price of our Common Stock could decline. If one or more of the research analysts ceases to cover us or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our Common Stock could decrease, which could cause the price or trading volume to decline.\nOur stock price has been, and may continue to be, volatile.\nThe trading price of our Common Stock has been and could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to certain factors, including:\n\u2022U.S. and global economic conditions leading to general declines in market capitalizations, with such declines not associated with operating performance.\n\u2022Quarter-to-quarter variations in results of operations.\n\u2022Our announcements of new products.\n\u2022Our announcements of acquisitions or divestitures.\n\u2022Our announcements of significant new customers or contracts.\n\u2022Our competitors\u2019 announcements of new products.\n\u2022Our product development.\n\u2022Changes in our management team.\n\u2022General conditions in our industry.\n\u2022Investor perceptions and expectations regarding our products, services, plans and strategic position and those of our competitors and clients.\nIn addition, the public stock markets experience extreme price and trading volume volatility, particularly in growth sectors of the market. This volatility has significantly affected the market prices of securities of many companies for reasons often unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies. The broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock.\nWe may issue additional equity securities, or engage in other transactions that could dilute our book value or affect the priority of our Common Stock, which may adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock.\nOur articles of incorporation allow our Board to issue up to 100,000,000 shares of Common Stock. Our Board may determine from time to time that we need to raise additional capital by issuing Common Stock or other equity securities. Except as otherwise described in this Annual Report, we are not restricted from issuing additional securities, including securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, shares of our Common Stock. Because our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing, or nature of any future offerings, or the prices at which such offerings may be affected. Additional equity offerings may dilute the holdings of our existing stockholders or reduce the market price of our Common Stock, or both. Holders of our Common Stock are not entitled to pre-emptive rights or other protections against dilution. New investors also may have rights, preferences and privileges that are senior to, and that adversely affect, the then-current holders of our Common Stock. Additionally, if we raise additional capital by making offerings of debt or shares of preferred stock, upon our liquidation, holders of our debt securities and shares of preferred stock, and lenders with respect to other borrowings, may receive distributions of our available assets before the holders of our Common Stock.\nWe may issue shares of preferred stock with greater rights than our Common Stock.\nSubject to the rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market, our articles of incorporation authorize our board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock and set the terms of the preferred stock without seeking any further approval from holders of our Common Stock. Any preferred stock that is issued may rank ahead of our Common Stock in terms of dividends, priority and liquidation premiums and may have greater voting rights than our Common Stock.\nWe have not paid any cash dividends in the past and have no plans to issue cash dividends in the future, which could cause our Common Stock to have a lower value than that of similar companies which do pay cash dividends.\nWe have not paid any cash dividends on our Common Stock to date and do not anticipate any cash dividends being paid to holders of our Common Stock in the foreseeable future. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our Board.\nWhile our dividend policy will be based on the operating results and capital needs of the business, it is anticipated that any earnings will be retained to finance our future expansion. As we have no plans to issue cash dividends in the future, our Common Stock could be less desirable to other investors and as a result, the value of our Common Stock may decline, or fail to reach the valuations of other similarly situated companies that pay cash dividends.\nShares eligible for future sale may depress our stock price.\nAs of February 28, 2022, we had 27,612,597 shares of Common Stock outstanding of which 6,452,587 shares were held by affiliates. All of the shares of Common Stock held by affiliates are restricted or control securities under Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933 as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d). Sales of shares of Common Stock under Rule 144 or another exemption under the Securities Act or pursuant to a registration statement could have a material adverse effect on the price of our Common Stock and could impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities. Furthermore, all Common Stock beneficially owned by persons who are not our affiliates and have beneficially owned such shares for at least one year may be sold at any time by these existing stockholders in accordance with Rule 144 of the Securities Act. However, there can be no assurance that any of these existing stockholders will sell any or all of their Common Stock and there may be a lack of supply of, or demand for, our Common Stock on The Nasdaq Stock Market. In the case of a lack of supply of our Common Stock offered in the market, the trading price of our Common Stock may rise to an unsustainable level, particularly in instances where institutional investors may be discouraged from purchasing our Common Stock because they are unable to purchase a block of our Common Stock in the open market due to a potential unwillingness of our existing stockholders to sell the amount of Common Stock at the price offered by such investors and the greater influence individual investors have in setting the trading price. In the case of a lack of market demand for our Common Stock, the trading price of our Common Stock could decline significantly and rapidly after our listing.\nPercentage of ownership in our Common Stock may be diluted in the future.\nIn the future, the percentage ownership in our Common Stock owned by our stockholders may be diluted because of equity issuances for acquisitions, capital market transactions or otherwise, including equity awards that we expect to be granting to our directors, officers and employees. Such issuances may have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share, which could materially adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions could make a third party acquisition of us difficult.\nOur bylaws eliminate the ability of stockholders to call special meetings or take action by written consent. These provisions in our bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the approval of our board. In addition, the Nevada corporate statute also contains certain provisions that could make an acquisition by a third party more difficult.\nOur directors and officers have substantial control over us.\nOur directors and executive officers, together with their affiliates and related persons, beneficially owned, in the aggregate, approximately 23.4% of our outstanding Common Stock as of February 28,\n2022. These stockholders have the ability to substantially control our operations and direct our policies including the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, such as the election of directors and any acquisition or merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets.\nOur bylaws provide that the state and federal courts located in Bexar County, Texas will be the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nOur bylaws provide that, with certain limited exceptions, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the state and federal courts located in Bexar County, Texas will be the sole and exclusive forum for any stockholder (including any beneficial owner) to bring any (i) derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of, or a claim based on, breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director, officer, employee or stockholder to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against us or any current or former director, officer, employee or stockholder arising pursuant to any provision of Chapters 78 and 92 of the Nevada Revised Statutes or our articles of incorporation or bylaws or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us or any current or former director, officer, employee or stockholder (including any beneficial owner of stock) governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in our Common Stock is deemed to have notice of and consented to the foregoing provisions. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find this choice of forum provision inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. The choice of forum provision does not apply to any actions arising under the Securities Act or the Securities Exchange Act.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nThe COVID-19 pandemic could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe global pandemic resulting from the outbreak of COVID-19 has disrupted global health, economic and market conditions, consumer behavior and the Company\u2019s global operations since its spread in early 2020. We cannot predict how the pandemic will continue to develop or to what extent the pandemic may have longer term unanticipated impacts on our global operations.\nThe spread of COVID-19 has caused us to modify our business practices including employee travel, employee work locations, cancellation of physical participation in meetings, events and conferences, and instituting social distancing measures, and we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners, vendors and suppliers. Work-from-home and other measures introduce additional operational risks, including cybersecurity risks, and have affected the way we conduct our product development, validation, qualification, customer support and other activities which could have an adverse effect on our operations. There is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the virus, and illness and workforce disruptions could lead to unavailability of key personnel and harm our ability to perform critical functions. Any one of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nGeneral global economic and business conditions affect demand for our products.\nWe compete in various geographic regions and markets around the world. We expect to experience fluctuations in revenue and results of operations due to economic and business cycles. Important factors for our business and the businesses of our customers include the overall strength of the economy and our customers\u2019 confidence in the economy, unemployment rates, availability of consumer financing and interest rates. Our products and services are discretionary purchases for most consumers. Consumers are generally more willing to make discretionary purchases on products and services such as ours during periods of favorable general economic conditions. While we attempt to minimize our exposure to economic or market fluctuations by offering a balanced mix of end markets and geographic regions, any of the above factors, individually or in the aggregate, or a significant or sustained downturn in a specific end market or geographic region could reduce demand for our products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.", "PERMNO": 18856, "SIC": 3714, "TIC": "XPEL"}
