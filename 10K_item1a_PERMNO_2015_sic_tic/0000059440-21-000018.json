We have described below the known material risks that we and our subsidiaries face. There may be additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we do not currently perceive to be significant that may also impact our business or the business of our subsidiaries. Each of the risks and uncertainties described below could lead to events or circumstances that have a material adverse effect on the business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition or equity of us or one or more of our subsidiaries, which in turn could negatively affect the value of our common stock. You should carefully consider and evaluate all of the information included in this report and any subsequent reports that we may file with the Securities and Exchange Commission or make available to the public before investing in any securities issued by us.\nRisks Relating to Our Tobacco Business\nLiggett faces intense competition in the domestic tobacco industry.\nLiggett is considerably smaller and has fewer resources than its major competitors, and, as a result, has in certain circumstances a more limited ability to respond to market developments. Further, all of Liggett\u2019s unit volume is generated in the discount segment, which is highly competitive, with consumers having less brand loyalty and placing greater emphasis on price. Management Science Associates\u2019 data indicate that in 2020, Philip Morris and RJ Reynolds, the two largest cigarette manufacturers, controlled 74.0% of the United States cigarette market. Philip Morris is the largest manufacturer in the market, and its profits are derived principally from its sale of premium cigarettes. Philip Morris had 57.0% of the premium segment and 44.8% of the total domestic market during 2020. During 2020, all of Liggett\u2019s sales were in the discount segment, and its share of the total domestic cigarette market was 4.1%. Historically, because of their dominant market share, Philip Morris and RJ Reynolds, have been able to determine cigarette prices for the various pricing tiers within the industry.\nFurther consolidation in the industry could adversely affect our ability to compete in the U.S. cigarette market.\nLiggett\u2019s business is highly dependent on the discount cigarette segment and to maintain market share, it may be required to take steps to reduce prices.\nAll of Liggett\u2019s unit volume is generated in the discount segment, which is highly competitive. While Philip Morris, RJ Reynolds, and ITG Brands compete with Liggett in the discount segment of the market, Liggett also faces intense competition\nfor market share in the discount segment from a group of smaller manufacturers and importers, most of which sell low quality and deep discount cigarettes. While Liggett\u2019s share of the discount market was 14.2% in 2020, 14.3% in 2019, and 14.3% in 2018, Management Science Associates\u2019 data indicate that the discount market share of these other smaller manufacturers and importers was approximately 35.5% in 2020, 32.3% in 2019, and 29.4% in 2018. If pricing in the discount market continues to be impacted by these smaller manufacturers and importers, margins in Liggett\u2019s only market segment could be negatively affected and, to maintain market share, Liggett may be required to take steps to reduce prices. Thus, Liggett\u2019s sales volume, operating income and cash flows would be materially adversely affected, which in turn could negatively affect the value of our common stock.\nThe domestic cigarette industry has experienced declining unit sales in recent periods, which could result in lower sales or higher costs for us.\nPrior to 2020, industry-wide shipments of cigarettes in the United States had declined for a number of years. Management Science Associates\u2019 data indicated that domestic industry-wide shipments decreased by approximately 5.3% in 2019 as compared to 2018 before increasing by approximately 1.5% in 2020. In addition to a declining market impacting our sales volume, operating income and cash flows, our annual cost advantage from our payment exemption under the MSA declines by approximately $1.7 million for each percentage point decline in shipment volumes in the U.S. market. We believe the 2020 increase was a COVID-19 related anomaly and that industry-wide shipments of cigarettes in the United States will continue to decline in future years as a result of numerous factors. These factors include health considerations, diminishing social acceptance of smoking, and a wide variety of federal, state and local laws limiting smoking in restaurants, bars and other public places, as well as increases in federal and state excise taxes and settlement-related expenses which have contributed to higher cigarette prices in recent years. If this decline in industry-wide shipments continues and Liggett is unable to capture market share from its competitors, or if the industry as a whole is unable to offset the decline in unit sales with price increases, or if Liggett\u2019s market share percentage falls below its MSA payment exemption percentage, Liggett\u2019s sales volume, operating income and cash flows could be materially adversely affected, which in turn could negatively affect the value of our common stock.\nOur tobacco operations are subject to substantial and increasing legislation, regulation and taxation, which have a negative effect on revenue and profitability.\nCigarettes are subject to substantial regulation and taxation at the federal, state and local levels, which has had and may continue to have an adverse effect on our business. For a more complete discussion of the material regulations and taxation applicable to our Business, see Item 1. Business. Legislation and Regulation. For instance:\n\u2022Federal, state and local laws have limited the advertising, sale and use of cigarettes in the United States, such as laws prohibiting smoking in restaurants and other public places. Private businesses have also implemented prohibitions on the use of cigarettes. Further regulations or rules limiting advertising, sale or use of cigarettes or ingredients or flavorings could negatively impact sales of cigarettes, which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\n\u2022The federal government, as well as certain state, city and county governments, impose excise taxes on cigarettes, which has had, and is expected to continue to have, an adverse effect on sales of cigarettes. Since certain of these excise taxes were proportionately smaller on other types of tobacco products, a dramatic increase in the sale of mislabeled pipe tobacco occurred, which took away market share from traditional cigarette products.\n\u2022Various state and local government regulations have, among other things, increased the minimum age to purchase tobacco products, banned the sale of menthol cigarettes, restricted or banned sampling and advertising and required ingredient and constituent disclosure. Significantly, the federal government increased the minimum age of sale for tobacco products from 18 to 21 years of age in December 2019. Further regulations that limit the group of individuals able to purchase cigarettes in the United States or other regulations that limit the types of products we can offer, such as limitations on use of flavoring, could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products, our results of operations and our business. FDA and other organizations have also conducted anti-tobacco media campaigns, which have and may continue to have an adverse effect on the demand for cigarettes.\nThere have also been adverse legislative and political decisions and other unfavorable developments concerning cigarette smoking and the tobacco industry, as well as restrictive actions by federal agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency and FDA. In 2009, legislation was enacted giving FDA regulatory authority over tobacco products. Additionally, all states have enacted statutes requiring cigarettes to meet a reduced ignition propensity standard. These developments may negatively affect the perception of potential triers of fact with respect to the tobacco industry, possibly to the detriment of certain pending litigation, and may prompt the commencement of additional similar litigation or legislation. We are not able to evaluate the effect of these developing matters on pending litigation or the possible commencement of additional litigation, but our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nAdditional federal, state or local regulations relating to the manufacture, sale, distribution, advertising, labeling, or information disclosure of tobacco products could further reduce sales, increase costs and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFDA Regulation under the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act may adversely affect our sales and operating profit.\nIn June 2009, the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (\u201cTCA\u201d) became law. The TCA grants FDA broad authority over the manufacture, sale, marketing and packaging of tobacco products, although FDA is prohibited from banning all cigarettes or all smokeless tobacco products. For a more complete discussion of the TCA, see Item 1. Business. Legislation and Regulation.\nIn July 2017, FDA announced a comprehensive plan for tobacco and nicotine regulation, proposing an increased focus on the impact of flavors (including menthol) and on reducing the level of nicotine in tobacco. FDA\u2019s March 2018 ANPR relating to menthol indicated that it may, among other things, take regulatory actions to implement tobacco product standards and restrict the sale and distribution of tobacco products with flavors, including menthol. In 2020, approximately 19% of our cigarette unit sales were menthol flavored. Regulations under the TCA that restrict or prohibit the sale of menthol flavored cigarettes would reduce the demand for our cigarettes and may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nAs part of the comprehensive plan announced in July 2017, FDA said it would focus on nicotine addiction, with the goal of lowering nicotine levels in combustible cigarettes through a product standard developed through notice and comment rulemaking, which FDA announced in March 2018. See Item 1. Business. Legislation and Regulation. At this time, we cannot predict the specific regulations FDA will enact, the timeframe for such regulations, or the effect of such regulations. The rulemaking process could take years and once a final rule is issued it typically does not take effect for at least one year. We cannot predict how a tobacco product standard, if ultimately issued by FDA, would impact product sales, whether it would have a material adverse effect on Liggett or Vector Tobacco, or whether it would impact Liggett and Vector Tobacco to a greater degree than other companies in the industry.\nIn April 2018, FDA announced a change in its process for reviewing \u201cprovisional\u201d substantial equivalence applications. See Item 1. Business. Legislation and Regulation for additional information on the substantial equivalence process. Vector Tobacco received a letter from FDA in April 2018 advising that FDA does not intend to conduct further review of Vector Tobacco\u2019s remaining applications, with certain \u201cconditions\u201d (as described under Item 1. Business. Legislation and Regulation). Liggett received a letter from FDA in May 2018 advising that FDA does not intend to conduct further review for certain applications, also with certain \u201cconditions\u201d (as described under Item 1. Business. Legislation and Regulation). FDA has not indicated whether the applications relating to Liggett\u2019s other products, not covered by that May 2018 letter, would proceed through FDA review. We cannot predict whether FDA will deem Liggett\u2019s outstanding applications to be sufficient to support determinations of substantial equivalence for the products covered by these substantial equivalence reports. It is possible that FDA could determine that some, or all, of these products are \u201cnot substantially equivalent\u201d to a preexisting tobacco product, as the agency has already done for 20 of Liggett\u2019s applications. NSE orders for other cigarette styles may require us to stop the sale of the applicable cigarettes and other cigarette styles and could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOn March 18, 2020, FDA issued a final rule to require new health warnings on cigarette packages and in cigarette advertisements. This rule requires each cigarette package and advertisement to bear one of eleven textual warning statements accompanied by a corresponding graphic image covering 50% of the area of the front and rear panels of cigarette packages and at least 20% of the area at the top of cigarette advertisements. The rule establishes marketing requirements that include the random and equal display and distribution of the required warnings for cigarette packages and quarterly rotation of the required warnings for cigarette advertisements. The final rule provided for an effective date of June 18, 2021, 15 months after issuance of the final rule. The inclusion of new warnings and rotation requirements pursuant to the final rule would likely increase Liggett\u2019s production costs. On April 3, 2020, Liggett, along with other tobacco companies, commenced an action against the FDA in the United States District Court, District of Texas (Tyler Division) challenging the legality of the graphic warning final rule. On May 8, 2020, the court issued an updated scheduling order and granted a joint motion to postpone the effective date of the final rule by 120 days to October 16, 2021. On December 2, 2020, the court granted a motion by the plaintiffs to postpone the effective date by an additional 90 days to January 14, 2022.\nWe cannot predict whether the court will delay the effective date and/or determine that some or all of the proposed textual and/or graphic warnings, or proposed prominence of the warnings, violate the First Amendment, Administrative Procedure Act, or other legal requirements, or what the impact of such a court ruling would have on the compliance timeline or requirements imposed on industry.\nIt is likely that the TCA and further regulatory efforts by FDA could result in a decrease in cigarette sales in the United States, including sales of Liggett\u2019s and Vector Tobacco\u2019s brands. Compliance and related costs are not possible to predict and depend substantially on the future requirements imposed by FDA under the law. Costs, however, could be substantial and could\nhave a material adverse effect on the companies\u2019 financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. In addition, FDA has a number of investigatory and enforcement tools available to it. Failure to comply with the law and with FDA regulatory requirements could result in significant financial penalties and could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results of operation of both Liggett and Vector Tobacco. At present, we are not able to predict whether the law will impact Liggett and Vector Tobacco to a greater degree than other companies in the industry, thus affecting our competitive position.\nCertain states may attempt to pass minimum price legislation.\nThe state of Colorado placed a referendum, called Proposition EE, for taxes on cigarettes, tobacco and nicotine products on the November 3, 2020 ballot. Proposition EE was approved by the voters. In addition to raising the Colorado state excise tax on cigarettes, Proposition EE includes a provision that fixes the minimum retail price of cigarettes in Colorado at $7.00 per pack beginning January 1, 2021, thus reducing the competitive advantage of our Company\u2019s discount priced cigarettes in the Colorado marketplace. We commenced litigation against Colorado challenging the legality of the minimum price provision contained in Proposition EE, the outcome of which cannot be predicted. Although no other state has adopted a fixed minimum retail price law, other states may attempt to do so if the minimum price provision in Proposition EE is determined by the courts to be legal. In the event that litigation challenging the minimum price legislation is not successful or other states pass similar legislation that withstands judicial scrutiny, the result could have a material adverse effect on our future financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nLitigation will continue to harm the tobacco industry, including Liggett.\nLiggett could be subjected to substantial liabilities and bonding requirements from litigation relating to cigarette products. Adverse judgments could have a negative impact on our ability to operate due to their impact on cash flows. We and our Liggett subsidiary, as well as the entire cigarette industry, continue to be challenged on numerous fronts. New cases continue to be commenced against Liggett and other cigarette manufacturers. As of December 31, 2020, there were 70 individual product liability lawsuits, two purported class actions and one health care cost recovery action pending in the United States in which Liggett and/or we were named defendants. It is likely that similar legal actions, proceedings and claims will continue to be filed against Liggett. Punitive damages, often in amounts ranging into the billions of dollars, are specifically pleaded in certain cases, in addition to compensatory and other damages. It is possible that there could be adverse developments in pending cases including the certification of additional class actions. An unfavorable outcome or settlement of pending tobacco-related litigation could encourage the commencement of additional litigation. In addition, an unfavorable outcome in any tobacco-related litigation could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Liggett could face difficulties in obtaining a bond to stay execution of a judgment pending appeal. As new product liability cases are commenced against Liggett, the costs associated with defending these cases and the risks relating to the inherent unpredictability of litigation continue to increase.\nIndividual tobacco-related cases resulting from the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in Engle could continue to harm Liggett.\nIn May 1994, the Engle case was filed as a class action against Liggett and others in Miami-Dade County, Florida. The class consisted of all Florida residents who, by November 21, 1996, \u201chave suffered, presently suffer or have died from diseases and medical conditions caused by their addiction to cigarette smoking.\u201d A trial was held and the jury returned a verdict adverse to the defendants (approximately $145.0 billion in punitive damages, including $790.0 million against Liggett). Following an appeal to the Third District Court of Appeal, the Florida Supreme Court in July 2006 decertified the class on a prospective basis and affirmed the appellate court\u2019s reversal of the punitive damages award. Former class members had until January 2008 to file individual lawsuits. As a result, we and Liggett, and other cigarette manufacturers, were sued in thousands of Engle progeny cases in both federal and state courts in Florida. Although we were not named as a defendant in the Engle case, we were named as a defendant in substantially all of the Engle progeny cases where Liggett was named as a defendant. Notwithstanding Liggett\u2019s multi-plaintiff settlements, Liggett and Vector remain defendants in 41 state court Engle progeny cases. The costs associated with defending these cases continue to negatively impact our cash flows. We cannot predict the cash requirements related to any future settlements and judgments, including cash required to bond any appeals, and there is a risk that those requirements will not be able to be met.\nLiggett may have additional payment obligations under the MSA.\nNPM Adjustment. In March 2006, an economic consulting firm selected pursuant to the MSA determined that the MSA was a \u201csignificant factor contributing to\u201d the loss of market share of Participating Manufacturers for 2003. This same determination has been made for additional years. This is known as the \u201cNPM Adjustment.\u201d As a result, the Participating Manufacturers may be entitled to potential NPM Adjustments to their MSA payments.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Participating Manufacturers had entered into agreements with 38 Settling States setting out terms for settlement of the NPM Adjustment and addressing the NPM Adjustment with respect to those states for future years.\nFor 2003 - 2019, Liggett and Vector Tobacco, as applicable, disputed that they owed the Settling States the NPM Adjustments as calculated by the independent auditor. As permitted by the MSA, Liggett and Vector Tobacco paid subject to dispute, withheld payment or paid into a disputed payment account the amounts associated with these NPM Adjustments. The arbitration for 2004, for those states that did not enter into the agreement or otherwise settle, has commenced. As of December 31, 2020, Liggett and Vector Tobacco accrued approximately $13.2 million related to disputed amounts withheld from the non-settling states for 2004 - 2010, which may be subject to payment, with interest, if Liggett and Vector Tobacco lose the disputes for those years.\nLiggett may have additional payment obligations under its individual state settlements.\nIn 2004, the Attorneys General of Mississippi and Texas advised Liggett that they believed Liggett had failed to make all required payments under the respective settlement agreements with these states. Liggett believes these allegations are without merit, based, among other things, on the language of the most favored nation provisions of the settlement agreements. No amounts have been accrued in our consolidated financial statements for any additional amounts that may be payable by Liggett under the settlement agreements with Mississippi and Texas.\nIn January 2016, the Attorney General for Mississippi filed a motion in Chancery Court in Jackson County, Mississippi to enforce the March 1996 settlement agreement (the \u201c1996 Agreement\u201d). In April 2017, the Chancery Court ruled that the 1996 Agreement should be enforced and referred the matter to a Special Master for further proceedings to determine the amount of damages, if any, to be awarded.\nIn July 2020, the parties stipulated that the unpaid principal (exclusive of interest) purportedly due from Liggett to Mississippi pursuant to the 1996 Agreement (from inception through 2019) is approximately $15.5 million, subject to Liggett\u2019s right to litigate and/or appeal the enforceability of the 1996 Agreement (and all issues other than the calculation of such principal amount). In September 2019, the Special Master held a hearing regarding the state\u2019s claim for approximately $17.5 million in prejudgment interest as well as post-judgment interest in amounts to be determined. A decision is pending. In the event Liggett appeals an adverse judgment, the posting of a bond may be required.\nLiggett may be required to make additional payments to Mississippi and Texas which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Associated with Our New Valley Real Estate Business.\nNew Valley is subject to risks relating to the industries in which it operates.\nThe real estate industry is significantly affected by changes in economic and political conditions as well as real estate markets, which could adversely impact returns on our investments, trigger defaults in project financing, cause cancellations of property sales, reduce the value of our properties or investments and could affect our results of operations and liquidity. The real estate industry is cyclical and is significantly affected by changes in general and local economic conditions which are beyond our control.\nThese conditions include short-term and long-term interest rates, inflation, fluctuations in debt and equity capital markets, levels of unemployment, consumer confidence and the general economic condition of the United States and the global economy. The real estate market also depends upon the strength of financial institutions, which are sensitive to changes in the general macroeconomic environment. Lack of available credit or lack of confidence in the financial sector could impact the real estate market, which in turn could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny of the following could be associated with cyclicality in the real estate market by halting or limiting a recovery in the residential real estate market, and have an adverse effect on our business by causing periods of lower growth or a decline in the number of home sales and/or property prices which, in turn, could adversely affect our revenue and profitability:\n\u2022periods of economic slowdown or recession;\n\u2022rising interest rates;\n\u2022the general availability of mortgage financing;\n\u2022a negative perception of the market for residential real estate;\n\u2022commission pressure from brokers who discount their commissions;\n\u2022an increase in the cost of homeowners\u2019 insurance;\n\u2022weak credit markets;\n\u2022a low level of consumer confidence in the economy and/or the real estate market;\n\u2022instability of financial institutions;\n\u2022legislative, tax or regulatory changes that would adversely impact the real estate market, including but not limited to potential reform relating to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and other government sponsored entities that provide liquidity to the U.S. housing and mortgage markets, and potential limits on, or elimination of, the deductibility of certain mortgage interest expense and property taxes;\n\u2022adverse changes in economic and general business conditions in the New York metropolitan area;\n\u2022a decline in the affordability of homes;\n\u2022declining demand for real estate;\n\u2022decreasing home ownership rates, declining demand for real estate and changing social attitudes toward home ownership;\n\u2022acts of God, such as hurricanes, earthquakes and other natural disasters, or acts or threats of war or terrorism; and/or\n\u2022adverse changes in global, national, regional and local economic and market conditions, particularly in the New York metropolitan area and the other markets where our businesses operate, including those relating to pandemics and health crises, such as the recent outbreak of novel coronavirus (COVID-19).\nNew Valley is impacted by the performance of the real estate market in the New York metropolitan area, which has been adversely impacted by COVID-19. New Valley\u2019s business primarily depends on the performance of the real estate market in the New York metropolitan area. Our real estate brokerage businesses and our investments in real estate developments are largely located in New York City and elsewhere in the surrounding New York metropolitan area.\nDouglas Elliman\u2019s business primarily depends on sales transactions for residential property in the New York City market and it derived approximately 29% of its revenues in 2020 and 46% of its revenues in 2019 and 2018 from the New York City market. Published reports and data indicate that the New York metropolitan area was impacted more than any other area in the United States by the COVID-19 pandemic. Various governmental agencies in the New York metropolitan area and other markets where Douglas Elliman operates and where our real estate investments are located, instituted quarantines, \u201cpause\u201d orders, \u201cshelter-in-place\u201d rules, restrictions on travel and restrictions on the types of businesses that can operate. For example, Douglas Elliman\u2019s agents were restricted from performing personal showings of properties or conducting open houses in most of Douglas Elliman\u2019s markets from March 2020 to June 2020. These measures may occur again depending on COVID-19 infection rates. As a result of such measures, volumes of residential property sales transactions in the New York metropolitan area, and specifically, New York City, declined significantly in 2020, and the aggregate sales commissions earned by Douglas Elliman on sales transactions in the New York City area correspondingly declined. Although the suburban New York markets have improved and, recently, we have seen improvement in the New York City market, this has had, and may continue to have, a material adverse effect on Douglas Elliman\u2019s financial condition and results of operations, notwithstanding the mitigating actions we initiated (including employee-related and other expense-reduction measures) and expect to continue during and immediately following this pandemic.\nIn addition, property development and investment activities are significantly lower than past levels and improvement in the markets where New Valley operates is uncertain. This may have a material adverse effect on New Valley\u2019s real estate investments. As of December 31, 2020, we had investments in or were developing projects in New York City with carrying values of approximately $35.7 million. In addition, during the second quarter of 2020, construction was halted at many of the real estate projects where New Valley is invested. The construction that was halted as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic has since resumed, although the delays may adversely impact those investments. Adverse developments in national and local economic conditions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, as measured by such factors as GDP growth, employment levels, job growth, consumer confidence, interest rates and population growth in the New York metropolitan area and the United States generally have impacted our investments through reduced demand and depressed prices. We anticipate that this could have a material adverse effect on our Real Estate segment, its financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Tax Act could negatively impact New Valley\u2019s and Douglas Elliman\u2019s markets. The Tax Act places new limits on mortgage interest deductions as well as state and local income and property tax deductions. The loss of the use of these deductions may encourage residents of states with high income and property taxes and costs of housing to migrate to states with lower tax rates and housing costs. In 2020, approximately 73.0% of Douglas Elliman\u2019s closed sales occurred in New York, California, Connecticut and Massachusetts, and a migration of residents from these markets or a reduction in the attractiveness of these markets as a place to live could adversely impact New Valley\u2019s and Douglas Elliman\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nNew Valley is impacted by the attractiveness of New York City as a place to live and invest in and its status as an international center for business and commerce. Through its investments in Douglas Elliman and developments with carrying values of $35.7 million in the New York metropolitan area, New Valley is impacted by the attractiveness of New York City as a place in which to live and invest. If New York City\u2019s economy stagnates or contracts or if there are significant concerns or uncertainty regarding the strength of New York City\u2019s economy due to domestic, international or global macroeconomic trends (including, in particular, the virtual work trend arising as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic), or other factors (including, in particular, any matters which adversely affect New York City\u2019s status as an international center for business and commerce or the economic benefits of New York City\u2019s financial services industry), the New York metropolitan area may become a less attractive place to live, work, study or to own residential property for investment purposes. The attractiveness of New York City may also be negatively affected by other factors, including high residential property sales prices or rents (or a risk or perceived risk of a fall in sales prices in the future), high costs of living, the impact of the Tax Act (discussed above), the impact of changes in state tax law, such as the real estate transfer tax on luxury property (the \u201cMansion Tax\u201d) and negative perceptions surrounding quality of life, safety and security (including the risk or perceived risk of acts of terrorism or protests).\nAny reduction in the attractiveness of New York City as a place to live or a place to invest in residential real estate and any matters which adversely affect New York City\u2019s status as an international center for business and commerce could result in a reduction, by volume and/or by value, in our investment in real estate developments and/or residential property sales transactions in the New York metropolitan area, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks associated with our real estate development business.\nReal estate development is a competitive industry, and competitive conditions may adversely affect our results of operations. The real estate development industry is highly competitive. Real estate developers compete not only for buyers, but also for desirable properties, building materials, labor and capital. We compete with other local, regional, national and international real estate asset managers, investors and property developers, which have significant financial resources and experience. Competitive conditions in the real estate development industry could result in: difficulty in acquiring suitable investments in properties at acceptable prices; increased selling incentives; lower sales volumes and prices; lower profit margins; impairments in the value of our investments in real estate developments and other assets; and increased construction costs, delays in construction and increased carry costs. Development projects are subject to special risks including potential increase in costs, changes in market demand, inability to meet deadlines which may delay the timely completion of projects, reliance on contractors who may be unable to perform and the need to obtain various governmental and third party consents.\nIf the market value of our properties or investments decline, our results of operations could be adversely affected by impairments and write-downs. We acquire land and invest in real estate projects in the ordinary course of our business. There is an inherent risk that the value of our land and investments may decline after purchase, which also may affect the value of existing properties under construction. The valuation of property is inherently subjective and based on the individual characteristics of each property. The market value of our land and investments in real estate projects depends on general and local real estate market conditions. These conditions can change and thereby subject valuations to uncertainty. Moreover, all valuations are made on the basis of assumptions that may not prove to reflect economic or demographic reality. We may have acquired options on or bought and developed land at a cost we will not be able to recover fully or on which we cannot build and sell the property profitably. In addition, our deposits or investments in deposits for building lots controlled under option or similar contracts may be put at risk. If market conditions deteriorate, some of our assets may be subject to impairments and write-down charges which would adversely affect our operations and financial results.\nIf demand for residential or commercial real estate decreases below what was anticipated when we purchased interests in or developed such inventory, profitability may be adversely affected and we may not be able to recover the related costs when selling and building our properties and/or investments. We regularly review the value of our investments and will continue to do so on a periodic basis. Write-downs and impairments in the value of our properties and/or investments may be required, and we may in the future sell properties and/or investments at a loss, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe face risks associated with property acquisitions. We may be unable to finance acquisitions or investments on favorable terms or properties may fail to perform as expected. We may underestimate the costs necessary to bring an investment up to standards established for its intended market position. We may also acquire or invest in properties subject to liabilities and with recourse, with respect to unknown liabilities. New Valley\u2019s acquisition of real estate investments are subject to several risks including: underestimated operating expenses for a property, possibly making it uneconomical or unprofitable; a property may fail to perform in accordance with expectations, in which case the Company may sustain lower-than-expected income or need to incur additional expenses for the property; and the Company may not be able to sell, dispose or refinance the property at a favorable price or terms, or at all, as the case may be; in addition to any potential loss on a sale, the Company may have no choice but to hold on to the property and continue to incur net operating losses if underperforming for an indefinite period of\ntime, as well as incur continuing tax, environmental and other liabilities. Acquisition agreements will typically contain conditions to closing, including completion of due diligence to our satisfaction or other conditions that are not within our control, which may not be satisfied. Each of these factors could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur success depends on the availability of suitable real estate investments at acceptable prices and having sufficient liquidity to acquire such investments. Our success in investing in real estate depends in part upon the continued availability of suitable real estate assets at acceptable prices. The availability of properties for investment at favorable prices depends on a number of factors outside of our control, including the risk of competitive over-bidding on real estate assets. Should suitable opportunities become less available, the number of properties we develop and invest in would be reduced, which would reduce revenue and profits. In addition, our ability to make investments will depend upon whether we have sufficient liquidity to fund such purchases and investments.\nIf we, or the entities we invest in, are not able to develop and market our real estate developments successfully or within expected timeframes or at projected pricing, our business and results of operations will be adversely affected. Before a property development generates any revenues, material expenditures are incurred to acquire land, obtain development approvals and construct significant portions of project infrastructure, amenities, model offices, showrooms, apartments or homes and sales facilities. It generally takes several years for a real estate development to achieve cumulative positive cash flow. If we, or the entities we invest in, are unable to develop and market our real estate developments successfully or to generate positive cash flows from these operations within expected timeframes, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nBecause certain of our assets are illiquid, we may not be able to sell these assets when appropriate or when desired. Large real estate developments like the ones that we retain investments in can be hard to sell, especially if local market conditions are poor. Such illiquidity could limit our ability to diversify our assets promptly in response to changing economic or investment conditions. Additionally, financial difficulties of other property owners resulting in distressed sales could depress real estate values in the markets in which we operate in times of illiquidity. These restrictions reduce our ability to respond to changes in the performance of our assets and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nGuaranty risks; risks of joint ventures. New Valley has a number of real estate-related investments in which other partners hold significant interests. New Valley must seek approval from these other parties for important actions regarding these joint ventures. Since the other parties\u2019 interests may differ from those of New Valley, a deadlock could arise that might impair the ability of the ventures to function. Such a deadlock could significantly harm a venture. Further, our minority interest in these joint ventures means that we may not be able to influence the outcome of any particular project, and our rights to obtain information may be limited to the contractual requirements. As a result, we may not have adequate insight into the financial condition of any of our joint ventures given that we do not oversee their financial reporting or decision making. If our partners face adverse financial conditions, it may impair their ability to fund capital calls or satisfy their share of any guarantees on project financing. In addition, we are typically obligated to execute guarantees or indemnify our partners for guarantees they may execute in connection with the acquisition or construction financing for our projects. The guarantees that we might be obligated to sign include guarantees for environmental liability at a project, improper acts committed by New Valley (otherwise known as a \u201cbad boy\u201d guaranty), as well as carry and completion guarantees for a project. In the event of a default, if a lender were to exercise its rights under these guarantees, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur real estate investments and the real estate market in general could be adversely impacted by changes in the law. Many different laws govern the development of real estate. Changes to laws such as affordable housing, zoning, air rights and others, could adversely impact our real estate projects. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the Treasury Department has recently issued Geographic Targeting Orders that will temporarily require certain United States title insurance companies to identify the natural persons who directly or indirectly beneficially own companies that pay all cash for high-end residential real estate in the Borough of Manhattan in New York City and in Miami-Dade County in Florida. No assurances can be given as to the impact such requirements may have on the continued purchasing of high-end residential properties in Manhattan and Miami-Dade County by such individuals while such requirements are in effect, and no assurances can be given as to the impact such requirements may have in the event they are extended to other markets throughout the country in which New Valley is engaged in high-end residential properties.\nThe real estate developments we invest in may be subject to losses as a result of construction defects. Real estate developers are subject to construction defect and warranty claims arising in the ordinary course of their business. These claims are common in the real estate development industry and can be costly.\nClaims may be asserted against the real estate developments we invest in for construction defects, personal injury or property damage caused by the developer, general contractor or subcontractors, and if successful, these claims may give rise to liability. Subcontractors are independent of the homebuilders that contract with them under normal management practices and\nthe terms of trade contracts and subcontracts within the industry; however, if U.S. or other regulatory agencies or courts reclassify the employees of sub-contractors as employees of real estate developers, real estate developers using subcontractors could be responsible for wage, hour and other employment-related liabilities of their subcontractors.\nIn addition, where the real estate developments in which we invest hire general contractors, unforeseen events such as the bankruptcy of, or an uninsured or under-insured loss claimed against, the general contractor may sometimes result in the real estate developer becoming responsible for the losses or other obligations of the general contractor. The costs of insuring against construction defect and product liability claims are high, and the amount of coverage offered by insurance companies may be limited. There can be no assurance that this coverage will not be further restricted and become more costly. If the real estate developments in our real estate portfolio are not able to obtain adequate insurance against these claims in the future, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nIncreasingly in recent years, individual and class action lawsuits have been filed against real estate developers asserting claims of personal injury and property damage caused by a variety of issues, including faulty materials and the presence of mold in residential dwellings. Furthermore, decreases in home values as a result of general economic conditions may result in an increase in both non-meritorious and meritorious construction defect claims, as well as claims based on marketing and sales practices. Insurance may not cover all of the claims arising from such issues, or such coverage may become prohibitively expensive. If real estate developments in our real estate portfolio are not able to obtain adequate insurance against these claims, they may experience litigation costs and losses that could reduce our revenues from these investments. Even if they are successful in defending such claims, we may incur significant losses.\nOur real estate investments may face substantial damages as a result of existing or future litigation, arbitration or other claims. The real estate developments we invest in are exposed to potentially significant litigation, arbitration proceedings and other claims, including breach of contract, contractual disputes and disputes relating to defective title, property misdescription or construction defects. Class action lawsuits can be costly to defend, and if our assets were to lose any certified class action suit, it could result in substantial liability. With respect to certain general liability exposures, including construction defect and product liability claims, interpretation of underlying current and future trends, assessment of claims and the related liability and reserve estimation process requires us to exercise significant judgment due to the complex nature of these exposures, with each exposure exhibiting unique circumstances. Furthermore, once claims are asserted for construction defects, it is difficult to determine the extent to which the assertion of these claims will expand geographically. As a result, we may suffer losses on our investments which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur investments in real estate are susceptible to adverse weather conditions and natural and man-made disasters. Adverse weather conditions and natural and man-made disasters such as hurricanes, tornadoes, storms, earthquakes, floods, droughts, fires, snow, blizzards, as well as terrorist attacks, riots and electrical outages, can have a significant effect on the assets in our real estate portfolio. These adverse conditions can cause physical damage to work in progress and new developments, delays and increased costs in the construction of new developments and disruptions and suspensions of operations, whether caused directly or by disrupting or suspending operations of those upon whom our real estate developments rely in their operations. Such adverse conditions can mutually cause or aggravate each other, and their incidence and severity are unpredictable. If insurance is unavailable to the real estate developments we invest in or is unavailable on acceptable terms, or if insurance is not adequate to cover business interruptions or losses resulting from adverse weather or natural or man-made disasters, the real estate developments we invest in and our results of operations will be adversely affected. In addition, damage to properties in our real estate portfolio caused by adverse weather or a natural or man-made disaster may cause insurance costs for these properties to increase.\nA major health and safety incident relating to our real estate investments could be costly in terms of potential liabilities and reputational damage. Building sites are inherently dangerous, and operating in the real estate development industry poses certain inherent health and safety risks. Due to regulatory requirements, health and safety performance is critical to the success of our real estate investments. Any failure in health and safety performance may result in penalties for non-compliance with relevant regulatory requirements, and a failure that results in a major or significant health and safety incident is likely to be costly in terms of potential liabilities incurred as a result. Such a failure could generate significant negative publicity and have a corresponding impact on the reputation and relationships of the developer with relevant regulatory agencies or governmental authorities, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our investment and operating results.\nInsurance may not cover some potential losses or may not be obtainable at commercially reasonable rates, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Real estate properties in our real estate portfolio maintain insurance on their properties in amounts and with deductibles that we believe are comparable with what owners of similar properties carry; however, such insurance may not cover some potential losses or may not be obtainable at commercially reasonable rates in the future. There also are certain types of risks (such as war, environmental contamination such as toxic mold, and lease and other contract claims) which are either uninsurable or not economically insurable. Should any uninsured or underinsured loss occur, we could lose our investment in, and anticipated profits and cash flows from, one or more properties.\nThe volatility in the capital and credit markets has increased in recent years. Because the volatility in capital and credit markets may create additional risks in the upcoming months and possibly years, we will continue to perform additional assessments to determine the impact, if any, on our consolidated financial statements. Thus, future impairment charges may occur.\nRisks associated with New Valley Ventures.\nRisks inherent in PropTech Investments. The types of investments that New Valley Ventures anticipates making in the PropTech industry may involve a high degree of risk. In general, financial and operating risks confronting portfolio companies can be significant. While targeted returns should reflect the perceived level of risk in any investment situation, there can be no assurance that New Valley Ventures will be adequately compensated for risks taken, and the loss of its entire investment is possible. The investments may be difficult to value and the timing of any profit realization is highly uncertain. Losses are likely to occur.\nEarly-stage and development-stage companies often experience unexpected problems in the areas of product development, manufacturing, marketing, financing and general management, which, in some cases, cannot be adequately solved. In addition, such companies may require substantial amounts of financing which may not be available through institutional private placements or the public markets. The percentage of companies that survive and prosper can be small.\nInvestments in more mature companies in the expansion or profitable stage may involve substantial risks. Such companies typically have obtained capital in the form of debt and/or equity to expand rapidly, reorganize operations, acquire other businesses, or develop new products and markets. These activities by definition involve a significant amount of change in a company and could give rise to significant problems in sales, manufacturing, and general management of these activities.\nRisks associated with Douglas Elliman.\nDouglas Elliman depends on a strong brand, and any failure to maintain, protect and enhance the Douglas Elliman brand would have an adverse effect on its ability to grow its real estate brokerage business. Douglas Elliman has developed a strong brand that we believe has contributed significantly to the success of its business. Maintaining, protecting and enhancing Douglas Elliman as a premium real estate brokerage brand is critical to growing its business. If Douglas Elliman does not successfully build and maintain a strong brand, its real estate brokerage business could be negatively impacted. Preserving and increasing the quality of the Douglas Elliman brand may require us to make substantial investments in areas such as marketing, community relations, outreach technology and employee training. Douglas Elliman actively engages in print and online advertisements, targeted promotional mailings and email communications and engages on a regular basis in public relations and sponsorship activities. There is no assurance that those activities will enhance the brand awareness.\nBrand value can be severely damaged even by isolated incidents, particularly if the incidents receive considerable negative publicity or result in litigation. Some of these incidents may relate to the way Douglas Elliman manages its relationship with its agents, its growth strategies or the ordinary course of its business or its brokerage business. Other incidents may arise from events that are or may be beyond its ability to control and may damage its brand, such as actions taken (or not taken) by one or more agents relating to health, safety, welfare or other matters; litigation and claims; failure to maintain high ethical and social standards for all of its operations and activities; failure to comply with local laws and regulations; and illegal activity targeted at Douglas Elliman or others. Douglas Elliman\u2019s brand value could diminish significantly if any such incidents or other matters erode consumer confidence in it, which may result in a decrease in its total agent count and, ultimately could adversely affect its business and operating results.\nThe real estate brokerage business in the New York City metropolitan area, Florida, California, Massachusetts, Colorado, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Texas is extremely competitive. Douglas Elliman competes with other multi-office independent real estate organizations and with franchise real estate organizations competing in local areas. Competition is particularly intense in the densely populated metropolitan areas of New York City, South Florida and Los Angeles in which it operates. In addition, in the real estate brokerage industry, new participants face minimal barriers to entry into the market. Douglas Elliman also competes for the services of qualified licensed agents. The ability of its brokerage offices to retain agents is generally subject to numerous factors, including the sales commissions they receive, advertising support and perception of brand value.\nDouglas Elliman\u2019s business is concentrated in the states of New York, California, Connecticut, New Jersey and Massachusetts and changes in U.S. Tax Laws could impact these markets. The Tax Act places new limits on mortgage interest deductions as well as state and local income and property tax deductions. The loss of the use of these deductions may encourage residents of states with high income and property taxes and costs of housing to migrate to states with lower tax rates and housing costs. In 2020, approximately 73.0% of Douglas Elliman\u2019s closed sales occurred in the states of New York, California, Connecticut and Massachusetts, and a migration of residents from these markets or a reduction in the attractiveness of these markets as a place to live could adversely impact Douglas Elliman\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe financial results of Douglas Elliman\u2019s real estate brokerage business is affected directly by the success of its agents. Douglas Elliman\u2019s real estate brokerage offices generate revenue in the form of commissions and service fees. Accordingly, its financial results depend upon the operational and financial success of its brokerage offices and its agents. As mentioned above, there is significant competition among brokerage firms for the services of high producing agents. The failure to recruit and retain these agents could negatively impact the financial success of Douglas Elliman\u2019s brokerage business.\nWe have made significant operating adjustments in Douglas Elliman\u2019s real estate brokerage business, including staff reductions, which could negatively impact the financial success of Douglas Elliman\u2019s brokerage business in the future. Douglas Elliman\u2019s real estate brokerage offices generate revenue in the form of commissions and service fees. Accordingly, its financial results depend upon the operational and financial success of its brokerage offices and its agents. As a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Douglas Elliman\u2019s brokerage business, in April 2020, we made significant operating adjustments at Douglas Elliman, including a reduction of personnel by approximately 25%, which resulted in a reduction in salaries and administrative expenses, as well as a reduction, deferral or elimination of leases across the country. As a result of the expense reductions, in addition to personnel expenses, Douglas Elliman\u2019s professional services, advertising, travel and other occupancy expenses were reduced during the second and third quarters of 2020. While such expense-reduction measures were necessary in order to mitigate the on-going financial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on Douglas Elliman\u2019s business, there can be no assurance that we will be able to re-hire those employees in the event that economic conditions improve, and as a result, the staff reductions that we have made could negatively impact the financial success of Douglas Elliman\u2019s brokerage business in the future. Further, while we continue to evaluate other expense reduction measures, as Douglas Elliman\u2019s business began to improve in the third quarter, we began to relinquish, as appropriate, some of the second quarter expense reductions, including advertising and personnel expenses, and to the extent Douglas Elliman\u2019s business continues to improve in the fourth quarter, we will continue to do so.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic could continue to have a material impact on our Real Estate segment; the likelihood and magnitude of a material impact increases with the amount of time the virus impacts activity levels in locations in which Douglas Elliman operates. Therefore, we are unable to predict the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the future financial condition, results of operations and cash flows from our Real Estate segment.\nInfringement, misappropriation or dilution of Douglas Elliman's intellectual property could harm its business. We regard the Douglas Elliman trademark portfolio as having significant value and as being an important factor in the marketing of its brand. Douglas Elliman believes that this and other intellectual property are valuable assets that are critical to its success. Douglas Elliman relies on a combination of protections provided by contracts, as well as copyright, trademark, and other laws, to protect our intellectual property from infringement, misappropriation or dilution. It has registered certain trademarks and service marks and has other trademark and service mark registration applications pending in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Although Douglas Elliman monitors its trademark portfolio both internally and through external search agents and imposes an obligation on agents to notify it upon learning of potential infringement, there can be no assurance that it will be able to adequately maintain, enforce and protect its trademarks or other intellectual property rights.\nDouglas Elliman is not aware of any challenges to its right to use any of its brand names or trademarks. It is commonly involved in numerous proceedings, generally on a small scale, to enforce its intellectual property and protect its brand. Unauthorized uses or other infringement of its trademarks or service marks, including ones that are currently unknown to us, could diminish the value of its brand and may adversely affect its business. Failure to adequately protect its intellectual property rights could damage its brand and impair its ability to compete effectively. Even where it has effectively secured statutory protection for its trademarks and other intellectual property, its competitors may misappropriate its intellectual property. Defending or enforcing its trademark rights, branding practices and other intellectual property, and seeking an injunction and/or\ncompensation for misappropriation of confidential information, could result in the expenditure of significant resources and divert the attention of management, which in turn may adversely affect our business and operating results.\nMoreover, unauthorized third parties may use Douglas Elliman\u2019s intellectual property to trade on the goodwill of its brand, resulting in consumer confusion or dilution. Any reduction of its brand\u2019s goodwill, consumer confusion, or dilution is likely to impact sales, and could adversely affect its business and operating results.\nDouglas Elliman relies on traffic to its websites, including its flagship website, elliman.com, directed from search engines. If these websites fail to rank prominently in unpaid search results, traffic to these websites could decline and its business would be adversely affected. Douglas Elliman\u2019s success depends in part on its ability to attract users through unpaid Internet search results on search engines. The number of users it attracts to its websites, including its flagship website elliman.com, from search engines is due in large part to how and where its websites rank in unpaid search results. These rankings can be affected by a number of factors, many of which are not under our direct control, and they may change frequently. For example, a search engine may change its ranking algorithms, methodologies or design layouts. As a result, links to Douglas Elliman\u2019s websites may not be prominent enough to drive traffic to its websites, and we may not know how or otherwise be in a position to influence the results. In some instances, search engine companies may change these rankings in order to promote their own competing services or the services of one or more of Douglas Elliman\u2019s competitors. Douglas Elliman\u2019s websites have experienced fluctuations in search result rankings in the past, and it anticipates fluctuations in the future. Any reduction in the number of users directed to its websites could adversely affect its real estate brokerage business and results of operations. Further, a failure of Douglas Elliman\u2019s websites or website-based technology, either due to malfunction, outside intrusion through hacking or otherwise, could significantly disrupt its business and lead to reduced revenue and reputational damage as Douglas Elliman may not be able to effectively scale and adapt its existing technology and network infrastructure to ensure its platforms are accessible.\nRisks Relating to Our Indebtedness\nWe and our subsidiaries have a substantial amount of indebtedness and liquidity commitments.\nWe and our subsidiaries have significant indebtedness and debt service obligations. As of December 31, 2020, we and our subsidiaries had total outstanding indebtedness of $1.43 billion on a historical basis (or $1.46 billion adjusted to give effect to our January 2021 refinancing). In addition, subject to the terms of any future agreements, we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur additional indebtedness in the future. There is a risk that we will not be able to generate sufficient funds to repay our debt. If we cannot service our fixed charges, it would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe have significant liquidity commitments.\nDuring 2021, we will have significant liquidity commitments that will require the use of our existing cash resources. As of December 31, 2020, our corporate expenditures (exclusive of Liggett, Vector Tobacco and New Valley) and other potential liquidity requirements over the next 12 months include the following (after giving effect to our January 2021 refinancing):\n\u2022cash interest expense of approximately $109.5 million,\n\u2022principal payments on notes related to acquisition of remaining portion of Douglas Elliman of $12.5 million,\n\u2022dividends of approximately $128.4 million based on the assumed quarterly cash dividend rate of $0.20 per share and assuming 157,572,448 shares outstanding (153,324,629 common shares outstanding as of December 31, 2020 and 4,247,819 employee stock options with dividend equivalent rights), and\n\u2022other corporate expenses and taxes.\nIn order to meet the above liquidity requirements as well as other liquidity needs in the normal course of business, we will be required to use cash flows from operations and existing cash and cash equivalents. Should these resources be insufficient to meet the upcoming liquidity needs, we may also be required to liquidate investment securities available for sale and other long-term investments, or, if available, draw on the Liggett Credit Facility. While there are actions we can take to reduce our liquidity needs, there can be no assurance that such measures will be successful.\nServicing our indebtedness requires a significant amount of cash and we may not generate sufficient cash flow from our businesses to pay our substantial indebtedness.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal, to pay interest on, or to refinance our indebtedness, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and regulatory factors, as well as other factors beyond our control. The cash flow from operations in the future may be insufficient to service our indebtedness because of factors beyond our control. If we are unable to generate the necessary cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations.\nOur high level of debt may adversely affect our ability to satisfy our obligations.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to meet our debt service obligations. A default in our debt obligations, including a breach of any restrictive covenant imposed by the terms of our indebtedness, could result in the acceleration of the affected debt as well as other of our indebtedness. In such a situation, it is unlikely that we would be able to fulfill our obligations under the debt or such other indebtedness or that we would otherwise be able to repay the accelerated indebtedness or make other required payments. Even in the absence of an acceleration of our indebtedness, a default under the terms of our indebtedness could have an adverse impact on our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and on the trading price of our debt and our common stock.\nOur high level of indebtedness, as well as volatility in the capital and credit markets, could have important consequences. For example, they could:\n\u2022make it more difficult for us to satisfy our other obligations with respect to our debt, including repurchase obligations, upon the occurrence of specified change of control events;\n\u2022increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022limit our ability to obtain additional financing;\n\u2022require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, reducing the amount of our cash flow available for dividends on our common stock and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022require us to sell other securities or to sell some or all of our assets, possibly on unfavorable terms, to meet payment obligations;\n\u2022restrict us from making strategic acquisitions, investing in new capital assets or taking advantage of business opportunities;\n\u2022limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry; and\n\u2022place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that have less debt.\nOur 5.75% Senior Secured Notes, 10.5% Senior Notes, and Liggett Credit Facility contain restrictive covenants, and the Liggett Credit Facility contains financial ratios, that limit our operating flexibility, and may limit our ability to pay dividends in the future.\nThe indenture governing our 5.75% Senior Secured Notes due 2029 (the \u201c2029 Indenture\u201d), the indenture governing our 10.5% Senior Notes due 2026 (the \u201c2026 Indenture\u201d) and the Liggett Credit Facility contain covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to take specific actions, even if we believe them to be in our best interest, including restrictions on our ability to:\n\u2022incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred stock;\n\u2022pay dividends or distributions on, or redeem or repurchase, capital stock or subordinated indebtedness, or make other restricted payments;\n\u2022create or incur liens with respect to our assets;\n\u2022make investments, loans or advances;\n\u2022incur dividend or other payment restrictions;\n\u2022prepay subordinated indebtedness;\n\u2022enter into certain transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022merge, consolidate, reorganize or sell our assets, or use asset sale proceeds.\nOur ability to comply with the provisions of the 2029 Indenture, the 2026 Indenture, and the Liggett Credit Facility may be affected by changes in our operating and financial performance, changes in general business and economic conditions, adverse regulatory developments or other events beyond our control. The breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our indebtedness, which could cause those and other obligations to become due and payable. If any of our indebtedness is accelerated, we may not be able to repay it. See Liquidity and Capital Resources in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for details of debt covenant compliance.\nChanges in respect of the debt ratings of our notes may materially and adversely affect the availability, the cost and the terms and conditions of our debt.\nBoth we and several issues of our notes have been publicly rated by Moody\u2019s Investors Service, Inc. (\u201cMoody\u2019s\u201d), and Standard & Poor\u2019s Rating Services (\u201cS&P\u201d), independent rating agencies. In addition, future debt instruments may be publicly rated. These debt ratings may affect our ability to raise debt. Any future downgrading of the notes or our other debt by Moody\u2019s or S&P may affect the cost and terms and conditions of our financings and could adversely affect the value and trading of the notes.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 may increase the after-tax cost of debt financings.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \u201cTax Act\u201d) limits our interest expense deduction to 30% of taxable income before interest, depreciation and amortization in 2018 and 2021 and 50% of taxable income before interest, depreciation, and amortization in 2019 and 2020 (as a result of provisions contained in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (\u201cCARES\u201d) Act, and then 30% of taxable income before interest thereafter for non-excepted trade or businesses. One such excepted trade or business is any electing real property trade or business, of which portions of our real estate business may qualify. Interest expense allocable to an excepted trade or business is not subject to limitation. The Tax Act permits us to carry forward disallowed interest expense indefinitely. Although all of our interest expense has been deductible to date, due to our high degree of leverage, a portion of our interest expense in future years may not be deductible, which may increase the after tax cost of any new debt financings as well as the refinancing of our existing debt. We will continue to evaluate the impact of the nondeductible interest on our operations and capital structure.\nRisks Relating to Our Structure and Other Business Risks\nWe are a holding company and depend on cash payments from our subsidiaries, which are subject to contractual and other restrictions, in order to service our debt and to pay dividends on our common stock.\nWe are a holding company and have no operations of our own. We hold our interests in our various businesses through our wholly-owned subsidiaries, VGR Holding LLC and New Valley LLC. In addition to our own cash resources, our ability to pay interest on our debt and to pay dividends on our common stock depends on the ability of VGR Holding and New Valley to make cash available to us. VGR Holding\u2019s ability to pay dividends to us depends primarily on the ability of Liggett and Vector Tobacco, its wholly-owned subsidiaries, to generate cash and make it available to VGR Holding. The Liggett Credit Facility contains a restricted payments test that limits the ability of Liggett to pay cash dividends to VGR Holding. The ability of Liggett to meet the restricted payments test may be affected by factors beyond its control.\nOur receipt of cash payments, as dividends or otherwise, from our subsidiaries is an important source of our liquidity and capital resources. If we do not have sufficient cash resources of our own and do not receive payments from our subsidiaries in an amount sufficient to repay our debts and to pay dividends on our common stock, we must obtain additional funds from other sources. There is a risk that we will not be able to obtain additional funds at all or on terms acceptable to us. Our inability to service these obligations and to continue to pay dividends on our common stock would significantly harm us and the value of our notes and our common stock.\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nWe have a substantial amount of goodwill and other intangible assets on our balance sheet, primarily comprised of goodwill and trademarks related to Douglas Elliman. Goodwill, trademarks and other identifiable intangible assets must be tested for impairment at least annually. The fair value of the goodwill assigned to a reporting unit could decline if projected revenues or cash flows were to be lower in the future due to effects of the global economy or other causes. If the carrying value of intangible assets or of goodwill were to exceed its fair value, the asset would be written down to its fair value, with the impairment loss recognized as a non-cash charge in our Consolidated Statement of Operations.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $208 million of goodwill and other intangible assets on our balance sheet, which included $32 million of goodwill and $68 million of trademarks related to Douglas Elliman. During the first quarter of 2020, we determined that a triggering event occurred related to the Douglas Elliman reporting unit due to a decline in sales and profitability projections for the reporting unit driven by the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic disruption. We utilized third-party valuation specialists to prepare a quantitative assessment of goodwill and trademark intangible asset related to Douglas Elliman. The quantitative assessments resulted in impairment charges to goodwill of $46.3 million and to the trademark intangible asset of $12.0 million. Changes in the future outlook of the Douglas Elliman reporting unit could result in an impairment loss, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nMaintaining the integrity of our computer systems and protecting confidential information and personal identifying information has become increasingly costly, as cybersecurity incidents could disrupt business operations, result in the loss of critical and confidential information, and adversely impact our reputation and results of operations.\nGlobal cybersecurity threats and incidents can range from uncoordinated individual attempts that gain unauthorized access to information technology systems both internally and externally, to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats, directed at the Company and its affiliated agents. In the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including our proprietary business information and intellectual property, and personally identifiable information of our tobacco and real estate customers. Additionally, we increasingly rely on third-party data storage providers, including cloud storage solution providers. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information are critical to our operations and with respect to information collected and stored by our third-party service providers, we are reliant upon their security procedures. Our systems and the confidential information on them may also be compromised by employee misconduct or employee error. While we and our third-party service providers have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, these types of internal and external threats and incidents, cybersecurity incidents, depending on their nature and scope, could potentially result in the misappropriation, destruction, corruption or unavailability of critical data and confidential or proprietary information (our own or that of third parties, including personally identifiable information) and the disruption of business operations. Our business interruption insurance may be insufficient to compensate us for losses that may occur. The potential consequences of a material cybersecurity incident include reputational damage, litigation with third parties, diminution in the value of the services we provide to our customers, and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs, which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations. Developments in the laws and regulations governing the handling and transmission of personal identifying information in the United States may require us to devote more resources to protecting such information, which could in turn adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe depend on our key personnel.\nWe depend on the efforts of our executive officers and other key personnel as our named executive officers have been employed by us for an average of 25 years at December 31, 2020. While we believe that we could find replacements for these key personnel, the loss of their services could have a significant adverse effect on our operations.\nFailure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could adversely affect us.\nThe accuracy of our financial reporting depends on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, the implementation of which requires significant management attention. Internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements and may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations. These limitations include, among others, the possibility of human error, inadequacy or circumvention of controls and fraud. If we do not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or design and implement controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of our financial statements, including in connection with controls executed for us by third parties, we might fail to timely detect any misappropriation of corporate assets or inappropriate allocation or use of funds and could be unable to file accurate financial reports on a timely basis. As a result, our reputation, results of operations and stock price could be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Relating to our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly.\nThe trading price of our common stock has ranged between $7.92 and $14.60 per share over the past 52 weeks.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include the following:\n\u2022actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022changes in expectations as to our future financial performance, including financial estimates by securities analysts and investors;\n\u2022the operating and stock performance of our competitors;\n\u2022our dividend payment ratio and level;\n\u2022announcements by us or our competitors of new products or services or significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u2022the initiation or outcome of litigation;\n\u2022the failure or significant disruption of our operations from various causes related to our critical information technologies and systems including cybersecurity threats to our data and customer data as well as reputational or financial risks associated with a loss of any such data;\n\u2022changes in interest rates;\n\u2022general economic, market and political conditions;\n\u2022additions or departures of key personnel; and\n\u2022future sales of our equity or convertible securities.\nWe cannot predict the extent, if any, to which future sales of shares of common stock or the availability of shares of common stock for future sale, may depress the trading price of our common stock.\nIn addition, the stock market in recent years has experienced extreme price and trading volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of individual companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. Furthermore, stockholders may initiate securities class action lawsuits if the market price of our stock drops significantly, which may cause us to incur substantial costs and could divert the time and attention of our management. These factors, among others, could significantly depress the price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 75233, "SIC": 6531, "TIC": "VGR"}
