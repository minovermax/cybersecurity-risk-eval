{"cik": "31978", "company": "EL PASO ELECTRIC CO /TX/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-27", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nLike other companies in our industry, our financial results are primarily impacted by weather, the economy of our service territory, market prices for power, fuel prices, and the decisions of regulatory agencies. Our common stock price and creditworthiness may be affected by local, regional and national macroeconomic trends, general market conditions and the expectations of the investment community, all of which are largely beyond our control. In addition, the following statements highlight risk factors that may affect our financial condition and results of operations. These are not intended to be an exhaustive discussion of all such risks, and the statements below must be read together with factors discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other filings with the SEC.\nRisk Factors Relating to Our Operations\nOur Revenues and Profitability Depend Upon Regulated Rates\nOur rates are governed by Texas, New Mexico and federal laws and regulations, with our retail rates subject to regulation by incorporated municipalities in Texas, the PUCT, the NMPRC and our wholesale rates subject to regulation by the FERC. There can be no assurance that the laws and regulations or the application thereof in our different jurisdictions will be similar or consistent, which could lead to different treatment of certain matters by our regulators in different jurisdictions. The PUCT Final Order in Docket No. 46831 (\"2017 PUCT Final Order\") established our current retail base rates in Texas, effective July 18, 2017. In addition, the NMPRC Final Order in Case No. 15-00127-UT (\"NMPRC Final Order\") established rates in New Mexico that became effective in July 2016.\nOur profitability depends on our ability to recover the costs, including a reasonable return on invested capital, of providing electric service to our customers through base rates approved by our regulators. These rates are generally established based on an analysis of the expenses we incur in a historical test year, and as a result, the rates ultimately approved by our regulators may or may not match our expenses at any given time and recovery of expenses may lag behind the occurrence of those expenses. Rates in New Mexico may be established using projected costs and investment for a future test year period in certain instances. While rate regulation is based on the assumption that we will have a reasonable opportunity to recover our costs and earn a reasonable rate of return on our invested capital, there can be no assurance that our future Texas rate cases, New Mexico rate cases or FERC rate cases will result in rates that will allow us to fully recover our costs including a reasonable return on invested capital, or that our regulators will make similar or consistent determinations with respect to our rates, operations or other matters before our regulators. There can be no assurance that regulators will determine that all of our costs are reasonable and have been prudently incurred, including costs associated with future plant retirements. It is also likely that third parties will intervene in any rate cases and challenge whether our costs are reasonable and necessary. If all of our costs are not recovered, or timely recovered, through the retail rates ultimately approved by our regulators, our profitability and cash flow could be adversely affected which, over time, could adversely affect our ability to meet our financial obligations.\nWe May Not Be Able To Recover All Costs of New Generation and Transmission Assets\nWe received approval, both from the PUCT and the NMPRC, to construct Units 3 and 4, two 89-MW simple-cycle aeroderivative combustion turbines at MPS. In 2016, we completed construction of these units, which began commercial operation in May 2016 and September 2016, respectively. The PUCT approved the inclusion of the Texas jurisdictional portion of MPS Units 3 and 4 in base rates in the 2017 PUCT Final Order. However, the New Mexico jurisdiction portion of MPS Units 3 and 4 have not yet been approved by the NMPRC for inclusion in customer base rates. Accordingly, we are exposed to the risk of failing to recover these costs as well as costs associated with the construction of other new units and transmission and distribution assets.\nWe announced the results of the 2017 All Source RFP on December 26, 2018, that include a diverse generation mix. The selected proposals are subject to the execution of contracts following negotiations with the winning bidders, obtaining the applicable environmental and construction related permits and obtaining necessary approvals by the PUCT and the NMPRC. In relation to the 2017 All Source RFP, the Company filed for regulatory approval with the NMPRC for three Long-Term Purchased Power Agreements relating to (i) a 100-MW solar plant to be constructed in Santa Teresa, New Mexico; (ii) a 100-MW solar plant combined with 50-MW of battery energy storage to be constructed in Otero County, New Mexico; and (iii) a 50-MW battery energy storage facility to be constructed in Canutillo, Texas. Additionally, the Company has filed a certificate of convenience and necessity with both the PUCT and the NMPRC to own and operate a new approximately 228-MW natural gas-fired unit to be constructed at the Company\u2019s existing Newman Power Station. The Company cannot predict the outcome of these filings at this time.\nIn addition, for all resource additions, if the contracts, permits, approvals or the construction of the new unit is not completed on time, we may be required to purchase power or operate less efficient generating units to meet customer requirements. Any replacement purchased power or fuel costs will be subject to regulatory review by the PUCT and the NMPRC. We face financial\nrisks to the extent that recovery is not allowed for any replacement fuel costs resulting from delays in the completion of these new units or other new units.\nWeakness in the Economy and Uncertainty in the Financial Markets Could Reduce Our Sales, Hinder Our Capital Programs and Increase Our Funding Obligations for Pensions and Decommissioning\nThe global credit and equity markets and the overall economy can be extremely volatile, which could have a number of adverse effects on our operations, funding obligations and capital programs. For example, tight credit and capital markets could make it difficult and more expensive to raise capital to fund our operations and capital programs. If we are unable to access the credit markets, we could be required to defer or eliminate important capital projects in the future. In addition, declines in stock market performance may reduce the value of our financial assets and decommissioning trust investments and negatively impact our results of operations. Similarly, inflationary increases will increase our future decommission obligations. Such market results may also increase our funding obligations for our pension plans, other post-retirement benefit plans and the NDT. Changes in the corporate interest rates that we use as the discount rate to determine our pension and other post-retirement liabilities may have an impact on our funding obligations for such plans and trusts.\nFurther, an economic downturn may result in reduced customer demand, both in the retail and wholesale markets, and increases in customer delinquencies and write-offs. Uncertainty in the credit markets may negatively impact the ability of our customers to finance purchases of our services and could adversely affect the collectability of our receivables. The credit markets and overall economy (including inflationary increases) may also adversely impact our ability to arrange future financings on acceptable terms and therefore our ability to refinance our existing indebtedness could be limited. Furthermore, the credit markets and overall economy may also adversely impact the financial health of our suppliers. If that were to occur, our access to and prices for inventory, supplies and capital equipment could be adversely affected. Our power trading counterparties could also be adversely impacted by the market and economic conditions, which could result in reduced wholesale power sales or increased counterparty credit risk.\nSimilarly, actions or inaction of Congress and of governmental agencies can impact our operations. Partial government shutdowns, such as occurred in 2013, the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019, can impact both sales and timely receivables from public authorities, commercial, industrial and residential customers. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThere are Inherent Risks in the Ownership of Nuclear Facilities\nOur 15.8% ownership interest in Palo Verde, which is the largest nuclear electric generating facility in the U.S., subjects us to a number of risks. A significant percentage of our generating capacity, off-system sales margins, assets and operating expenses is attributable to Palo Verde. Our interest in each of the three Palo Verde units totals approximately 633 MW of generating capacity. Palo Verde represents approximately 30% of our available net generating capacity and provided approximately 44% of our energy requirements for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. Palo Verde comprises approximately 23% of our total net plant-in-service and Palo Verde expenses comprise a significant portion of O&M expenses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. APS is the operating agent for Palo Verde, and we have limited ability under the ANPP Participation Agreement to influence operations and costs at Palo Verde. Palo Verde operated at a capacity factor of 92.5% and 90.2% in the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nWe participate in Palo Verde with one or more parties who may not have the same goals, strategies, priorities or resources as we do and may compete with us. Furthermore, regulatory compliance issues and financial restraints could cause these parties to make decisions that could potentially be adverse to us. Additionally, if one or more of the participants defaults in performance of its obligations under the ANPP Participation Agreement, the non-defaulting participants must bear all operating, maintenance, and other costs otherwise payable by the defaulting participant (and will receive the generation share of the defaulting participant) in the ratio of their respective share to the total shares of all non-defaulting participants.\nAs Palo Verde is a nuclear electric generating facility, it is subject to environmental, health and financial risks, such as the ability to obtain adequate supplies of nuclear fuel and water; the ability to dispose of spent nuclear fuel; increases in decommissioning costs due to inflation and regulatory changes; the ability to maintain adequate trust fund reserves for decommissioning; potential liabilities arising out of the operation of these facilities; the costs of securing the facilities against possible terrorist attacks; cyber-attacks, or other causes and unscheduled outages due to equipment and other problems. If a nuclear incident were to occur at Palo Verde, it could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. A major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause regulatory bodies to limit or prohibit the operation or licensing of any domestic nuclear unit and to promulgate new regulations that could require significant capital expenditures and/or increase operating costs.\nThe NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose safety-related, security-related and other licensing requirements for the operation of nuclear generating facilities. Events at nuclear facilities of other operators or impacting the industry generally may lead the NRC to impose additional requirements and regulations on all nuclear generating facilities, including Palo Verde. In the event of noncompliance with its requirements, the NRC has the authority to impose a progressively increased inspection regime that could ultimately result in the shut-down of a unit or civil penalties, or both, depending upon the NRC\u2019s assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved. The increased costs resulting from penalties, a heightened level of scrutiny and implementation of plans to achieve compliance with NRC requirements may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe May Not Be Able to Recover All of Our Fuel Expenses from Customers On a Timely Basis Or at All\nIn general, by law, we are entitled to recover our reasonable and necessary fuel and purchased power expenses from our customers in Texas and New Mexico. NMPRC Case No. 18-00006-UT provides for capacity and energy delivered to New Mexico customers from the deregulated Palo Verde Unit 3 to be recovered based on an approved fuel and purchased power cost. Fuel and purchased power expenses in Texas and New Mexico are subject to reconciliation by the PUCT and NMPRC. Prior to the completion of a reconciliation, we record fuel and purchased power costs such that fuel revenues equal recoverable fuel and purchased power expense including the re-priced energy costs for Palo Verde Unit 3 in New Mexico. In the event that recovery of fuel and purchased power expenses is denied in any reconciliation proceeding, the amounts recorded for fuel and purchased power expenses could differ from the amounts we are allowed to collect from our customers, and we would incur a loss to the extent of the disallowance.\nIn New Mexico, the Fuel and Purchased Power Cost Adjustment Clause (\"FPPCAC\") allows us to reflect current fuel and purchased power expenses in the FPPCAC and to adjust for under-recoveries and over-recoveries with a two-month lag. In Texas, fuel costs are recovered through a fixed fuel factor. In Texas, we can seek to revise our fixed fuel factor based upon our approved formula at least four months after our last revision except in the month of December. If we materially under-recover fuel costs, we may seek a surcharge to recover those costs at any time the balance exceeds a threshold material amount and is expected to continue to be materially under-recovered. During periods of significant increases in natural gas prices, we realize a lag in the ability to reflect increases in fuel costs in our fuel recovery mechanisms in Texas. As a result, cash flow is impacted due to the lag in payment of fuel costs and collection of fuel costs from customers. To the extent the fuel and purchased power recovery processes in Texas and New Mexico do not provide for the timely recovery of such costs, we could experience a material negative impact on our cash flow.\nSecurity Breaches, Criminal Activity, Terrorist Attacks and Other Disruptions to Our Infrastructure Could Interfere With Our Operations, Could Expose Us or Our Customers or Employees to a Risk of Loss, and Could Expose Us to Liability, Regulatory Penalties, Reputational Damage and Other Harm to Our Business\nWe rely upon our infrastructure to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities, including the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity, supply chain functions, and the invoicing and collection of payments from our customers. We also use information technology systems for internal accounting purposes and to comply with financial reporting, legal and tax requirements. Our information technology networks and infrastructure may be vulnerable to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by hackers, breaches due to employee error or malfeasance, system failures, computer viruses, natural disasters, a physical attack on our facilities, or other catastrophic events. The occurrence of any of these events to us or our key suppliers or service providers could impact the reliability of our generation, transmission and distribution systems and energy marketing and trading functions; could expose us or our customers or employees to a risk of loss or misuse of confidential information; and could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or regulatory penalties against us, damage our reputation or otherwise harm our business. In addition, we may be required to incur significant costs to prevent or respond to damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future. Further, certain of the various internal systems we use to conduct our businesses are highly integrated. Consequently, a cyber-attack or unauthorized access in any one of these systems could potentially impact the other systems.\nAdditionally, we cannot predict the impact that any future information technology or terrorist attack may have on the energy industry in general. The effects of such attacks against us or others in the energy industry could increase the cost of regulatory compliance, increase the cost of insurance coverage or result in a decline in the U.S. economy which could negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition. Ongoing and future governmental efforts to regulate cybersecurity in the energy industry could lead to increased regulatory compliance costs.\nAs domestic and global cyber threats are on-going and increasing in sophistication, magnitude and frequency, our critical energy infrastructure may be targets of terrorist activities or otherwise could disrupt our business operations. Any such disruptions could result in significant costs to repair damaged facilities and implement increased security measures, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe are subject to laws and rules issued by multiple government agencies concerning safeguarding and maintaining the confidentiality of our security, customer and business information. One of these agencies, the NERC, has issued comprehensive regulations and standards surrounding the security of bulk power systems, and is continually in the process of developing updated and additional requirements with which the utility industry must comply. The NRC also has issued regulations and standards related to the protection of critical digital assets at commercial nuclear power plants. The increasing promulgation of NERC and NRC rules and standards will increase our compliance costs and our exposure to the potential risk of violations of the standards. Experiencing a cybersecurity incident could cause us to be non-compliant with applicable laws and regulations, such as those promulgated by NERC and the NRC, or contracts that require us to securely maintain confidential data, causing us to incur costs related to legal claims or proceedings and regulatory fines or penalties.\nWe May Incur Additional Capital and Operating Costs in Connection with the Physical Security and Cyber Security of New Technologies\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry that requires the continued operation and development of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure. The introduction of new technology and the emergence of new industry standards and technological hurdles can create unanticipated difficulties, including failures or inadequacy of equipment or software, difficulties in integrating the various components of the equipment, changes in technology, cybersecurity issues and factors outside our control, which could negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition. As we continue to develop new technology to keep up with the demands of the industry and the needs of our customers, we may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by security breaches.\nFailure to Maintain the Security of Personally Identifiable Information Could Adversely Affect Us\nIn connection with our business we and our vendors, suppliers and contractors collect and retain personally identifiable information (e.g., information of our customers, shareholders, suppliers and employees), and there is an expectation that we and such third parties will adequately protect that information. The U.S. regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding. A significant theft, loss or fraudulent use of the personally identifiable information we maintain or failure by our vendors, suppliers and contractors to use or maintain such information in accordance with contractual provisions could adversely impact our reputation and could result in significant costs, fines, litigation and loss of reputation.\nWeather Conditions Affect the Demand for Electricity or Could Result in Unplanned Outages\nOur service territory is in west Texas and southern New Mexico and is particularly susceptible to dry and hot temperatures in the summer months. These seasonal weather patterns result in temperatures that can lead to daytime highs exceeding 100 degrees Fahrenheit for extended periods during the summer when we typically experience peak kWh sales at higher summer rates. Milder temperatures during this period will occur occasionally and result in less kWh sales, which will adversely affect our results of operations. From time to time, we experience extreme weather conditions, including high winds (usually in the spring months but can occur during other months), that may result in unplanned outages. Under such conditions, we may incur additional costs to repair and, if necessary, to replace equipment. Depending upon the length and extent of the damage, we may also incur additional purchased power costs. Fallen power lines and poles can cause severe damage to customer property and subject us to claims, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nEquipment Failures and Other External Factors Can Adversely Affect Our Results\nThe generation and transmission of electricity require the use of expensive and complex equipment. While we have a maintenance program in place, generating plants are subject to unplanned outages because of equipment failure and severe weather conditions. The advanced age of several of our gas-fired generating units in or near El Paso increases the vulnerability of these units. In the event of unplanned outages, we must acquire power from other sources at unpredictable costs in order to supply our customers and comply with our contractual agreements. This additional purchased power cost would be subject to review and approval of the PUCT and the NMPRC in reconciliation proceedings. As noted above, in the event that recovery for fuel and purchased power expenses could differ from the amounts we are allowed to collect from our customers, we would incur a loss to the extent of the disallowance. Unplanned outages could also prevent us from selling excess power at wholesale. In addition, actions of other utilities may adversely affect our ability to use transmission lines to deliver or import power, thus subjecting us to unexpected expenses or to the cost and uncertainty of public policy initiatives. We may also incur additional capital and operating costs in connection with the physical security and cyber security of transmission lines and generation facilities. Damage to certain transmission and generation facilities due to vandalism or other deliberate acts, or damage due to severe weather could lead to outages or other adverse effects. We are particularly vulnerable to this because a significant portion of our available energy (at Palo Verde) is located hundreds of miles from El Paso and Las Cruces and must be delivered to our customers over long distance transmission lines. In addition, Palo Verde\u2019s availability is an important factor in realizing off-system sales margins. These factors,\nas well as interest rates, economic conditions, fuel prices and price volatility, could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flow and financial position. While we believe that we maintain adequate insurance coverage for such incidents, there is no assurance that all costs in excess of deductible amounts will be reimbursed or that we can maintain such coverage limits in the future at competitive market rates. In the event future insurance costs and/or deductible amounts increase, our financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nCompetition and Deregulation Could Result in a Loss of Customers and Increased Costs\nAs a result of changes in federal law, our wholesale and large retail customers have access to, in varying degrees, alternative sources of power, including co-generation of electric power. Deregulation legislation is in effect in Texas requiring us to separate our transmission and distribution functions, which would remain regulated, from our power generation and energy services businesses, which would operate in a competitive market, in the future. In 2004, the PUCT approved a rule delaying retail competition in our Texas service territory. This rule was codified in the Texas Public Utility Regulatory Act (\"PURA\") in June 2011. The PURA identifies various milestones that we must reach before retail competition can begin. The first milestone calls for the development, approval by the FERC, and commencement of independent operation of a regional transmission organization in the area that includes our service territory. This and other milestones are not likely to be achieved for a number of years, if at all. There is substantial uncertainty about both the regulatory framework and market conditions that would exist if and when retail competition is implemented in our Texas service territory, and we may incur substantial preparatory, restructuring and other costs that may not ultimately be recoverable. There can be no assurance that deregulation would not adversely affect our future operations, cash flow and financial condition.\nFuture Costs of Compliance with Environmental Laws and Regulations Could\nAdversely Affect Our Operations and Financial Results\nWe are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations relating to discharges into the air, air quality, discharges of effluents into water, water quality, the use of water, the handling, disposal and clean-up of hazardous and non-hazardous substances and wastes, natural resources and health and safety. Compliance with these legal requirements, which change frequently and often become more restrictive, could require us to commit significant capital and operating resources toward permitting, emission fees, environmental monitoring, installation and operation of pollution control equipment and purchases of air emission allowances and possible offsets. These laws and regulations could also result in limitations in operating hours and changes in construction schedules for future generating units.\nCost of compliance with environmental laws and regulations or fines or penalties resulting from non-compliance, if not recovered in our rates, could adversely affect our operations and financial results, especially if emission or discharge limits are tightened, more extensive permitting requirements are imposed, additional substances become regulated and the number and types of assets we operate increase. We cannot estimate our compliance costs or any possible fines or penalties with certainty, or the degree to which such costs might be recovered in our rates, due to our inability to predict the requirements and timing of implementation of environmental laws or regulations. For example, the EPA has issued in the recent past various proposed regulations regarding air emissions, such as the revision of the primary and secondary ground-level ozone NAAQS. If these regulations become finalized and survive legal challenges, the cost to us to comply could adversely affect our operations and our financial results.\nClimate Change and Related Legislation and Regulatory Initiatives Could Affect Demand for\nElectricity or Availability of Resources, and Could Result in Increased Compliance Costs\nWe emit GHG (including carbon dioxide) through the operation of our power plants. Federal legislation has been introduced in both houses of Congress to regulate GHG emissions and numerous states have adopted programs to stabilize or reduce GHG emissions. Additionally, the EPA is proceeding with regulation of GHG under the CAA.\nIn October 2015, the EPA published a rule establishing guidelines for states to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from existing power plants, known as the CPP. Legal challenges to the CPP are ongoing. On August 31, 2018, the EPA published a proposal to replace the CPP called the ACE rule. The ACE rule was finalized in July 2019. Remaining legal challenges to the CPP were mooted in September 2019. Legal challenges to the ACE rule are ongoing. As adopted, the ACE rule is focused on coal-fired generation, and would not impose requirements on our operations. However, at this time the Company cannot determine the impact that the ACE rule, and related proposals and legal challenges may have on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nIt is not possible to predict how any pending, proposed or future GHG legislation by Congress, the states or multi-state regions or any GHG regulations adopted by the EPA or state environmental agencies will impact our business. Additionally, we are unable to predict how initiatives by members of the investment community or customers could affect our business. However, any legislation or regulation of GHG emissions, any future related litigation, or initiatives to further improve sustainability practices\nby investors or customers could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions or increased or reduced demand for our services, could require us to purchase rights to emit GHG and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, reputation or results of operations.\nAdverse Regulatory Decisions or Changes in Applicable Regulations or Laws Could Have a Material Adverse Effect on Our Business or Result in Significant Additional Costs\nOur business is subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations regarding safety and performance, siting and construction of facilities, customer service and the rates we can charge our customers, among other things. FERC regulates our wholesale operations, provision of transmission services and compliance with federally mandated reliability standards. FERC has issued a number of rules pertaining to preventing undue discrimination in transmission services and electric reliability standards. Under the Energy Policy Act of 2005, FERC can impose penalties (up to $1,291,894 per violation, per day) for failure to comply with statutes, rules and orders within FERC's jurisdiction, including mandatory electric reliability standards. Additional regulatory authorities have jurisdiction over some of our operations and construction projects, including the EPA, the DOE, the PUCT, the NMPRC and various local municipalities (including the cities of El Paso and Las Cruces).\nWe must periodically apply for licenses and permits from these various authorities and abide by their respective orders. Should we be unsuccessful in obtaining necessary licenses or permits or should these regulatory authorities initiate any investigations or enforcement actions or impose penalties or disallowances on us, our business could be adversely affected. Existing regulations may be revised or reinterpreted, and new laws and regulations may be adopted or become applicable to us or our facilities in a manner that may have a detrimental effect on our business or result in significant additional costs because of our obligation to comply with those requirements.\nIn addition, our service territory borders with Mexico and, as such, businesses in our service territory rely heavily on commerce with businesses in Mexico. Changes in regulations or enforcement restricting such commerce activities could reduce our customer growth rate and materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe New Mexico Renewable Energy Act (the \"REA\") requires electric utilities to meet an RPS of twenty percent of its total retail sales to New Mexico customers by 2020. Effective June 14, 2019, the New Mexico Energy Transition Act amended the REA (the \"Amended REA\") to, among other amendments: (i) increase the RPS to forty percent by 2025, fifty percent by 2030 and eighty percent by 2040; (ii) impose a zero-carbon standard by 2045; (iii) eliminate the reduction to the RPS requirement for sales to qualifying large non-governmental customers whose costs are capped under the REA; (iv) set a statutory reasonable cost threshold and (v) provide cost recovery for certain undepreciated investments and decommissioning costs, such as coal-fired generation, associated with generation required by the NMPRC to be discontinued and replaced with lower or zero-carbon generation. In administering the eighty percent RPS and zero-carbon standards, the Amended REA requires the NMPRC to consider certain factors, including safety, reliability and rate impact to customers. On October 10, 2019, the NMPRC initiated a rulemaking proceeding to implement the Amended REA in Case No. 19-00296-UT. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the Amended REA may have on its operations. Further, the Company has not determined the costs associated with complying with the Amended REA including potential fines that could be associated with non-compliance.\nFailure to Successfully Operate Our Facilities or Perform Certain Corporate Functions May Adversely Affect Our Operations and Financial Condition\nOur performance depends on the successful operation of our facilities. Operating these facilities involves many risks, including:\n\u2022\noperator error or failure of equipment or processes, including failure to follow appropriate safety protocols;\n\u2022\nthe handling of hazardous equipment or materials that could result in serious personal injury, loss of life and environmental and property damage;\n\u2022\noperating limitations that may be imposed by environmental or other regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nlabor disputes;\n\u2022\ninformation technology or financial system failures, including those due to the implementation and integration of new technology, that impair our information technology infrastructure, reporting systems or disrupt normal business operations;\n\u2022\ninformation technology failure that affects our ability to access customer information or causes us to lose confidential or proprietary data that materially and adversely affects our reputation or exposes us to legal claims; and\n\u2022\ncatastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, leaks, floods, droughts, natural disasters, terrorism, pandemic health events or other similar occurrences, which may require participation in mutual assistance efforts by us or other utilities to assist in power restoration efforts.\nSuch events may result in a decrease or elimination of revenue from our facilities, an increase in the cost of operating our facilities or delays in cash collections, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe Effects of Technological Advancement, Energy Conservation Measures and Distributed Generation Could Adversely Affect Our Operations and Financial Results\nNew technologies may emerge that could be superior to, or may not be compatible with, some of our existing technologies, and may require us to make significant expenditures to remain competitive. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and adapt to technological changes in a cost-effective manner and to offer, on a timely basis, services that meet customer demands and evolving industry standards.\nAdditionally, the electric utility industry is undergoing other technological advances such as the expanded cost-effective utilization of energy efficiency measures, energy storage and distributed generation, including solar rooftop projects. Customers\u2019 increased use of energy efficiency measures, energy storage and distributed generation could result in lower demand. Reduced demand due to energy efficiency measures, energy storage and the use of distributed generation, to the extent not substantially offset through ratemaking mechanisms, could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nInflation Could Adversely Affect Our Financial Results\nFor the past several years, inflation has been relatively low and, therefore has had little impact on our results of operations and financial condition. However, should we experience increases in costs due to inflationary impacts, any delays in requesting and receiving compensatory increases in our base rates could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur Line of Business Is Concentrated Solely to the Electric Industry and to One Region\nWe are a fully vertically integrated electric utility company whose only business is the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity to customers in an area of approximately 10,000 square miles in west Texas and southern New Mexico. Approximately 86% of revenues are directly related to the retail sales of electric power to approximately 432,800 residential, commercial and public authority customers. As such, risks uniquely associated with the utility industry such as changes in utility legislation and regulations, weather patterns in the region and economic conditions will have a greater effect on our overall operating results than otherwise if our operations were more diversified into other lines of business and in a broader geographical area.\nThe Operation of Transmission Lines on Public and Private Properties, including Indian Lands, Could Result in Uncertainty Related to Continued Easements and Rights-of-Way and Significantly Impact Our Business\nPortions of our transmission lines are located on public and private properties, including Indian lands, pursuant to easements or other rights-of-way that are effective for specified periods. We are unable to predict the final outcome of pending or future approvals by applicable property owners and governing bodies with respect to renewals of these easements and rights-of-way.\nOur Success Depends on the Availability of the Services of a Qualified Workforce and Our Ability to Attract and Retain Qualified Personnel and Senior Management\nOur workforce is aging and many employees have retired in the last few years or are or will become eligible to retire within the next few years. Although we have undertaken efforts to recruit and train new field service personnel, we may be faced with a shortage of experienced and qualified personnel. Our costs, including costs to replace employees, benefit (including healthcare) costs, retirement costs, productivity costs and safety costs, may rise. Failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees, including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees, or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate our business. If we are unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, our results of operations could be negatively affected.\nA substantial number of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement that was renewed for four years in October 2019. Labor disruptions, strikes or significant negotiated wage and benefit increases, whether due to union activities, employee turnover or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe depend on our senior management and other key personnel. Our success depends on our ability to attract and retain key personnel. The inability to recruit and retain or effectively transition key personnel or the unexpected loss of key personnel may adversely affect our operations. In addition, because of the reliance on our management team, our future success depends in part on our ability to identify and develop talent to succeed senior management. Any such occurrences could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur Ability to Accurately Report Our Financial Results or Prevent Fraud May Be Adversely Affected if We Fail to Maintain an Effective System of Internal Controls\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports, effectively prevent fraud and operate successfully as a public company. If our efforts to maintain an effective system of internal controls are not successful, we are unable to maintain adequate controls over our financial reporting and processes in the future or we are unable to comply with our obligations under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, our operating results could be harmed, or we may fail to meet our reporting obligations. Ineffective internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock and other securities.\nInsufficient Insurance Coverage and Increased Insurance Costs Could Adversely Affect Our Operations and Financial Results\nWe currently have general liability and property insurance in place to cover certain of our facilities in amounts that we consider appropriate. Such policies are subject to certain limits and deductibles and do not include business interruption coverage. Insurance coverage may not be available in the future at current costs or on commercially reasonable terms, and the insurance proceeds received for any loss of, or any damage to, any of our facilities may not be sufficient to restore the loss or damage without negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe Are Subject to Costs and Other Effects of Legal and Regulatory Proceedings, Disputes and Claims\nFrom time to time in the normal course of business, we are subject to various lawsuits, audits, regulatory proceedings, disputes and claims that could result in adverse judgments or settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other adverse consequences. These matters are subject to a number of uncertainties, and management is often unable to predict the outcome of such matters; resulting liabilities could exceed amounts currently reserved or insured against with respect to such matter. The legal costs and final resolution of matters in which we are involved could have a reputational impact and a short- or long-term negative effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Similarly, the terms of resolution could require us to change our operational practices and procedures, which could also have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nRisk Factors Related to Our Financings\nAdverse Changes in Our Credit Ratings Could Negatively Affect Our Access to the Capital Markets and our Cost of Borrowed Funds\nAccess to the capital markets is important to our ability to operate our business and complete our capital projects. Credit rating agencies evaluate our credit ratings on a periodic basis and when certain events occur. These ratings are premised on financial ratios and performance, our regulatory environment and rate mechanisms, resource risks and power supply costs, and other factors. A ratings downgrade could increase fees on the RCF thereby increasing the cost of funding day-to-day working capital requirements, and could also result in higher interest rates on future long-term debt. In addition, any ratings downgrade or placement of our credit ratings on negative watch could have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock. If access to capital were to become significantly constrained or costs of capital increased significantly due to lowered credit ratings, prevailing industry conditions, regulatory constraints, the volatility of the capital markets or other factors, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nChanges in the Method of Determining the London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\"), or the Replacement of the London Interbank Offered Rate with an Alternative Reference Rate, May Adversely Affect Interest Expense Related to Outstanding Debt\nAmounts drawn under our current debt agreements, including the RCF, may bear interest at rates based on the LIBOR. On July 27, 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom announced that it would phase out LIBOR as a benchmark by the end of 2021. It is unclear whether new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021. The RCF provides for a mechanism to amend the RCF to reflect the establishment of an alternative rate of interest\nupon the occurrence of certain events related to the phase-out of LIBOR. However, we have not yet pursued any technical amendment or other contractual alternative to address this matter and are currently evaluating the impact of the potential replacement of the LIBOR interest rate. In addition, the overall financial markets may be disrupted as a result of the phase-out or replacement of LIBOR. Uncertainty as to the nature of such potential phase-out and alternative reference rates or disruption in the financial market could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisk Factors Relating to the Merger\nThe Company Cannot Provide Any Assurance That the Merger Will Be Completed. Failure to Complete the Merger Could Negatively Affect the Trading Price of the Company\u2019s Common Stock and its Future Business and Financial Results\nConsummation of the Merger is subject to various conditions, including: (i) receipt of all required regulatory and statutory approvals without the imposition of a Burdensome Condition (as defined in the Merger Agreement), (ii) absence of any law or order prohibiting the consummation of the Merger and (iii) other customary closing conditions, including (a) subject to materiality qualifiers, the accuracy of each party\u2019s representations and warranties, (b) each party\u2019s compliance in all material respects with its obligations and covenants under the Merger Agreement and (c) the absence of a material adverse effect with respect to the Company.\nThe conditions to the Merger may not be satisfied and the Merger Agreement could be terminated. In addition, satisfying the conditions to the Merger may take longer than the Company and Parent expect. The occurrence of any of these events individually or in combination could negatively affect the trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock and the Company\u2019s future business and financial results and subject the Company to the following:\n\u2022\nnegative reactions from the financial markets, including declines in the price of the Company\u2019s common stock due to the fact that the current price may reflect a market assumption that the Merger will be completed;\n\u2022\nperformance shortfalls and missed opportunities as a result of the diversion of the Company\u2019s management\u2019s attention by the Merger; and\n\u2022\npotential payments by the Company to Parent for damages or, if the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, a termination fee of $85 million.\nThe Company Will Be Subject to Business Uncertainties and Contractual Restrictions While the Merger is Pending, Which Could Adversely Affect the Company\u2019s Business\nUncertainty about the impact of the Merger, including on employees and customers, may have an adverse effect on the Company. These uncertainties may impair the Company\u2019s ability to attract, retain and motivate personnel, and could cause customers, suppliers and others that deal with the Company to seek to change existing business relationships with the Company. If employees depart, the Company\u2019s business could be harmed. In addition, the Merger Agreement restricts the Company, without the consent of Parent, from taking specified actions until the Merger is completed or the Merger Agreement is terminated. These restrictions may prevent the Company from pursuing otherwise attractive business opportunities and making other changes to the Company\u2019s business.\nPending Litigation Against Us May Adversely Affect the Company\u2019s Business, Financial Condition or Results of Operations Following the Merger\nFollowing the announcement of the Merger Agreement, three purported Company shareholders filed lawsuits under the federal securities laws, two in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and one in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, challenging the adequacy of the disclosures made in the Company\u2019s preliminary proxy statement in connection with the Merger. All three actions allege violations of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder based on various alleged omissions of material information from the preliminary proxy statement. The lawsuits name as defendants the Company and each of our directors, individually, and seek to enjoin the Merger (or, in the alternative, rescission or an award of rescissory damages in the event the Merger is completed), damages, and an award of costs and attorneys\u2019 and expert fees. The Company believes that these complaints are without merit, and while the Company believes that the disclosures set forth in the proxy statement complied fully with applicable law, to moot plaintiffs\u2019 disclosure claims, to avoid nuisance, potential expense and delay, and to provide additional information to the Company\u2019s shareholders, the Company voluntarily supplemented the proxy statement with additional disclosure in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company with the SEC on September 9, 2019.\nThe outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. The defense or settlement of any lawsuit or claim that remains unresolved at the time the Merger closes may adversely affect the combined company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operation.
