{"cik": "835324", "company": "Stock Yards Bancorp, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-02-28", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nInvestment in Bancorp\u2019s common stock involves risk, and Bancorp\u2019s profitability and success may be affected by a number of factors including those discussed below.\nFinancial condition and profitability depend significantly on local and national economic conditions.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends on general economic conditions both locally and nationally. Most of Bancorp\u2019s customers are in the Louisville, Indianapolis, and Cincinnati metropolitan areas. Compared to regional or national financial institutions, Bancorp is less able to spread risks of unfavorable local economic conditions across a large number of diversified economies. Some of Bancorp\u2019s customers are directly impacted by the local economy while others have more national or global business dealings. Deterioration in the quality of the credit portfolio could have a material adverse effect on financial condition, results of operations, and ultimately capital.\nFinancial condition and profitability depend on real estate values in the Company\u2019s market area.\nBancorp offers a variety of secured loans, including commercial lines of credit, commercial term loans, real estate, construction, home equity, consumer and other loans. Bancorp\u2019s loans are typically secured by real estate (both residential and commercial) primarily in Bancorp\u2019s market areas. In instances where borrowers are unable to repay their loans and there has been deterioration in the value of loan collateral, Bancorp could experience higher loan losses which could have a material adverse effect on financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf actual loan losses are greater than Bancorp\u2019s assumption for loan losses, earnings could decrease.\nBancorp\u2019s loan customers may not repay their loans according to the terms of these loans, collateral securing payment of these loans may be insufficient to ensure repayment and the wealth of guarantors providing guarantees to support these loans may be insufficient to aid in the repayment of these loans. Accordingly, Bancorp might experience significant credit losses which could have a material adverse effect on operating results. Bancorp makes various assumptions and judgments about collectability of the loan portfolio, including creditworthiness of borrowers and value of collateral for repayment of many loans. In determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses (\u201callowance\u201d), Bancorp considers, among other factors, an evaluation of economic conditions and Bancorp\u2019s loan loss experience. If Bancorp\u2019s assumptions prove to be incorrect or economic problems are worse than projected, the current allowance may be insufficient to cover loan losses and adjustments may be necessary to allow for different economic conditions or adverse developments in the loan portfolio. Such additions to the allowance, if necessary, could have a material adverse impact on financial results.\nFederal and state regulators annually review Bancorp\u2019s allowance and may require an increase in the provision for loan losses or loan charge-offs. If regulatory agencies require any increase in the provision for loan losses or loan charge-offs for which Bancorp had not allocated, it would have a negative effect on financial results.\nFluctuations in interest rates could reduce profitability.\nBancorp\u2019s primary source of income is from net interest spread, the difference between interest earned on loans and investments and interest paid on deposits and borrowings. Bancorp expects to periodically experience gaps in interest rate sensitivities of Bancorp\u2019s assets and liabilities, meaning that either interest-bearing liabilities will be more sensitive to changes in market interest rates than interest-earning assets, or vice versa. In either event, if market interest rates should move contrary to Bancorp\u2019s position, this gap will work against Bancorp and earnings will be negatively affected.\nMany factors affect fluctuation of market interest rates, including, but not limited to the following:\n\u25cf\ninflation or deflation\n\u25cf\nrecession\n\u25cf\na rise in unemployment\n\u25cf\ntightening money supply\n\u25cf\ninternational disorder and instability in foreign financial markets\n\u25cf\nthe Federal Reserve\u2019s actions to control interest rates\nThe Federal Reserve increased the overnight federal funds rate four times in 2018 which led to the Wall Street Journal Prime lending rate (\u201cPrime\u201d) increasing from 4.50% to 5.50%. Bancorp typically benefits from a rising interest rate environment, as the majority of the Company\u2019s variable rate loans are tied to Prime with a lesser amount tied to the London Interbank Offering Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d). While variable rate loans have re-priced at higher rates Bancorp has also increased deposit rates in response to market pressure and funding needs. Deposit rates generally do not reprice as quickly as loans which positively affects earnings as rates rise in the short term. Market expectations are for the Federal Reserve to leave the federal funds rate at 5.50% for the duration of 2019. In addition, a flattening yield curve is widely anticipated, with the possibility of short term rates at some point exceeding longer term rates, resulting in an inverted yield curve. Deposit rates tend to be tied to the short end of the rate curve, while fixed-rate loans are largely priced based upon longer term rates, specifically five-year offerings. A flattening or inverted yield curve may increase Bancorp\u2019s funding costs while limiting rates that can be earned on loans and investments, thereby decreasing net interest income and earnings. Migration of deposits out of Bancorp, as customers pursue higher rates, could impact liquidity and earnings as Bancorp competes for deposits. Changes in the mix of deposits could result in increased average rates paid on deposits, and lower earnings to Bancorp. Bancorp\u2019s asset-liability management strategy, which is designed to mitigate risk from changes in market interest rates, may not be able to prevent changes in interest rates from having a material adverse effect on Bancorp\u2019s results of operations and financial condition. Bancorp\u2019s most recent earnings simulation model estimating the impact of changing interest rates on earnings for the next 12 months indicates net interest income will increase approximately 6% if interest rates immediately increase 200 basis points and decrease approximately 13% if rates immediately decrease 200 basis points. In 2019 Bancorp anticipates completing the purchase of King Bancorp, Inc., which will further add to funding pressure and could result in higher rates paid on deposits.\nBancorp is subject to funding risk.\nFunding risk represents dependence Bancorp has on large commercial deposit relationships. Approximately 40% of Bancorp\u2019s total deposits are centralized in accounts with balances $500,000 or greater. Bancorp considers these deposits core funds as they represent long-standing, full-service relationships and are a testament to Bancorp\u2019s commitment to partner with business clients by providing exemplary service and competitive products. A sudden shift in customer behavior within these deposits resulting in balances being reduced or moved out of the Bank altogether could impact Bancorp\u2019s ability to capitalize on growth opportunities and meet current obligations. Bancorp has secondary sources of funding to draw upon as needed but the cost of those funds would be higher than typical deposit accounts which would negatively impact the financial condition and results of operation.\nSignificant stock market volatility could negatively affect Bancorp\u2019s financial results.\nIncome from WM&T constitutes approximately 47% of non-interest income. Trust assets under management are expressed in terms of market value, and a significant portion of fee income is based upon those values. A large majority of WM&T fees are based on market values which generally fluctuate with overall capital markets.\nCapital and credit markets experience volatility and disruption from time to time. These conditions place downward pressure on credit availability, credit worthiness and customers\u2019 inclinations to borrow. Prolonged volatility or a significant disruption could negatively impact customers\u2019 ability to seek new loans or to repay existing loans. Personal wealth of many borrowers and guarantors has historically added a source of financial strength to certain loans and would be negatively impacted by severe market declines. Sustained reliance on personal assets to make loan payments would result in deterioration of their liquidity, and could result in loan defaults.\nCompetition with other financial institutions could adversely affect profitability.\nBancorp operates in a highly competitive industry that could become even more so as a result of earnings pressure of peer organizations, legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation. Bancorp faces vigorous competition in price and structure of financial products from banks and other financial institutions. In recent years, credit unions have expanded their lending mix and now compete heavily with banks in the commercial real estate market. Non-traditional providers high risk tolerance for fixed rate, long-term loans has adversely affected Bancorp\u2019s net loan growth and results of operations. Bancorp also competes with other non-traditional providers of financial services, such as brokerage firms and insurance companies. As internet-based financial services continue to grow in acceptance, Bancorp must remain relevant as a place where consumers and businesses value personal service while other institutions offer these services without human interaction. The variety of sources of competition may reduce or limit margins on banking services, reduce market share and adversely affect results of operations and financial condition.\nAn extended disruption of vital infrastructure could negatively impact Bancorp\u2019s business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nBancorp\u2019s operations depend upon, among other things, infrastructure, including equipment and facilities. Extended disruption of vital infrastructure by fire, power loss, natural disaster, telecommunications failure, information systems breaches, terrorist activity or the domestic and foreign response to such activity, or other events outside of Bancorp\u2019s control could have a material adverse impact on the financial services industry, the economy as a whole, and on Bancorp\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. Bancorp\u2019s business continuity plan may not work as intended or may not prevent significant interruption of operations. Occurrence of any failures or interruptions of information systems could damage Bancorp\u2019s reputation, result in loss of customer business, subject the Company to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose Bancorp to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have an adverse effect on Bancorp\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nSecurity breaches or incidences of fraud could negatively impact Bancorp\u2019s business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nBancorp\u2019s assets which are at risk for cyber-attacks include financial assets and non-public information belonging to customers. Cyber security risks include cyber espionage, blackmail, ransom, theft, and corporate account takeovers. Bancorp employs many preventive and detective controls to protect its assets, and provides mandatory recurring information security training to all employees. Bancorp has invested in multiple preventative tools in an attempt to protect customers from cyber threats and corporate account takeover. Bancorp regularly provides educational information regarding cyber threats to customers. Bancorp utilizes multiple third-party vendors who have access to the Company\u2019s assets via electronic media. While Bancorp requires third parties, many of whom are small companies, to have similar or superior controls in place, there is no guarantee that a breach of information could not occur. Activities of the Bank that subject Bancorp to risk of fraud by customers, employees, vendors, or members of the general public include ACH transactions, wire transactions, ATM transactions, checking transactions, and loan originations. Repeated incidences of fraud or a single large occurrence would adversely impact Bancorp\u2019s reputation and results of operations.\nBancorp\u2019s credit metrics are currently at historically strong levels and this trend could normalize over time.\nDuring 2018, Bancorp\u2019s asset quality metrics trended within a narrow range and exceeded benchmarks of the past several years to reach historically strong levels. Bancorp realizes that present asset quality metrics are exceptionally positive and, recognizing the cyclical nature of the lending business, the Company anticipates this trend will most likely normalize over time.\nBancorp\u2019s accounting policies and methods are critical to how Bancorp reports its financial condition and results of operations. They require management to make estimates about matters that are uncertain.\nAccounting policies and methods are fundamental to how Bancorp records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. Bancorp must exercise judgment in selecting and applying these accounting policies and methods so they comply with United States generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cUS GAAP\u201d).\nBancorp has identified certain accounting policies as being critical because they require management\u2019s judgment to ascertain the valuations of assets, liabilities, commitments and contingencies. A variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income, recognizing an expense, recovering an asset, or reducing a liability. Bancorp has established detailed policies and control procedures intended to ensure these critical accounting estimates and judgments are well controlled and applied consistently.\nPolicies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. Because of the uncertainty surrounding Bancorp\u2019s judgments and estimates pertaining to these matters, there can be no assurances that actual results will not differ from those estimates. See the \u201cCritical Accounting Policies\u201d in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d for more information.\nBancorp operates in a highly regulated environment and may be adversely affected by changes to or lack of compliance with federal, state and local laws and regulations.\nBancorp is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by federal and state banking authorities. Any change in applicable regulations or federal or state legislation could have a substantial impact on Bancorp and its operations. Additional legislation and regulations may be enacted or adopted in the future that could significantly affect Bancorp\u2019s powers, authority and operations, which could have a material adverse effect on Bancorp\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. If Bancorp\u2019s policies, procedures and systems are deemed deficient, the Company would be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions, which may include restrictions on the ability to pay dividends and the requirement to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of Bancorp\u2019s business plan, including branching and acquisition plans.\nBancorp\u2019s ability to stay current on technological changes in order to compete and meet customer demands is constantly being challenged.\nThe financial services industry is constantly undergoing rapid technological changes, with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. Future success of Bancorp will depend, in part, upon its ability to address the needs of its customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands for convenience, as well as to create additional operational efficiencies and greater privacy and security protection for customers and their personal information. Many of Bancorp\u2019s competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. Bancorp may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services as quickly as competitors or be successful in marketing these products and services to its customers. Bancorp relies on third party providers for many of its technology-driven banking products and services. Some of these companies may be slow to respond with upgrades or enhancements to their products to keep pace with improvements in technology or the introduction of competing products. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could impair Bancorp\u2019s ability to effectively compete to retain or acquire new business and could have an adverse impact on its business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nBancorp is dependent upon outside third parties for processing and handling of the Company\u2019s records and data.\nBancorp relies on software developed by third-party vendors to process various transactions. In some cases, Bancorp has contracted with third parties to run their proprietary software on the Company\u2019s behalf. While Bancorp performs a review of controls instituted by applicable vendors over these programs in accordance with industry standards and performs testing of user controls, the Company relies on continued maintenance of controls by these third-party vendors, including safeguards over security of client data. Bancorp may incur a temporary disruption in the Company\u2019s ability to conduct business or process transactions, or incur reputational damage, if a third-party vendor fails to adequately maintain internal controls or institute necessary changes to systems. Such a disruption or breach of security could have a material adverse effect on Bancorp\u2019s business. Further, if these third-party service providers experience difficulties, or should terminate their services, and the Company is unable to replace them on a timely basis, Bancorp\u2019s business operations could be interrupted. If an interruption were to continue for a significant period of time, or if the Company incurred excessive costs involved with replacing third-party service provider, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nBancorp may not be able to attract and retain skilled people.\nBancorp\u2019s success depends, in large part, on its ability to attract and retain key people. Competition for the best people in the industry and markets in which Bancorp engages can be intense, and the Company may not be able to retain or hire the people wanted or needed. To attract and retain qualified employees, Bancorp must compensate them at market levels. If Bancorp is unable to continue to attract and retain qualified employees, or do so at rates necessary to maintain the Company\u2019s competitive position, Bancorp\u2019s performance, including the Company\u2019s competitive position, could suffer, and, in turn, adversely affect Bancorp\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nBancorp invests in partnerships that generate federal income tax savings and these may not continue.\nBancorp invests in certain partnerships that yield federal income tax credits resulting in higher net income for Bancorp. These transactions may also include lending to developers, further enhancing profitability of the transaction. These transactions typically involve a very limited number of counterparties. Availability and suitability of these transactions are not particularly predictable and may not continue to be favorable to Bancorp. Recently enacted income tax reform could result in fewer transactions and the extent to which federal income tax credits favorably affect Bancorp\u2019s net income. Therefore the positive effect on Bancorp\u2019s net income may not continue at levels previously experienced.\nChanges in customer use of banks could adversely affect Bancorp\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nRapid evolution of non-bank alternatives for initiation and completion of financial transactions puts Bancorp at risk of losing sources of revenue and funding. The ability of customers to pay bills, transfer funds, and purchase assets without utilizing the banking system could result in loss of fee income, deposits, and loans. If Bancorp is unable to continue timely development of competitive new products and services, its business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe Current Expected Credit Loss (\u201cCECL\u201d) accounting standard will result in a significant change in how Bancorp recognizes credit losses and may have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition or results of operations.\nIn June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued an accounting standard update, \u201cFinancial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,\u201d which replaces the current \u201cincurred loss\u201d model for recognizing credit losses with an \u201cexpected loss\u201d model. Whereas the incurred loss model delays recognition of loss on financial instruments until it is probable a loss has occurred, the expected loss model will recognize a loss at the time the loan is first added to the balance sheet. As result of this differing methodology, Bancorp expects adoption of the CECL model will materially affect the determination of the allowance and could require a significant increase to the allowance. Any material increase to the required level of loan loss allowance could adversely affect Bancorp\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe CECL standard will become effective for Bancorp for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 and for interim periods beginning with the first quarter of 2020. While the impact of implementing the CECL model cannot be quantified at this time, Bancorp expects to recognize a one-time cumulative-effect adjustment to the allowance and stockholders\u2019 equity in the first quarter of 2020. Interagency guidance issued in December 2018 allows for a three year phase-in of the cumulative-effect adjustment for regulatory capital reporting.\nCompany acquisitions could adversely affect Bancorp\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nAn institution that the Company acquires may have asset quality issues or contingent liabilities that the Company did not discover or fully recognize in the due diligence process, thereby resulting in unanticipated losses. Acquisitions of other institutions also typically require integration of different corporate cultures, loan and deposit products, pricing strategies, data processing systems and other technologies, accounting, internal audit and financial reporting systems, operating systems and internal controls, marketing programs and personnel of the acquired institution. The integration process is complicated and time consuming and could divert the Company\u2019s attention from other business concerns and may be disruptive to its clients and clients of the acquired institution. The Company\u2019s failure to successfully integrate an acquired institution could result in loss of key clients and employees, and prevent the Company from achieving expected synergies and cost savings.\nBancorp must transition from using LIBOR as a benchmark for loan pricing and swap transactions.\nLIBOR will cease to exist as a published rate after 2021. As of December 31, 2018, Bancorp has approximately $400 million in variable rate loans with interest rates tied to LIBOR, of which approximately $200 million have maturity dates beyond December 31, 2021. Bancorp\u2019s derivative activities based upon LIBOR include interest rate swap transactions with maturities beyond 2021 with notional amounts totaling approximately $56 million. The Federal Reserve through the Alternative Reference Rate Committee has recommended a replacement benchmark rate, the Secured Overnight Financing Rate. All loan and swap contracts extending beyond 2021 will need to be managed effectively to ensure appropriate benchmark rate replacements are provided for and adopted. Failure to identify a replacement benchmark rate and/or update data processing systems could result in future interest rate changes not being correctly captured, which could result in interest rate risk not being mitigated as intended, or interest earned being miscalculated, which could adversely impact Bancorp\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 79013, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "SYBT"}
