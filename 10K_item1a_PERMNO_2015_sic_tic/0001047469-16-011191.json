{"cik": "1060523", "company": "CARDINAL FINANCIAL CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-15", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nWe are subject to various risks, including the risks described below. Our operations, financial condition and performance and, therefore, the market value of our Common Stock could be adversely affected by any of these risks or additional risks not presently known or that we currently deem immaterial.\nDifficult conditions in the economy and the capital markets continue to adversely affect our industry.\nIn recent years during the financial crisis, dramatic declines in the housing market, with falling home prices and increasing foreclosure rates, followed by unemployment and under-employment, negatively impacted the credit performance of real estate related loans and consumer loans and resulted in significant write-downs of asset values by financial institutions. These write-downs spread to other securities and loans and have caused many financial institutions to seek additional capital, to reduce or eliminate dividends, to merge with larger and stronger institutions and, in some cases, to fail. Lenders and institutional investors have reduced or ceased providing funding to borrowers, including to other financial institutions. This market turmoil and tightening of credit led to an increased level of commercial and consumer delinquencies, lack of consumer confidence, increased market volatility and reduction of business activity generally. While we have seen an improvement in economic trends, future economic pressure on consumers may adversely affect our business and results of operations. Market developments may affect consumer confidence levels and may cause adverse changes in payment patterns, causing increases in delinquencies and default rates, which may impact our charge-offs and provision for loan losses. A worsening of these conditions would likely exacerbate the adverse effects of these current market conditions on us and others in the financial institutions industry.\nThe capital and credit markets have experienced volatility and disruption in recent years. In some cases, the markets have produced downward pressure on stock prices and credit availability for certain issuers without regard to those issuers' underlying financial strength. If these levels of market disruption and volatility recur, there can be no assurance that we will not experience an adverse effect, which may be material, on our ability to access capital and on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur mortgage banking revenue is cyclical and is sensitive to the level of interest rates, changes in economic conditions, decreased economic activity, a slowdown in the housing market, any of which could adversely impact our profits.\nRecently, we have significantly expanded our mortgage banking operations by adding mortgage loan officers and support staff, and this segment has become a larger portion of our consolidated business. Maintaining our revenue stream in this segment is dependent upon our ability to originate loans and sell them to investors at or near current volumes. Loan production levels are sensitive to changes in the level of interest rates and changes in economic conditions. Loan production levels may also suffer if we experience a slowdown in the local housing market or tightening credit conditions. Any sustained period of decreased activity caused by less refinancing transactions, higher interest rates, housing price pressure or loan underwriting restrictions would adversely affect our mortgage originations and, consequently, could significantly reduce our income from mortgage banking activities. As a result, these conditions would also adversely affect our net income. In addition, the effect of any such slowdown in volume on our net income could be exacerbated by accounting rules which require mortgage revenues to be realized prior to certain associated expenses. See Note 2(p) to our consolidated financial statements for a summary of this accounting policy.\nDeteriorating economic conditions may also cause home buyers to default on their mortgages. In certain cases where we have originated loans and sold them to investors, we may be required to repurchase loans or provide a financial settlement to investors if it is proven that the borrower failed to provide full and accurate information on or related to their loan application or for which appraisals have not been acceptable or when the loan was not underwritten in accordance with the loan program specified by the loan investor. Such repurchases or settlements would also adversely affect our net income.\nGeorge Mason, as part of the service it previously provided to its managed companies, purchased the loans managed companies originate at the time of origination. These loans were then sold by George Mason to investors. George Mason has agreements with these managed companies requiring that, for any loans that were originated by a managed company and for which investors have requested George Mason to repurchase due to the borrowers failure to provide full and accurate information on or related to their loan application or for which appraisals have not been acceptable or when the loan was not underwritten in accordance with the loan program specified by the loan investor, the managed company be responsible for buying back the loan. In the event that the managed company's financial condition deteriorates and it is unable to fund the repurchase of such loans, George Mason may have to provide the funds to repurchase these loans from investors.\nWe may be adversely affected by economic conditions in our market area.\nWe are headquartered in Northern Virginia, and our market is the greater Washington, D.C. metropolitan area. Because our lending and deposit-gathering activities are concentrated in this market, we will be affected by the general economic conditions in the greater Washington area, which may, among other factors, be impacted by the level of federal government spending. Federal government cuts in spending could severely impact negatively the unemployment rate in our region and business development activity. Changes in the economy, and government spending in particular, may influence the growth rate of our loans and deposits, the quality of the loan portfolio and loan and deposit\npricing. A significant decline in general economic conditions caused by inflation, recession, unemployment or other factors, would impact these local economic conditions and the demand for banking products and services generally, and could negatively affect our financial condition and performance.\nGovernment measures to regulate the financial industry, including the Financial Reform Act, could require us to change certain of our business practices, impose significant additional costs on us, limit the products that we offer, limit our ability to pursue business opportunities in an efficient manner, require us to increase our regulatory capital, impact the value of the assets we hold, significantly reduce our revenues or otherwise materially affect our businesses, financial condition or results of operations.\nAs a financial institution, we are heavily regulated at the state and federal levels. As a result of the financial crisis and related global economic downturn that began in 2007, we have faced, and expect to continue to face, increased public and legislative scrutiny as well as stricter and more comprehensive regulation of our financial services practices. In July 2010, the Financial Reform Act was signed into law. Many of the provisions of the Financial Reform Act have begun to be or will be phased in over the next several months or years and will be subject both to further rulemaking and the discretion of applicable regulatory bodies. Although we cannot predict the full effect of the Financial Reform Act on our operations, it could, as well as the future rules implementing its reforms, impose significant additional costs on us, limit the products we offer, could limit our ability to pursue business opportunities in an efficient manner, require us to increase our regulatory capital, impact the values of assets that we hold, significantly reduce our revenues or otherwise materially and adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, or results of operations.\nThe ultimate impact of the final rules on our businesses and results of operations, however, will depend on regulatory interpretation and rulemaking, as well as the success of any of our actions to mitigate the negative earnings impact of certain provisions.\nWe may be subject to more stringent capital requirements, which could adversely affect our results of operations and future growth.\nIn 2013, the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the OCC approved a new rule that substantially amended the regulatory risk-based capital rules applicable to us. The final rule implements the \"Basel III\" regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the Financial Reform Act. The final rule includes new minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratios which became effective for us on January 1, 2015, and refines the definition of what constitutes \"capital\" for purposes of calculating these ratios. The new minimum capital requirements will be: (i) a new common equity Tier 1 (\"CET1\") capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 6%, which is increased from 4%; (iii) a total capital ratio of 8%, which is unchanged from the current rules; and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%. The final rule also establishes a \"capital conservation buffer\" of 2.5% above the new regulatory minimum capital ratios, and when fully effective in 2019, will result in the following minimum ratios: (a) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%; (b) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 8.5%; and (c) a total capital ratio of 10.5%. The new capital conservation buffer requirement would be phased in beginning in January 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and would increase each year until fully implemented in January 2019. An institution will be subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the buffer amount. These limitations will establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that can be utilized for such activities. In addition, the final rule provides for a number of new deductions from and adjustments to capital and prescribes a revised approach for risk weightings that could result in higher risk weights for a variety of asset categories.\nThe application of these more stringent capital requirements for us could, among other things, result in lower returns on equity, require the raising of additional capital, adversely affect our future growth opportunities, and result in regulatory actions such as a prohibition on the payment of dividends or on the repurchase shares if we were unable to comply with such requirements.\nAt December 31, 2015, the Company and its banking subsidiary met all capital adequacy requirements under the Basel III capital rules.\nWe may not be able to successfully manage our growth or implement our growth strategies, which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nDuring the last five years, we have experienced significant growth, and a key aspect of our business strategy is our continued growth and expansion. Our ability to continue to grow depends, in part, upon our ability to:\n\u2022 open new branch offices or acquire existing branches or other financial institutions;\n\u2022 attract deposits to those locations and cross-sell new and existing depositors additional products and services; and\n\u2022 identify attractive loan and investment opportunities.\nWe may not be able to implement our growth strategy successfully if we are unable to identify attractive markets, locations or opportunities to expand. Our ability to successfully manage our growth will also depend upon our ability to maintain capital levels sufficient to support this growth, maintain effective cost controls and adequate asset quality such that earnings are not adversely impacted to a material degree.\nAs we implement our growth strategy by opening new branches or acquiring branches or other banks, we expect to incur increased personnel, occupancy and other operating expenses. In the case of new branches, we must absorb those higher expenses while we begin to generate new deposits, and there is a further time lag involved in redeploying new deposits into attractively priced loans and other higher yielding earning assets. Thus, our plans to branch aggressively could depress our earnings in the short run, even if we efficiently execute our branching strategy. In addition, failure to properly integrate or manage our expanded business could adversely affect our financial condition.\nOur potential inability to integrate companies we may acquire in the future could have a negative effect on our expenses and results of operations.\nOn occasion, we may engage in a strategic acquisition when we believe there is an opportunity to strengthen and expand our business. To fully benefit from such acquisition, however, we must integrate the administrative, financial, lending, and retail functions of the acquired company. If we are unable to successfully integrate an acquired company, our financial condition, results of operations and capital may be negatively affected. Completed acquisitions may also lead to significant unexpected liabilities.\nDifficulties in combining the operations of acquired entities with our own operations may prevent us from achieving the expected benefits from acquisitions.\nWe may not be able to achieve fully the strategic objectives and operating efficiencies expected in our acquisition of UFBC. Inherent uncertainties exist in integrating the operations of an acquired entity. In addition, the markets and industries in which we operate are highly competitive. We may lose customers or the customers of acquired entities as a result of an acquisition; we may lose key personnel, either from the acquired entity or from us; and we may not be able to control the incremental increase in noninterest expense arising from thethethe acquisition in a manner that improves our overall operating efficiencies. These factors could contribute to our not achieving the\nexpected benefits from acquisitions within desired time frames, if at all. Future business acquisitions could be material to us and we may issue additional shares of common stock to pay for those acquisitions, which would dilute current shareholders' ownership interests. Acquisitions also could require us to use substantial cash or other liquid assets or to incur debt; we could therefore become more susceptible to economic downturns and competitive pressures.\nWe have goodwill and other intangibles that may become impaired, and thus result in a charge against earnings.\nAt December 31, 2015, we had $10.1 million of goodwill related to the George Mason acquisition and $24.9 million related to acquisitions that occurred within the commercial banking segment of our Company. Goodwill and other intangibles are tested for impairment on an annual basis or when facts and circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred.\nWe may be forced to recognize impairment charges in the future as operating and economic conditions change.\nWe may be adversely impacted by changes in the condition of financial markets.\nWe are directly and indirectly affected by changes in market conditions. Market risk generally represents the risk that values of assets and liabilities or revenues will be adversely affected by changes in market conditions. Market risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations and activities including loans, deposits, securities, short-term borrowings, long-term debt, trading account assets and liabilities, and derivatives. Just a few of the market conditions that may shift from time to time, thereby exposing us to market risk, include fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates, equity and futures prices, and price deterioration or changes in value due to changes in market perception or actual credit quality of issuers. Accordingly, depending on the instruments or activities impacted, market risks can have adverse effects on our results of operations and our overall financial condition.\nThe subprime mortgage market dislocation which occurred in prior years has impacted the ratings of certain monoline insurance providers which, in turn, has affected the pricing of certain municipal securities and the liquidity of the short term public finance markets. We have some exposure to monolines and, as a result, are continuing to monitor this exposure. Additionally, unfavorable economic or political conditions and changes in government policy could impact the operating budgets or credit ratings of U.S. states and U.S. municipalities and expose us to credit risk.\nAt December 31, 2015, we owned two pooled trust preferred securities which are classified as held-to-maturity within the investment securities portfolio. The par and carrying values of these securities were each $3.8 million at December 31, 2015. The collateral underlying these structured securities are instruments issued by financial institutions. We own the A-3 tranches in each issuance. Each of the bonds is rated by more than one rating agency. One security has a composite rating of AA and the other security has a composite rating of A. Observable trading activity remains limited for these types of securities. We have estimated the fair value of the securities through the use of internal calculations and through information provided by external pricing services. Given the level of subordination below the A-3 tranches, and the actual and expected performance of the underlying collateral, we expect to receive all contractual interest and principal payments recovering the amortized cost basis of each of the securities, and concluded that these securities are not other-than-temporarily impaired. However, if there are additional deferrals or defaults that impact the contractual cash flows within the tranches we own, we may be required to record an other-than-temporary impairment related to these securities, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur concentration in commercial real estate and business loans may increase our future credit losses, which would negatively affect our financial results.\nWe offer a variety of secured loans, including commercial lines of credit, commercial term loans, real estate, construction, home equity, consumer and other loans. Approximately 87% of our loans are secured by real estate, both residential and commercial, substantially all of which are located in our market area. A major change in the region's real estate market, resulting in a further deterioration in real estate values, or in the local or national economy, including changes caused by raising interest rates, could adversely affect our customers' ability to pay these loans, which in turn could adversely impact us. Risk of loan defaults and foreclosures are inherent in the banking industry, and we try to limit our exposure to this risk by carefully underwriting and monitoring our extensions of credit. We cannot fully eliminate credit risk, and as a result credit losses may occur in the future.\nCommercial real estate and business loans increase our exposure to credit risks.\nAt December 31, 2015, our portfolio of commercial and industrial and commercial real estate (including construction) totaled $2.5 billion, or 80% of total loans. We plan to continue to emphasize the origination of loans to small and medium-sized businesses as well as government contractors, professionals, such as physicians, accountants and attorneys, and commercial real estate developers and builders, which generally exposes us to a greater risk of nonpayment and loss than residential real estate loans because repayment of such loans often depends on the successful operations and cash flows of the borrowers. Additionally, such loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to residential real estate loans. Also, many of our borrowers have more than one commercial loan outstanding. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to a significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a residential real estate loan. In addition, these small to medium-sized businesses generally have fewer financial resources in terms of capital or borrowing capacity than larger entities. If general economic conditions negatively impact these businesses, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. This concentration also exposes us more to the market risks of real estate sales leasing and other activity in the areas we serve. An adverse change in local real estate conditions and markets could materially adversely affect the values of our loans and the real estate held as collateral for such loans, and materially affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nFederal bank regulatory agencies have released guidance on \"Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending\" (the \"Guidance\"). The Guidance defines commercial real estate (\"CRE\") loans as exposures secured by raw land, land development and construction (including 1-4 family residential construction), multi-family property, and non-farm nonresidential property where the primary or a significant source of repayment is derived from rental income associated with the property (that is, loans for which 50% or more of the source of repayment comes from third party, non-affiliated, rental income) or the proceeds of the sale, refinancing, or permanent financing of the property. The Guidance requires that appropriate processes be in place to identify, monitor and control risks associated with real estate lending concentrations. This could include enhanced strategic planning, CRE underwriting policies, risk management, internal controls, portfolio stress testing and risk exposure limits as well as appropriately designed compensation and incentive programs. Higher allowances for loan losses and capital levels may also be required. The Guidance is triggered when CRE loan concentrations exceed either:\n\u2022 Total reported loans for construction, land development, and other land of 100% or more of a bank's total capital; or\n\u2022 Total reported loans secured by multifamily and nonfarm nonresidential properties and loans for construction, land development, and other land of 300% or more of a bank's capital.\nThe Guidance applies to our CRE lending activities. Although our regulators have not required us to maintain elevated levels of capital or liquidity due to our CRE concentrations, the regulators may do so in the future, especially if there is a material downturn in our local real estate markets.\nIf our allowance for loan losses is not appropriate, our results of operations may be affected.\nWe maintain an allowance for loan losses that we believe is a reasonable estimate of known and inherent losses in our loan portfolio. Through a periodic review and analysis of the loan portfolio, management determines the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses by considering such factors as general and industry-specific market conditions, credit quality of the loan portfolio, the collateral supporting the loans and financial performance of our loan customers relative to their financial obligations to us. The amount of future losses is impacted by changes in economic, operating and other conditions, including changes in interest rates, which may be beyond our control. Actual losses may exceed our current estimates. Rapidly growing loan portfolios are, by their nature, unseasoned. Estimating loan loss allowances for an unseasoned portfolio is more difficult than with seasoned portfolios, and may be more susceptible to changes in estimates and to losses exceeding estimates. Although we believe the allowance for loan losses is a reasonable estimate of known and inherent losses in our loan portfolio, we cannot fully predict such losses or assert that our loan loss allowance will be appropriate in the future. Future loan losses that are greater than current estimates could have a material impact on our future financial performance.\nBanking regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses or recognize additional loan charge-offs, based on credit judgments different than those of our management. Any increase in the amount of our allowance or loans charged-off as required by these regulatory agencies could have a negative effect on our operating results.\nOur liquidity could be impaired by our inability to access the capital markets on favorable terms.\nLiquidity is essential to our business. Under normal business conditions, primary sources of funding for our parent company may include dividends received from banking and nonbanking subsidiaries and proceeds from the issuance of equity capital in the capital markets. The primary sources of funding for our banking subsidiary include customer deposits and wholesale market-based funding. Our liquidity could be impaired by an inability to access the capital markets or by unforeseen outflows of cash, including deposits. This situation may arise due to circumstances that we may be unable to control, such as a general market disruption, negative views about the financial services industry generally, or an operational problem that affects third parties or us.\nFor further discussion on our liquidity position and other liquidity matters, including policies and procedures we use to manage our liquidity risks, see \"Capital Resources\" and \"Liquidity\" in Item 7 of this report.\nIncreases in FDIC insurance premiums may cause our earnings to decrease.\nSince the financial crisis began several years ago, an increasing number of bank failures have imposed significant costs on the FDIC in resolving those failures, and the regulator's deposit insurance fund has been depleted. In order to maintain a strong funding position and restore reserve ratios of the deposit insurance fund, the FDIC has increased, and may increase in the future, assessment rates of insured institutions, including Cardinal Bank.\nDeposits are insured by the FDIC, subject to limits and conditions or applicable law and the FDIC's regulations. Pursuant to the Financial Reform Act, FDIC insurance coverage limits were permanently increased to $250,000 per customer. The FDIC administers the deposit insurance fund, and all insured depository institutions are required to pay assessments to the FDIC that fund the DIF.\nThe Financial Reform Act changed the methodology for calculating deposit insurance assessments by changing the assessment base from the amount of an insured depository institution's domestic deposits to its total assets minus tangible equity. The new regulation implementing revisions to the assessment system mandated by the Financial Reform Act was effective April 1, 2011 and was reflected in the June 30, 2011 FDIC fund balance and the invoices for assessments due September 30, 2011. As a result of the new regulations, we expect higher annual deposit insurance assessments than we historically incurred before the financial crisis began several years ago. While the burden of replenishing the DIF will be placed primarily on institutions with assets of greater than $10 billion, any future increases in required deposit insurance premiums or other bank industry fees could have a significant adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.\nOur ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial industry. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client. There is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe rely heavily on our management team and the unexpected loss of any of those personnel could adversely affect our operations; we depend on our ability to attract and retain key personnel.\nWe are a customer-focused and relationship-driven organization. We expect our future growth to be driven in a large part by the relationships maintained with our customers by our Executive Chairman, Bernard H. Clineburg, and our other executive and senior lending officers. We have entered into employment agreements with Mr. Clineburg and several other executive officers. The existence of such agreements, however, does not necessarily assure us that we will be able to continue to retain their services. The unexpected loss of Mr. Clineburg or other key employees could have a significant adverse effect on our business and possibly result in reduced revenues and earnings. We maintain bank owned life insurance policies on all of our corporate executives, of which we are the beneficiary.\nThe implementation of our business strategy will also require us to continue to attract, hire, motivate and retain skilled personnel to develop new customer relationships, as well as develop new financial products and services. Many experienced banking professionals employed by our competitors are covered by agreements not to compete or solicit their existing customers if they were to leave their current employment. These agreements make the recruitment of these professionals more difficult. While we have been recently successful in acquiring what we consider to be talented banking professionals, the market for talented people is competitive and we may not continue to be successful in attracting, hiring, motivating or retaining experienced banking professionals.\nFailure to maintain effective systems of internal and disclosure control could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition.\nEffective internal and disclosure controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud, and to operate successfully as a public company. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our reputation and operating results would be harmed. As part of our ongoing monitoring of internal control, we may discover material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in internal control that require remediation. A \"material weakness\" is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable\npossibility that a material misstatement of a company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nWe have in the past discovered, and may in the future discover, areas of our internal controls that need improvement. Even so, we continue to work to improve our internal controls. We cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we implement and maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future. Any failure to maintain effective controls or to timely implement any necessary improvement of our internal and disclosure controls could, among other things, result in losses from fraud or error, harm our reputation, or cause investors to lose confidence in the reported financial information, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may incur losses if we are unable to successfully manage interest rate risk.\nOur future profitability will substantially depend upon our ability to maintain or increase the spread between the interest rates earned on investments and loans and interest rates paid on deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities. Changes in interest rates will affect our operating performance and financial condition. The shape of the yield curve can also impact net interest income. Changing rates will impact how fast our mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities will have the principal repaid. Rate changes can also impact the behavior of our depositors, especially depositors in non-maturity deposits such as demand, interest checking, savings and money market accounts. While we attempt to minimize our exposure to interest rate risk, we are unable to eliminate it as it is an inherent part of our business. Our net interest spread will depend on many factors that are partly or entirely outside our control, including competition, federal economic, monetary and fiscal policies, and industry-specific conditions and economic conditions generally.\nOur future success is dependent on our ability to compete effectively in the highly competitive banking and financial services industry.\nWe face vigorous competition from other commercial banks, savings and loan associations, savings banks, credit unions, mortgage banking firms, consumer finance companies, securities brokerage firms, insurance companies, money market funds and other types of financial institutions for deposits, loans and other financial services in our market area. A number of these banks and other financial institutions are significantly larger than we are and have substantially greater access to capital and other resources, as well as larger lending limits and branch systems, and offer a wider array of banking services. Many of our nonbank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations that govern us. As a result, these nonbank competitors have advantages over us in providing certain services. This competition may reduce or limit our margins and our market share and may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in accounting standards could impact reported earnings.\nThe authorities that promulgate accounting standards, including the FASB, SEC, and other regulatory authorities, periodically change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. These changes are difficult to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in the restatement of financial statements for prior periods. Such changes could also require us to incur additional personnel or technology costs.\nOur businesses and earnings are impacted by governmental, fiscal and monetary policy.\nWe are affected by domestic monetary policy. For example, the Federal Reserve Board regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States and its policies determine in large part our cost of funds for lending, investing and capital raising activities and the return we earn on those loans and investments, both of which affect our net interest margin. The actions of the Federal Reserve Board also can materially affect the value of financial instruments we hold, such as loans and debt securities, and its policies also can affect our borrowers, potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans. Our businesses and earnings also are affected by the fiscal or other policies that are adopted by various regulatory authorities of the United States. Changes in fiscal or monetary policy are beyond our control and hard to predict.\nOur information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security.\nWe rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business. In addition, as part of our business, we collect, process and retain sensitive and confidential client and customer information. Our facilities and systems, and those of our third party service providers, may be vulnerable to security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors, or other similar events. Any failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in customer relationship management, general ledger, deposit, loan and other systems. While we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure, interruption or security breach of our information systems, there can be no assurance that any such failures, interruptions or security breaches will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed. The occurrence of any failures, interruptions or security breaches of our information systems could damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe operational functions of business counterparties over which we may have limited or no control may experience disruptions that could adversely impact us.\nMultiple major U.S. retailers have recently experienced data systems incursions reportedly resulting in the thefts of credit and debit card information, online account information, and other financial data of tens of millions of the retailers' customers. Retailer incursions affect cards issued and deposit accounts maintained by many banks, including our subsidiary Bank. Although our systems are not breached in retailer incursions, these events can cause us to reissue a significant number of cards and take other costly steps to avoid significant theft loss to the Bank and its customers. In some cases, the Bank may be required to reimburse customers for the losses they incur. Other possible points of intrusion or disruption not within our control include internet service providers, electronic mail portal providers, social media portals, distant-server (\"cloud\") service providers, electronic data security providers, telecommunications companies, and smart phone manufacturers.\nOur profitability and the value of any equity investment in us may suffer because of rapid and unpredictable changes in the highly regulated environment in which we operate.\nWe are subject to extensive supervision by several governmental regulatory agencies at the federal and state levels. Recently enacted, proposed and future banking and other legislation and regulations have had, and will continue to have, or may have a significant impact on the financial services industry. These regulations, which are generally intended to protect depositors and not our shareholders, and the interpretation and application of them by federal and state regulators, are beyond our control, may change rapidly and unpredictably, and can be expected to influence our earnings and growth. Our success depends on our continued ability to maintain compliance with these regulations. Many of these\nregulations increase our costs and thus place other financial institutions that may not be subject to similar regulation in stronger, more favorable competitive positions.\nIf we need additional capital in the future to continue our growth, we may not be able to obtain it on terms that are favorable. This could negatively affect our performance and the value of our common stock.\nOur business strategy calls for continued growth. We anticipate that we will be able to support this growth through the generation of additional deposits at existing and new branch locations, as well as expanded loan and other investment opportunities. However, we may need to raise additional capital in the future to support our continued growth and to maintain desired capital levels. Our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities or the placement of financial instruments that qualify as regulatory capital will depend primarily upon our financial condition and the condition of financial markets at that time. We may not be able to obtain additional capital in the amounts or on terms satisfactory to us. Our growth may be constrained if we are unable to raise additional capital as needed.\nWe have extended off-balance sheet commitments to borrowers which expose us to credit and interest rate risk.\nWe enter into certain off-balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers. These off-balance sheet arrangements include commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit and guarantees which would impact our liquidity and capital resources to the extent customers accept or use these commitments. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet. Our exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit and guarantees written is represented by the contractual or notional amount of those instruments. We use the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as we do for on-balance-sheet instruments.\nWe have operational risk that could impact our ability to provide services to our customers.\nThird parties provide key components of our business operations such as data processing, recording and monitoring transactions, online banking interfaces and services, internet connections, and network access. While we have selected these third party vendors carefully, we do not control their actions. Any problem caused by these third parties, including poor performance of services failure to provide services, disruptions in communication services provided by a vendor and failure to handle current or higher volumes, could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and otherwise conduct our business, and may harm our reputation. Financial or operational difficulties of a third party vendor could also hurt our operations if those difficulties affect the vendor's ability to serve us. Replacing these third party vendors could also create significant delay and expense. Accordingly, use of such third parties creates an unavoidable inherent risk to our business operations.\nWe may be parties to certain legal proceedings that may impact our earnings.\nWe face significant legal risks in our businesses, and the volume of claims and amount of damages and penalties claimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions remain high. Substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against us could have material adverse financial impact or cause significant reputational risk to us, which in turn could seriously harm our business prospects.\nOur ability to pay dividends is limited and we may be unable to pay future dividends.\nOur ability to pay dividends is limited by banking laws and regulations and the need to maintain sufficient consolidated capital in the Company and in our subsidiaries. The ability of our bank subsidiary to pay dividends to us is limited by its obligations to maintain sufficient capital, earnings and liquidity and by other general restrictions on its dividends under federal and state bank regulatory requirements. In addition, as a bank holding company, our ability to declare and pay dividends is subject to the guidelines of the Federal Reserve regarding capital adequacy and dividends. The Federal Reserve guidelines generally require us to review the effects of the cash payment of dividends on common stock and other Tier 1 capital instruments (i.e., perpetual preferred stock and trust preferred debt) on our financial condition. These guidelines also require that we review our net income for the current and past four quarters, and the level of dividends on common stock and other Tier 1 capital instruments for those periods, as well as our projected rate or earnings retention. Under the Federal Reserve's policy, the board of directors of a bank holding company should also consider different factors to ensure that its dividend level is prudent relative to the organization's financial position and is not based on overly optimistic earnings scenarios such as any potential events that may occur before the payment date that could affect its ability to pay while still maintaining a strong financial position. As a general matter, the Federal Reserve has indicated that the board of directors of a bank holding company should consult with the Federal Reserve and eliminate, defer, or significantly reduce bank holding company's dividends if: (i) its net income available to shareholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid during that period, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends; (ii) its prospective rate of earnings retention is not consistent with its capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition; or (iii) it will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios. If we do not satisfy these regulatory requirements or the Federal Reserve's policies, we will be unable to pay dividends on our common stock.\nConsumers may increasingly decide not to use the Bank to complete their financial transactions, which would have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operations.\nTechnology and other changes are allowing parties to complete financial transactions through alternative methods that historically have involved banks. For example, consumers can now maintain funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits in brokerage accounts, mutual funds or general-purpose reloadable prepaid cards. Consumers can also complete transactions such as paying bills and/or transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks. The process of eliminating banks as intermediaries, known as \"disintermediation,\" could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits. The loss of these revenue streams and the lower cost of deposits as a source of funds could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 86250, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "CFNL"}
