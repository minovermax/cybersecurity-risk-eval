Any or all of our forward-looking statements in this annual report, and in any other public statements we make, may turn out to be wrong. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Many factors mentioned in the discussion below will be important in determining future results. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures we make in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, or other outbreak of disease or similar public health threat, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in government authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain the virus, and these measures have impacted and may further impact our workforce and operations, the operations of our customers, and those of our respective vendors and suppliers. Furthermore, the outbreak has significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty and negatively impacted consumer confidence. Any shortfall in consumer spending or demand for consumer electronic products, such as due to social distancing and other restrictions, may negatively affect our business and results of operations.\nThe spread of COVID-19 also has caused us to modify our business practices, and we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, and communities. Such actions may result in further disruptions to our supply chain, operations and facilities, and workforce. We cannot assure you that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by COVID-19, and our ability to perform critical functions could be harmed.\nWe cannot at this time quantify or forecast the full business impact of COVID-19. The degree to which COVID-19 impacts our business, financial condition, and results of operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain, and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume.\nThe markets in which we operate are highly competitive, and as a result we could experience a loss of sales, lower prices and lower revenues.\nThe markets for the products in which our technology is incorporated are highly competitive. Aggressive competition could result in substantial declines in the prices that we are able to charge for our intellectual property or lose design wins to competitors. Many of our competitors are striving to increase their share of the growing signal processing IP markets and are reducing their licensing and royalty fees to attract customers. The following industry players and factors may have a significant impact on our competitiveness:\n\u25cf\nwe compete directly in the signal processing cores space with Verisilicon, Cadence and Synopsys;\n\u25cf\nwe compete with CPU IP or configurable CPU IP (offering DSP configured CPU and/or DSP acceleration and/or connectivity capabilities to their IP) providers, such as ARM (in the process of being acquired by NVidia), Synopsys and Cadence and the RISC-V open source;\n\u25cf\nwe compete with internal engineering teams at companies such as Mediatek, Qualcomm, Samsung, Huawei and NXP that may design programmable DSP core products and signal processing cores in-house and therefore not license our technologies;\n\u25cf\nwe compete in the short range wireless markets with Mindtree, Synopsys and internal engineering teams at companies such as Cypress (now part of Infineon), Silicon Labs, NXP;\n\u25cf\nwe compete in embedded imaging and vision market with Cadence, Synopsys, Videantis, Verislicon, ARM and Verisilicon;\n\u25cf\nwe compete in AI processor marketing with AI processor and accelerator providers, including AImotive, Arm Limited, Cadence, Synopsys, Cambricon, Digital Media Professionals (DMP), Imagination Technologies, Nvidia open source NVDLA and Verisilicon; and\n\u25cf we compete in the audio and voice applications market with Arm Limited, Cadence, Synopsys and Verisilicon.\nIn addition, we may face increased competition from smaller, niche semiconductor design companies in the future. Some of our customers also may decide to satisfy their needs through in-house design. We compete on the basis of signal processing IP performance, overall chip cost, power consumption, flexibility, reliability, communication and multimedia software availability, design cycle time, tool chain, customer support, name recognition, reputation and financial strength. Our inability to compete effectively on these bases could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur quarterly operating results fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to a variety of factors, including our lengthy sales cycle, and may not be a meaningful indicator of future performance.\nIn some quarters our operating results could be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, which could cause our stock price to fall. Factors that may affect our quarterly results of operations in the future include, among other things:\n\u25cf\nthe gain or loss of significant licensees, partly due to our dependence on a limited number of customers generating a significant amount of quarterly revenues;\n\u25cf\nany delay in execution of any anticipated licensing arrangement during a particular quarter;\n\u25cf\ndelays in revenue recognition for some license agreements based on percentage of completion of customized work or other accounting reasons;\n\u25cf\nthe timing and volume of orders and production by our customers, as well as fluctuations in royalty revenues resulting from fluctuations in unit shipments by our licensees;\n\u25cf\nroyalty pricing pressures and reduction in royalty rates due to an increase in volume shipments by customers, end-product price erosion and competitive pressures;\n\u25cf\nearnings or other financial announcements by our major customers that include shipment data or other information that implicates expectations for our future royalty revenues;\n\u25cf\nthe mix of revenues among licensing and related revenues, and royalty revenues;\n\u25cf\nthe timing of the introduction of new or enhanced technologies by us and our competitors, as well as the market acceptance of such technologies;\n\u25cf\nthe discontinuation, or public announcement thereof, of product lines or market sectors that incorporate our technology by our significant customers;\n\u25cf\nour lengthy sales cycle and specifically in the third quarter of any fiscal year during which summer vacations slow down decision-making processes of our customers in executing contracts;\n\u25cf\ndelays in the commercialization of end products that incorporate our technology;\n\u25cf\ncurrency fluctuations, mainly the EURO and the NIS versus the U.S. dollar;\n\u25cf\nfluctuations in operating expenses and gross margins associated with the introduction of, and research and development investments in, new or enhanced technologies and adjustments to operating expenses resulting from restructurings;\n\u25cf\nthe approvals, amounts and timing of Israeli research and development government grants from the Israeli Innovation Authority of the Ministry of Economy and Industry in Israel (the \u201cIIA\u201d), EU grants and French research tax credits;\n\u25cf\nthe impact of new accounting pronouncements, including the new revenue recognition rules;\n\u25cf\nthe timing of our payment of royalties to the IIA, which is impacted by the timing and magnitude of license agreements and royalty revenues derived from technologies that were funded by grant programs of the IIA;\n\u25cf\nstatutory changes associated with research tax benefits applicable to French technology companies;\n\u25cf\nour ability to scale our operations in response to changes in demand for our technologies;\n\u25cf\nentry into new end markets that utilize our signal processing IPs, software and platforms;\n\u25cf\nchanges in our pricing policies and those of our competitors;\n\u25cf\nrestructuring, asset and goodwill impairment and related charges, as well as other accounting changes or adjustments;\n\u25cf\ngeneral political conditions, including global trade wars resulting from tariffs and business restrictions and bans imposed by government entities, like the well publicized 2018 ban associated with ZTE, as well as other regulatory actions and changes that may adversely affect the business environment;\n\u25cf\ngeneral economic conditions, including the current economic conditions, and its effect on the semiconductor industry and sales of consumer products into which our technologies are incorporated;\n\u25cf\ndelays in final product delivery due to unexpected issues introduced by our service or EDA tool providers;\n\u25cf\ndelays in ratification of standards for Bluetooth, Wi-Fi or NB-IoT that can affect the introduction of new products;\n\u25cf\nconstraints on chip manufacturing capacity due to high demand or shutdowns of FABs and other manufacturing facilities; and\n\u25cf\nreductions in demand for consumer and digital devices due to lockdowns or overall financial difficulties resulting from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\nEach of the above factors is difficult to forecast and could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Also, we license our technology to OEMs and semiconductor companies for incorporation into their end products for consumer markets, including handsets and consumer electronics products. The royalties we generate are reported by our customers.\nOur royalty revenues are affected by seasonal buying patterns of consumer products sold by OEMs, partially by our direct customers and partially by semiconductor customers that incorporate our technology into their end products and the market acceptance of such end products. The first quarter in any given year is usually a sequentially down quarter for us in relation to royalty revenues as this period represents lower post-Christmas fourth quarter consumer product shipments. However, the magnitude of this first quarter decrease varies annually and has been impacted by global economic conditions, market share changes, exiting or refocusing of market sectors by our customers and the timing of introduction of new and existing handset devices powered by CEVA technology sold in any given quarter compared to the prior quarter. Furthermore, in 2020 the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic created demand for digital connectivity and consumer devices, in parallel to economic slowdowns in different countries and at different times due to shelter-in-place orders and other government restrictions. Such events may continue into 2021 and distort more traditional seasonality trends.\nMoreover, the semiconductor and consumer electronics industries remain volatile, which makes it extremely difficult for our customers and us to accurately forecast financial results and plan for future business activities. As a result, our past operating results should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance.\nWe rely significantly on revenues derived from a limited number of customers who contribute to our royalty and license revenues.\nWe derive a significant amount of revenues from a limited number of customers. Sales to Spreadtrum, accounted for 14%, 15% and 15% of our total revenues for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Sales to Intel represented 15%, 19% and 19% of our total revenues for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. With respect to our royalty revenues, four royalty paying customers each represented 10% or more of our total royalty revenues for 2020, and collectively represented 72% of our total royalty revenues for 2020. Three royalty paying customers each represented 10% or more of our total royalty revenues for 2019, and collectively represented 73% of our total royalty revenues for 2019, and three royalty paying customers each represented 10% or more of our total royalty revenues for 2018, and collectively represented 76% of our total royalty revenues for 2018. We expect that a significant portion of our future revenues will continue to be generated by a limited number of customers. The loss of any significant royalty paying customer could adversely affect our near-term future operating results. Furthermore, consolidation among our customers may negatively affect our revenue source, increase our existing customers\u2019 negotiation leverage and make us further dependent on a limited number of customers. Moreover, the discontinuation of product lines or market sectors that incorporate our technology by our significant customers or a change in direction of their business and our inability to adapt our technology to their new business needs could have material negative implications for our future royalty revenues.\nOur business is dependent on licensing revenues, which may vary period to period.\nLicense agreements for our signal processing IP cores and platforms have not historically provided for substantial ongoing license payments so past licensing revenues may not be indicative of the amount of such revenues in any future period. We believe that there is a similar risk with RivieraWaves\u2019 operations associated with Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity technologies. Significant portions of our anticipated future revenues, therefore, will likely depend upon our success in attracting new customers or expanding our relationships with existing customers. However, revenues recognized from licensing arrangements vary significantly from period to period, depending on the number and size of deals closed during a quarter, and is difficult to predict. In addition, as we expand our business into the non-handset baseband markets, our licensing deals may be smaller but greater in volume which may further fluctuate our licensing revenues quarter to quarter. Our ability to succeed in our licensing efforts will depend on a variety of factors, including the performance, quality, breadth and depth of our current and future products as well as our sales and marketing skills. In addition, some of our licensees may in the future decide to satisfy their needs through in-house design and production. Our failure to obtain future licensing customers would impede our future revenue growth and could materially harm our business.\nRoyalty rates could decrease for existing and future license agreements, which could materially adversely affect our operating results.\nRoyalty payments to us under existing and future license agreements could be lower than currently anticipated for a variety of reasons. Average selling prices for semiconductor products generally decrease over time during the lifespan of a product. In addition, there is increasing downward pricing pressures in the semiconductor industry on end products incorporating our technology, especially end products for the handsets and consumer electronics markets. As a result, notwithstanding the existence of a license agreement, our customers may demand that royalty rates for our products be lower than our historic royalty rates. We have in the past and may be pressured in the future to renegotiate existing license agreements with our customers. In addition, certain of our license agreements provide that royalty rates may decrease in connection with the sale of larger quantities of products incorporating our technology. Furthermore, our competitors may lower the royalty rates for their comparable products to win market share which may force us to lower our royalty rates as well. As a consequence of the above referenced factors, as well as unforeseen factors in the future, the royalty rates we receive for use of our technology could decrease, thereby decreasing future anticipated revenues and cash flow. Royalty revenues were approximately 48%, 45% and 48% of our total revenues for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Therefore, a significant decrease in our royalty revenues could materially adversely affect our operating results.\nMoreover, royalty rates may be negatively affected by macroeconomic trends (including the recent COVID-19 pandemic and its global impact) or changes in products mix. Furthermore, consolidation among our customers may increase the leverage of our existing customers to extract concessions from us in royalty rates. Moreover, changes in products mix such as an increase in lower royalty bearing products shipped in high volume like low-cost feature phones and Bluetooth-based products in lieu of higher royalty bearing products like LTE phones could lower our royalty revenues.\nWe generate a significant amount of our total revenues, especially royalty revenues, from the handset baseband market (for mobile handsets and for other modem connected devices) and our business and operating results may be materially adversely affected if we do not continue to succeed in these highly competitive markets.\nA significant portion of our revenues in general, and in particular our royalty revenues, are derived from baseband for handsets. Any adverse change in our ability to compete and maintain our competitive position in the handset baseband market, including through the introduction by competitors of enhanced technologies that attract customers that target those markets, would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, the handset baseband market is extremely competitive and is facing intense pricing pressures, and we expect that competition and pricing pressures will only increase. Furthermore, it can be very volatile with regards to volume shipments of different phones, standards and connected devices due to inventory build out or consumer demand changes or geographical macroeconomics, pricing changes, product discontinuations due to technical issues and timing of introduction of new phones and products. Our existing OEM or semiconductor customers also may fail to introduce new handset devices that attract consumers, lose a significant design opportunity for a new product introduction or encounter significant delays in developing, manufacturing or shipping new or enhanced products in those markets or find alternative technological solutions and suppliers. The inability of our customers to compete would result in lower shipments of products powered by our technologies which in turn would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. As an example, Intel, one of our customers, did not have its products selected for inclusion in Apple\u2019s new 5G smartphone series, and thereafter announced the sale of its 5G smartphone modem business to Apple. A customer\u2019s loss of a design opportunity may have an adverse effect on our royalty revenues from such customer, which in turn will also have an adverse effect on our overall results of operations and market share. Our royalty revenues will be negatively impacted if we fail to offset any loss of royalty revenues from, for example, our customers\u2019 products being incorporated Apple\u2019s new 5G smartphone series with royalty revenues from other emerging products incorporating our technologies. Since a significant portion of our revenues is derived from the handset baseband market, adverse conditions in this market would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn order to sustain the future growth of our business, we must penetrate new markets and our new products must achieve widespread market acceptance but such additional revenue opportunities may not be implemented and may not be achieved.\nIn order to expand our business and increase our revenues, we must penetrate new markets and introduce new products, including additional non-baseband related products. We have invested significant resources in pursuing potential opportunities for revenue growth and diversify our revenue streams. Our continued success will depend significantly on our ability to accurately anticipate changes in industry standards and to continue to appropriately fund development efforts to enhance our existing products or introduce new products in a timely manner to keep pace with technological developments. However, there are no assurances that we will develop products relevant for the marketplace or gain significant market share in those competitive markets. Moreover, if any of our competitors implement new technologies before us, those competitors may be able to provide products that are more effective or at lower prices, which could adversely impact our sales and impact our market share. Our inability to penetrate new markets and increase our market share in those markets or lack of customer acceptance of our new products may harm our business and potential growth.\nBecause our IP solutions are components of end products, if semiconductor companies and electronic equipment manufacturers do not incorporate our solutions into their end products or if the end products of our customers do not achieve market acceptance, we may not be able to generate adequate sales of our products.\nWe do not sell our IP solutions directly to end-users; we license our technology primarily to semiconductor companies and electronic equipment manufacturers, who then incorporate our technology into the products they sell. As a result, we rely on our customers to incorporate our technology into their end products at the design stage. Once a company incorporates a competitor\u2019s technology into its end product, it becomes significantly more difficult for us to sell our technology to that company because changing suppliers involves significant cost, time, effort and risk for the company. As a result, we may incur significant expenditures on the development of a new technology without any assurance that our existing or potential customers will select our technology for incorporation into their own product and without this \u201cdesign win,\u201d it becomes significantly difficult to sell our IP solutions. Moreover, even after a customer agrees to incorporate our technology into its end products, the design cycle is long and may be delayed due to factors beyond our control, which may result in the end product incorporating our technology not reaching the market until long after the initial \u201cdesign win\u201d with such customer. From initial product design-in to volume production, many factors could impact the timing and/or amount of sales actually realized from the design-in. These factors include, but are not limited to, changes in the competitive position of our technology, our customers\u2019 financial stability, and our customers' ability to ship products according to our customers\u2019 schedule. Moreover, current economic conditions may further prolong a customer\u2019s decision-making process and design cycle.\nFurther, because we do not control the business practices of our customers, we do not influence the degree to which they promote our technology or set the prices at which they sell products incorporating our technology. We cannot assure you that our customers will devote satisfactory efforts to promote their end products which incorporate our IP solutions.\nIn addition, our royalties from licenses and therefore the growth of our business, are dependent upon the success of our customers in introducing products incorporating our technology and the success of those products in the marketplace. The primary customers for our products are semiconductor design and manufacturing companies, system OEMs and electronic equipment manufacturers, particularly in the telecommunications field. All of the industries we license into are highly competitive, cyclical and have been subject to significant economic downturns at various times. These downturns are characterized by production overcapacity and reduced revenues, which at times may encourage semiconductor companies or electronic product manufacturers to reduce their expenditure on our technology. If we do not retain our current customers and continue to attract new customers, our business may be harmed.\nWe depend on market acceptance of third-party semiconductor intellectual property.\nThe semiconductor intellectual property (SIP) industry is a relatively small and emerging industry. Our future growth will depend on the level of market acceptance of our third-party licensable intellectual property model, the variety of intellectual property offerings available on the market, and a shift in customer preference away from in-house development of proprietary signal processing IP towards licensing open signal processing IP cores and platforms. Furthermore, the third-party licensable intellectual property model is highly dependent on the market adoption of new services and products, such as low cost smartphones in emerging markets, LTE-based smartphones, mobile broadband, small cell base stations and the increased use of advanced audio, voice, computational photography and embedded vision in mobile, automotive and consumer products, as well as in IoT and connectivity applications in general in which we participate. Such market adoption is important because the increased cost associated with ownership and maintenance of the more complex architectures needed for the advanced services and products may motivate companies to license third-party intellectual property rather than design them in-house.\nThe trends that would enable our growth are largely beyond our control. Semiconductor customers also may choose to adopt a multi-chip, off-the-shelf chip solution versus licensing or using highly-integrated chipsets that embed our technologies. If the above referenced market shifts do not materialize or third-party SIP does not achieve market acceptance, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially harmed.\nBecause we have significant international operations, we may be subject to political, economic and other conditions relating to our international operations that could increase our operating expenses and disrupt our revenues and business.\nApproximately 79% of our total revenues for 2020, 81% for 2019 and 89% for 2018 were derived from customers located outside of the United States. We expect that international customers will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future. As a result, the occurrence of any negative international political, economic or geographic events could result in significant revenue shortfalls. These shortfalls could cause our business, financial condition and results of operations to be harmed. Some of the risks of doing business internationally include:\n\u25cf\nunexpected changes in regulatory requirements;\n\u25cf\nfluctuations in the exchange rate for the U.S. dollar;\n\u25cf\nimposition of tariffs and other barriers and restrictions, including trade tensions such as U.S.-China trade tensions;\n\u25cf\npotential negative international community\u2019s reaction to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act;\n\u25cf\nburdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws, treaties and technical standards;\n\u25cf\nuncertainty of laws and enforcement in certain countries relating to the protection of intellectual property;\n\u25cf\nmultiple and possibly overlapping tax structures and potentially adverse tax consequences;\n\u25cf\npolitical and economic instability, including terrorist attacks and protectionist polices; and\n\u25cf\nchanges in diplomatic and trade relationships.\nRevenues from customers located in the Asia Pacific region account for a substantial portion of our total revenues. We expect that revenue from international sales generally, and sales to the Asia Pacific region specifically, will continue to be a material part of our total revenues. Therefore, any financial crisis, trade negotiations or disputes or other major event causing business disruption in international jurisdictions generally, and in specific countries in the Asia Pacific region in particular, could negatively affect our future revenues and results of operations. For example, in 2018, the U.S. Department of Commerce\u2019s Bureau of Industry and Security\u2019s initial ban on exports of U.S. products to Chinese telecommunications OEM ZTE disrupted ZTE\u2019s operations, which caused delays with our engagements with ZTE and negatively impacted our royalty revenues. Actions of any nature with respect to such customers may reduce our revenues from them and adversely affect our business and financial results.\nNew tariffs and other trade measures could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nGeneral trade tensions between the U.S. and China have been escalating since 2018, and are not fully resolved yet. Trade tensions between the U.S. and China have resulted in significant tariff increases, sanctions against specified entities, and the broadening of restrictions and license requirements for specified uses of products. The ongoing geopolitical and economic uncertainty between the U.S. and China, and the unknown impact of current and future U.S. and Chinese trade regulations, may cause disruptions in the semiconductor industry and its supply chain, decreased demand from customers for the ultimate products using our IP solutions, or other disruptions which may, directly or indirectly, materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. While tariffs and other retaliatory trade measures imposed by other countries on U.S. goods have not yet had a significant impact on our business or results of operations, we cannot predict further developments, and such existing or future tariffs could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Furthermore, further changes in U.S. trade policy could trigger retaliatory actions by affected countries, which could impose restrictions on our ability to do business in or with affected countries or prohibit, reduce or discourage purchases of our products by foreign customers and higher prices for our products in foreign markets. For example, there are risks that the Chinese government may, among other things, require the use of local suppliers, compel companies that do business in China to partner with local companies to conduct business and provide incentives to government-backed local customers to buy from local suppliers. Changes in, and responses to, U.S. trade policy could reduce the competitiveness of our products and cause our sales and revenues to drop, which could materially and adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nWe depend on a limited number of key personnel who would be difficult to replace.\nOur success depends to a significant extent upon certain of our key employees and senior management, the loss of which could materially harm our business. Competition for skilled employees in our field is intense. We cannot assure you that in the future we will be successful in attracting and retaining the required personnel.\nThe sales cycle for our IP solutions is lengthy, which makes forecasting of our customer orders and revenues difficult.\nThe sales cycle for our IP solutions is lengthy, often lasting three to nine months. Our customers generally conduct significant technical evaluations, including customer trials, of our technology as well as competing technologies prior to making a purchasing decision. In addition, purchasing decisions also may be delayed because of a customer\u2019s internal budget approval process. Furthermore, given the current market conditions, we have less ability to predict the timing of our customers\u2019 purchasing cycle and potential unexpected delays in such a cycle. Because of the lengthy sales cycle and potential delays, our dependence on a limited number of customers to generate a significant amount of revenues for a particular period and the size of customer orders, if orders forecasted for a specific customer for a particular period do not occur in that period, our revenues and operating results for that particular quarter could suffer. Moreover, a portion of our expenses related to an anticipated order is fixed and difficult to reduce or change, which may further impact our operating results for a particular period.\nBecause our IP solutions are complex, the detection of errors in our products may be delayed, and if we deliver products with defects, our credibility will be harmed, the sales and market acceptance of our products may decrease and product liability claims may be made against us.\nOur IP solutions are complex and may contain errors, defects and bugs when introduced. If we deliver products with errors, defects or bugs, our credibility and the market acceptance and sales of our products could be significantly harmed. Furthermore, the nature of our products may also delay the detection of any such error or defect. If our products contain errors, defects and bugs, then we may be required to expend significant capital and resources to alleviate these problems. This could result in the diversion of technical and other resources from our other development efforts. Any actual or perceived problems or delays may also adversely affect our ability to attract or retain customers. Furthermore, the existence of any defects, errors or failure in our products could lead to product liability claims or lawsuits against us or against our customers. A successful product liability claim could result in substantial cost and divert management\u2019s attention and resources, which would have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success will depend on our ability to successfully manage our geographically dispersed operations.\nMost of our research and development staff is located in Israel. We also have research and development teams in France, Ireland, the United Kingdom and United States (following our acquisition of the Hillcrest Labs business from InterDigital in July 2019). Accordingly, our ability to compete successfully will depend in part on the ability of a limited number of key executives located in geographically dispersed offices to manage our research and development staff and integrate them into our operations to effectively address the needs of our customers and respond to changes in our markets. If we are unable to effectively manage and integrate our remote operations, our business may be materially harmed.\nOur operations in Israel may be adversely affected by instability in the Middle East region.\nOne of our principal research and development facilities is located in Israel, and most of our executive officers and some of our directors are residents of Israel. Although substantially all of our sales currently are being made to customers outside Israel, we are nonetheless directly influenced by the political, economic and military conditions affecting Israel. Any major hostilities involving Israel could significantly harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIn addition, certain of our employees are currently obligated to perform annual reserve duty in the Israel Defense Forces and are subject to being called to active military duty at any time. Although we have operated effectively under these requirements since our inception, we cannot predict the effect of these obligations on the company in the future. Our operations could be disrupted by the absence, for a significant period, of one or more of our key employees due to military service.\nTerrorist attacks, acts of war or military actions and/or other civil unrest may adversely affect the territories in which we operate, and our business, financial condition and operating results.\nTerrorist attacks and attempted terrorist attacks, military responses to terrorist attacks, other military actions, or governmental action in response to or in anticipation of a terrorist attack, or civil unrest, may adversely affect prevailing economic conditions, resulting in work stoppages, reduced consumer spending or reduced demand for end products that incorporate our technologies. These developments subject our worldwide operations to increased risks and, depending on their magnitude, could reduce net sales and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur research and development expenses may increase if the grants we currently receive from the Israeli government are reduced or withheld.\nWe currently receive research grants mainly from programs of the IIA. We recorded an aggregate of $3,042,000, $5,843,000 and $3,510,000 in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The amounts in 2020 are lower compared to 2019 as some CEVA-requested programs were not approved by the IIA and as a result of a general change of fund allocations by the IIA. While we will endeavor to win part of these amounts in the coming years, we can provide no assurance that such efforts will be successful. To be eligible for these grants, we must meet certain development conditions and comply with periodic reporting obligations. Although we have met such conditions in the past, should we fail to meet such conditions in the future our research grants may be repayable, reduced or withheld. The repayment or reduction of such research grants may increase our research and development expenses which in turn may reduce our operating income. Also, the timing of such payments from the IIA may vary from year to year and quarter to quarter, and we have no control on the timing of such payment.\nThe nature of our business requires the application of complex revenue recognition rules. Significant changes in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, including the adoption of the new revenue recognition rules, could materially affect our financial position and results of operations.\nWe prepare our financial statements in accordance with GAAP, which is subject to interpretation or changes by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, the SEC, and other various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. New accounting pronouncements and changes in accounting principles have occurred in the past and are expected to occur in the future, which may have a significant effect on our financial results. For example, pursuant to the new revenue recognition rules, effective as of January 1, 2018, an entity recognizes sales and usage-based royalties as revenue only when the later of the following events occurs: (1) the subsequent sale or usage occurs or (2) the performance obligation to which some or all of the sales-based or usage-based royalty allocated has been satisfied (or partially satisfied). Recognizing royalty revenue on a lag time basis is not permitted. As a result, the royalties we generate from customers is based on royalty of units shipped during the quarter as estimated by our customers, not a quarter in arrears that we previously report. Adoption of this standard and any difficulties in implementation of changes in accounting principles, including uncertainty associated with royalty revenues for the quarter based on estimates provided by our customer, could cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations, which could result in regulatory discipline and harm investors\u2019 confidence in us.\nThe Israeli tax benefits that we currently receive and the government programs in which we participate require us to meet certain conditions and may be terminated or reduced in the future, which could increase our tax expenses.\nWe enjoy certain tax benefits in Israel, particularly as a result of the \u201cApproved Enterprise\u201d and the \u201cBenefited Enterprise\u201d status of our facilities and programs through 2019, and the \u201cTechnological Preferred Enterprise\u201d status of our facilities and programs since 2020. To maintain our eligibility for these tax benefits, we must continue to meet certain conditions, relating principally to adherence to the investment program filed with the Investment Center of the Israeli Ministry of Industry and Trade and to periodic reporting obligations. Should we fail to meet such conditions, these benefits would be cancelled and we would be subject to corporate tax in Israel at the standard corporate rate (23% in 2020) and could be required to refund tax benefits already received. Additionally, if we increase our activities outside of Israel, for example, by acquisitions, our increased activities may not be eligible for inclusion in Israeli tax benefit programs. The termination or reduction of certain programs and tax benefits or a requirement to refund tax benefits already received may seriously harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe may have exposure to additional tax liabilities as a result of our foreign operations.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. In addition to our significant operations in Israel, we have operations in Ireland, France, the United Kingdom, China and Japan. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. In the ordinary course of a global business, there are many intercompany transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities. Our intercompany transfer pricing may be reviewed by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and by foreign tax jurisdictions. Although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable, due to the complexity of our corporate structure, the multiple intercompany transactions and the various tax regimes, we cannot assure you that a tax audit or tax dispute to which we may be subject will result in a favorable outcome for us. If taxing authorities do not accept our tax positions and impose higher tax rates on our foreign operations, our overall tax expenses could increase.\nOur failure to maintain certain research tax benefits applicable to French technology companies may adversely affect the results of operations of our RivieraWaves operations.\nPursuant to our acquisition of the RivieraWaves operations, we will benefit from certain research tax credits applicable to French technology companies, including, for example, the Cr\u00e9dit Imp\u00f4t Recherche (\u201cCIR\u201d). The CIR is a French tax credit aimed at stimulating research activities. The CIR can be offset against French corporate income tax due and the portion in excess (if any) may be refunded every three years. The French Parliament can decide to eliminate, or reduce the scope or the rate of, the CIR benefit, at any time or challenge our eligibility or calculations for such tax credits, all of which may have an adverse impact on our results of operations and future cash flows.\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates.\nA significant portion of our business is conducted outside the United States. Although most of our revenues are transacted in U.S. dollars, we may be exposed to currency exchange fluctuations in the future as business practices evolve and we are forced to transact business in local currencies. Moreover, the majority of our expenses are denominated in foreign currencies, mainly New Israeli Shekel (NIS) and the EURO, which subjects us to the risks of foreign currency fluctuations. Based on trends to date, we expect that in 2021 we will have additional exchange rate expenses as compared to 2020 in the event of the ongoing devaluation of the U.S. dollar compared to the Shekel and Euro. Our primary expenses paid in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are employee salaries. Increases in the volatility of the exchange rates of currencies other than the U.S. dollar versus the U.S. dollar could have an adverse effect on the expenses and liabilities that we incur in currencies other than the U.S. dollar when remeasured into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. We have instituted a foreign cash flow hedging program to minimize the effects of currency fluctuations. However, hedging transactions may not successfully mitigate losses caused by currency fluctuations, and our hedging positions may be partial or may not exist at all in the future. We also review our monthly expected non-U.S. dollar denominated expenditure and look to hold equivalent non-U.S. dollar cash balances to mitigate currency fluctuations. However, in some cases, we expect to continue to experience the effect of exchange rate currency fluctuations on an annual and quarterly basis. For example, our EURO cash balances increase significantly on a quarterly basis beyond our EURO liabilities from the CIR, which is generally refunded every three years.\nWe are exposed to the credit risk of our customers, which could result in material losses.\nAs we diversify and expand our addressable market, we will enter into licensing arrangements with first time customers with whom we don\u2019t have full visible of their creditworthiness. Furthermore, we have increased business activities in the Asia Pacific region. As a result, our future credit risk exposure may increase. Although we monitor and attempt to mitigate credit risks, there can be no assurance that our efforts will be effective. Although any losses to date relating to credit exposure of our customers have not been material, future losses, if incurred, could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nOur product development efforts are time-consuming and expensive and may not generate an acceptable return, if any.\nOur product development efforts require us to incur substantial research and development expense. Our research and development expenses were approximately $62.0 million, $52.8 million and $47.8 million for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We may not be able to achieve an acceptable return, if any, on our research and development efforts.\nThe development of our products is highly complex. We occasionally have experienced delays in completing the development and introduction of new products and product enhancements, and we could experience delays in the future. Unanticipated problems in developing products could also divert substantial engineering resources, which may impair our ability to develop new products and enhancements and could substantially increase our costs. Furthermore, we may expend significant amounts on research and development programs that may not ultimately result in commercially successful products. Our research and development expense levels have increased steadily in the past few years. As a result of these and other factors, we may be unable to develop and introduce new products successfully and in a cost-effective and timely manner, and any new products we develop and offer may never achieve market acceptance. Any failure to successfully develop future products would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to meet the changing needs of our end-users or address evolving market demands, our business may be harmed.\nThe markets for signal processing IPs are characterized by rapidly changing technology, emerging markets and new and developing end-user needs, and requiring significant expenditure for research and development. We cannot assure you that we will be able to introduce systems and solutions that reflect prevailing industry standards, on a timely basis, meet the specific technical requirements of our end-users or avoid significant losses due to rapid decreases in market prices of our products, and our failure to do so may seriously harm our business.\nWe may seek to expand our business in ways that could result in diversion of resources and extra expenses.\nWe may in the future pursue acquisitions of businesses, products and technologies, establish joint venture arrangements, make minority equity investments or enhance our existing CEVAnet partner eco-system to expand our business. We are unable to predict whether or when any prospective acquisition, equity investment or joint venture will be completed. The process of negotiating potential acquisitions, joint ventures or equity investments, as well as the integration of acquired or jointly developed businesses, technologies or products may be prolonged due to unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of our resources and management\u2019s attention. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition or investment candidates, complete acquisitions or investments, or integrate acquired businesses or joint ventures with our operations. If we were to make any acquisition or investment or enter into a joint venture, we may not receive the intended benefits of the acquisition, investment or joint venture or such an acquisition, investment or joint venture may not achieve comparable levels of revenues, profitability or productivity as our existing business or otherwise perform as expected. The expansion of our CEVAnet partner eco-system also may not achieve the anticipated benefits. The occurrence of any of these events could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations. Future acquisitions, investments or joint ventures may require substantial capital resources, which may require us to seek additional debt or equity financing.\nFuture acquisitions, joint ventures or minority equity investments by us could result in the following, any of which could seriously harm our results of operations or the price of our stock:\n\u25cf\nissuance of equity securities that would dilute our current stockholders\u2019 percentages of ownership;\n\u25cf\nlarge one-time write-offs or equity investment impairment write-offs;\n\u25cf\nincurrence of debt and contingent liabilities;\n\u25cf\ndifficulties in the assimilation and integration of operations, personnel, technologies, products and information systems of the acquired companies;\n\u25cf\ninability to realize cost efficiencies or synergies, thereby incurring higher operating expenditures as a result of the acquisition;\n\u25cf\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns;\n\u25cf\ncontractual disputes;\n\u25cf\nrisks of entering geographic and business markets in which we have no or only limited prior experience; and\n\u25cf\npotential loss of key employees of acquired organizations.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property.\nOur success and ability to compete depend in large part upon the protection of our proprietary technologies. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, mask work and other intellectual property rights, confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights. These agreements and measures may not be sufficient to protect our technology from third-party infringement or protect us from the claims of others. As a result, we face risks associated with our patent position, including the potential need to engage in significant legal proceedings to enforce our patents, the possibility that the validity or enforceability of our patents may be denied, the possibility that third parties will be able to compete against us without infringing our patents and the possibility that our products may infringe patent rights of third parties.\nOur trade names or trademarks may be registered or utilized by third parties in countries other than those in which we have registered them, impairing our ability to enter and compete in those markets. If we were forced to change any of our brand names, we could lose a significant amount of our brand identity.\nOur business will suffer if we are sued for infringement of the intellectual property rights of third parties or if we cannot obtain licenses to these rights on commercially acceptable terms.\nWe are subject to the risk of adverse claims and litigation alleging infringement of the intellectual property rights of others. There are a large number of patents held by others, including our competitors, pertaining to the broad areas in which we are active. We have not, and cannot reasonably, investigate all such patents. From time to time, we have become aware of patents in our technology areas and have sought legal counsel regarding the validity of such patents and their impact on how we operate our business, and we will continue to seek such counsel when appropriate in the future. In addition, patent infringement claims are increasingly being asserted by patent holding companies (so-called patent \u201ctrolls\u201d), which do not use technology and whose sole business is to enforce patents against companies, such as us, for monetary gain. Because such patent holding companies do not provide services or use technology, the assertion of our own patents by way of counter-claim may be ineffective. Infringement claims may require us to enter into license arrangements or result in protracted and costly litigation, regardless of the merits of these claims. Any necessary licenses may not be available or, if available, may not be obtainable on commercially reasonable terms. If we cannot obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms, we may be forced to stop licensing our technology, and our business would be seriously harmed.\nThe future growth of our business depends in part on our ability to license to system OEMs and small-to-medium-sized semiconductor companies directly and to expand our sales geographically.\nHistorically, a substantial portion of our licensing revenues has been derived in any given period from a relatively small number of licensees. Because of the substantial license fees we charge, our customers tend to be large semiconductor companies or vertically integrated system OEMs. Part of our current growth strategy is to broaden the adoption of our products by small and mid-size companies by offering different versions of our products targeted at these companies. If we are unable to develop and market effectively our intellectual property through these models, our revenues will continue to be dependent on a smaller number of licensees and a less geographically dispersed pattern of licensees, which could materially harm our business and results of operations.\nOur operating results are affected by the highly cyclical nature of and general economic conditions in the semiconductor industry.\nWe operate within the semiconductor industry, which experiences significant fluctuations in sales and profitability. Downturns in the semiconductor industry are characterized by diminished product demand, excess customer inventories, accelerated erosion of prices and excess production capacity. Various market data suggests that the semiconductor industry may be facing such a negative cycle presently, especially in the global handset market. The semiconductor industry has faced significant global supply chain issues as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related imposition of government restrictions on staffing and facility operations, supply chain shortages, and other disruptions. Numerous factors, such as the ongoing pandemic or further trade tensions between the U.S. and China, may prolong or deepen these challenges faced by the industry. Volatility or declines in the semiconductor industry could cause substantial fluctuations or declines in our revenues and results of operations.\nIf we determine that our goodwill and intangible assets have become impaired, we may incur impairment charges, which would negatively impact our operating results.\nGoodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations. Under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, we assess potential impairment of our goodwill and intangible assets at least annually, as well as on an interim basis to the extent that factors or indicators become apparent that could reduce the fair value of any of our businesses below book value. Impairment may result from significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired asset, negative industry or economic trends and significant underperformance relative to historic or projected operating results. If we determine that our goodwill and intangible assets have become impaired, we may incur impairment charges, which could negatively impact our operating results.\nCybersecurity threats or other security breaches could compromise sensitive information belonging to us or our customers and could harm our business and our reputation.\nWe store sensitive data, including intellectual property, proprietary business information and our customer and employee information. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions that could result in unauthorized disclosure or loss of sensitive data. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to networks, or to sabotage systems, change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Furthermore, in the operation of our business we also use third-party vendors that store certain sensitive data. Any security breach of our own or a third-party vendor\u2019s systems could cause us to be non-compliant with applicable laws or regulations, subject us to legal claims or proceedings, disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, any of which could adversely affect our business.\nOur corporate tax rate may increase, which could adversely impact our cash flow, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have significant operations in Israel, as well operations in the Republic of Ireland and France. A substantial portion of our taxable income historically has been generated in Israel, and starting in 2020, also in France. Currently, our Israeli and Irish subsidiaries are taxed at rates lower than the U.S. tax rates. Our French entity tax rate is 28% and higher than current U.S. tax rates. If our Israeli and Irish subsidiaries were no longer to qualify for these lower tax rates or if the applicable tax laws were rescinded or changed, our operating results could be materially adversely affected. Moreover, if U.S. or other authorities were to change applicable tax laws or successfully challenge the manner in which our subsidiaries\u2019 profits are currently recognized, our overall tax expenses could increase, and our business, cash flow, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Also our taxes on the Irish interest income may be double taxed both in Ireland and in the U.S. due to U.S. tax regulations and Irish tax restrictions on net operating losses to offset interest income. In addition, our Israeli interest income also may be taxed both in Israel and the U.S due to different Controlled Foreign Corporation rules.\nThe anti-takeover provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could prevent or discourage a third party from acquiring us.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may prevent or discourage a third party from acquiring us, even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders. Our board of directors also has the authority to fix the rights and preferences of shares of our preferred stock and to issue such shares without a stockholder vote. Our bylaws also place limitations on the authority to call a special meeting of stockholders. We have advance notice procedures for stockholders desiring to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring matters before an annual meeting of stockholders. In addition, these factors may also adversely affect the market price of our common stock, and the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock.\nOur stock price may be volatile so you may not be able to resell your shares of our common stock at or above the price you paid for them.\nAnnouncements of developments related to our business, announcements by competitors, quarterly fluctuations in our financial results, changes in the general conditions of the highly dynamic industry in which we compete or the national economies in which we do business, and other factors could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate, perhaps substantially. For example, if we fail to achieve our near term financial guidance or longer term 2022 strategic goals announced at our analysts day in January 2019, or fail to show overall business growth and expansion, our stock price may significantly decline. In addition, in recent years, the stock market has experienced extreme price fluctuations, which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies. These factors and fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 89572, "SIC": 6794, "TIC": "CEVA"}
