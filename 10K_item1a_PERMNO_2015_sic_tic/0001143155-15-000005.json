{"cik": "1143155", "company": "HAMPTON ROADS BANKSHARES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-25", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our Common Stock involves risks. You should carefully consider the risks described below in conjunction with the other information in this Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes, before investing in our Common Stock. In addition to the other information contained in this report, the following risks may affect us. This Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, including statements about our future plans, objectives, intentions, and expectations. Past results are not a reliable indicator of future results, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. Many factors, including those described below, could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in forward-looking statements.\nRisks Relating to our Business\nOur success is largely dependent on attracting and retaining key management team members.\nWe are a customer-focused and relationship-driven organization. Future growth is expected to be driven in large part by the relationships maintained with customers. While we have assembled an experienced and talented senior management team, maintaining this team, while at the same time developing other managers and/or attracting new talent in order that management succession can be achieved, is not assured. The unexpected loss of key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business and may result in lower revenues or reduced earnings.\nWe are not paying dividends on our Common Stock currently and absent regulatory approval are prevented from doing so. The failure to resume paying dividends on our Common Stock may adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock.\nWe paid cash dividends on our Common Stock prior to the third quarter of 2009. During the third quarter of 2009, we suspended dividend payments. Absent permission from the Virginia State Corporation Commission, BOHR may pay dividends to us only to the extent of positive accumulated retained earnings. The retained deficit of BOHR, our principal banking subsidiary, was $455.9 million as of December 31, 2014. It is unlikely in the foreseeable future that we would be able to pay dividends if BOHR cannot pay dividends to us. As a result, there is no assurance if or when we will be able to resume paying cash dividends.\nIn addition, all dividends are declared and paid at the discretion of our Board of Directors and are dependent upon our liquidity, financial condition, results of operations, regulatory capital requirements, and such other factors as our Board of Directors may deem relevant. The ability of our banking subsidiaries to pay dividends to us is also limited by obligations to maintain sufficient capital and by other general restrictions on dividends that are applicable to our banking subsidiaries. If we do not satisfy these regulatory requirements, we are unable to pay dividends on our Common Stock.\nWe incurred significant losses from 2009 to 2012. While we returned to profitability in 2013 and continued to be profitable during 2014, we can make no assurances that will continue. An inability to improve our profitability could adversely affect our operations and our capital levels.\nSince 2008, our loan customers have operated in an economically stressed environment. While broader economic conditions have begun to gradually improve, economic conditions in the markets in which we operate remain somewhat constrained. Consequently, the levels of loan delinquencies and defaults that we have experienced continue to be higher than historical levels and our net interest income, before the provision for loan losses, has not grown over this period.\nOur net income attributable to Hampton Roads Bankshares, Inc. was $9.3 million and $4.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, but our net loss attributable to Hampton Roads Bankshares, Inc. for the year ended December 31, 2012 was $25.1 million. There is no guarantee that we will be able to maintain this improvement in our net income. In addition to the risk that the broader economic conditions will stagnate or reverse their improvements, our mortgage banking earnings are particularly volatile due to their dependence upon the direction and level of mortgage interest rates.\nOur mortgage banking earnings are cyclical and sensitive to the level of interest rates, changes in economic conditions, decreased economic activity, and slowdowns in the housing market, any of which could adversely impact our results of operations.\nOur mortgage banking earnings are dependent upon our ability to originate loans and sell them to investors. Loan production levels are sensitive to changes in the level of interest rates and changes in economic conditions. A significant portion of increases in our mortgage banking earnings over the last few years was due to historically low interest rate environment that resulted in a high volume of mortgage loan refinancing activity. As the interest rate environment began to return to more typical levels, starting in late summer\nHAMPTON ROADS BANKSHARES, INC.\nof 2013 and continuing throughout 2014, mortgage loan refinancing activity was significantly reduced. Loan production levels may also suffer if we experience a slowdown in the local housing market or tightening credit conditions. Any sustained period of decreased activity caused by fewer refinancing transactions, higher interest rates, housing price pressure or loan underwriting restrictions would adversely affect our mortgage originations and, consequently, could significantly reduce our income from mortgage banking activities. As a result, these conditions would also adversely affect our results of operations.\nEconomic, market, or operational developments may negatively impact our ability to maintain required capital levels or otherwise negatively impact our financial condition.\nAt December 31, 2014, BOHR and Shore were classified as \u201cwell capitalized\u201d for regulatory capital purposes. However, impairments to our loan or securities portfolio, declines in our earnings or a combination of these or other factors could change our capital position in a relatively short period of time. If BOHR or Shore is unable to remain \u201cwell capitalized,\u201d it will not be able to renew or accept brokered deposits without prior regulatory approval or offer interest rates on deposit accounts that are significantly higher than the average rates in its market area. As a result, it would be more difficult for us to attract new deposits as our existing brokered deposits mature and do not rollover and to retain or increase non-brokered deposits. If we are not able to attract new deposits, our ability to fund our loan portfolio may be adversely affected. In addition, any negative impact to our capital position may cause the Banks to have to pay higher insurance premiums to the FDIC, which will reduce our earnings.\nVirginia law and the provisions of our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws could deter or prevent takeover attempts by a potential purchaser of our Common Stock that would be willing to pay you a premium for your shares of our Common Stock.\nOur Articles of Incorporation, as well as the Company\u2019s Bylaws (the \u201cBylaws\u201d), contain provisions that may be deemed to have the effect of discouraging or delaying uninvited attempts by third parties to gain control of the Company. These provisions include the ability of our board to set the price, term, and rights of, and to issue, one or more series of our preferred stock. Our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws do not provide for the ability of stockholders to call special meetings.\nSimilarly, the Virginia Stock Corporation Act contains provisions designed to protect Virginia corporations and employees from the adverse effects of hostile corporate takeovers. These provisions reduce the possibility that a third party could affect a change in control without the support of our incumbent directors. These provisions may also strengthen the position of current management by restricting the ability of shareholders to change the composition of the board, to affect its policies generally, and to benefit from actions that are opposed by the current board.\nOur ability to maintain adequate sources of funding and liquidity may be negatively impacted by the economic environment which may, among other things, impact our ability to resume the payment of dividends or satisfy our obligations.\nThe management of liquidity risk is critical to the management of our business and to our ability to service our customer base. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities on terms which are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry or economy in general. In managing our balance sheet, a primary source of funding is customer deposits. Our ability to continue to attract these deposits and other funding sources is subject to variability based upon a number of factors including volume and volatility in the securities markets and the relative interest rates that we are prepared to pay for these liabilities. Our potential inability to maintain adequate sources of funding may, among other things, impact our ability to resume the payment of dividends or satisfy our obligations.\nAn inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of investments or loans, the issuance of equity and debt securities, and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity. Factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include operating losses; rising levels of non-performing assets; a decrease in the level of our business activity as a result of a downturn in the markets in which our loans or deposits are concentrated or as a result of a loss of confidence in us by our customers, lenders, and/or investors; or adverse regulatory action against us. Our ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us, such as a disruption in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial industry.\nThe availability and level of deposits and other funding sources, including borrowings and the issuance of equity and debt securities, is highly dependent upon the perception of the liquidity and creditworthiness of the financial institution, and such perception can change quickly in response to market conditions or circumstances unique to a particular company. Concerns about our financial condition or concerns about our credit exposure to other persons could adversely impact our sources of liquidity, financial position, regulatory capital ratios, results of operations, and our business prospects.\nHAMPTON ROADS BANKSHARES, INC.\nOur future success is dependent on our ability to compete effectively in the highly competitive banking industry.\nWe face vigorous competition from other banks and other financial institutions, including savings and loan associations, savings banks, finance companies, and credit unions for deposits, loans, and other financial services that serve our market area. A number of these banks and other financial institutions are significantly larger than we are and have substantially greater access to capital and other resources, as well as larger lending limits and branch systems, and offer a wider array of banking services. Many of our non-bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations that govern us. As a result, these non-bank competitors have advantages over us in providing certain services. While we believe we compete effectively with these other financial institutions serving our primary markets, we may face a competitive disadvantage to larger institutions. If we have to raise interest rates paid on deposits or lower interest rates charged on loans to compete effectively, our net interest margin and income could be negatively affected. Failure to compete effectively to attract new, or to retain existing, clients may reduce or limit our margins and our market share and may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, growth, and the market price of our Common Stock.\nSales, or the perception that sales could occur, of large amounts of our Common Stock by our institutional investors may depress our stock price.\nThe market price of our Common Stock could drop if our existing shareholders decide to sell their shares. As of December 31, 2014, Anchorage, CapGen, and Carlyle owned 24.86%, 29.91%, and 24.86%, respectively, of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock. Pursuant to the various definitive investment agreements that we have entered into with these shareholders, the Company has an effective registration statement covering the resale of shares of our Common Stock by each of the shareholders listed above. These shareholders could utilize this registration statement by reselling the shares of our Common Stock they currently hold. If any of these shareholders sell large amounts of our Common Stock, or other investors perceive such sales to be imminent, the market price of our Common Stock could drop significantly. In addition, sale of our Common Stock by Anchorage, CapGen, and Carlyle could adversely impact our ability to realize certain deferred tax benefits relating to prior losses, thereby increasing our effective tax rate in the future.\nThe concentration of our loan portfolio continues to be in real estate - commercial mortgage, equity line lending, and construction, which may expose us to greater risk of loss.\nOur business strategy centers, in part, on offering real estate - commercial mortgage and equity line loans secured by real estate in order to generate interest income. These types of loans generally have higher yields due to an elevated risk profile compared to traditional one-to-four family residential mortgage loans. At December 31, 2014 real estate - commercial mortgage and equity line lending totaled $639.2 million and $128.3 million, respectively. These loan categories combined represented 53.9% of total loans. Such loans increase our credit risk profile relative to other financial institutions that have lower concentrations of real estate - commercial mortgage and equity line loans.\nLoans secured by real estate - commercial mortgage properties are generally for larger amounts than one-to-four family residential mortgage loans. Payments on loans secured by these properties generally are dependent on the income produced by the underlying properties which, in turn, depends on the successful operation and management of the properties. Accordingly, repayment of these loans is subject to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the local economy. While we seek to minimize these risks in a variety of ways, there can be no assurance that these measures will protect against credit-related losses.\nEquity line lending allows a customer to access an amount up to their line of credit for the term specified in their agreement. At the expiration of the term of an equity line, a customer may have the entire principal balance outstanding as opposed to a one-to-four family residential mortgage loan where the principal is disbursed entirely at closing and amortizes throughout the term of the loan. We cannot predict when and to what extent our customers will access their equity lines. While we seek to minimize this risk in a variety of ways, including attempting to employ conservative underwriting criteria, there can be no assurance that these measures will protect against credit-related losses.\nOur loan portfolio contains loans used to finance construction and land development. Construction financing typically involves a higher degree of credit risk than financing on improved, owner-occupied real estate. Risk of loss on a construction loan is largely dependent upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the property\u2019s value at completion of construction, the marketability of the property, and the bid price and estimated cost (including interest) of construction. If the estimate of construction costs proves to be inaccurate, we may be required to advance funds beyond the amount originally committed to permit completion of the project. If the estimate of the value proves to be inaccurate, we may be confronted, at or prior to the maturity of the loan, with a project whose value is insufficient to assure full repayment. When lending to builders, the cost of construction breakdown is provided by the\nHAMPTON ROADS BANKSHARES, INC.\nbuilder, as well as supported by the appraisal. Although our underwriting criteria were designed to evaluate and minimize the risks of each construction loan, there can be no guarantee that these practices will have safeguarded against material delinquencies and losses to our operations.\nAt December 31, 2014 we had loans of $137.0 million or 9.6% of total loans outstanding to finance construction and land development. Construction and land development loans are dependent on the successful completion of the projects they finance, however, in many cases such construction and development projects in our primary market areas are not being completed in a timely manner, if at all. A portion of our residential and real estate - commercial mortgage lending is secured by vacant or unimproved land. Loans secured by vacant or unimproved land are generally more risky than loans secured by improved property for one-to-four family residential mortgage loans. Since vacant or unimproved land is generally held by the borrower for investment purposes or future use, payments on loans secured by vacant or unimproved land will typically rank lower in priority to the borrower than a loan the borrower may have on their primary residence or business. These loans are more susceptible to adverse conditions in the real estate market and local economy.\nGeneral economic conditions in the markets in which we do business may decline and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe local economies where the Company does business are heavily reliant on military spending and may be adversely impacted by significant cuts to such spending that might result from recent Congressional budgetary enactments. Real estate values are affected by various factors in addition to local economic conditions, including, among other things, changes in general or regional economic conditions, government rules or policies, and natural disasters. With 95.8% of our loans concentrated in the regions of Hampton Roads, Richmond, the Eastern Shore of Virginia, and the Research Triangle and Northeast North Carolina regions, a decline in local economic conditions could adversely affect the value of the real estate collateral securing our loans. A decline in property values could diminish our ability to recover on defaulted loans by selling the real estate collateral, making it more likely that we would suffer additional losses on defaulted loans and/or foreclosed properties by requiring additions to our allowance for loan losses through increased provisions for loan losses. Also, a decline in local economic conditions may have a greater effect on our earnings and capital than on the earnings and capital of financial institutions whose real estate portfolios are more geographically diverse. While our policy is to obtain updated appraisals on a periodic basis, there are no assurances that we may be able to realize the amount indicated in the appraisal upon disposition of the underlying property. We take into account all available information in assessing the fair value of other real estate owned and repossessed assets, including pending offers, recent appraisals, and other indicators. However, differences may exist between our estimate of fair value and the amount we ultimately realize upon sale, and such differences could be material.\nWe have had large numbers of problem loans, relative to our peers. Although problem loans have declined significantly, there is no assurance that they will continue to do so.\nOur non-performing assets ratio, defined as the ratio of loans 90 days past due and still accruing interest plus nonaccrual loans plus other real estate owned and repossessed assets to gross loans plus loans held for sale plus other real estate owned and repossessed assets was 2.95% and 5.29% at December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively. On December 31, 2014, 0.64% of our loans was 30 to 89 days delinquent and treated as performing assets. The administration of non-performing loans is an important function in attempting to mitigate any future losses related to our non-performing assets.\nThe determination of the appropriate balance of our allowance for loan losses is merely an estimate of the inherent risk of loss in our existing loan portfolio and may prove to be incorrect. If such estimate is proven to be materially incorrect and we are required to increase our allowance for loan losses, our results of operations, financial condition, and the market price of our Common Stock could be materially adversely affected.\nWe maintain an allowance for loan losses, which is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged to our expenses that represents management\u2019s best estimate of probable losses within our existing portfolio of loans. Our allowance for loan losses was $27.1 million at December 31, 2014, which represented 1.90% of our total loans, as compared to $35.0 million, or 2.53% of total loans, at December 31, 2013. The level of the allowance reflects management\u2019s estimates and judgments as to specific credit risks, evaluation of industry concentrations, loan loss experience, current loan portfolio quality, present economic, political, and regulatory conditions, and incurred but unidentified losses inherent in the current loan portfolio. For further discussion on the impact continued weak economic conditions have on the collateral underlying our loan portfolio, see above section \u201cGeneral economic conditions in the markets in which we do business may decline and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\u201d\nHAMPTON ROADS BANKSHARES, INC.\nThe determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires management to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes. In addition, regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the estimated losses of loans. Such agencies may require us to recognize additional losses based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination. Furthermore, certain proposed changes to GAAP, if implemented as proposed, may require us to increase our estimate for losses embedded in our loan portfolio, resulting in an adverse impact to our results of operations and level of regulatory capital. Accordingly, the allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover loan losses or significant increases to the allowance for loan losses may be required in the future if economic conditions should worsen. Any such increases in the allowance for loan losses may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and the market price of our Common Stock.\nOur profitability will be jeopardized if we are unable to successfully manage interest rate risk.\nOur profitability depends in substantial part upon the spread between the interest rates earned on investments and loans and the interest rates paid on deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities. These rates are normally in line with general market rates and rise and fall based on management\u2019s view of our needs. Changes in interest rates will affect our operating performance and financial condition in diverse ways including the prices of securities, loans and deposits, and the volume of loan originations in our mortgage banking business, and could result in decreases to our earnings. Our net interest income will be adversely affected if market interest rates change so that the interest we pay on deposits and borrowings increases faster than the interest we earn on loans and investments. This could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on the market price of our Common Stock.\nWe may face increasing deposit-pricing pressures, which may, among other things, reduce our profitability.\nDeposit pricing pressures may result from competition as well as changes to the interest rate environment. Under current conditions, pricing pressures also may arise from depositors who demand premium interest rates from what they perceive to be a troubled financial institution. There is intense competition for deposits. The competition has had an impact on interest rates paid to attract deposits as well as fees charged on deposit products. In addition to the competitive pressures from other depository institutions, we face heightened competition from non-depository financial products such as securities and other alternative investments.\nFurthermore, technology and other market changes have made it more convenient for bank customers to transfer funds for investing purposes. Bank customers also have greater access to deposit vehicles that facilitate spreading deposit balances among different depository institutions to maximize FDIC insurance coverage. In addition to competitive forces, we also are at risk from market forces as they affect interest rates. It is not uncommon when interest rates transition from a low interest rate environment to a rising rate environment for deposit and other funding costs to rise in advance of yields on earning assets. In order to keep deposits required for funding purposes, it may be necessary to raise deposit rates without commensurate increases in asset pricing in the short term. Finally, we may see interest rate pricing pressure from depositors concerned about our financial condition and levels of non-performing assets.\nWe face a variety of threats from technology-based frauds and scams.\nFinancial institutions are a prime target of criminal activities through various channels of information technology. We attempt to mitigate risk from such activities through policies, procedures, and preventative and detective measures. Although the Company devotes significant resources to maintain and regularly upgrade its systems and processes that are designed to protect the security of the Company\u2019s computer systems, software, networks and other technology assets, as well as its intellectual property, and the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information belonging to the Company and its customers, the Company\u2019s security measures do not provide absolute security.\nIn fact, many financial services institutions, retailers and other companies engaged in data processing have reported breaches in the security of their websites or other systems, some of which have involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information, destroy data, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems, often through the introduction of computer viruses or malware, cyber-attacks and other means.\nThird parties with which the Company does business or that facilitate its business activities, including exchanges, clearinghouses, payment and ATM networks, financial intermediaries or vendors that provide services or technology solutions for the Company\u2019s operations, could also be sources of operational and security risks to the Company, including with respect to breakdowns or failures of their systems, misconduct by their employees or cyber-attacks that could affect their ability to deliver a product or service to the Company or result in lost or compromised information of the Company or its customers.\nHAMPTON ROADS BANKSHARES, INC.\nWhile we maintain insurance coverage designed to provide a level of financial protection to our business risks posed by business interruption, fraud losses, business recovery expenses, and other potential losses or expenses that may be experienced from a significant event are not readily predictable and, therefore, could have an impact on our results of operations.\nOur operations and customers might be affected by the occurrence of a natural disaster or other catastrophic event in our market area.\nBecause a substantial portion of our loans are with customers and businesses located in the central and coastal portions of Virginia, North Carolina, and Maryland, catastrophic events, including natural disasters such as hurricanes which have historically struck the east coast of the United States with some regularity, or terrorist attacks, could disrupt our operations. Any of these natural disasters or other catastrophic events could have a negative impact on our financial centers and customer base as well as collateral values and the strength of our loan portfolio. Any natural disaster or catastrophic event affecting us could have a material adverse impact on our operations and the market price of our Common Stock.\nRisks Relating to Market, Legislative, and Regulatory Events\nOur business, financial condition, and results of operations are highly regulated and could be adversely affected by new or changed regulations and by the manner in which such regulations are applied by regulatory authorities.\nCurrent economic conditions, particularly in the financial markets, have resulted in government regulatory agencies placing increased focus and scrutiny on the financial services industry. The U.S. Government has intervened on an unprecedented scale, responding to what has been commonly referred to as the financial crisis. Compliance with increased government regulation may significantly increase our costs, impede the efficiency of our internal business processes, require us to increase our regulatory capital, and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities in an efficient manner. The increased costs associated with anticipated regulatory and political scrutiny could adversely impact our results of operations.\nNew proposals for legislation continue to be introduced in the U.S. Congress that could further substantially increase regulation of the financial services industry. Federal and state regulatory agencies also frequently adopt changes to their regulations and/or change the manner in which existing regulations are applied. We cannot predict whether any pending or future legislation will be adopted or the substance and impact of any such new legislation on us. Additional regulation could affect us in a substantial way and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nBanking regulators have broad enforcement power, but regulations are meant to protect depositors and not investors.\nWe are subject to supervision by several governmental regulatory agencies. The regulators\u2019 interpretation and application of relevant regulations are beyond our control, may change rapidly and unpredictably, and can be expected to influence our earnings and growth. In addition, if we do not comply with regulations that are applicable to us, we could be subject to regulatory penalties, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAll such government regulations may limit our growth and the return to our investors by restricting activities such as the payment of dividends, mergers with, or acquisitions by, other institutions, investments, loans and interest rates, interest rates paid on deposits, the use of brokered deposits, and the creation of financial centers. Although these regulations impose costs on us, they are intended to protect depositors. The regulations to which we are subject may not always be in the best interests of investors.\nThe fiscal, monetary, and regulatory policies of the Federal Government and its agencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe Federal Reserve regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States. Its policies determine, in large part, the cost of funds for lending and investing and the return earned on those loans and investments, both of which affect our net interest margin. It also can materially decrease the value of financial assets we hold, such as debt securities. Its policies also can adversely affect borrowers, potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans.\nIn addition, as a public company we are subject to securities laws and standards imposed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Because we are a relatively small company, the costs of compliance are disproportionate compared with much larger organizations. Continued growth of legal and regulatory compliance mandates could adversely affect our expenses, future results of operations, and the market price of our Common Stock. In addition, the government and regulatory authorities have the power to impose rules or other\nHAMPTON ROADS BANKSHARES, INC.\nrequirements, including requirements that we are unable to anticipate, that could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and the market price of our Common Stock.\nGovernment legislation and regulation may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOn July 21, 2010, President Obama signed the Dodd-Frank Act into law. The Dodd-Frank Act makes extensive changes to the laws regulating financial services firms and requires significant rule-making. In addition, the law mandates multiple studies, which could result in additional legislative or regulatory action. The Dodd-Frank Act has and will continue to have a broad impact on the financial services industry, including significant regulatory and compliance changes designed to improve supervision and oversight of and strengthen safety and soundness for the financial services sector. Many of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act have begun to be or will be implemented over the next few years and will be subject to further rule-making and the discretion of applicable regulatory bodies. Because the ultimate impact of the Dodd-Frank Act will depend on future regulatory rule-making and interpretation, we cannot predict the full effect of this legislation on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nAlthough management does not expect the Dodd-Frank Act to have a material adverse effect on the Company, it is not possible to predict at this time all the effects the Dodd-Frank Act will have on the Company and the rest of our industry. It is possible that the Company\u2019s interest expense could increase and deposit insurance premiums could change and steps may need to be taken to increase qualifying capital.\nOn June 6, 2012, the federal bank regulatory agencies issued a series of proposed rules to revise the risk-based and leverage capital requirements and the method for calculating risk-weighted assets to make them consistent with the agreements that were reached by the Basel Committee in Basel III. These federal bank regulatory agencies approved final rules on July 2, 2013. The rules apply to all depository institutions, top-tier bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $500.0 million or more, and top-tier savings and loan holding companies (\u201cbanking organizations\u201d). Although the final rules contain significant revisions from the proposed rules intended to provide relief to community banks, such as BOHR and Shore, many of the Basel III rules will apply to these institutions. Among other things, the rules establish a new common equity Tier 1 minimum capital requirement and a higher minimum Tier 1 capital requirement, changes in the treatment of unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities in the calculation of regulatory capital, and assigns higher risk weightings (150%) to exposures that are more than 90 days past due or are on nonaccrual status and certain commercial real estate facilities that finance the acquisition, development, or construction of real property. The rules also limit a banking organization\u2019s capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments if the banking organization does not hold a \u201ccapital conservation buffer\u201d consisting of a specified amount of common equity Tier 1 capital in addition to the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. For community banking organizations, the rules will be phased in beginning in 2015 and 2016. The Company has assessed the impact of this rule making on our capital and the amount of capital required to support our business, and has concluded that it is unlikely to adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nFor further discussion of these issues, see the \u201cGovernment Supervision and Regulation\u201d section found in Item 1 of this document.\nProposed and final regulations could restrict our ability to originate loans.\nThe CFPB has issued a rule designed to clarify how lenders can avoid legal liability under the Dodd-Frank Act, which would hold lenders accountable for ensuring a borrower\u2019s ability to repay a mortgage. Loans that meet this definition of \u201cqualified mortgage\u201d will be presumed to have complied with the new ability-to-repay standard. Under the CFPB\u2019s rule, a \u201cqualified mortgage\u201d loan must not contain certain specified features, including:\n\u2022\nexcessive upfront points and fees (those exceeding 3% of the total loan amount, less \u201cbona fide discount points\u201d for prime loans);\n\u2022\ninterest-only payments;\n\u2022\nnegative-amortization; and\n\u2022\nterms longer than 30 years.\nAlso, to qualify as a \u201cqualified mortgage,\u201d a borrower\u2019s total monthly debt-to-income ratio may not exceed 43%. Lenders must also verify and document the income and financial resources relied upon to qualify the borrower for the loan and underwrite the loan based on a fully amortizing payment schedule and maximum interest rate during the first five years, taking into account all applicable taxes, insurance and assessments. The CFPB\u2019s rule on qualified mortgages and similar rules could limit our ability to make certain\nHAMPTON ROADS BANKSHARES, INC.\ntypes of loans or loans to certain borrowers, or could make it more expensive and time-consuming to make these loans, which could limit our growth or profitability.\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.\nOur ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry, generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be liquidated at prices sufficient to recover the full amount of the financial instrument exposure due to us. There is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our results of operations and the value of, or market for, our Common Stock.", "PERMNO": 91431, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "XBKS"}
