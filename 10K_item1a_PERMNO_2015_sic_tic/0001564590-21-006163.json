{"cik": "1472787", "company": "First American Financial Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-17", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nThe following \u201crisk factors\u201d could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, operations, reputation, financial position or future financial performance. You should carefully consider each of the following risk factors and the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Company faces risks other than those listed here, including those that are unknown to the Company and others of which the Company may be aware but, at present, considers immaterial. Because of the following factors, as well as other variables affecting the Company\u2019s operating results, past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\nSTRATEGIC RISK FACTORS\n1.The Company\u2019s risk management framework could prove inadequate, which could adversely affect the Company\nThe Company\u2019s risk management framework is designed to identify, monitor and mitigate risks that could have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition or reputation. This framework includes departments or groups dedicated to enterprise risk management, information security, disaster recovery and other information technology-related risks, business continuity, legal and compliance, compensation structures and other human resources matters, vendor management and internal audit, among others. Many of the processes overseen by these departments function at the enterprise level, but many also function through, or rely to a certain degree upon, risk mitigation efforts in local operating groups. Similarly, with respect to the risks the Company assumes in the ordinary course of its business through the issuance of title insurance policies and the provision of related products and services, the Company employs localized as well as centralized risk mitigation efforts. These efforts include the implementation of underwriting policies and procedures, automated risk-decisioning tools and other mechanisms for assessing and managing risk. Underwriting title insurance policies and making other risk-assumption decisions frequently involves a substantial degree of individual judgment and, accordingly, underwriters are maintained at the state, regional, divisional, and corporate levels with varying degrees of underwriting authority. These individuals may be encouraged by customers or others to assume risks or to expeditiously make risk determinations. If the Company\u2019s risk mitigation efforts prove inadequate, the Company could be adversely affected.\n2.The Company is pursuing various innovative initiatives, which could result in increased title claims or otherwise adversely affect the Company\nIn an effort to speed the delivery of its products, increase efficiency, improve quality, improve the customer experience and decrease risk, the Company is increasingly utilizing innovative technologies, processes and techniques in the creation of its products and services. These efforts include streamlining the closing process by converting certain manual processes into automated ones, which the Company believes will improve the customer experience by simplifying and reducing the time it takes to close a transaction, reducing risk and improving communication. The Company increasingly is employing advanced technologies to automate various processes, including various processes related to the building, maintaining and updating of title plants and other data assets, as well as the search and examination of information in connection with the issuance of title insurance policies. As a result of the recent reduction in interest rates in connection with the coronavirus pandemic, the Company has experienced a significant increase in refinance orders. To facilitate the processing of these orders, the Company has expanded the use of certain of these advanced technologies. Risks from these and other innovative initiatives include those associated with potential defects in the design and development of the technologies used to automate processes, misapplication of technologies, the reliance on data that may prove inadequate, and failure to meet customer expectations, among others. As a result of these risks, the Company could experience increased claims, reputational damage or other adverse effects, which could be material to the Company.\n3.Potentially disruptive innovation in the real estate industry and/or the Company\u2019s participation in these efforts could adversely affect the Company\nIn addition to the Company\u2019s innovative activities, other participants in the real estate industry are seeking to innovate in ways that could adversely impact the Company\u2019s businesses. These participants include certain of the Company\u2019s sources of business, competitors and ultimate customers. Innovations by these participants may change the demand for the Company\u2019s products and services, the manner in which the Company\u2019s products and services are ordered or fulfilled and the revenue or profitability derived from the products and services. The Company has made and will likely continue to make high-risk, illiquid investments in some of these participants, typically during their early- and growth-stages. If any of these companies do not succeed, the Company could lose and/or be required to impair all or part of its investment in the unsuccessful company. The risk of such impairment is generally greater during periods of economic uncertainty, such as that currently being experienced in the United States. The prospects of these investments also depend on a number of factors in addition to the condition of the general economy, including the general availability of capital, the performance of and volatility in the public markets, the condition of the real estate industry, the competitive environment for such participants and the operational and financial performance of such participants. These investments could also facilitate efforts that ultimately disrupt the Company\u2019s business or enable competitors. Accordingly, the Company\u2019s efforts to anticipate and participate in these transformations could require significant additional investment and management attention and may not succeed. These innovative efforts by third parties, and the manner in which the Company, its agents and other industry participants respond to them, could therefore have an adverse effect on the Company.\n4.The coronavirus pandemic and the responses thereto could adversely affect the Company\nThe coronavirus pandemic and responses to it have created significant volatility, uncertainty and disruption in the broader economy. The extent to which the coronavirus pandemic impacts the Company\u2019s business, operations and financial results will depend on numerous factors that the Company may not be able to accurately predict, including: the duration and scope of the pandemic and restrictions and responses to it; governmental, business and individual actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic; the ongoing impact of the pandemic on economic activity and actions taken in response, including the efficacy of governmental relief efforts; the availability and efficacy of vaccines; the effect on participants in real estate transactions and the demand for the Company\u2019s products and services, including as a result of higher unemployment, business closures and economic uncertainty; and the Company\u2019s ability to sell and provide, or its efficiency in selling and providing, its services and solutions, including as a result of illness, travel restrictions, governmental closure orders and partial or full closures of business and government offices. For example, in the second and third quarters of 2020, the Company experienced a decrease in the number of opened commercial orders relative to the same periods of the prior year, and experienced a decrease in the number of opened residential purchase orders early in the pandemic. The Company also experienced increased volatility in the Company\u2019s investment portfolio early in the pandemic. The Company is also taking certain underwriting risks that could result in increased claims. In addition, the Company has made changes to certain of its production processes that also could result in increased claims. While the Company is unable to predict the ultimate impact the coronavirus pandemic and related responses will have on its businesses, these events adversely affected the Company early in the pandemic, and still could adversely affect, its business and results of operations and, if prolonged, could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition. The impacts of the coronavirus pandemic may also exacerbate the risks discussed elsewhere in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report.\nOPERATIONAL RISK FACTORS\n5.\nConditions in the real estate market generally impact the demand for a substantial portion of the Company\u2019s products and services and the Company\u2019s claims experience\nDemand for a substantial portion of the Company\u2019s products and services generally decreases as the number of real estate transactions in which its products and services are purchased decreases. The number of real estate transactions in which the Company\u2019s products and services are purchased decreases in the following situations, among others:\n\u2022\nwhen mortgage interest rates are high or rising;\n\u2022\nwhen the availability of credit, including commercial and residential mortgage funding, is limited; and\n\u2022\nwhen real estate affordability is declining.\nThese circumstances, particularly when combined with declining real estate values and the increase in foreclosures that often results therefrom, also tend to adversely impact the Company\u2019s title claims experience.\n6.\nUnfavorable economic conditions adversely affect the Company\nHistorically, uncertainty and negative trends in general economic conditions in the United States and abroad, including significant tightening of credit markets and a general decline in the value of real property, have created a difficult operating environment for the Company\u2019s core title and settlement businesses. Uncertainty and a deterioration in economic conditions in connection with the coronavirus pandemic adversely affected the Company early in the pandemic. These conditions also tend to negatively impact the amount of funds the Company receives from third parties to be held in trust pending the closing of commercial and residential real estate transactions. The Company deposits a substantial portion of these funds, as well as its own funds, with the federal savings bank it owns. The Company\u2019s bank invests those funds and any realized losses incurred on those investments will be reflected in the Company\u2019s consolidated results. The likelihood of such losses, which generally would not occur if the Company were to deposit these funds in an unaffiliated entity, increases when economic conditions are unfavorable. Moreover, during periods of unfavorable economic conditions, the return on these funds deposited at the Company\u2019s bank, as well as funds the Company deposits with third party financial institutions, tends to decline. Certain rules promulgated in connection with the coronavirus pandemic allow certain borrowers to request forbearance of the payment of their mortgages. In certain circumstances, if a borrower requests forbearance on a mortgage originated through the Company\u2019s warehouse lender before that mortgage is sold to a third party, the Company\u2019s warehouse lender may have to retain that loan. In addition, the Company holds investments in entities, such as title agencies and settlement service providers, some of which have been negatively impacted by these conditions, as well as other securities in its investment portfolio, which also may be, and recently have been, negatively impacted by these conditions. Depending upon the ultimate severity and duration of any economic downturn, the resulting effects on the Company could be materially adverse, including a significant reduction in revenues, earnings and cash flows, challenges to the Company\u2019s ability to satisfy covenants or otherwise meet its obligations under debt facilities, difficulties in obtaining access to capital, challenges to the Company\u2019s ability to pay dividends at currently anticipated levels, deterioration in the value of or return on its investments and increased credit risk from customers and others with obligations to the Company.\n7.\nClimate change, severe weather conditions, health crises and other catastrophe events could adversely affect the Company\nClimate change, global or extensive health crises, severe weather and other catastrophe events could adversely affect the Company. These include impacts on the results of the Company\u2019s property and casualty insurance business due to any increase in the frequency and severity of wildfires, hurricanes, floods, earthquakes or other catastrophe or severe weather events, as well as increased claims in the Company\u2019s home warranty business. Home warranty claims, including those pertaining to climate control units, tend to rise as temperatures become extreme, especially in geographies where extreme temperatures are infrequent, and as people spend more time at home, such as during the coronavirus pandemic. In addition, the Company manages its financial exposure for losses in its title insurance business and in its property and casualty insurance business with third-party reinsurance. Catastrophic events could adversely affect the cost and availability of that reinsurance. Moreover, to the extent climate change, health crises, severe weather conditions and other catastrophe events impact companies or municipalities whose securities the Company invests in, the value of its investment portfolio may also decrease due to these factors. In addition, these factors may impact real estate markets and the broader economy, which could also impact the Company. The frequency, severity, duration, and geographic location and scope of such health crises, catastrophe and severe whether events are inherently unpredictable, and, therefore, the Company is unable to predict the ultimate impact climate change and such events will have on its businesses.\n8.The Company may find it difficult to acquire necessary data\nCertain data used and supplied by the Company are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local regulatory authorities. Compliance with existing federal, state and local laws and regulations with respect to such data has not had a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations to date. Nonetheless, federal, state and local laws and regulations in the United States designed to protect the public from the misuse of personal information in the marketplace and adverse publicity or potential litigation concerning the commercial use of such information may affect the Company\u2019s operations and could result in substantial regulatory compliance expense, litigation expense and a loss of revenue. The suppliers of data to the Company face similar burdens. As a result of these and other factors, the Company may find it financially burdensome to acquire necessary data.\n9.Changes in the Company\u2019s relationships with large mortgage lenders or government-sponsored enterprises could adversely affect the Company\nLarge mortgage lenders and government-sponsored enterprises, because of their significant role in the mortgage process, have significant influence over the Company and other service providers. Changes in the Company\u2019s relationship with any of these lenders or government-sponsored enterprises, the loss of all or a portion of the business the Company derives from these parties, any refusal of these parties to accept the Company\u2019s products and services, the modification of the government-sponsored enterprises\u2019 requirement for title insurance in connection with mortgages they purchase or the use of alternatives to the Company\u2019s products and services, could have a material adverse effect on the Company.\n10.A downgrade by ratings agencies, reductions in statutory capital and surplus maintained by the Company\u2019s title insurance underwriters or a deterioration in other measures of financial strength could adversely affect the Company\nCertain of the Company\u2019s customers use measurements of the financial strength of the Company\u2019s title insurance underwriters, including, among others, ratings provided by ratings agencies and levels of statutory capital and surplus maintained by those underwriters, in determining the amount of a policy they will accept and the amount of reinsurance required. Each of the major ratings agencies currently rates the Company\u2019s title insurance operations. The Company\u2019s principal title insurance underwriter\u2019s financial strength ratings are \u201cA2\u201d by Moody\u2019s Investor Services, Inc., \u201cA\u201d by Fitch Ratings, Inc., \u201cA-\u201d by Standard & Poor\u2019s Ratings Services and \u201cA\u201d by A.M. Best Company, Inc. These ratings provide the agencies\u2019 perspectives on the financial strength, operating performance and cash generating ability of those operations. These agencies continually review these ratings and the ratings are subject to change. Statutory capital and surplus, or the amount by which statutory assets exceed statutory liabilities, is also a measure of financial strength. The Company\u2019s principal title insurance underwriter maintained $1.5 billion of total statutory capital and surplus as of December 31, 2020. Accordingly, if the ratings or statutory capital and surplus of these title insurance underwriters are reduced from their current levels, or if there is a deterioration in other measures of financial strength, the Company\u2019s results of operations, competitive position and liquidity could be adversely affected.\n11.The issuance of the Company\u2019s title insurance policies and related activities by title agents, which operate with substantial independence from the Company, could adversely affect the Company\nThe Company\u2019s title insurance subsidiaries issue a significant portion of their policies through title agents that operate largely independent of the Company. There is no guarantee that these title agents will fulfill their contractual obligations to the Company, which contracts include limitations that are designed to limit the Company\u2019s risk with respect to their activities. In addition, regulators are increasingly seeking to hold the Company responsible for the actions of these title agents and, under certain circumstances, the Company may be held liable directly to third parties for actions (including defalcations) or omissions of these agents. Case law in certain states also suggests that the Company is liable for the actions or omissions of its agents in those states, regardless of contractual limitations. As a result, the Company\u2019s use of title agents could result in increased claims on the Company\u2019s policies issued through agents and an increase in other costs and expenses.\n12.Systems damage, failures, interruptions, cyberattacks and intrusions, and unauthorized data disclosures by the Company or its service providers may disrupt the Company\u2019s business, harm the Company\u2019s reputation, result in material claims for damages or otherwise adversely affect the Company\nThe Company uses computer systems and other technologies (collectively referred to as \u201csystems\u201d), some of which it owns and manages and some of which are owned and/or managed by third parties, including providers of distributed computing infrastructure platforms commonly known as the \u201ccloud.\u201d The Company and its agents, suppliers, service providers, and customers use these systems to receive, process, store and transmit business information, including non-public personal information as well as data from suppliers and other information upon which the Company\u2019s business relies. The Company also uses these systems to manage substantial cash, investment assets, bank deposits, trust assets and escrow account balances on behalf of itself and its customers, among other activities. Many of the Company\u2019s products, services and solutions involving the use of real property related data are fully reliant on these systems and are only available electronically. Accordingly, for a variety of reasons, the integrity of these systems and the protection of the information that resides thereon are critically important to the Company\u2019s successful operation.\nThese systems have been subject to, and are likely to continue to be the target of, computer viruses, cyberattacks, phishing attacks and other malicious activity. These attacks have increased in frequency and sophistication, including in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. The Company\u2019s employees working remotely are more susceptible to social engineering attacks, intrusions and other malicious activity, and this risk has increased given that a substantial number of the Company\u2019s employees are working from home as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. The Company\u2019s applications and infrastructure also have known and unknown vulnerabilities. Once identified, the Company\u2019s information technology and information security personnel seek to remediate these vulnerabilities based on the level of risk presented. For a number of reasons, including the introduction of new vulnerabilities, resource constraints, competing business demands and dependence on third parties, a number of unremediated vulnerabilities will always exist. Remediation of some vulnerabilities are outside of the control of the Company and third-party remediation efforts may not be timely provided or implemented, even when the level of risk is critical or high. Further, certain other potential causes of system damage or other negative system-related events are wholly or partially beyond the Company\u2019s control, such as natural disasters, vendor failures to satisfy service level requirements and power or telecommunications failures. These circumstances could expose the Company to system-related damages, failures, interruptions, cyberattacks and other negative events or could otherwise disrupt the Company\u2019s business and could also result in the loss or unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring or destruction of confidential, proprietary and other information pertaining to the Company, its customers, employees, agents or suppliers.\nIn conducting its business and delivering its products and services, the Company also utilizes service providers. These service providers and the systems they utilize are typically subject to similar types of system- and information security-related risks that the Company faces. The Company provides certain of these service providers with data, including nonpublic personal information. There is no guarantee that the Company\u2019s due diligence or ongoing vendor oversight will be sufficient to ensure the integrity and security of the systems utilized by these service providers or the protection of the information that resides thereon. Adverse consequences for the Company in the event of a significant event involving the systems of its service providers or the information residing thereon include, among others, delays in the delivery of the Company\u2019s products and services, direct or indirect financial loss, loss of business and reputational damage.\nDuring the third quarter of 2019, the Company concluded an investigation regarding unauthorized access to non-public personal information as a result of a vulnerability in one of the Company\u2019s applications. The investigation identified imaged documents containing non-public personal information pertaining to 32 consumers that likely were accessed without authorization. These 32 consumers were notified and offered complimentary credit monitoring services. This incident triggered numerous federal and state governmental inquiries as well as private lawsuits against the Company. While the incident is not expected to have a material impact on the Company\u2019s business, it increases the risk associated with any future incidents, particularly the risk of damage to the Company\u2019s reputation.\nCertain laws and contracts the Company has entered into require it to notify various parties, including consumers or customers, in the event of certain actual or potential data breaches or systems failures, including those of the Company\u2019s service providers. These notifications can result, among other things, in the loss of customers, lawsuits, adverse publicity, diversion of management\u2019s time and energy, the attention of regulatory authorities, fines and disruptions in sales. Further, the Company\u2019s financial institution customers have obligations to safeguard their systems and sensitive information and the Company may be bound contractually and/or by regulation to comply with the same requirements. If the Company or its service providers fail to comply with applicable regulations and contractual requirements, the Company could be exposed to lawsuits, governmental proceedings or the imposition of fines, among other consequences.\nAny inability to prevent or adequately respond to the issues described above could disrupt the Company\u2019s business, inhibit its ability to retain existing customers or attract new customers, otherwise harm its reputation and/or result in financial losses, litigation, increased costs or other adverse consequences that could be material to the Company.\n13.Errors and fraud involving the transfer of funds may adversely affect the Company\nThe Company relies on its systems, employees and domestic and international banks to transfer its own funds and the funds of third parties. In addition to relying on third-party banks to transfer these funds, the Company\u2019s federal savings bank subsidiary transfers funds on behalf of the Company as well as title agents that are not affiliates of the Company. These transfers are susceptible to user input error, fraud, system interruptions, incorrect processing and similar errors that from time to time result in lost funds or delayed transactions. The Company\u2019s email and computer systems and systems used by its agents, customers and other parties involved in a transaction have been subject to, and are likely to continue to be the target of, fraudulent attacks, including attempts to cause the Company or its agents to improperly transfer funds. These attacks have increased in frequency and sophistication. Funds transferred to a fraudulent recipient are often not recoverable. In certain instances the Company may be liable for those unrecovered funds. The controls and procedures used by the Company to prevent transfer errors and fraud may prove inadequate, resulting in financial losses, reputational harm, loss of customers or other adverse consequences which could be material to the Company.\n14.The Company\u2019s use of a global workforce involves risks that could adversely affect the Company\nThe Company utilizes lower cost labor in countries such as India and the Philippines, among others. These countries are subject to relatively high degrees of political and social instability and may lack the infrastructure to withstand natural disasters, health crises and other catastrophe events. Such disruptions could decrease efficiency and increase the Company\u2019s costs, which the Company has experienced during the coronavirus pandemic. Weakness of the United States dollar in relation to the currencies used in these countries may also reduce the savings achievable through this strategy. Furthermore, the practice of utilizing labor based in other countries is subject to heightened scrutiny in the United States and, as a result, the Company could face pressure to decrease its use of labor based outside the United States. Laws or regulations that require the Company to use labor based in the United States or effectively increase the Company\u2019s labor costs abroad also could be enacted. The Company may not be able to pass on these increased costs to its customers.\nLEGAL AND COMPLIANCE RISK FACTORS\n15.Regulatory oversight and changes in government regulation could require the Company to raise capital, make it more difficult to deploy capital, including dividends to shareholders and repurchases of the Company\u2019s shares, prohibit or limit the Company\u2019s operations, make it more costly or burdensome to conduct such operations or result in decreased demand for the Company\u2019s products and services\nMany of the Company\u2019s businesses, including its title insurance, property and casualty insurance, home warranty, banking, trust and wealth management businesses, are regulated by various federal, state, local and foreign governmental agencies. These and other of the Company\u2019s businesses also operate within statutory guidelines. The industry in which the Company operates and the markets into which it sells its products are also regulated and subject to statutory guidelines. In general, in recent years, the Company experienced increasing regulatory oversight and became subject to increasingly complex statutory guidelines. This is due, among other factors, to the passing of, and significant changes in, laws and regulations pertaining to privacy and data protection and to the Company\u2019s status as a savings and loan holding company.\nRegulatory oversight could require the Company to raise capital, and/or make it more difficult to deploy capital, including dividends to shareholders and repurchases of the Company\u2019s shares. For example, regulatory capital requirements for the Company have historically applied only at the subsidiary level, specifically to the Company\u2019s federal savings bank subsidiary and the Company\u2019s insurance underwriter subsidiaries. However, both the National Association of Insurance Commissioners and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System have issued proposals for group capital calculations. These proposals, if finalized and adopted in their current forms, would apply to the Company at the group level and would be in addition to existing subsidiary-level capital requirements. It is possible that the requirements, particularly in an economic downturn, could have the effect of requiring the Company to raise capital and/or making it more difficult to otherwise deploy capital, including dividends to shareholders and repurchases of the Company\u2019s shares.\nIn addition, changes in the applicable regulatory environment, statutory guidelines or interpretations of existing regulations or statutes, enhanced governmental oversight or efforts by governmental agencies to cause customers to refrain from using the Company\u2019s products or services could prohibit or limit its future operations or make it more costly or burdensome to conduct such operations or result in decreased demand for the Company\u2019s products and services or a change in its competitive position. The impact of these changes would be more significant if they involve jurisdictions in which the Company generates a greater portion of its title premiums, such as the states of Arizona, California, Florida, Michigan, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas. These changes may compel the Company to reduce its prices, may restrict its ability to implement price increases or acquire assets or businesses, may limit the manner in which the Company conducts its business or otherwise may have a negative impact on its ability to generate revenues, earnings and cash flows.\n16.Scrutiny of the Company\u2019s businesses and the industries in which it operates by governmental entities and others could adversely affect the Company\nThe real estate settlement services industry, an industry in which the Company generates a substantial portion of its revenue and earnings, is subject to continuous scrutiny by regulators, legislators, the media and plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys. Though often directed at the industry generally, these groups also focus their attention directly on the Company\u2019s businesses from time to time. In either case, this scrutiny may result in changes which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s operations and, therefore, its financial condition and liquidity.\nGovernmental entities have routinely inquired into certain practices in the real estate settlement services industry to determine whether certain of the Company\u2019s businesses or its competitors have violated applicable laws, which include, among others, the insurance codes of the various jurisdictions and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and similar state, federal and foreign laws. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (\u201cCFPB\u201d), for example, has actively utilized its regulatory authority over the mortgage and real estate markets by bringing enforcement actions against various participants in the mortgage and settlement industries and we expect that such enforcement activity will intensify. Departments of insurance in the various states, the CFPB and other federal regulators and applicable regulators in international jurisdictions, either separately or together, also periodically conduct targeted inquiries into the practices of title insurance companies and other settlement services providers in their respective jurisdictions. Currently, the Company is the subject of a number of regulatory inquiries.\nFurther, from time to time plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers have targeted, and are expected to continue to target, the Company and other members of the Company\u2019s industry with lawsuits claiming legal violations or other wrongful conduct. These lawsuits often involve large groups of plaintiffs and claims for substantial damages. These types of inquiries or proceedings have from time to time resulted, and may in the future result, in findings of a violation of the law or other wrongful conduct and the payment of fines or damages or the imposition of restrictions on the Company\u2019s conduct. This could impact the Company\u2019s operations and financial condition. Moreover, these laws and standards of conduct often are ambiguous and, thus, it may be difficult to ensure compliance. This ambiguity may force the Company to mitigate its risk by settling claims or by ending practices that generate revenues, earnings and cash flows. Currently the Company is a party to a number of class action lawsuits.\n17.\nRegulation of title insurance rates could adversely affect the Company\nTitle insurance rates are subject to extensive regulation, which varies from state to state. In many states the approval of the applicable state insurance regulator is required prior to implementing a rate change. These regulations could hinder the Company\u2019s ability to promptly adapt to changing market dynamics through price adjustments, which could adversely affect its results of operations, particularly in a rapidly declining market.\n18.Changes in certain laws and regulations, and in the regulatory environment in which the Company operates, could adversely affect the Company\nFederal and state officials are discussing various potential changes to laws and regulations that could impact the Company\u2019s businesses, including the reform of government-sponsored enterprises such as the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) and additional data privacy regulations, among others. Changes in these areas, and more generally in the regulatory environment in which the Company and its customers operate, could adversely impact the volume of mortgage originations in the United States and the Company\u2019s competitive position and results of operations. In addition, in connection with the coronavirus pandemic, the Company and generally its agents have been deemed in most areas an essential business and have been permitted to operate. A change in this determination, particularly in jurisdictions where the Company generates a large portion of its revenues, could adversely impact the Company\u2019s businesses.\n19.\nRecent and pending privacy and data protection laws and regulations could adversely affect the Company\nAn increasing number of federal, state, and international laws and regulations apply to the collection, use, retention, protection, disclosure, transfer, and other processing of personal data, including the California Consumer Privacy Act, the California Privacy Rights Act and the European Union General Data Protection Regulation. The effects of these privacy and data protection laws, including the cost of compliance and required changes in the manner in which the Company conducts its business, are not fully known and are potentially significant, and the failure to comply could adversely affect the Company. The Company has incurred costs to comply with these laws and to respond to inquiries about its compliance with them.\nFINANCIAL RISK FACTORS\n20.\nFailures at financial institutions at which the Company deposits funds could adversely affect the Company\nThe Company deposits substantial funds in financial institutions. These funds include amounts owned by third parties, such as escrow deposits and like-kind exchange deposits. Should one or more of the financial institutions at which deposits are maintained fail, there is no guarantee that the Company would recover the funds deposited, whether through Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation coverage or otherwise. In the event of any such failure, the Company also could be held liable for the funds owned by third parties.\n21.\nUnfavorable economic or other conditions could cause the Company to write off a portion of its goodwill and other intangible assets\nThe Company performs an impairment test of the carrying value of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets annually in the fourth quarter, or sooner if circumstances indicate a possible impairment. Finite-lived intangible assets are subject to impairment tests on a periodic basis. Factors that may be considered in connection with this review include, without limitation, underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, reductions in the Company\u2019s stock price and market capitalization, increased cost of capital and negative macroeconomic, industry and company-specific trends. These and other factors could lead to a conclusion that goodwill or other intangible assets are impaired, in which case the Company would be required to write off the portion believed to be impaired. In the third quarter of 2020, the Company committed to a plan to sell its property and casualty insurance business, which triggered goodwill and other intangible assets impairment tests. Based on the results of the impairment tests, the Company recorded pretax impairment losses to goodwill and other intangible assets of $34.2 million and $3.2 million, respectively, for the third quarter of 2020. Total goodwill and other intangible assets reflected on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020 are $1.6 billion. Any substantial goodwill and other intangible asset impairments that may be required could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\n22.\nUncertainty from the expected discontinuance of LIBOR and transition to any other interest rate benchmark may affect the Company\u2019s cost of capital and net investment income\nIn July 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021, which is expected to result in these widely used reference rates no longer being available. The Company has exposure to LIBOR-based financial instruments, such as LIBOR-based securities held in its investment portfolio. Borrowings under the Company\u2019s $700.0 million senior unsecured credit facility and some of its warehouse credit facilities also are LIBOR-based, although each allows for the use of an unspecified alternative benchmark rate if LIBOR is no longer available. Potential changes to LIBOR, as well as uncertainty related to such potential changes and the establishment of any alternative reference rate, may adversely affect the Company\u2019s cost of capital and the market for LIBOR-based securities, which could have an adverse impact on the earnings from or value of the Company\u2019s investment portfolio. At this time, the Company cannot predict the overall effect of the modification or discontinuation of LIBOR or the establishment of any alternative benchmark rate.\n23.\nThe Company\u2019s investment portfolio is subject to certain risks and could experience losses\nThe Company maintains a substantial investment portfolio, primarily consisting of fixed income debt securities. The investment portfolio also includes adjustable-rate debt securities, common and preferred stock, as well as money-market and other short-term investments. Securities in the Company\u2019s investment portfolio are subject to certain economic and financial market risks, such as credit risk, interest rate (including call, prepayment and extension) risk and/or liquidity risk. The risk of loss associated with the portfolio is increased during periods of instability in credit markets and economic conditions, including during the current pandemic. Debt and equity securities are carried at fair value on the Company\u2019s balance sheet. Changes in the fair value of debt securities is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income/loss on the balance sheet. For debt securities in an unrealized loss position, where the loss is determined to be due to credit-related factors, the Company records the loss in earnings. Changes in the fair value of equity securities are recognized in earnings. Changes in the fair value of securities in the Company\u2019s investment portfolio have had an adverse impact on the Company and could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations, statutory surplus, financial condition and cash flow.\n24.\nActual claims experience could materially vary from the expected claims experience reflected in the Company\u2019s reserve for incurred but not reported claims\nThe Company maintains a reserve for incurred but not reported (\u201cIBNR\u201d) claims pertaining to its title, escrow and other insurance and guarantee products. The majority of this reserve pertains to title insurance policies, which are long-duration contracts with the majority of the claims reported within the first few years following the issuance of the policy. Generally, 70% to 80% of claim amounts become known in the first six years of the policy life, and the majority of IBNR reserves relate to the six most recent policy years. Changes in expected ultimate losses and corresponding loss rates for recent policy years are considered likely and could result in a material adjustment to the IBNR reserves. Based on historical experience, management believes a 50 basis point change to the loss rates for recent policy years, positive or negative, is reasonably likely given the long duration nature of a title insurance policy. In uncertain economic times, such as those currently being experienced as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, an even larger change is more likely. As examples, if the expected ultimate losses for each of the last six policy years increased or decreased by 50 basis points, the resulting impact on the Company\u2019s IBNR reserve would be an increase or decrease, as the case may be, of $134.3 million, and if expected ultimate losses for those same years were to fluctuate by 100 basis points, the resulting impact would be $268.5 million. A material change in expected ultimate losses and corresponding loss rates for older policy years is also possible, particularly for policy years with loss ratios exceeding historical norms. The estimates made by management in determining the appropriate level of IBNR reserves could ultimately prove to be materially different from actual claims experience.\nChanges in laws or regulations impacting real estate, particularly when applied retroactively, may cause a material change in expected ultimate losses and corresponding loss rates for recent and/or older policy years. For example, the 2020 United States Supreme Court decision in McGirt v. Oklahoma calls into question the governing authority for certain real estate-related matters in Native American reservations once thought to have been disestablished. To the extent the Company, in those areas, underwrote title insurance policies or closed real estate transactions in conformity with authority that ultimately proves inapplicable, expected ultimate losses arising from those policies and transactions could change materially and could result in a material change to loss rates.\n25.\nAs a holding company, the Company depends on distributions from its subsidiaries, and if distributions from its subsidiaries are materially impaired, the Company\u2019s ability to declare and pay dividends may be adversely affected; in addition, insurance and other regulations limit the amount of dividends, loans and advances available from the Company\u2019s insurance subsidiaries\nThe Company is a holding company whose primary assets are investments in its operating subsidiaries. The Company\u2019s ability to pay dividends is dependent on the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends or repay funds. If the Company\u2019s operating subsidiaries are not able to pay dividends or repay funds, the Company may not be able to fulfill parent company obligations and/or declare and pay dividends to its stockholders. Moreover, pursuant to insurance and other regulations under which the Company\u2019s insurance subsidiaries operate, the amount of dividends, loans and advances available is limited. As of December 31, 2020, under such regulations, the maximum amount available in 2021 from these insurance subsidiaries, without prior approval from applicable regulators, was dividends of $555.4 million and loans and advances of $115.6 million.\nGENERAL RISK FACTORS\n26.\nCertain provisions of the Company\u2019s bylaws and certificate of incorporation may reduce the likelihood of any unsolicited acquisition proposal or potential change of control that the Company\u2019s stockholders might consider favorable\nThe Company\u2019s bylaws and certificate of incorporation contain provisions that could be considered \u201canti-takeover\u201d provisions because they make it harder for a third-party to acquire the Company without the consent of the Company\u2019s incumbent board of directors. Under these provisions:\n\u2022\nelection of the Company\u2019s board of directors is staggered such that only one-third of the directors are elected by the stockholders each year and the directors serve three year terms prior to reelection;\n\u2022\nstockholders may not remove directors without cause, change the size of the board of directors or, except as may be provided for in the terms of preferred stock the Company issues in the future, fill vacancies on the board of directors;\n\u2022\nstockholders may act only at stockholder meetings and not by written consent;\n\u2022\nstockholders must comply with advance notice provisions for nominating directors or presenting other proposals at stockholder meetings; and\n\u2022\nthe Company\u2019s board of directors may without stockholder approval issue preferred shares and determine their rights and terms, including voting rights, or adopt a stockholder rights plan.\nWhile the Company believes that they are appropriate, these provisions, which may only be amended by the affirmative vote of the holders of approximately 67% of the Company\u2019s issued voting shares, could have the effect of discouraging an unsolicited acquisition proposal or delaying, deferring or preventing a change of control transaction that might involve a premium price or otherwise be considered favorably by the Company\u2019s stockholders.", "PERMNO": 93374, "SIC": 6361, "TIC": "FAF"}
