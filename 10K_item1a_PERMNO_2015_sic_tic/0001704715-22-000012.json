{"cik": "1704715", "company": "Alpha Metallurgical Resources, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-07", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nSummary\nInvestment in our common stock is subject to various risks, including risks and uncertainties inherent in our business. As detailed in the following pages, these risks include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022Risks relating to our industry and the global economy, such as those associated with declines in coal prices, our ability to obtain financing and other services, competition, decreased demand for coal, Chinese governmental policies, loss of customers, customer creditworthiness and global economic disruptions.\n\u2022Risks relating to regulatory and legal developments, such as those associated with regulatory requirements and costs, climate change regulations, environmental laws and treaties, unfavorable tax actions, decreased demand for energy, environmental cleanup costs, permit approvals, maintenance of internal controls and healthcare regulations and costs.\n\u2022Risks relating to our operations, such as those associated with mining and other conditions, many of which are beyond our control, decreased demand for coal, the complexity of mining in Central Appalachia, disruptions in transportation services, the availability of skilled workers, product specification requirements, higher than estimated employee benefit, property reclamation or mine closure costs, the availability of coal reserves, unionization, cybersecurity, our dependence upon third parties and our ability to make capital investments.\n\u2022Risks relating to our liquidity, such as those associated with our indebtedness, our ability to obtain or renew surety bonds, limitations imposed on us by our credit facility, access to funds when needed and debt service.\n\u2022Risks relating to the ownership of our common stock, such as those associated with compliance with securities laws, the availability of an orderly trading market for our common stock, dilution or other effects resulting from the issuance of additional securities, impediments to our acquisition by a third party and limited fora for stockholder litigation matters.\nThese risks, and others, are reviewed in greater detail below. The realization of any of these risks could cause an investment in our securities to decline and result in a loss. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results.\nRisks Relating to Our Industry and the Global Economy\nDeclines in coal prices would adversely affect our revenues, operating results, cash flows, financial condition, stock price and the value of our coal reserves.\nOur results of operations are substantially dependent upon the prices we receive for our coal. Those prices depend upon factors beyond our control (some of which are described in more detail in other risk factors below), including but not limited to:\n\u2022the demand for domestic and foreign coal and coke, which depends significantly on the demand for steel and electricity;\n\u2022the price and availability of natural gas, other alternative fuels and alternative steel production technologies;\n\u2022domestic and foreign economic conditions, including economic downturns and the strength of the global and U.S. economies;\n\u2022the consumption pattern of industrial customers, electricity generators and residential users;\n\u2022the legal, regulatory and tax environment for our industry and those of our customers;\n\u2022adverse weather, climactic or other natural conditions, natural disasters, epidemics, pandemics (such as the COVID-19 virus) and other public health challenges;\n\u2022the quantity, quality and pricing of coal available in the resale market;\n\u2022the effects of worldwide energy conservation or emissions measures;\n\u2022competition from other suppliers of coal and other energy sources; and\n\u2022the proximity to and availability, reliability and cost of transportation and port facilities.\nA period of sustained low coal prices in the U.S. and other countries would materially adversely affect our operating results and cash flows, as well as the value of our coal reserves, and would cause a number of other risks that we face to increase in likelihood, magnitude and duration.\nA period of sustained low demand for coal, particularly for metallurgical coal (or \u201cmet coal\u201d), by U.S. and foreign customers and the potential for negative trade impacts resulting from changing tariff policies could reduce the price of our coal, which would reduce our revenues.\nAlpha produces coal that is sold directly to both U.S. and foreign customers and indirectly to foreign customers through U.S.-based companies. Coal export revenues accounted for approximately 76% of our coal revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nMet coal accounted for approximately 92% of our coal revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021. Any deterioration in conditions in the U.S. or foreign steel industries, including the demand for steel and the continued financial viability of the industry, could reduce the demand for our met coal and could impact the collectability of our accounts receivable from U.S. or foreign steel industry customers.\nThe demand for foreign-produced steel both in foreign markets and in the U.S. market also depends on factors such as tariff rates on steel. For example, in 2018, the U.S. imposed tariffs on imports of steel mill products and a tariff on imports of wrought and unwrought aluminum. These tariffs led to generally higher rates of steel production in the U.S. and therefore greater domestic demand for met coal. However, Alpha\u2019s export customers include foreign steel producers who may be affected by these and similar tariffs to the extent their imports into the U.S. are curtailed as a result of tariffs. Further, retaliatory tariffs by foreign nations have already limited international trade and may adversely impact global economic conditions.\nIn addition, the steel industry\u2019s demand for met coal is affected by a number of factors, including the variable nature of that industry\u2019s business, technological developments in the steel-making process and the availability of substitutes for steel, such as aluminum, composites and plastics. The U.S. steel industry increasingly relies on processes to make steel that do not use coke, such as electric arc furnaces or pulverized coal processes. As this trend continues, the amount of met coal that we sell and the prices that we receive for it could decrease, thereby reducing our revenues and adversely impacting our earnings and the value of our coal reserves. Lower demand for met coal in international markets would reduce the amount of met coal that we sell and the prices that we receive for it, thereby reducing our revenues and adversely impacting our earnings and the value of our coal reserves. Foreign government policies related to coal production and consumption could also negatively impact pricing and demand for our products.\nOur ability to obtain financing and other services, and the form and degree of these services available to us, may be significantly limited by the lending, investment and similar policies of financial institutions and insurance companies regarding carbon energy producers and the environmental impacts of coal combustion.\nCertain financial institutions, including banks and insurance companies, have adopted policies that prevent or limit those institutions from providing financing, insurance, bonding, and other services to entities that produce, generate power from or use fossil fuels. These policies, and others that may be adopted in the future, may limit our ability to obtain financing, insurance, surety bonds, and other services and may have similar effects upon our customers, which may in turn reduce future global demand for coal. Further, some investors and investment advisors support divestiture of securities issued by companies, such as us, involved in the fossil fuel extraction market. These developments may negatively affect the market for our securities, our access to capital and financial markets and our ability to obtain insurance in the future, which may in turn have significant negative effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCompetition within the coal industry may adversely affect our ability to sell coal, and excess production capacity in the industry could put downward pressure on coal prices.\nWe compete with numerous other coal producers in various regions of the U.S. for domestic and international sales. We also compete in international markets against coal producers in other countries. International demand for U.S. coal exports also affects coal demand in the U.S. This competition affects domestic and international coal prices and our ability to retain or attract coal customers. The threat of increased production from competing mines and natural gas price declines with large basis differentials have all historically contributed, and may in the future contribute, to lower coal prices.\nIn the past, high demand for coal and attractive pricing brought new investors to the coal industry, leading to the development of new mines and added production capacity. Subsequent overcapacity in the industry contributed, and may in the future contribute, to lower coal prices.\nPotential changes to international trade agreements, trade concessions, foreign currency fluctuations or other political and economic arrangements may benefit coal producers operating in countries other than the United States. Additionally, North\nAmerican steel producers face competition from foreign steel producers, which could adversely impact the financial condition and business of our customers. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to compete on the basis of price or other factors with companies that in the future may benefit from favorable foreign trade policies or other arrangements. Coal is priced internationally in U.S. dollars, and, as a result, general economic conditions in foreign markets and changes in foreign currency exchange rates may provide our foreign competitors with a competitive advantage. If our competitors\u2019 currencies decline against the U.S. dollar or against our foreign customers\u2019 local currencies, those competitors may be able to offer lower prices for coal to customers. Furthermore, if the currencies of our overseas customers were to significantly decline in value in comparison to the U.S. dollar, those customers may seek decreased prices for the coal we sell to them. Consequently, currency fluctuations could adversely affect the competitiveness of our coal in international markets, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. See \u201cItem 1. Business-Competition.\u201d Similarly, currency fluctuations could adversely affect demand for U.S. steel.\nChinese governmental policies, trade disputes in Asian markets and other factors affecting the pricing of international sales may negatively affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Chinese government has from time to time implemented regulations and promulgated new laws or restrictions on its domestic coal industry, sometimes with little advance notice, which may affect worldwide coal demand, supply and prices. During the past several years,for example, the Chinese government has initiated a number of anti-smog measures aimed at reducing hazardous air emissions through temporary production capacity restrictions within the steel, coal and coal-fired power sectors. Any future policy changes, regulations, laws or restrictions by the Chinese government may be detrimental to the global coal market and, thus, negatively affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Further, similar actions by government entities in countries that produce and/or consume large quantities of coal and other energy related commodities, such as India, may have a material impact on the prices at which we sell our product.\nCertain trade disputes in Asian markets, such as those between China and Australia, have resulted in changes in purchasing habits within certain regional markets and have led to more volatile price behavior in the global markets. Should these disputes endure, continued pricing volatility in certain of our export markets may have significant negative effects on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nFurther, certain of our sales contracts, principally international sales contracts, contain index provisions that change the sales price based upon changes in market-based indices, economic indices or both. Therefore, volatility in these indices induced by decisions by the Chinese, other governments, disputes between nations or other factors may have significant negative effects on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe concurrent loss of, or significant reduction in, purchases by several of our largest customers could materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nOur largest customer during the year ended December 31, 2021 accounted for approximately 13% of our total revenues, and coal sales to our 10 largest customers accounted for approximately 64% of our total revenues. These customers could decide to discontinue purchasing coal from us in the volumes that they have previously purchased or decide to not purchase coal from us at all. If several of these customers were to concurrently and significantly reduce their purchases of coal, or if we were unable to sell coal to them on terms as favorable to us as previous sales, we could face a significant reduction in sales while we attempt to sell the coal to other customers in the global marketplace. If such concurrent loss of large customers or a significant reduction in our sales volume to such customers were to happen, our revenues and profitability could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur ability to collect payments from our customers could be impaired if their creditworthiness and financial health deteriorate.\nOur ability to receive payment for coal sold and delivered depends on the continued creditworthiness and financial health of our customers. Competition with other coal suppliers could force us to extend credit to customers and on terms that could increase the risk we bear on payment default. In recent years, downturns in the economy and disruptions in the global financial markets have, from time to time, affected the creditworthiness of our customers and limited their liquidity and credit availability. In addition, purchasers of our met coal may increasingly be required to implement costly new emissions and other technologies, thereby increasing the risk we bear for customer payment default.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021 we derived 76% of our coal revenues from coal sales made to customers outside the U.S. Our customers in other countries may be subject to other pressures and uncertainties that may also affect their ability to pay, including trade barriers, exchange controls and local economic, threat of military action, and political conditions. We are\nmonitoring developments in Ukraine as well as the related export controls and financial and economic sanctions imposed on certain industry sectors and parties in Russia by the U.S., the U.K., the European Union and others. Although we do not presently foresee direct material adverse effects upon our business, financial condition or results of operations as a result of developments in Ukraine and the consequent controls and sanctions, these factors may affect companies in many sectors and could lead to increased market volatility and uncertainty, which could affect us in turn.\nContinuing low demand for thermal coal, or further declines in demand, by North American electric power generators could reduce the price of our thermal coal, which would reduce our revenues.\nThermal coal accounted for approximately 8% of our coal revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021. The majority of our sales of thermal coal were to U.S. electric power generators. The North American demand for thermal coal is affected primarily by the overall demand for electricity, the availability, quality and price of competing fuels, such as natural gas, nuclear fuel, oil and alternative energy sources such as wind, solar, and hydroelectric power, increasingly stringent environmental and other governmental regulations and the coal inventories of utilities.\nA reduction in the amount of coal consumed by North American electric power generators would reduce the amount of thermal coal that we sell and the price that we receive for it, thereby reducing our revenues and adversely impacting our earnings and the value of our coal reserves. In addition, uncertainty caused by federal and state regulations could cause thermal coal customers to be uncertain of their coal requirements in future years, which could adversely affect our ability to sell coal to such customers under multi-year sales contracts.\nWe may not be able to extend our existing long-term supply contracts or enter into new ones, and our existing supply contracts may contain certain provisions that may reduce protection from short-term coal price volatility, which could adversely affect the profitability of our operations.\nHistorically, a substantial portion of our thermal coal has been sold under long-term contracts, and these arrangements provided predictability regarding future sales to electric power generation customers. Generally, these long-term agreements have contained committed volumes and fixed prices for a certain number of periods during which thermal coal will be delivered.\nIn large part, as a result of increasing and frequently changing regulation and natural gas pricing, electric power generation customers are increasingly unwilling to enter into long-term coal supply contracts, instead purchasing higher percentages of coal under short-term supply contracts or requiring contracts that provide for negotiation of price and/or supply volume for upcoming contract periods, with negotiations generally considering either then current market prices and/or relevant market indices. These contracts may cause greater variability in our thermal coal revenues and may make it more difficult for us to estimate and plan for future sales. Further, when current contracts with customers expire or are otherwise renegotiated, our customers may decide to purchase fewer tons of coal than in the past or on terms, including pricing terms, that are not as favorable to us as the terms in our current agreements. Any adjustment or negotiation leading to a significantly lower contract price could result in significantly decreased future revenues.\nDownturns and disruptions in the global economy and financial markets have had, and could in the future have, a material adverse effect on the demand for and price of coal, which could have a material negative effect on our sales, costs, margins and profitability and ability to obtain financing.\nDownturns and disruptions in the global economy and financial markets have from time to time resulted in, among other things, extreme volatility in securities prices, severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others, including real estate. Significant economic disruptions can result from numerous unpredictable factors, including but not limited to market forces, natural disasters, pandemics, trade disputes and armed conflicts. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, global supply chain disruptions, including COVID-19-related factory closures and port congestion have reduced our ability to obtain some materials used in our operations, have reduced the demand for steel, and therefore for met coal, and have affected railroad and other transportation systems.\nFuture disruptions of this sort, and in particular the tightening of credit in financial markets or any other disruption that negatively affects global economic growth, could adversely affect our customers\u2019 ability to obtain financing for operations and result in a decrease in demand, lower coal prices, the cancellation of some orders for our coal and the restructuring of agreements with some of our customers. Changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies, particularly where imported products are required for the mining process, could result in materially increased operating expenses. Any prolonged global, national or regional economic recession or other similar events could have a material adverse effect on the demand for and price of coal, on our sales, margins and profitability, and on our own ability to obtain financing. We are unable to predict\nthe timing, duration and severity of any potential future disruptions in financial markets and potential future adverse economic conditions in the U.S. and other countries and the impact these events may have on our operations and the industry in general.\nRisks Relating to Regulatory and Legal Developments\nThe extensive regulation of the mining industry imposes significant costs on us, and future regulations or violations could increase those costs or limit our ability to produce coal.\nOur operations are subject to a wide variety of federal, state and local environmental, health and safety, transportation, labor and other laws and regulations relating to matters such as:\n\u2022blasting;\n\u2022controls on emissions and discharges;\n\u2022the effects of operations on surface water and groundwater quality and availability;\n\u2022the storage, treatment and disposal of wastes;\n\u2022the remediation of contaminated soil, surface water and groundwater;\n\u2022surface subsidence from underground mining;\n\u2022the classification of plant and animal species near our mines as endangered or threatened species;\n\u2022the reclamation of mined sites; and\n\u2022employee health and safety, and benefits for current and former employees (described in more detail below).\nThese laws and regulations are becoming increasingly stringent. For example:\n\u2022federal and state agencies and citizen groups have increasingly focused on the amount of selenium and other constituents in mine-related water discharges;\n\u2022MSHA and the states of Virginia and West Virginia have implemented and proposed changes to mine safety and health requirements to impose more stringent health and safety controls, enhance mine inspection and enforcement practices, increase sanctions, and expand monitoring and reporting; and\n\u2022GHG emissions reductions are being considered that could increase our costs, require additional controls, or compel us to limit our current operations.\nIn addition, these laws and regulations require us to obtain numerous governmental permits and comply with the requirements of those permits, which are described in more detail below.\nWe incur substantial costs to comply with the laws, regulations and permits that apply to our mining and other operations and to address the outcome of inspections. The required compliance and actions to address inspection outcomes are often time-consuming and costly and may delay commencement or continuation of exploration or production. In addition, due in part to the extensive and comprehensive regulatory requirements, violations of laws, regulations and permits occur at our operations from time to time and may result in significant costs to us to correct the violations, as well as substantial civil or criminal penalties and limitations or shutdowns of our operations. In particular, President Biden and the current Congressional majorities have expressed support for policies that may result in stricter environmental, health and safety standards applicable to our operations and those of our customers. For example, on January 20, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order titled \u201cExecutive Order on Protecting Public Health and the Environment and Restoring Science to Tackle the Climate Crisis,\u201d (the \u201cJanuary 20 Executive Order\u201d), which, among other things, calls for a review of regulations and other executive actions issued during the prior Presidential administration to assess whether they are, in the view of the Biden administration, sufficiently protective of public health and the environment, including with respect to climate change. See \u201cItem 1. Business-Environmental and Other Regulatory Matters-Clean Water Act-Wastewater Discharge.\u201d\nMSHA and state regulators may also order the temporary or permanent closing of a mine in the event of certain violations of safety rules, accidents or imminent dangers. In addition, regulators may order changes to mine plans or operations due to their interpretation or application of existing or new laws or regulations. Any required changes to mine plans or operations may result in temporary idling of production or addition of costs.\nThese factors have had and will continue to have a significant effect on our costs of production and competitive position and, as a result, on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. New laws and regulations, as well as future interpretations or different enforcement of existing laws and regulations, may have a similar or more significant impact on us, including delays, interruptions or a termination of operations.\nClimate change or carbon dioxide emissions reduction initiatives could significantly reduce the demand for coal and reduce the value of our coal assets.\nGlobal climate issues continue to attract considerable public and scientific attention. Numerous reports, such as the Fourth and Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, have also engendered concern about the impacts of human activity, and in particular the emissions of GHG, such as carbon dioxide and methane, on global climate issues. Combustion of fossil fuels like coal results in the creation of carbon dioxide, which is emitted into the atmosphere by coal end users such as coal-fired electric power generators, coke plants and steelmaking plants, and, to a lesser extent, by the combustion of fossil fuels by the mining equipment we use. In addition, coal mining can release methane from the mine, directly into the atmosphere. Concerns associated with global climate change, and GHG emissions reduction initiatives designed to address them, have resulted, and are expected to continue to result, in materially increased operating costs for steel producers who use met coal, particularly in Europe.\nEmissions from coal consumption and production are subject to pending and proposed regulations as part of regulatory initiatives to address global climate change and global warming. Various international, federal, regional, foreign and state proposals are currently in place or being considered to limit emissions of GHGs, including possible future U.S. treaty commitments, new federal or state legislation, and regulation under existing environmental laws by the EPA and other regulatory agencies and litigation by private parties. These include:\n\u2022the 2015 Paris climate summit agreement, which resulted in voluntary commitments by 197 countries to reduce their GHG emissions and could result in additional firm commitments by various nations and states with respect to future GHG emissions. On June 1, 2017, the Trump administration announced that the U.S. would withdraw from the agreement, but the Biden administration has subsequently taken steps to rejoin the agreement;\n\u2022state and regional climate change initiatives implementing renewable portfolio standards or cap-and-trade schemes;\n\u2022challenges to or denials of permits for new coal-fired power plants or retrofits to existing plants by state regulators and environmental organizations due to concerns related to GHG emissions from the new or existing plants;\n\u2022private litigation against coal companies or power plant operators based on GHG-related concerns;\n\u2022the Glasgow Climate Pact resulting from the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) held from October 31 to November 13, 2021, which, though not legally binding, contains a plan to reduce use of coal by 40%.\nOn August 3, 2015, the EPA released a final rule establishing the Power Plant NSPS. The final rule requires that newly constructed fossil fuel-fired steam generating units achieve an emission standard for carbon dioxide of 1,400 lb CO2/MWh-gross. The standard is based on the performance of a supercritical pulverized coal boiler implementing partial CCS. Modified and reconstructed fossil fuel fired steam generating units must implement the most efficient generation achievable through a combination of best operating practices and equipment upgrades, to meet an emission standard consistent with best historical performance.\nIn addition, on July 8, 2019, the EPA published the ACE Rule, a replacement of the CPP. In contrast to the CPP, which called for the shifting of electricity generation away from coal-fired sources towards natural gas and renewables, the ACE Rule focuses on reducing GHG emissions from existing coal-fired plants by requiring states to mandate the implementation of a range of technologies at power plants designed to improve their heat rate (i.e., decrease the amount of fuel necessary to generate the same amount of electricity). However, on January 19, 2021, the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia struck down the ACE rule. The EPA has since announced an intent to consider new regulations governing carbon emissions from existing power plants. The EPA\u2019s draft strategic plan issued in November 2021 emphasizes climate change and environmental justice as its top two priorities. More stringent standards for carbon dioxide pollution as a result of these rulemakings could further reduce demand for coal, and our business would be adversely impacted. In addition, certain banks and other financing sources have taken actions to limit available financing for the development of new coal-fueled power plants, which also may adversely impact the future global demand for coal.\nFurthermore, several well-funded non-governmental organizations have explicitly undertaken campaigns to minimize or eliminate the use of coal as a source of electricity generation. These efforts, as well as concerted conservation and efficiency efforts that result in reduced electricity consumption and consumer and corporate preferences for non-coal fuel sources, could cause coal prices and sales of our coal to materially decline and could cause our costs to increase.\nAny future laws, regulations or other policies or initiatives of the nature described above may adversely impact our business in material ways. The degree to which any particular law, regulation or policy impacts us will depend on several factors, including the substantive terms involved, the relevant time periods for enactment and any related transition periods. Considerable uncertainty is associated with these regulatory initiatives and legal developments, as the content of proposed legislation and regulation is not yet fully determined and many of the new regulatory initiatives remain subject to governmental and judicial review. In particular, President Biden and the current Congressional majorities have expressed support for the\nregulation of GHG emissions. In prior Congressional sessions, legislative proposals regulating GHG emissions (such as the Green New Deal) have been introduced, and Congressional leadership may introduce similar legislation this Congressional term. We routinely attempt to evaluate the potential impact on us of any proposed laws, regulations or policies, which requires that we make several material assumptions. From time to time, we determine that the impact of one or more such laws, regulations or policies, if adopted and ultimately implemented as proposed, may result in materially adverse impacts on our operations, financial condition or cash flow; however, we often are not able to reasonably quantify such impacts.\nIn general, any laws, regulations or other policies aimed at reducing GHG emissions have imposed, and are likely to continue to impose, significant costs on many coal-fired power plants, steel-making plants and industrial boilers, which may make them unprofitable. Accordingly, some existing power generators have switched to other fuels that generate fewer emissions and others are likely to switch, some power plants have closed and others are likely to close, and fewer new coal-fired plants are being constructed, all of which reduce demand for coal and the amount of coal that we sell and the prices that we receive for it, thereby reducing our revenues and adversely impacting our earnings and the value of our coal reserves.\nOther extensive environmental laws, including existing and potential future legislation, treaties and regulatory requirements relating to air emissions, waste management and water discharges, affect our customers and could further reduce the demand for coal as a fuel source and cause prices and sales of our coal to materially decline.\nOur customers\u2019 operations are subject to extensive laws and regulations relating to environmental matters, including air emissions, wastewater discharges and the storage, treatment and disposal of wastes and operational permits. In particular, the Clean Air Act and similar state and local laws extensively regulate the amount of sulfur dioxide, particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, mercury and other compounds emitted into the air from fossil-fuel fired power plants, which are the largest end-users of our thermal coal. A series of more stringent requirements will or may become effective in coming years, including:\n\u2022implementation of the current and more stringent proposed ambient air quality standards for sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, particulate matter and ozone, including the EPA\u2019s issuance of NAAQS in October 2015 of a more stringent ambient air quality standard for ozone and the EPA\u2019s determinations of attainment designations with respect to these rules;\n\u2022implementation of the EPA\u2019s CSAPR to significantly reduce nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide emissions from power plants in 28 states, and the CSAPR Update Rule, issued in September 2016, requiring further reductions in nitrogen oxides in 2017 in 22 states subject to CSAPR during the summertime ozone season;\n\u2022continued implementation of the EPA\u2019s MATS, which impose stringent limits on emissions of mercury and other toxic air pollutants from electric power generators, issued in December 2011 and in effect pending completion of judicial review proceedings;\n\u2022implementation of the EPA\u2019s August 2014 final rule on cooling water intake structures for power plants;\n\u2022more stringent EPA requirements governing management and disposal of coal ash pursuant to a rule finalized in December 2014 and new amendments effective as of August 2018; and\n\u2022implementation of the EPA\u2019s November 2015 final rule setting effluent discharge limits on the levels of metals that can be discharged from power plants.\nThese environmental laws and regulations impose significant costs on our customers, which are increasing as these requirements become more stringent. These costs make coal more expensive to use and make it a less attractive fuel source of energy for our customers. Accordingly, some existing power generators have switched to other fuels that generate fewer emissions and others are likely to switch, some power plants have closed and others are likely to close, and no coal-fired plants are currently being constructed in the U.S., all of which reduce demand for coal, the amount of coal that we sell and the prices that we receive for it, thereby reducing our revenues and adversely impacting our earnings and the value of our coal reserves.\nIn addition, regulations regarding sulfur dioxide emissions under the Clean Air Act, including caps on emissions and the price of emissions allowances, have a potentially significant impact on the demand for our coal based on its sulfur content. We sell both higher sulfur and low sulfur coal. More widespread installation by power generators of technology that reduces sulfur emissions may make high sulfur coal more competitive with our low sulfur coal. Decreases in the price of emissions allowances could have a similar effect. Significant increases in the price of emissions allowances could reduce the competitiveness of higher sulfur coal compared to low sulfur coal and possibly natural gas at power plants not equipped to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions. Any of these consequences could result in a decrease in revenues from some of our operations, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nDecreases in consumer demand for electricity and changes in general energy consumption patterns attributable to energy conservation trends could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDue to efforts to promote energy conservation in recent years, there is a risk that both the demand for electricity and the general energy consumption patterns of consumers worldwide will decrease. The ability of energy conservation technologies, public initiatives and government incentives to reduce electricity consumption or to support other forms of renewable energy could also lead to a reduction in the demand for and the price of coal. If prices for coal are not competitive, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially harmed.\nOur operations may impact the environment or cause exposure to hazardous substances, and our properties may have environmental contamination, which could result in material liabilities to us.\nOur operations use certain hazardous materials, and, from time to time, we generate limited quantities of hazardous wastes. We may be subject to claims under federal or state law for toxic torts, natural resource damages and other damages as well as for the investigation and clean-up of soil, surface water, sediments, groundwater and other natural resources. Such claims may arise out of current or former conditions at sites that we own or operate, or formerly owned or operated, and at contaminated sites owned or operated by third parties to which we sent wastes for treatment, storage or disposal. Our liability for such claims may be joint and several, so that we may be held responsible for more than our share of the contamination or other damages, or even for the entire share.\nWe operate and maintain a number of coal slurry impoundments. These impoundments are subject to extensive regulation. Some slurry impoundments maintained by other coal mining operations have failed, causing extensive damage to the environment and natural resources, as well as liability for related personal injuries and property damages. Some of our impoundments overlie mined out areas, which can pose a heightened risk of failure and of resulting damages. If one of our impoundments were to fail, we could be subject to substantial claims for the resulting environmental contamination and associated liability, as well as for fines and penalties, and potential third-party claims for personal injury, property damage or other losses. In addition, we may become subject to such claims related to surface expressions of methane gas, which can result from underground coal mining activities.\nThese and other environmental impacts that our operations may have, as well as exposures to hazardous substances or wastes associated with our operations, could result in costs and liabilities that could render continued operations at certain mines economically unfeasible or impractical or otherwise materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to obtain and renew permits, mine plan modifications and approvals, leases or other rights necessary for our operations, which would reduce our production, cash flows and profitability.\nMining companies must obtain numerous regulatory permits that impose strict conditions on various environmental and safety matters in connection with coal mining. The permitting rules are complex and change over time, potentially in ways that may make our ability to comply with the applicable requirements more difficult or impractical or even preclude the continuation of ongoing operations or the development of future mining operations. The public, including special interest groups and individuals, have certain rights under various statutes to comment upon, submit objections to and otherwise engage in the permitting process, including bringing citizens\u2019 lawsuits or administrative actions to challenge permits or mining activities. In the states where we operate, applicable laws and regulations also provide that a mining permit or modification can, under certain circumstances, be delayed, refused or revoked if we or any entity that owns or controls or is under common ownership or control with us or is determined to be linked to us under OSM\u2019s AVS, have unabated permit violations or have been the subject of permit or reclamation bond revocation or suspension. These regulations define certain relationships, such as owning over 50% of stock in an entity or having the authority to determine the manner in which the entity conducts mining operations, as constituting ownership and control. Certain other relationships are presumed to constitute ownership or control, including being an officer or director of an entity or owning between 10% and 50% of the mining operator. This presumption, in some cases, can be rebutted where the person or entity can demonstrate that it in fact does not or did not have authority directly or indirectly to determine the manner in which the relevant coal mining operation is conducted. Thus, past or ongoing violations of federal and state mining laws by us or by coal mining operations owned or controlled by our significant stockholders, directors or officers or by entities linked to us through OSM\u2019s AVS could provide a basis to revoke existing permits and to deny the issuance of additional permits or modification or amendment of existing permits. This is known as being \u201cpermit-blocked.\u201d In recent years, the permitting required for coal mining has been the subject of increasingly stringent regulatory and administrative requirements and extensive litigation by environmental groups.\nAs a result, the permitting process is costly and time-consuming, required permits may not be issued or renewed in a timely fashion (or at all), and permits that are issued may be conditioned in a manner that may restrict our ability to conduct our mining activities efficiently. In some circumstances, regulators could seek to revoke permits previously issued. We are required\nunder certain permits to provide data on the impact on the environment of proposed exploration for or production of coal to governmental authorities.\nIn particular, certain of our activities require a dredge and fill permit from the COE under Section 404 of the CWA. In recent years, the Section 404 permitting process has been subject to increasingly stringent regulatory and administrative requirements and a series of court challenges, which have resulted in increased costs and delays in the permitting process.\nIn January 2020, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (the \u201cUSACE\u201d) issued a final rule that attempts to clarify the Clean Water Act's (\u201cCWA\u201d) jurisdictional reach over waters of the United States, referred to as the Navigable Waters Protection Rule. The rule replaces a rule issued in June 2015 by the previous presidential administration, the Clean Water Rule. The Clean Water Rule was the subject of extensive legal challenges, injunctions and administrative action, and was formally repealed in December 2019. The Navigable Waters Protection Rule is designed to fulfill a February 2017 executive order calling on the EPA and the USACE to develop a rule consistent with Justice Antonin Scalia's plurality opinion in the 2006 Supreme Court decision, Rapanos v. United States, that CWA jurisdiction attaches only to \u201cnavigable waters\u201d and other waters with a relatively permanent flow, such as rivers or lakes. The Navigable Waters Protection Rule narrows the jurisdiction of the CWA relative to Clean Water Rule by, among other things, excluding from the scope of the definition of \u201cwaters of the United States\u201d certain ephemeral streams and wetlands not adjacent to jurisdictional water bodies. The Navigable Water Protection Rule is likely to be the subject of legal challenges and potential reconsideration by the EPA and its ultimate impact on our operations is uncertain.\nAdditionally, we may rely on nationwide permits under the CWA Section 404 program for some of our operations. These nationwide permits are issued every five years, and the 2017 nationwide permit program was recently reissued in January 2017. If we are unable to use the nationwide permits and require an individual permit for certain work, that could delay operations.\nMany of our permits are subject to renewal from time to time, and renewed permits may contain more restrictive conditions than our existing permits. For example, many of our permits governing surface stream and groundwater discharges and impacts will be subject to new and more stringent conditions to address various new water quality requirements upon renewal over the next several years. Although we have no estimates at this time, our costs to satisfy these conditions could be substantial.\nFuture changes or challenges to the permitting and mine plan modification and approval process could cause additional increases in the costs, time, and difficulty associated with obtaining and complying with the permits and could delay or prevent commencing or continuing exploration or production operations and, as a result, adversely affect our coal production, cash flows and profitability.\nFederal and state regulatory agencies have the authority to order any of our facilities to be temporarily or permanently closed under certain circumstances, which could materially adversely affect our ability to meet our customers\u2019 demands.\nFederal and state regulatory agencies have the authority following significant health and safety incidents, such as fatalities, to order a facility to be temporarily or permanently closed. If this were to occur, we may be required to incur capital expenditures to re-open the facility. In the event that these agencies order the closing of our facilities, our coal sales agreements and our take-or-pay contracts related to our export terminals may permit us to issue force majeure notices, which suspend our obligations to deliver coal under these contracts. However, our customers may challenge our issuances of force majeure notices. If these challenges are successful, we may have to purchase coal from third-party sources, if it is available, to fulfill these obligations, incur capital expenditures to re-open the facilities and/or negotiate settlements with the customers, which may include price reductions, the reduction of commitments or the extension of time for delivery, or terminate customers\u2019 contracts. Any of these actions could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur systems and procedures for internal control over financial reporting or the disclosure controls related to them may in the future have material weaknesses, which may adversely affect the value of our common stock.\nWe are responsible for maintaining systems and documentation necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. These activities may divert management\u2019s attention from other business concerns. To maintain and improve our controls and procedures, we must commit significant resources, may be required to hire additional staff and need to continue to provide effective management oversight, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCertain U.S. federal income tax provisions currently available with respect to coal percentage depletion and exploration and development may be eliminated by future legislation.\nFrom time to time, legislation is proposed that could result in the reduction or elimination of certain U.S. federal income tax provisions currently available to companies engaged in the exploration, development, and production of coal reserves. These proposals have included, but are not limited to: (1) the elimination of current deductions, the 60-month amortization period and the 10-year amortization period for exploration and development costs relating to coal and other hard mineral fossil fuels, (2) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance with respect to coal properties and (3) the repeal of capital gains treatment of coal and lignite royalties. The passage of these or other similar proposals could increase our taxable income and negatively impact our cash flows and the value of an investment in our common stock.\nChanges in tax laws, particularly in the areas of non-income taxes, could cause our financial position and profitability to deteriorate.\nWe pay non-income taxes on the coal we produce. A substantial portion of our non-income taxes are levied as a percentage of gross revenues, while others are levied on a per ton basis. If such liabilities were to arise, or if non-income tax rates were to increase significantly, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nRisks Relating to Our Operations\nOur coal mining production and delivery is subject to conditions and events, many of which are beyond our control, that could result in higher operating expenses and decreased production and sales. The occurrence of a significant accident or other event that is not fully insured could adversely affect our business and operating results and could result in impairments to our assets.\nOur coal production at our mines is subject to operating conditions and events, many of which are beyond our control, that could disrupt operations, affect production and the cost of mining for varying lengths of time and have a significant impact on our operating results. Adverse operating conditions and events that we have experienced in the past and/or may experience in the future include:\n\u2022changes or variations in geologic, hydrologic or other conditions, such as the thickness of the coal deposits and the amount of rock, clay or other non-coal material embedded in or overlying the coal deposit;\n\u2022mining, processing and loading equipment failures and unexpected maintenance problems;\n\u2022limited availability or increased costs of mining, processing and loading equipment and parts and other materials from suppliers;\n\u2022difficulties associated with mining under or around surface obstacles;\n\u2022unfavorable conditions with respect to proximity to and availability, reliability and cost of transportation facilities;\n\u2022adverse weather and natural disasters, such as heavy snows, heavy rains and flooding, lightning strikes, hurricanes or earthquakes;\n\u2022accidental mine water discharges, coal slurry releases and failures of an impoundment or refuse area, including inadvertent environmental impacts to the local community;\n\u2022mine safety accidents, including fires and explosions from methane and other sources;\n\u2022hazards or occurrences that could result in personal injury and loss of life;\n\u2022a shortage of skilled and unskilled labor;\n\u2022security breaches or terroristic acts;\n\u2022strikes and other labor-related interruptions;\n\u2022delays or difficulties in, the unavailability of, or unexpected increases in the cost of acquiring, developing or permitting new acquisitions from the federal government and other new mining reserves and surface rights;\n\u2022competition and/or conflicts with other natural resource extraction activities and production within our operating areas;\n\u2022the termination of material contracts by state or other governmental authorities; and\n\u2022fatalities, personal injuries or property damage arising from train derailments, mined material or overburden leaving permit boundaries, underground mine blowouts, impoundment failures, subsidence or other unexpected incidents.\nIf any of these or other conditions or events occur in the future at any of our mines or affect deliveries of our coal to customers, they may increase our cost of mining, delay or halt production or sales to our customers, result in regulatory action or lead to customers initiating claims against us. Any of these consequences could adversely affect our operating results or result in impairments to our assets.\nIn addition, our mining operations are concentrated in a small number of material mines. As a result, the effects of any of these conditions or events may be exacerbated and may have a disproportionate impact on our results of operations and assets.\nWe maintain insurance policies that provide limited coverage for some, but not all, of these risks. Even where covered by insurance, these risks may not be fully covered, and insurers may contest their obligations to make payments. Failures by insurers to make payments could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations or financial condition.\nA decline in demand for met coal would limit our ability to sell our high quality thermal coal as higher priced met coal, which would reduce our revenues and profitability, and could affect the economic viability of some of our mines with higher operating costs.\nWe are able to mine, process and market some of our coal reserves as either met coal or high-quality thermal coal. In deciding our approach to these reserves, we assess the conditions in the met and thermal coal markets, including factors such as the current and anticipated future market prices of met coal and thermal coal, the generally higher price of met coal as compared to thermal coal, the lower volume of saleable tons that results when producing coal for sale in the met market rather than the thermal market, the increased costs of producing met coal, the likelihood of being able to secure a longer term sales commitment for thermal coal and our contractual commitments to deliver different types of coal to our customers. A decline in demand for met coal relative to thermal coal could cause us to shift coal from the met market to the thermal market, thereby reducing our revenues and profitability.\nMining in Central Appalachia is more complex and involves more regulatory constraints than mining in other areas of the U.S., which could affect our mining operations and cost structures in these areas.\nThe geological characteristics of Central Appalachian coal reserves, such as depth of overburden and coal seam thickness, make them complex and costly to mine. As mines become depleted, replacement reserves may not be available or, if available, may not be able to be mined at costs comparable to those of the depleting or depleted mines. In addition, compared to mines in other areas of the country, permitting, licensing and other environmental and regulatory requirements in Central Appalachia are more costly and time consuming to satisfy. These factors could materially adversely affect the mining operations and cost structures of, and our customers\u2019 ability to use coal produced by, our mines in Central Appalachia.\nDisruptions in transportation services and increased transportation costs could impair our ability to supply coal to our customers, reduce demand and adversely affect our business.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, 82% of our coal volume was transported from our shipping points to a vessel loading point or customer location by rail. Deterioration in the reliability of the service provided by rail carriers would result in increased internal coal handling costs and decreased shipping volumes, and, if we are unable to find alternatives, our business could be adversely affected. Most of our operations are serviced by a single rail carrier. Due to the difficulty in arranging alternative transportation, these operations are particularly at risk of disruptions, capacity issues or other difficulties with that carrier\u2019s transportation services, which could adversely impact our revenues and results of operations.\nWe also depend upon trucks, barges and ocean vessels to deliver coal to our customers. In addition, much of our coal is transported from our mines to our loading facilities by trucks owned and operated by third parties. Disruption of any of these transportation services due to weather-related problems, mechanical difficulties, fuel and supply costs, strikes, lockouts, bottlenecks, terrorist attacks or other events could impair our ability to supply coal to our customers, resulting in decreased shipments and revenue. Disruption in shipment levels over long periods of time could cause our customers to look to other sources for their coal needs, negatively affecting our revenues and results of operations.\nAn increase in transportation costs could have an adverse effect on our ability to increase or to maintain production on a profit-making basis and could therefore adversely affect our revenues and earnings. Because transportation costs represent a significant portion of the total cost of coal for our customers, increases in transportation costs could also reduce overall demand for coal or make our coal production less competitive than coal produced from other sources or other regions.\nWe require a skilled workforce and a dedicated senior management team to run our business. If we cannot hire and retain qualified persons, including to meet replacement or expansion needs, we may not be able to achieve planned results.\nEfficient coal mining using modern techniques and equipment requires skilled laborers with mining experience and proficiency as well as qualified managers, supervisors and other staff. We, along with the mining industry generally, are currently facing a significant shortage of operating staff. Moreover, we are seeing an increasing number of those who leave our employment accept new positions outside the coal industry, further reducing the number of skilled employees available to us and leading to increased labor costs. When coal producers compete for skilled miners, recruiting challenges can occur, and employee turnover rates can increase, which negatively affect operating efficiency and costs. If we are unable to train or retain the necessary number of staff, it could adversely affect our productivity, costs and ability to maintain or expand production.\nIn addition, we depend on the experience and industry knowledge of our officers and other key employees to design and execute our business plans. If we experience a substantial turnover in our leadership and other key employees, and those persons are not replaced by individuals with comparable skills, our performance could be materially adversely impacted. Furthermore, we may be unable to attract and retain additional qualified executives as needed in the future. We believe that our future success will depend on our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified personnel. There is a high level of competition for experienced, successful personnel in our industry. Our inability to meet our executive staffing requirements in the future could impair our growth and harm our business.\nCertain provisions in our coal supply agreements may result in economic penalties upon our failure to meet specifications.\nMost of our coal supply agreements contain provisions requiring us to deliver coal meeting quality thresholds for certain characteristics such as BTU, sulfur content, ash content, grindability, moisture and ash fusion temperature. Failure to meet these specifications could result in economic penalties, including price adjustments, the rejection of deliveries or termination of the contracts. Further, some of our coal supply agreements allow our customers to terminate the contract in the event of regulatory changes that restrict the type of coal the customer may use at its facilities or the use of that coal or increase the price of coal or the cost of using coal beyond specified limits. In addition, our coal supply agreements typically contain force majeure provisions allowing temporary suspension of performance by us or the customer during specified events beyond the control of the affected party. As a result of these issues, we may not achieve the revenue or profit we expect to achieve from our coal supply agreements.\nCybersecurity attacks, natural disasters, terrorist attacks and other similar crises or disruptions may negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, or those of our customers and suppliers.\nOur business, or the businesses of our customers and suppliers, may be impacted by disruptions such as terrorist or cybersecurity attacks or failures, threats to physical security, and extreme weather conditions or other natural disasters. These disruptions or any significant increases in energy prices that follow could result in government-imposed price controls. Our insurance may not protect us against such occurrences. It is possible that any of these occurrences, or a combination of them, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nStrategic targets, such as energy-related assets, may be at greater risk of future cybersecurity attacks than other targets in the U.S. Our defensive preparedness against cybersecurity attacks includes limited technological capabilities for prevention and detection of cybersecurity disruptions; internal governance processes that assist to identify, protect, and remediate security risks routinely; non-technological measures such as threat information sharing with industry groups; internal training and awareness campaigns including testing of employee awareness and an emphasis on resiliency. If the measures we and our cloud service providers are taking to protect against cybersecurity disruptions prove to be insufficient or if our proprietary data is otherwise not protected, we as well as our customers, employees, or third parties could be adversely affected. Cybersecurity disruptions could cause physical harm to people or the environment; damage or destroy assets; compromise business systems; result in proprietary information being altered, lost, or stolen; result in employee, customer, or third-party information being compromised; or otherwise disrupt our business operations. We could incur significant costs to remedy the effects of a major cybersecurity disruption in addition to costs in connection with resulting regulatory actions, litigation or reputational harm. Further, as cybersecurity attacks continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to cybersecurity attacks.\nExpenditures for certain employee benefits could be materially higher than we have anticipated, which could increase our costs and adversely affect our financial results.\nWe are responsible for certain liabilities under a variety of benefit plans and other arrangements with employees. The unfunded status of these obligations, including discontinued operations, as of December 31, 2021, included $84.3 million of workers\u2019 compensation obligations, net of expected insurance receivable amounts, $159.9 million of pension obligations and $114.5 million of black lung obligations. These obligations have been estimated based on assumptions including actuarial estimates, discount rates, and changes in health care costs. We could be required to expend greater amounts than anticipated. In addition, future regulatory and accounting changes relating to these benefits could result in increased obligations or additional costs, which could also have a material adverse effect on our financial results. Several states in which we operate consider changes in workers\u2019 compensation laws from time to time, which, if enacted, could adversely affect us. In addition, the U.S. Department of Labor has a legislative directive to periodically review operators\u2019 financial standing and federal black lung liabilities, which could result in a substantial increase in required security, negatively impacting liquidity.\nIf the assumptions underlying our accruals for reclamation and mine closure obligations prove to be inaccurate, we could be required to expend greater amounts than anticipated.\nSMCRA establishes operational, reclamation and closure standards for all aspects of surface mining as well as deep mining. We accrue for the costs of current mine disturbance and final mine closure, including the cost of treating mine water discharge where necessary. Our estimated total reclamation and mine-closing liabilities were $164.2 million as of December 31, 2021, based upon permit requirements and the historical experience at our operations, and depend on a number of variables involving assumptions and estimation and, therefore, may be subject to change, including the estimated future asset retirement costs and the timing of such costs, estimated proven reserves, assumptions involving profit margins of third-party contractors, inflation rates and discount rates. Furthermore, these obligations are primarily unfunded. If these accruals are insufficient or our liability in a particular year is greater than currently anticipated, our future operating results and financial position could be adversely affected. In addition, significant changes from period to period could result in significant variability in our operating results, which could reduce comparability between periods and impact our liquidity. See \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\u201d for a description of our estimated costs of these liabilities.\nEstimates of our economically recoverable coal reserves and coal resources involve uncertainties, and any inaccuracies in our estimates could result in lower than expected revenues, higher than expected costs, decreased profitability and asset impairments.\nOur estimates of economically recoverable coal reserves and coal resources are based on engineering, economic and geological data and assumptions. Our estimates as to the quantity and quality of the coal in our reserves depend upon a variety of factors and assumptions, many of which involve uncertainties and factors beyond our control and may vary considerably from actual results, such as:\n\u2022geological and mining conditions that may not be fully identified by available exploration data or that may differ from experience in current operations;\n\u2022historical production from the area compared with production from other similar producing areas;\n\u2022the assumed ability to obtain future permits and effects of regulation and taxes by governmental agencies; and\n\u2022assumptions about coal prices, operating costs, mining technology improvements, development costs and reclamation costs.\nFor these reasons, estimates of the economically recoverable quantities and qualities attributable to any particular property, classifications of reserves and coal resources based on risk of recovery and estimates of net cash flows expected from particular reserves prepared by different engineers or by the same engineers at different times may vary substantially. In addition, actual coal tonnage recovered from identified reserve areas or properties and revenues and expenditures with respect to our reserves and resources may vary materially from estimates. Accordingly, our estimates may not accurately reflect our actual reserves and resources. Any inaccuracy in our reserve estimates could result in lower than expected revenues, higher than expected costs, decreased profitability and asset impairments.\nDecreased availability or increased costs of key equipment and materials, including certain items mandated by regulations, or of coal that we purchase from third parties, could impact our cost of production and decrease our profitability.\nWe depend on reliable supplies of mining equipment, replacement parts and materials such as explosives, diesel fuel, tires, steel, magnetite and other raw materials and consumables which, in some cases, do not have ready substitutes. Some equipment and materials are needed to comply with regulations, such as proximity detection devices on continuous mining machines and steel. The supplier base providing mining materials and equipment has been relatively consistent in recent years, although there continues to be consolidation, which has resulted in a limited number of suppliers for certain types of equipment and supplies. Any significant reduction in availability or increase in cost of any mining equipment or key supplies could adversely affect our operations and increase our costs, which could adversely affect our operating results and cash flows.\nIn addition, the prices we pay for these materials are strongly influenced by the global commodities markets. Coal mines consume large quantities of commodities such as steel, copper, rubber products, explosives and diesel and other liquid fuels. If the value of the U.S. dollar declines relative to foreign currencies with respect to certain imported supplies or other products, our operating expenses will increase, which could materially adversely impact our profitability. Likewise, a sustained period of inflation could also lead to an overall increase in input costs, which could also materially adversely impact our profitability. Furthermore, operating expenses at our mining locations are sensitive to changes in certain variable costs, including diesel fuel prices, which is one of our largest variable costs. Our results depend on our ability to adequately control our costs. Any increase in the price we pay for diesel fuel will have a negative impact on our results of operations. A rapid or significant increase in the cost of these commodities could increase our mining costs because we have limited ability to negotiate lower prices due to a small number of suppliers for many of our mining supplies.\nWe purchase coal from third parties, for use in coal blending and for other purposes, for which ready substitutes may not be immediately available. A significant reduction in availability or increase in cost of these supplies, or the failure of third party coal producers to provide them in a timely fashion, could adversely affect our operations and increase our costs, which could adversely affect our operating results and cash flows.\nOur business will be adversely affected if we are unable to timely develop or acquire additional coal reserves that are economically recoverable.\nOur profitability depends substantially on our ability to mine in a cost-effective manner coal reserves of the quality our customers need. Although we have coal reserves that we believe could support current production levels for multiple decades, we have not yet developed the mines for all our reserves. We may not be able to mine all of our reserves as profitably as we do at our current operations. Under adverse market conditions, some reserves could not be mined profitably at all. In addition, in order to develop our reserves, we must receive various governmental permits. As discussed above, some of these permits are becoming increasingly more difficult and expensive to obtain, and the review process continues to lengthen. We may be unable to obtain the necessary permits on terms that would allow us to operate profitably or at all.\nBecause our reserves are depleted as we mine our coal, our future success and growth depend in part on our ability to timely acquire additional coal reserves that are economically recoverable. Our planned development projects and acquisition activities may not result in significant additional reserves, and we may not succeed in developing new mines or expanding existing mines beyond our existing reserves. Replacement reserves may not be available when required or, if available, may not be able to be mined at costs comparable to those of the depleting mines. We may not be able to accurately assess the geological characteristics of any reserves that we now own or subsequently acquire, which may adversely affect our profitability and financial condition. Exhaustion of reserves at particular mines also may have an adverse effect on our operating results due to lost production capacity from diminished or discontinued operations at those mines, as well as lay-offs, write-off charges and other costs, potentially causing an adverse effect that is disproportionate to the percentage of overall production represented by those mines. Our ability to acquire other reserves in the future could be limited by restrictions under our existing or future debt agreements, competition from other coal companies for attractive properties or the lack of suitable acquisition candidates available on commercially reasonable terms, among other factors. If we are unable to replace or increase our coal reserves on acceptable terms, our production and revenues will decline as our reserves are depleted.\nIf we are unable to acquire surface rights to access our coal reserves, we may be unable to obtain a permit to mine coal we own and may be required to employ expensive techniques to mine around those sections of land we cannot access in order to access other sections of coal reserves, which could materially and adversely affect our business and our results of operations.\nAfter we acquire coal reserves, we are required to obtain a permit to mine the reserves through the applicable state agencies prior to mining the acquired coal. In part, permitting requirements provide that, under certain circumstances, we must obtain surface owner consent if the surface estate has been severed from the mineral estate, which is commonly known as a \u201csevered estate.\u201d At certain of our mines where we have obtained the underlying coal and the surface is held by one or more third party owners, we are engaged in negotiations for surface rights with multiple parties. If we are unable to successfully negotiate surface rights with any or all of these surface owners, or to do so on commercially reasonable terms, we may be denied a permit to mine some or all of our coal or may find that we cannot mine the coal at a profit. If we are denied a permit, that would create significant delays in our mining operations and materially and adversely impact our business and results of operations. Furthermore, if we decide to alter our plans to mine around the affected areas, we could incur significant additional costs to do so, which could increase our operating expenses considerably and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nConflicts with competing holders of mineral rights and rights to use adjacent, overlying or underlying lands could materially and adversely affect our ability to mine coal or do so on a cost-effective basis.\nOur operations at times face potential conflicts with holders of other mineral interests such as coalbed methane, natural gas and oil reserves. Some of these minerals are located on, or are adjacent to, some of our coal reserves and active operations, potentially creating conflicting interests between us and the holders of those interests. From time to time we acquire these minerals ourselves to prevent conflicting interests from arising. If, however, conflicting interests arise and we do not acquire the competing mineral rights, we may be required to negotiate our ability to mine with the holder of the competing mineral rights. Furthermore, the rights of third parties for competing uses of adjacent, overlying or underlying lands, such as oil and gas activity, coalbed methane, pipelines, roads, easements and public facilities, may affect our ability to operate as planned if our title is not superior or arrangements cannot be negotiated. If we are unable to reach an agreement with the holders of such\nrights, or to do so on a cost-effective basis, we may incur increased costs, and our ability to mine could be impaired, which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe contract with third parties to operate or reclaim certain of our mines, and our results of operations could be adversely affected if those third party operators are ineffective.\nWe contract with third parties to operate certain of our mines. Under those arrangements, we retain certain contractual rights of oversight over these mines, which are operated under our permits or leases, but we do not control, and our employees do not participate in, the day-to-day operations of these mines. Operational difficulties at these mines, increased competition for contract miners from other coal producers and other factors beyond our control could affect the availability, cost and quality of coal produced for us by contractors. Disruption in our supply of contractor-produced coal could impair our ability to fill our customers\u2019 orders or require us to pay higher prices to obtain the required coal from other sources. Any increase in the per-ton compensation for services we pay for the production of contractor-produced coal could increase our costs and, therefore, lower our earnings and adversely affect our results of operations. We also contract with third parties to perform reclamation services for properties that are no longer in operation. If these third parties fail to meet their obligations under those contracts or are otherwise ineffective, it could increase our costs and, therefore, lower our earnings and adversely affect our results of operations.\nProvisions in our lease agreements, defects in title in our mine properties or loss of leasehold rights could limit our ability to recover coal from our properties or result in significant unanticipated costs.\nWe conduct a significant part of our mining operations on properties that we lease. Title to most of our leased properties and mineral rights is not thoroughly verified until a permit to mine the property is obtained, and, in some cases, title is not verified at all. Accordingly, actual or alleged defects in title or boundaries may exist, which may result in the loss of our right to mine on the property or in unanticipated costs to obtain leases or mining contracts to allow us to conduct our mining operations on the property, which could adversely affect our business and profitability. Furthermore, some leases require us to produce a minimum quantity of coal and/or pay minimum production royalties. If those requirements are not met, the leasehold interest may terminate.\nStrategic transactions, including acquisitions, involve a number of risks, any of which could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn the future, we may undertake strategic transactions such as the acquisition or disposition of coal mining and related infrastructure assets, interests in coal mining companies, joint ventures or other strategic transactions involving companies with coal mining or other energy assets. Our ability to complete these transactions is subject to the availability of attractive opportunities, including potential acquisition targets that can be successfully integrated into our existing business and provide us with complementary capabilities, products or services on terms acceptable to us, as well as general market conditions, among other things.\nRisks inherent in these strategic transactions include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022accurately assessing the geological conditions of acquired properties;\n\u2022the ability to obtain and maintain surety bonds, at acceptable rates, related to acquired properties;\n\u2022uncertainties in assessing the value, strengths, and potential profitability, and identifying the extent of all weaknesses, risks, contingent liabilities and other liabilities of acquisition candidates and strategic partners;\n\u2022the potential loss of key customers, management and employees of an acquired business;\n\u2022the ability to achieve identified operating and financial synergies from an acquisition or other strategic transactions in the amounts and on the time frame due to inaccurate assumptions underlying estimates of expected cost savings, the deterioration of general industry and business conditions, unanticipated legal, insurance and financial compliance costs, or other factors;\n\u2022the ability of management to manage successfully our exposure to pending and potential litigation and regulatory obligations;\n\u2022the ability of a purchaser to complete the transfer of operating permits related to our divested operations;\n\u2022unanticipated increases in competition that limit our ability to expand our business or capitalize on expected business opportunities, including retaining current customers; and\n\u2022unanticipated changes in business, industry, market, or general economic conditions that differ from the assumptions underlying our rationale for pursuing the acquisition or other strategic transactions.\nThe ultimate success of any strategic transaction we may undertake will depend in part on our ability to continue to realize the anticipated synergies, business opportunities and growth prospects from those transactions. We may not be able to successfully integrate the companies, businesses or properties that we acquire, invest in or partner with. Problems that could arise from the integration of an acquired business may involve:\n\u2022coordinating management and personnel and managing different corporate cultures;\n\u2022applying our safety and environmental programs at acquired mines and facilities;\n\u2022establishing, testing and maintaining effective internal control processes and systems of financial reporting for the acquired business;\n\u2022the diversion of our management\u2019s and our finance and accounting staff\u2019s resources and time commitments, and the disruption of either our or the acquired company\u2019s ongoing businesses;\n\u2022tax costs or inefficiencies; and\n\u2022inconsistencies in standards, information technology systems, procedures or policies.\nAny one or more of these factors could cause us not to realize the benefits anticipated from a strategic transaction, adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with clients, employees or other third parties or reduce our earnings.\nMoreover, any strategic transaction we pursue could materially affect our liquidity and capital resources and may require us to incur indebtedness, seek equity capital or both. Future transactions could also result in our assuming more long-term liabilities relative to the value of the acquired assets. Further, acquisition accounting rules require changes in certain assumptions made subsequent to the measurement period, as defined in current accounting standards, to be recorded in current period earnings, which could affect our results of operations.\nWe may be unable to generate sufficient taxable income from future operations, or other circumstances could arise, which may limit our ability to utilize our tax net operating loss carryforwards or maintain our deferred tax assets.\nWe acquired the core coal assets of Alpha Natural Resources, Inc. as part of Alpha Natural Resources, Inc.\u2019s bankruptcy restructuring in transactions intended to be treated as a tax-free reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result of these transactions, we inherited the tax basis of the core assets and the net operating loss and other carryforwards of Alpha Natural Resources, Inc. These carryforwards and tax basis were subject to reduction on December 31, 2016 due to the cancellation of indebtedness resulting from Alpha Natural Resources, Inc.\u2019s bankruptcy restructuring. Due to the change in ownership, the net operating loss and other carryforwards will be subjected to limitations on their use in future years and additional changes in ownership in future years may further reduce the annual amount of the net operating loss and other carryforwards available to be utilized. In addition, we do not have a long history of operating results, and, if we are unable to generate profits in the future, we may be unable to utilize these carryforwards. As of December 31, 2021, a valuation allowance of $172.9 million has been provided on federal and state net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets not expected to provide future tax benefits.\nNegative or unexpected consequences of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act could affect our business.\nOn December 22, 2017, legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTCJA\u201d) significantly revised U.S. federal corporate tax law by, among other things, reducing the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate to 21%, eliminating the corporate alternative minimum tax, providing a mechanism for corporations to monetize alternative minimum tax credits (\u201cAMT Credits\u201d), limiting the tax deduction for interest expense to 30% of adjusted earnings, allowing immediate expensing for certain new investments, and, effective for net operating losses arising in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, eliminating net operating loss carrybacks, permitting indefinite net operating loss carryforwards, and limiting the use of net operating loss carryforwards to 80% of current year taxable income.\nThere are a number of uncertainties and ambiguities as to the interpretation and application of many of the provisions in the TCJA. In the absence of guidance concerning those matters, we will use what we believe are reasonable interpretations and assumptions in interpreting and applying the TCJA for purposes of determining our cash tax liabilities and results of operations, which may change as we receive additional clarification and implementation guidance and as the interpretation of the TCJA evolves over time. It is possible that the IRS could issue subsequent guidance or take positions on audit that differ from the interpretations and assumptions that we previously made, which could have a material adverse effect on our cash tax liabilities, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business requires substantial capital investment and maintenance expenditures, which we may be unable to provide.\nOur business plan and strategy require substantial capital expenditures. We require capital for, among other purposes, acquisition of surface rights, equipment and the development of our mining operations, capital renovations, maintenance and expansions of plants and equipment and compliance with safety, health and environmental laws and regulations. Future debt or equity financing may not be available on satisfactory terms or at all or, if available, may result in dilution. If we are unable to obtain additional capital, we may not be able to maintain or increase our existing production rates, and we could be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures or change our business strategy, sell assets or restructure or refinance our indebtedness, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition.\nOur workforce could become increasingly unionized in the future and our unionized or union-free workforce could strike, which could adversely affect the stability of our production and reduce our profitability.\nApproximately 97% of our total workforce and approximately 95% of our hourly workforce was union-free as of December 31, 2021. However, under the National Labor Relations Act, employees have the right at any time to form or affiliate with a union. Any further unionization of our employees or the employees of third-party contractors who mine coal for us could adversely affect the stability of our production and reduce our profitability.\nOur union-represented employees could strike, which would disrupt our production, increase our costs and disrupt shipments of coal to our customers, and could result in the closure of affected mines, all of which could reduce our profitability.\nChanges in the fair value of liabilities that are marked to market could cause volatility in our earnings.\nPursuant to the Second Amended Joint Plan of Reorganization of Debtors and Debtors in Possession, dated May 27, 2016, as modified and confirmed by the Order Confirming Second Amended Joint Plan of Reorganization of Debtors and Debtors in Possession, as Modified (Docket No. 3038), entered by the Bankruptcy Court on July 12, 2016, we have contingent revenue payment obligations to certain of Alpha Natural Resources Inc.\u2019s creditors, which are recorded at fair market value and marked to market in each reporting period, with changes in value reflected in earnings. Any change in fair value can have a significant impact on our earnings from period to period, including in the future.\nRisks Relating to Our Liquidity\nOur indebtedness exposes us to various risks.\nAt December 31, 2021, we had $454.7 million of indebtedness outstanding before discounts and issuance costs applied for financial reporting, of which $454.6 million is scheduled to mature in the next three years.\nOur indebtedness could have important consequences to our business. For example, it could:\n\u2022make it more difficult for us to pay or refinance our debts as they become due during adverse economic and industry conditions because any related decrease in revenues could cause us to not have sufficient cash flows from operations to make our scheduled debt payments;\n\u2022force us to seek additional capital, restructure or refinance our debts, or sell assets;\n\u2022cause us to be less able to take advantage of significant business opportunities such as acquisition opportunities and to react to changes in market or industry conditions;\n\u2022cause us to use a portion of our cash flow from operations for debt service, reducing the availability of working capital and delaying or preventing investments, capital expenditures, research and development and other business activities;\n\u2022cause us to be more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022expose us to the risk of increased interest rates because certain of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest;\n\u2022expose us to the risk of foreclosure on substantially all of our assets and those of most of our subsidiaries, which secure certain of our indebtedness if we default on payment or are unable to comply with covenants or restrictions in any of the agreements;\n\u2022limit our ability to borrow additional monies in the future to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes; and\n\u2022result in a downgrade in the credit ratings of our indebtedness, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness and result in more restrictive borrowing terms, including increased borrowing costs and more restrictive covenants, all of which could affect our internal cost of capital estimates and therefore impact operational and investment decisions.\nOur ability to meet our debt service obligations will depend on our future cash flow from operations and our ability to restructure or refinance our debt, which will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at that\ntime. We may incur additional secured or unsecured indebtedness in the future, subject to compliance with covenants in our existing debt agreements. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations, and the terms of existing or future debt instruments may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives.\nFailure to obtain or renew surety bonds on acceptable terms could affect our ability to secure reclamation and coal lease obligations, which could adversely affect our ability to mine or lease coal.\nFederal and state laws require us to obtain surety bonds to secure payment of certain long-term obligations such as mine closure or reclamation costs, federal and state workers\u2019 compensation costs (including related to black lung), coal leases and other obligations. These bonds are typically renewable annually. Under applicable regulations, self-bonding may not be available to us as a means to comply with our reclamation bonding obligations for the foreseeable future. Surety bond issuers and holders may not continue to renew the bonds, may demand less favorable terms upon renewal or may impose new or increased collateral requirements. As of December 31, 2021, we had outstanding surety bonds with third parties of approximately $176.1 million, including $30 thousand attributable to discontinued operations. Surety bond issuers and holders may demand additional collateral, unfavorable terms or higher fees. Our failure to retain, or inability to acquire, surety bonds or to provide a suitable alternative could adversely affect our ability to mine or lease coal, which would materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. That failure could result from a variety of factors, including lack of availability, higher expense or unfavorable market terms, the exercise by third-party surety bond issuers of their right to refuse to renew the surety bonds, restrictions on availability of collateral for current and future third-party surety bond issuers under the terms of any credit arrangements then in place, or our inability to comply with our reclamation bonding obligations through self-bonding. In addition, as a result of increasing credit pressures on the coal industry, it is possible that surety bond providers could demand cash collateral as a condition to providing or maintaining surety bonds. Any such demands, depending on the amount of any cash collateral required, could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and financial position. If we are unable to meet cash collateral requirements and cannot otherwise obtain or retain required surety bonds, we may be unable to satisfy legal requirements necessary to conduct our mining operations.\nDifficulty in acquiring surety bonds, or additional collateral requirements, would increase our costs and likely require greater use of alternative sources of funding for this purpose, which would reduce our liquidity. If we are unable to provide the financial assurance that is required by state and federal law to secure our reclamation and coal lease obligations, our ability to mine or lease coal and, as a result, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe terms of our credit facility impose operating and financial restrictions on us, which may limit our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions.\nIn connection with the Credit Agreement entered into on June 14, 2019, we incurred indebtedness of approximately $561.8 million under a term loan credit facility to refinance existing indebtedness and to pay related fees and expenses. The term loan credit facility matures on June 14, 2024. The term loan credit facility permits us, subject to approval of the administrative agent and the lenders providing the financing, to request incremental term loans up to an aggregate amount of $50.0 million subject to certain conditions in the Credit Agreement, in increments not less than $25.0 million or the remaining availability.\nOn December 6, 2021, we entered into the Second Amended and Restated Asset-Based Revolving Credit Agreement (\u201cNew ABL Agreement\u201d). The New ABL Agreement amended and restated the Amended and Restated Asset-Based Revolving Credit Agreement dated November 9, 2018, in its entirety, and includes a senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility (\u201cthe New ABL Facility\u201d). Under the New ABL Facility, we may borrow cash from the Lenders (as defined therein) or cause the L/C Issuers (as defined therein) to issue letters of credit, on a revolving basis, in an aggregate amount of up to $155.0 million, of which no more than $150.0 million may represent outstanding letters of credit ($125.0 million on a committed basis and another $25.0 million on an uncommitted cash collateralized basis) with a maturity date of December 6, 2024. The New ABL Agreement extended the maturity date of the facility from the previous maturity of April 3, 2022. The terms of our credit facilities impose operating and financial restrictions on us, which may limit our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions. The revolving loan facility permits us, subject to approval of the administrative agent and the lenders providing the financing, to request incremental revolving commitment increases up to an aggregate amount of $50.0 million, in increments not less than $10.0 million or the remaining availability and subject to specified conditions.\nWe are subject to various operating and financial covenants under the term loan and revolving credit facilities that restrict our ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, make particular types of investments, incur certain types of liens, engage in fundamental corporate changes, enter into transactions with affiliates, make substantial asset sales, make certain restricted payments, enter into amendments or waivers to certain agreements, conduct certain sale leasebacks or enter into\ncertain burdensome agreements. Any failure to comply with those covenants may constitute a breach under the term loan and revolving credit facilities that could result in the acceleration of all or a substantial portion of any outstanding indebtedness and termination of revolving credit commitments under the term loan and revolving credit facilities. As of December 31, 2021, we are in compliance with the operating and financial covenants under the term loan and revolving credit facilities. Our inability in the future to maintain our term loan and revolving credit facilities could materially adversely affect our liquidity and our business.\nPressure on our business, cash flow and liquidity could materially and adversely affect our ability to fund our business operations or react to and withstand changing market and industry conditions. Additional sources of funds may not be available.\nA significant source of liquidity is our cash balance. Access to additional funds from liquidity-generating transactions or other sources of external financing may not be available to us and, if available, would be subject to market conditions and certain limitations, including our credit rating and covenant restrictions in our credit facility.\nThe terms of our borrowing arrangements limit our and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to take certain actions, which may limit our operating and financial flexibility and adversely affect our business.\nOur borrowing arrangements contain, and any future borrowing arrangements are also likely to contain, a number of significant restrictions and covenants that limit our ability and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, enter into sale and leaseback transactions, pay dividends, make redemptions and repurchases of certain capital stock, make loans and investments, create liens, sell certain assets, engage in transactions with affiliates, and merge or consolidate with other companies or sell substantially all of our assets. These covenants could adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs or to execute preferred business strategies. In addition, complying with these covenants may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy and compete against companies who are not subject to such restrictions. We regularly evaluate opportunities to enhance our capital structure and financial flexibility through a variety of methods, including repayment or repurchase of outstanding debt, amendment of our credit facility and other facilities, and other methods. As a result of any of these actions, the restrictions and covenants that apply to us may become more restrictive or otherwise change.\nOperating results below current levels, or other adverse factors, including a significant increase in interest rates, could result in our being unable to comply with our covenants and payment obligations contained in our borrowing arrangements. If we violate these covenants or obligations under any of these agreements and are unable to obtain waivers from our lenders, our debt under all of these agreements would be in default and could be accelerated by our lenders. If our indebtedness is accelerated, we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it. Even if we were able to obtain new financing, it may not be on commercially reasonable terms or on terms that are acceptable to us. If our debt is in default for any reason, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe need to maintain capacity for required letters of credit could limit our ability to provide financial assurance for self-insured obligations and negatively impact our ability to fund future working capital, capital expenditure or other general corporate requirements.\nOn December 6, 2021, we entered into the Second Amended and Restated Asset-Based Revolving Credit Agreement which amended and restated the Amended and Restated Asset-Based Revolving Credit Agreement dated November 9, 2018, in its entirety. Additionally, on December 6, 2021, we entered into the Second Amended and Restated Letter of Credit Agreement and a Credit and Security Agreement which amended and restated the Amended and Restated Letter of Credit Agreement and a Credit and Security Agreement dated November 9, 2018, in its entirety. Each of these agreements includes, among other things, provisions that provide for the issuance of letters of credit. Obligations secured by letters of credit may increase in the future. If we do not maintain sufficient borrowing capacity under our letter of credit facilities, we may be unable to provide financial assurance for self-insured obligations and could negatively impact our ability to fund future working capital, capital expenditure or other general corporate requirements.\nRisks Relating to the Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe requirements of being a public company, including compliance with the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), and the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, require application of significant resources and management attention, and we may be unable to comply with these requirements in a timely or cost-effective manner.\nAs a public company, we must comply with laws, regulations and requirements, certain corporate governance provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, related regulations of the SEC and the requirements of the New York Stock Exchange. Complying with these statutes, regulations and requirements occupies a significant amount of time for our board of directors and management and requires us to incur significant costs. We are required to:\n\u2022maintain a comprehensive compliance function;\n\u2022comply with rules promulgated by the New York Stock Exchange;\n\u2022prepare and distribute periodic public reports in compliance with our obligations under the federal securities laws;\n\u2022maintain internal policies; and\n\u2022engage outside counsel and accountants in the above activities.\nWe are responsible for assessing the operating effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting and we may conclude that our internal controls over financial reporting are ineffective. Additionally, our independent registered public accounting firm may issue an adverse report indicating that our internal controls are not effective due to deficiencies in how our controls are documented, designed, operated or reviewed. Efforts to remediate any such deficiencies and otherwise comply with these requirements may strain our resources, and we may be unable to do so in a timely or cost-effective manner.\nAn active, liquid and orderly trading market for our common stock may not be maintained, and our stock price may be volatile.\nAlpha\u2019s common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol \u201cAMR.\u201d Active, liquid and orderly trading markets usually result in less price volatility and more efficiency in carrying out investors\u2019 purchase and sale orders. An active, liquid and orderly trading market for our common stock may not be maintained, however. The market price of our common stock could vary significantly as a result of a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control. In the event of a drop in the market price of our common stock, shareholders could lose a substantial part or all of their investment in our common stock.\nThe following factors, among others, could affect our stock price:\n\u2022our operating and financial performance, including reserve estimates;\n\u2022an unexpected mine or environmental incident;\n\u2022quarterly variations in the rate of growth of our financial indicators, such as net income per share, net income and revenues;\n\u2022the public reaction to our press releases, our other public announcements and our filings with the SEC;\n\u2022strategic actions by our competitors;\n\u2022changes in revenue or earnings estimates, or changes in recommendations or withdrawal of research coverage, by equity research analysts;\n\u2022speculation in the press or investment community;\n\u2022research analysts\u2019 coverage of our common stock, or their failure to cover our common stock;\n\u2022sales of our common stock by us, our directors or officers or the selling stockholders or the perception that such sales may occur;\n\u2022our payment of dividends;\n\u2022changes in accounting principles, policies, guidance, interpretations or standards;\n\u2022additions or departures of key management personnel;\n\u2022actions by our stockholders;\n\u2022general market conditions, including fluctuations in commodity prices;\n\u2022public sentiment regarding climate change and fossil fuels;\n\u2022domestic and international economic, legal and regulatory factors unrelated to our performance; and\n\u2022the realization of any of the other risks described under this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section or described elsewhere in this document.\nThe stock markets in general have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. Securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the overall market and in the market price of a company\u2019s securities. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in very substantial costs, divert our management\u2019s attention and resources and harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nFuture sales of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales may occur, could reduce our stock price, and any additional capital raised by us through the sale of equity or convertible securities may dilute your ownership.\nWe may issue additional shares of common stock or convertible securities in subsequent public offerings. We cannot predict the size of future issuances of our common stock or securities convertible into common stock or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of shares of our common stock will have on the market price of our common stock or the dividend amount payable per share on our common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock (including shares issued in connection with an acquisition), or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock or the dividend amount payable per share on our common stock. In addition, the issuance of shares of common stock upon the exercise of outstanding options and warrants would result in dilution to the interests of other stockholders.\nOur share repurchase program could affect the price of our common stock and increase volatility and may be suspended or terminated at any time, which may result in a decrease in the trading price of our common stock.\nOn March 4, 2022, our board of directors authorized a new share repurchase program for up to $150.0 million of our common stock with no expiration date. This share repurchase program does not obligate us to repurchase any dollar amount or number of shares of our common stock and may be suspended or discontinued at any time, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. Repurchases pursuant to our share repurchase program could affect the price of our common stock and increase its volatility. Important factors that could cause us to limit, suspend or delay our share repurchases, without prior notice, and that could in any event impact our management\u2019s exercise of our discretion as to the amount and timing of such repurchases, include market conditions, the trading price of the stock, applicable legal requirements, compliance with the provisions of our debt agreements, and other factors. The existence of our share repurchase program could cause the price of our common stock to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our common stock. Additionally, repurchases under our share repurchase program would diminish our cash reserves, which could adversely affect our operating results. There can be no assurance that any share repurchases would enhance stockholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased such shares. Any failure to repurchase shares could negatively impact our reputation, investor confidence in us and our stock price.\nWe may issue preferred stock with terms that could adversely affect the voting power or value of our common stock.\nOur second amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designations, preferences, limitations and relative rights, including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our board of directors may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could adversely impact the voting power or value of our common stock. For example, we might grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we might assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock.\nProvisions in our organizational documents and the instruments governing our debt may discourage a takeover attempt, even if doing so might be beneficial to our stockholders.\nProvisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as amended, could impose impediments to the ability of a third-party to acquire us even if a change of control would be beneficial to our stockholders. Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws impose various procedural and other requirements, which could make it more difficult for stockholders to effect certain corporate actions. For example, our certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to determine the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of unissued series of preferred stock, without any vote or action by our stockholders. Thus, our board of directors can authorize the issuance of shares of preferred stock with voting or conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting or other rights of holders of our common stock. These provisions may have the effect of delaying or deterring a change of control of our company and could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.\nA change of control (as defined under the instruments governing our debt) is an event of default, permitting our lenders to accelerate the maturity of certain borrowings. Further, our borrowing arrangements impose other restrictions on us, including with respect to mergers or consolidations with other companies and the sale of substantially all of our assets. These provisions could prevent or deter a third-party from acquiring us even where the acquisition could be beneficial to our stockholders.\nOur bylaws provide, subject to certain exceptions, that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and the federal district courts of the United States are the exclusive forums for certain stockholder litigation matters, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or stockholders.\nOur bylaws provide, subject to limited exceptions, that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders; (iii) any action asserting a claim against us, any director or our officers or employees arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our certificate of incorporation (including any certificate of designations relating to any class or series of preferred stock) or our bylaws; or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us, any director or our officers or employees that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This provision does not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability under the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the U.S. federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. In addition, our bylaws provide that the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the provisions of our bylaws described above. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our directors, officers, other employees or stockholders which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision that is contained in our bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 18224, "SIC": 1220, "TIC": "CTRA"}
