{"cik": "885508", "company": "STRATUS PROPERTIES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-18", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThis report contains \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of U.S. federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements are all statements other than statements of historical facts, such as projections or expectations related to operational and financial performance or liquidity, reimbursements for infrastructure costs, financing and regulatory matters, development plans and sales of properties, leasing activities, timeframes for development, construction and completion of our projects, capital expenditures, liquidity and capital resources, and other plans and objectives of management for future operations and activities.\nWe undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. We caution readers that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated, expected, projected or assumed in the forward-looking statements. Important factors that can cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements include the following:\nRisks Relating to our Business and Industries\nWe need significant amounts of cash to service our debt. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash to service our debt, our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected.\nOur industry is capital-intensive and requires significant up-front expenditures to secure land and pursue development and construction on such land. Our business strategy requires us to rely on cash flow from operations and our debt agreements as our primary sources of funding for our liquidity needs. We have also, from time to time, relied on project-level equity financing of our subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2018, our outstanding debt totaled $295.5 million and our cash and cash equivalents totaled $19.0 million. Our level of indebtedness could have significant consequences. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nIncrease our vulnerability to adverse changes in economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nRequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations and proceeds from asset sales to pay or provide for our indebtedness, thus reducing the availability of cash flows to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, investments, dividends and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nLimit our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and the markets in which we operate;\n\u2022\nForce us to dispose of one or more of our properties, possibly on unfavorable terms;\n\u2022\nPlace us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors that have less debt; and\n\u2022\nLimit our ability to borrow money to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements and other financing needs.\nOur ability to make scheduled debt service payments or to refinance our indebtedness, depends on our future operating and financial performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. Historically, much of our debt has been renewed or refinanced in the ordinary course of business. Any deterioration of current economic conditions in our areas of operations could impact our ability to refinance our debt and obtain renewals on favorable terms or at all. In the future we may not be able to obtain sufficient external sources of liquidity on attractive terms, if at all, or otherwise renew, extend or refinance a significant portion of our outstanding debt scheduled to become due in the near future. There can be no\nassurance that we will maintain cash reserves and generate sufficient cash flow from operations in an amount sufficient to enable us to service our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs. Any of these occurrences may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. For example, our inability to extend, repay or refinance our debt when it becomes due, including upon a default or acceleration event, could force us to sell properties on unfavorable terms or ultimately result in foreclosure on properties pledged as collateral, which could result in a loss of our investment and harm our reputation. In addition, any difficulty in obtaining sufficient capital for planned development expenditures could also cause project delays, which could increase our costs.\nOur current financing arrangements contain, and our future financing arrangements likely will contain, certain financial and restrictive covenants relating to our operations and the failure to comply with such covenants could result in a default that accelerates the required payment of such debt.\nThe terms of the agreements governing our indebtedness include restrictive covenants and require that certain financial ratios be maintained. For example, the minimum stockholders\u2019 equity covenant contained in several of our debt agreements requires us to maintain total stockholders\u2019 equity of no less than $110.0 million. At December 31, 2018, our total stockholders\u2019 equity was $124.0 million. In addition, several of our debt agreements include a requirement that we maintain a net asset value, as defined in the agreements, of $125 million, and certain of our debt agreements include a requirement that we maintain a promissory note debt-to-gross asset value, as defined in the agreement, of less than 50 percent. As of December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with all financial covenants or had received waivers from lenders for noncompliance (see Note 5). Our Comerica credit facility and other debt arrangements contain several significant limitations restricting our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nBorrow additional money or issue guarantees;\n\u2022\nPay dividends or other distributions to shareholders;\n\u2022\nMake loans, advances or other investments;\n\u2022\nCreate liens on assets;\n\u2022\nSell assets;\n\u2022\nEnter into sale-leaseback transactions;\n\u2022\nEnter into transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022\nEngage in mergers or consolidations.\nFailure to obtain necessary bank consents or to comply with any of the restrictions or covenants in our loan documents could result in a default that may, if not cured or waived, accelerate the payment under our debt obligations which would likely have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. Certain of our debt arrangements have cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions. When present, these provisions could have a wider impact on liquidity than might otherwise arise from a default or acceleration of a single debt instrument. We cannot assure you that we could adequately address any such defaults, cross-defaults or acceleration of our debt payment obligations in a sufficient or timely manner, or at all. Our ability to comply with our covenants will depend upon our future economic performance. These covenants may adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations, satisfy our capital needs or engage in other business activities that may be desirable or advantageous to us. See Note 5 for additional discussion of our restrictive covenants.\nIn order to maintain compliance with the covenants in our debt agreements and carry out our business plan, we may need to raise additional capital through equity transactions, including project-level equity financing of our subsidiaries or obtain waivers or modifications of covenants from our lenders. Such additional funding may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all, when needed. We also may need to incur additional indebtedness in the future in the ordinary course of business to fund our development projects and our operations. There can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available when needed or, if available, offered on acceptable terms. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the risks described above could intensify.\nIncreases in interest rates will increase our interest expense and may adversely affect our cash flow, and changes in how LIBOR, the London interbank offered rate, is determined, or the potential replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate, may adversely affect our interest expense.\nWe have incurred, and may in the future incur, additional indebtedness that bears interest at a variable rate. Our consolidated debt at December 31, 2018 was $295.5 million, of which 51 percent was variable-rate debt. An increase in interest rates would increase our interest expense and increase the cost of refinancing existing debt and issuing new debt, which would adversely affect our cash flow. In addition, if we need to repay existing debt during periods of rising interest rates, we could be required to liquidate one or more of our investments at times that may not permit realization of the maximum return on such investments. The effect of prolonged interest rate increases could adversely impact our ability to make purchases and develop properties. We may seek to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility by using interest rate hedging arrangements, such as interest rate swap agreements. These agreements involve certain additional risks.\nLIBOR is widely used as a reference for setting the interest rate on loans globally. We have used LIBOR as a reference rate in our promissory notes, loans, credit facilities, and other debt agreements such that the interest due to our creditors pursuant to these loans is calculated using LIBOR. LIBOR, in its current form, is currently scheduled to be phased out by the end of 2021. Before LIBOR ceases to exist, we may need to renegotiate our debt agreements that utilize LIBOR as a factor in determining the interest rate to replace LIBOR with a new standard, which has yet to be established. The full consequences of these developments cannot be predicted, but they could result in higher interest obligations than under the current form of LIBOR.\nWe are vulnerable to concentration risks because our operations are primarily located in the Austin, Texas area.\nOur real estate operations are primarily, and our hotel and entertainment venue operations are entirely, located in Austin, Texas. While our real estate operations have expanded to include select markets in Texas outside of Austin, including College Station, Kingwood, Magnolia, West Killeen and New Caney, the geographic concentration of the majority of our operations we may have under development at a given time means that our operations are more vulnerable to local economic, regulatory, and other conditions (such as local periods of economic slowdown or recession, business layoffs or downsizing, industry slowdowns, relocations of businesses, increases in real estate and other taxes and the cost of complying with governmental regulations or increased regulation) and adverse project-specific risks than those of larger, more diversified companies. The performance of the Austin economy and our other select markets in Texas greatly affects our sales and consequently the underlying values of our properties. We cannot assure you that these markets will continue to grow or that underlying real estate fundamentals will continue to be favorable. Our geographic concentration may create increased vulnerability during regional economic downturns, which can significantly affect our financial condition and results of operations. See \u201cOverview - Real Estate Market Conditions\u201d in Part II, Items 7. and 7A. for more information.\nThe success of our business is significantly related to general economic conditions and, accordingly, our business could be harmed by any slowdown or deterioration in the economy.\nPeriods of economic uncertainty, weakness or recession; significantly rising interest rates; declining employment levels; declining demand for real estate; declining real estate values; conditions which negatively shape public perception of travel, including travel-related accidents, the financial condition of the airline, automotive and other transportation-related industries; or the public perception that any of these events or conditions may occur or be present, may negatively affect our business. These economic conditions can result in a general decline in acquisition, disposition and leasing activity, demand for hotel rooms and related lodging services, a general decline in the value of real estate and in rents, which in turn reduces revenue derived from property sales and leases and hotel operations as well as revenues associated with development activities. These conditions can also lead to a decline in property sales prices as well as a decline in funds invested in existing commercial real estate and related assets and properties planned for development. Other factors that could influence demand in our industries include increases in fuel costs, conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets, interest rates, labor costs, access to credit on reasonable terms, geopolitical issues and other macroeconomic factors. In addition, during periods of economic slowdown and recession, many consumers have historically reduced their discretionary spending, and our hotel and entertainment businesses depend on discretionary consumer and corporate spending. A reduction in consumer spending historically is accompanied by a decrease in hotel occupancy rates and attendance at live entertainment, sporting and leisure events, which may result in reductions in ticket sales, sponsorship opportunities and our ability to generate revenue with our hotel and entertainment businesses.\nDuring an economic downturn, investment capital is usually constrained and it may take longer for us to dispose of real estate investments. As a result, the value of our real estate investments may be reduced increasing the risk for asset impairments and write-offs and we could realize losses or diminished profitability. If economic and market conditions decline, our business performance and profitability could deteriorate. If this were to occur, we could fail to comply with certain financial covenants in our debt agreements, which would force us to seek waivers or amendments with our lenders. No assurance can be given that we would be able to obtain any necessary waivers or amendments on satisfactory terms, if at all.\nAdverse weather conditions or natural disasters could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by weather conditions, including natural disasters, in or near our areas of operations. For our real estate operations, adverse weather may delay development or damage property resulting in substantial repair or replacement costs to the extent not covered by insurance, cause shortages and price increases in labor or raw materials, reduce property values, or a loss of revenue, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our competitors may be affected differently by such changes in weather conditions or natural disasters depending on the location of their supplies or operations. Because of weather conditions, we may be required to cancel or reschedule an event to another available day, which would increase our costs for the event and could negatively affect the attendance at the event, as well as concession and merchandise sales, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur insurance coverage on our properties may be inadequate to cover any losses we may incur.\nWe maintain insurance on our properties, including business interruption, property, liability, fire and extended coverage. However, there are certain types of losses, generally of a catastrophic nature, such as floods or acts of war or terrorism that may be uninsurable or not economical to insure. We use our discretion when determining amounts, coverage limits and deductibles for insurance. These terms are determined based on retaining an acceptable level of risk at a reasonable cost. This may result in insurance coverage that in the event of a substantial loss would not be sufficient to pay the full current market value or current replacement cost of our lost investment. Inflation, changes in building codes and ordinances, environmental considerations and other factors also may make it unfeasible to use insurance proceeds to replace a building or other facility after it has been damaged or destroyed. Under such circumstances, the insurance proceeds we receive may be inadequate to restore our economic position in a property. In addition, we may become liable for injuries and accidents occurring during the construction process that are underinsured. A significant uninsured loss could materially and adversely affect our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe loss of certain key senior management personnel could negatively affect our business.\nWe depend on the experience and knowledge of our two executive officers and other key personnel who have been instrumental in setting our strategic direction and executing on our business strategy, have extensive market knowledge and relationships and exercise substantial influence over our operational, financing, development and construction activities. Among the reasons that these individuals are important to our success is that each has a regional industry reputation that attracts business and investment opportunities and assists us in negotiations with lenders, existing and potential tenants, community stakeholders and industry personnel. Our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer has been employed by the company since its inception in 1992. He has served as President since August 1996, Chief Executive Officer since May 1998 and Chairman of the Board of Directors (Board) since August 1998. Our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer has been employed by the company since 2009. The loss of any of our key senior management personnel could negatively affect our business.\nOur business may be adversely affected by information technology disruptions and the failure to maintain the integrity of guest, employee or company data could result in harm to our reputation, and result in a loss of business and/or subject us to costs, fines, investigations, enforcement actions, or lawsuits.\nMany of our business and operational processes are dependent on traditional and emerging technology systems to conduct day-to-day operations and lower costs. As our dependence on information systems, including those of third party service providers and vendors such as our hotel operator, third party ticket sales, or third party hotel bookings, grows, we become more vulnerable to an increasing threat of continually evolving cybersecurity risks. Cybersecurity incidents are increasing in frequency and magnitude. These incidents may include, but are not limited to, installation of malicious software, phishing, credential attacks, unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and the corruption of data. Our systems are also vulnerable to damage or interruption from fire, floods, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, break-ins, and similar events. These or similar occurrences could also lead to interruptions or delays in the operation of our systems resulting in business impact, including loss of business.\nWe and our hotel operator rely on the availability of information technology systems to operate our business. Our reliance on computer, Internet-based and mobile systems and communications and the frequency and sophistication of efforts by hackers to gain unauthorized access or prevent authorized access to such systems have greatly increased in recent years. The integrity and protection of guest, employee and company data, as well as the continuous operation of our systems, are critical to our business. Efforts to hack or breach security measures, disruptions or failures of systems or software to operate as designed or intended, viruses, \u201cransomware\u201d or other malware, operator error, or inadvertent releases of data may materially impact our information systems and records and those of our hotel operator. A significant theft, loss, loss of access to, or fraudulent use of guest, employee, or company data could adversely impact our reputation and could result in a loss of business, as well as remedial and other expenses, fines, litigation, investigations, enforcement actions, or lawsuits. In addition, any disruption in the functioning of our hotel manager\u2019s reservation systems could adversely affect our performance and results.\nWe have experienced targeted and non-targeted cybersecurity incidents in the past and may experience them in the future. While these cybersecurity incidents did not result in any material loss to us or interrupt our day-to-day operations, there can be no assurance that we will not experience any such losses in the future. We believe we have implemented appropriate measures to mitigate potential risks. However, given the unpredictability of the timing and the evolving nature and scope of information technology disruptions, the various procedures and controls we use to monitor and protect against these threats and to mitigate our potential risks to such threats may not be sufficient in preventing cybersecurity incidents from materializing. Further, as cybersecurity threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities to cybersecurity threats.\nFailure to succeed in new markets may limit our growth.\nWe have acquired in the past, and we may acquire in the future if appropriate opportunities arise, properties that are outside of Austin, Texas, our primary market. For example, we have properties in College Station, Kingwood, Magnolia, West Killeen and New Caney. Any success we have experienced in Austin in the past, does not indicate future success in these new markets. Our historical experience in existing markets does not ensure that we will be able to operate successfully in new markets. Entering into new markets exposes us to a variety of risks, including difficulty evaluating local market conditions and local economies, developing new business relationships in the area, competing with other companies that already have an established presence in the area, hiring and retaining key personnel, evaluating quality tenants in the area, and a lack of familiarity with local governmental and permitting procedures. Furthermore, expansion into new markets may divert management time and other resources away from our current primary market. As a result, we may not be successful in expanding into new markets, which could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, cash available for distribution, and ability to service our debt obligations.\nPart of our business strategy is dependent on maintaining strong relationships with key anchor tenants and our inability to do so could adversely affect our business. In addition, our key anchor tenants may have interests that differ from ours, which could adversely affect us.\nWe have formed strategic relationships with key anchor tenants as part of our overall strategy for particular development projects and may enter into other similar arrangements in the future. For example, our West Killeen Market, Jones Crossing, Kingwood Place, Magnolia and New Caney mixed-use development projects are each anchored by an HEB grocery. Any deterioration in our relationship with HEB or our inability to form strategic relationships with key anchor tenants or enter into other similar arrangements in the future could adversely affect our business.\nWhile key anchor tenants bring local credibility, enhance our ability to attract other tenants or customers to the area or offer other competitive attributes, they may have the ability to exert influence over our development projects through restrictive lease covenants (such as exclusive use covenants or prohibited use covenants) that restrict our rights or have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours or that are influenced by factors unrelated to our business. We may also be subject to reputational harm or the value of our properties may be adversely affected if the reputation or financial position of any of our key anchor tenants deteriorates.\nRisks Relating to Real Estate Operations\nThere can be no assurance that all of the properties in our active development pipeline will be completed in their entirety in accordance with the anticipated timing or cost, or that we will achieve the results we expect from the development of such properties, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations.\nWe currently have several active development projects, including Lantana Place, Jones Crossing, Kingwood Place, Santal Phase II, The Saint Mary and Amarra Villas. The development of the projects in our active development pipeline is subject to numerous risks, many of which are outside of our control. The cost necessary to complete the development of our active development pipeline could be materially higher than we anticipate. In addition, we could decide not to undertake construction on one or more of the projects in our development pipeline if our pre-leasing or financing efforts are unsuccessful. Furthermore, if we are delayed in the completion of any development project, tenants may have the right to terminate pre-development leases, which could materially and adversely affect the financial viability of the project. In addition, even if we decide to commence construction on a project, we can provide no assurances that we will complete any of the projects in our active development pipeline on the anticipated schedule or within the budget, or that, once completed, the properties in our development pipeline will achieve the results that we expect. If the development of the projects in our development pipeline is not completed in accordance with our anticipated timing or at the anticipated cost, or the properties fail to achieve the financial results we expect, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe real estate business is highly competitive and many of our competitors are larger and financially stronger than we are.\nThe real estate business is highly competitive. We compete with a large number of companies and individuals that have significantly greater financial, sales, marketing and other resources than we have. Our competitors include local developers who are committed primarily to particular markets and also national developers who acquire and develop properties throughout the United States. Competition may increase the demand for the types of properties in which we typically invest and, therefore, reduce the number of suitable investment opportunities available to us and increase the purchase prices for such properties. In addition, a downturn in the real estate industry could significantly increase competition among developers. Increased competition could cause us to increase our selling incentives, lose existing or potential tenants, offer more substantial rent abatements, tenant improvement allowances, early termination rights, below-market renewal options, or other incentives in order to retain tenants when our tenants' leases expire, and reduce our prices. An oversupply of real estate properties available for sale or lease, as well as the potential significant discounting of prices by some of our competitors, may adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur results of operations, cash flows and financial condition are greatly affected by the performance of the real estate industry.\nRevenue from our real estate operations segment accounted for 19 percent of our total revenue for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. The U.S. real estate industry is highly cyclical and is affected by changes in global, national and local economic conditions and events such as general employment and income levels, availability of financing, interest rates, consumer confidence and spending, and overbuilding of or decrease in demand for residential and commercial real estate. Our real estate activities are subject to numerous factors beyond our control, including local real estate market conditions (both where our properties are located and in areas where our potential customers reside), substantial existing and potential competition, general national, regional and local economic, political and social conditions, fluctuations in interest rates and mortgage availability, over-building in our markets, a decline in brick-and-mortar retail industry, changes in demographic conditions, changes in tenant preferences and changes in government regulations or requirements, including tax law changes. Any of the foregoing factors could result in a reduction or cancellation of sales and/or lower gross margins for sales. Lower than expected sales could have a material adverse effect on the level of our profits and the timing and amounts of our cash flows.\nReal estate investments often cannot easily be converted into cash and market values may be adversely affected by these economic circumstances, market fundamentals, and competitive and demographic conditions. Because of the effect these factors have on real estate values, it is difficult to predict the level of future sales or sales prices that will be realized for individual assets. In addition, validating third party pricing for illiquid assets may be more subjective than more liquid assets. We cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any property for the price or on the terms set by us or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us. We also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property. To the extent we are unable to sell any properties for our book value, we may be required to take a non-cash impairment charge or loss on the sale, either of which would reduce our net income or increase our net loss. See \"Critical Accounting Policies\" in Part II, Items 7. and 7A. for more information.\nOur operations are subject to an intensive regulatory approval process and opposition from environmental and special interest groups, either or both of which could cause delays and increase the costs of our development efforts or preclude such developments entirely.\nReal estate projects must generally comply with local land development regulations and may need to comply with state and federal regulations. Before we can develop a property, we must obtain a variety of approvals from local and state governments with respect to such matters as zoning and other land use entitlements and issues, and subdivision, site planning and environmental issues under applicable regulations. Some of these approvals are discretionary. Obtaining all of the necessary permits and entitlements to develop a parcel of land is often difficult, costly and may take several years, or more, to complete. In some situations, we may be unable to obtain the necessary permits and/or entitlements to proceed with a real estate development or may be required to alter our plans for the development. Because government agencies and special interest groups have in the past expressed concerns about our development plans in or near Austin and in the future may express similar concerns in or near Austin and in our other select markets in Texas, our ability to develop these properties and realize future income from our properties could be delayed, reduced, prevented or made more expensive. In addition, any failure to comply with these laws or regulations could result in capital or operating expenditures or the imposition of significant financial penalties or restrictions on our operations that could adversely affect present and future operations or our ability to sell, and thereby, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nSeveral special interest groups have in the past opposed our plans in the Austin area and have taken various actions to partially or completely restrict development in some areas, including areas where some of our most valuable properties are located. We have actively opposed these actions. However, because of the regulatory environment that has existed in the Austin area and the opposition of these special interest groups, there can be no assurance that an unfavorable ruling would not have a significant long-term adverse effect on the overall value of our property holdings.\nOur operations are subject to environmental regulation, which can change at any time and could increase our costs.\nReal estate development is subject to state and federal environmental regulations and to possible interruption or termination because of environmental considerations, including, without limitation, air and water quality and protection of endangered species and their habitats. In addition, in those cases where an endangered or threatened species is involved and agency rulemaking and litigation are ongoing, the outcome of such rulemaking and litigation can be unpredictable, and at any time can result in unplanned or unforeseeable restrictions on or even the prohibition of development in identified environmentally sensitive areas.\nCertain of the Barton Creek and Lantana properties include nesting territories for the golden-cheeked warbler, a federally listed endangered species. In 1995, we received a permit from the U.S. Wildlife Service pursuant to the Endangered Species Act, which to date has allowed the development of the Barton Creek and Lantana properties free of restrictions under the Endangered Species Act related to the maintenance of habitat for the golden-cheeked warbler.\nAdditionally, in April 1997, the U.S. Department of Interior listed the Barton Springs salamander as an endangered species after a federal court overturned a March 1997 decision by the Department of Interior not to list the Barton Springs salamander based on a conservation agreement between the State of Texas and federal agencies. The listing of the Barton Springs salamander has not affected, nor do we anticipate it will affect, our Barton Creek and Lantana properties for several reasons, including the results of technical studies and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 10(a) permit obtained by us in 1995. The development permitted by the 2002 Circle C settlement with the city of Austin has been reviewed and approved by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and, as a result, we also do not anticipate that the 1997 listing of the Barton Springs salamander will affect our Circle C properties.\nIn January 2013, the U.S. Department of the Interior announced that it had conducted an economic assessment of the potential designation of critical habitat for four species of Central Texas salamanders. Although this potential designation of habitat has not affected, nor do we anticipate that it will affect, our Barton Creek, Lantana or Circle C properties for several reasons, including prior studies and approvals and our existing U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 10(a) permit obtained in 1995, future endangered species listings or habitat designations could impact development of our properties.\nUnder various federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the environment, as a current or former owner or operator of real property, we may be liable for costs and damages resulting from the presence or discharge of hazardous or toxic substances, waste or petroleum products at, on, in, under or migrating through, whether generated from our property or other property, including costs to investigate and clean up such contamination and liability for harm to natural resources. The costs of removal or remediation, and the impact on the development potential and development timeline could be substantial. These laws often impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of any hazardous or toxic substances. Environmental laws also may impose restrictions on the manner in which a property may be used or businesses may be operated, and these restrictions may require substantial expenditures. Environmental laws provide for sanctions in the event of noncompliance and may be enforced by governmental agencies or, in certain circumstances, by private parties. Certain environmental laws and common law principles could be used to impose liability for release of and exposure to hazardous substances, including asbestos and other airborne contaminants. In addition, third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury or property damage associated with exposure to released hazardous substances. The cost of defending against claims of liability, of compliance with environmental regulatory requirements, of remediating any contaminated property, or of paying personal injury claims could materially adversely affect our business, assets or results of operations and, consequently, amounts available for distributions to our shareholders.\nFrom time to time, the Environmental Protection Agency and similar federal, state or local agencies review land developers\u2019 compliance with environmental laws and may levy fines and penalties for failure to strictly comply with applicable environmental laws or impose additional requirements for future compliance as a result of past failures. Any such actions taken with respect to us may increase our costs and result in project delays. We are making, and will continue to make, expenditures with respect to our real estate development for the protection of the environment. Emphasis on environmental matters will result in additional costs in the future. New environmental regulations or changes in existing regulations or their enforcement may be enacted and such new regulations or changes may require significant expenditures by us. The recent trend toward stricter standards in environmental legislation and regulations is likely to continue and could have a material adverse effect on our operating costs.\nRisks Relating to Leasing Operations\nUnfavorable changes in market and economic conditions could negatively affect occupancy or rental rates, which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nA decline in the real estate market and economic conditions could significantly affect rental rates. Occupancy and rental rates in our market, in turn, could significantly affect our profitability and our ability to satisfy our financial obligations. The risks that could affect conditions in our market include the following:\n\u2022\nLocal conditions, such as an oversupply of office and retail space, a decline in the demand for office and retail space or increased competition from other available office and retail buildings;\n\u2022\nThe inability or unwillingness of tenants to pay their current rent or rent increases; and\n\u2022\nDeclines in market rental rates.\nAdditionally, tenants at our retail properties face continual competition in attracting customers from various on-line and other competitors. Our competitors and those of our tenants could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease space in our retail properties, maintain occupancy levels and on the rents we can charge or the concessions we can grant. Further, as new technologies emerge, the relationship among customers, retailers, and shopping centers are evolving on a rapid basis. If we are unable to adapt to such new technologies and relationships on a timely basis, our financial performance will be adversely impacted.\nWe cannot predict with certainty whether any of these conditions will occur or whether, and to what extent, they will have an adverse effect on our operations.\nRisks Relating to Hotel Operations\nWe are subject to the business, financial and operating risks common to the hotel industry, any of which could reduce our revenues and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nRevenue from our hotel segment accounted for 43 percent of our total revenue for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. Business, financial and operating risks common to the hotel industry include:\n\u2022\nChanges in desirability of geographic regions or travel patterns of customers and geographic concentration of our operations and customers;\n\u2022\nChanges and volatility in general economic conditions;\n\u2022\nDecreases in the demand for hotel rooms and related lodging services, including a reduction in business travel as a result of alternatives to in-person meetings (including virtual meetings hosted online or over private teleconferencing networks) or because of general economic conditions;\n\u2022\nIncreases in fixed costs, including increases in commercial property taxes;\n\u2022\nDecreased corporate or governmental travel-related budgets and spending, as well as cancellations, deferrals or renegotiations of group business such as industry conventions;\n\u2022\nNegative public perception of corporate travel-related activities;\n\u2022\nThe effect of internet intermediaries and other new industry entrants on pricing and our increasing reliance on technology;\n\u2022\nThe costs and administrative burdens associated with complying with applicable laws and regulations in the U.S., including health, safety and environmental laws, rules and regulations and other governmental and regulatory actions and obtaining and maintain necessary licenses and permits to operate;\n\u2022\nSpending more than budgeted amounts to make necessary improvements or renovations;\n\u2022\nChanges in operating costs including, but not limited to, energy, water, labor (including the effect of labor shortages, unionization and minimum wage increases), food, workers\u2019 compensation and health-care, insurance and unanticipated costs related to force majeure events and their consequences;\n\u2022\nDecreased airline capacities and routes;\n\u2022\nSeasonality of the hotel industry and the Austin market;\n\u2022\nAttractiveness of properties and services to consumers; and\n\u2022\nCyclical over-building in the hotel industry.\nExternal perception of the W Austin Hotel could negatively affect our results of operations.\nStarwood manages hotel operations at the W Austin Hotel. Our ability to attract and retain guests depends, in part, upon the external perceptions and market recognition of Starwood and the quality of the W Austin Hotel and its services. We may be required to spend money periodically to keep the property well maintained, modernized and refurbished. The reputation of the W Austin Hotel may be negatively affected if Starwood fails to act responsibly or comply with regulatory requirements in a number of areas, such as safety and security, sustainability, responsible tourism, environmental management, human rights and support for the local communities where Starwood manages and/or owns properties. The considerable increase in the use of social media over recent years has greatly expanded the potential scope and scale, and increased the rapidity of the dissemination of negative publicity that could be generated by any adverse incident or failure on the part of hotel operators. An adverse incident involving associates or guests and any media coverage resulting therefrom may cause a loss of consumer confidence in the Starwood brand which could negatively affect our results of operations.\nOur revenues, profits or market share could be harmed if we are unable to compete effectively in the hotel industry in Austin.\nThe hotel industry in Austin is highly competitive. The W Austin Hotel competes for customers with other hotel and resort properties in Austin, ranging from national and international hotel brands to independent, local and regional hotel operators. We compete based on a number of factors, including quality and consistency of rooms, restaurant, bar and meeting facilities and services, attractiveness of location and price, and other amenities. Some of our competitors may have substantially greater marketing and financial resources than we do, and if we are unable to successfully compete in these areas, our operating results could be adversely affected.\nHistorically, the Austin market has had a limited number of high-end hotel accommodations. However, hotel capacity is being expanded by other hotel operators in Austin, including several properties in close proximity to the W Austin Hotel in downtown Austin. This increase in competition as well as the anticipated opening of additional hotel rooms in downtown Austin during 2019, is expected to further impact future hotel revenues. As new rooms come on-line, increased competition could lead to an excess supply of hotel rooms in the Austin market, thereby causing Starwood to increase promotional incentives for hotel guests and/or reduce rates. Increased competition in the Austin market from new hotels or hotels that have recently undergone expansion or renovation could have an adverse effect on occupancy, average daily rate and revenue per available room.\nAdditionally, some of our hotel rooms are booked through third-party internet travel intermediaries as well as lesser-known online travel service providers. Furthermore, travelers can book stays on websites that facilitate the short-term rental of homes and apartments from owners, thereby providing an alternative to hotel rooms. Increased internet bookings could have an adverse effect on occupancy, average daily rate and revenue per available room.\nRisks Relating to Entertainment Businesses\nWe face intense competition in the live music industry, and we may not be able to maintain or increase our current revenue, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRevenue from our entertainment businesses accounted for 26 percent of our total revenue for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. Our entertainment businesses compete in a highly competitive industry, and we may not be able to maintain or increase our current revenue as a result of such competition. The live music industry competes with other forms of entertainment for consumers\u2019 discretionary spending and within this industry we compete with other venues to book artists. Our competitors compete with us for key personnel who have relationships with popular music artists and that have a history of being able to book such artists for concerts and tours. These competitors may engage in more extensive development efforts, undertake more far-reaching marketing campaigns, adopt more aggressive pricing policies and make more attractive offers to existing and potential artists. Our competitors may develop services, advertising options or music venues that are equal or superior to those we provide or that achieve greater market acceptance and brand recognition than we achieve. It is possible that new competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share.\nOther variables related to our entertainment businesses that could adversely affect our financial performance by, among other things, leading to decreases in overall revenue, the number of sponsors, event attendance, ticket prices and fees or profit margins include:\n\u2022\nAn increased level of competition for advertising dollars, which may lead to lower sponsorships as we attempt to retain advertisers or which may cause us to lose advertisers to our competitors offering better programs that we are unable or unwilling to match;\n\u2022\nUnfavorable fluctuations in operating costs, which we may be unwilling or unable to pass through to our customers via ticket prices;\n\u2022\nCompetitors\u2019 offerings that may include more favorable terms than we do in order to obtain events for the venues they operate;\n\u2022\nEvent, tour and artist cancellations;\n\u2022\nOur ability to anticipate and respond to changes in consumer preferences and to offer events that appeal to them;\n\u2022\nTechnological changes and innovations that we are unable to adopt or are late in adopting that offer more attractive entertainment alternatives than we or other live entertainment providers currently offer, which may lead to a reduction in attendance at live events, a loss of ticket sales or lower ticket fees;\n\u2022\nOther entertainment options available to our audiences that we do not offer;\n\u2022\nGeneral economic conditions which could cause our consumers to reduce discretionary spending;\n\u2022\nUnfavorable changes in labor conditions which may require us to spend more to retain and attract key employees;\n\u2022\nInterruptions in our computer, communications, information and ticketing systems and infrastructures and data loss or other breaches of our network security; and\n\u2022\nOccurrence and threat of extraordinary events, such as terrorist attacks, intentional or unintentional mass-casualty incidents such as active shooter incidents, public health concerns such as contagious disease outbreaks, weather conditions, natural disasters or similar events that may require us to cancel or reschedule an event.\nAdditionally, our entertainment operations are seasonal. The results of operations from our entertainment segment vary from quarter to quarter and year to year, and the financial performance in certain quarters or years may not be indicative of, or comparable to, our financial performance in subsequent quarters or years.\nPersonal injuries and accidents may occur in connection with our live music events, which could subject us to personal injury or other claims and increase our expenses, as well as reduce attendance at our live music events, causing a decrease in our revenue.\nThere are inherent risks involved with producing live music events. As a result, personal injuries and accidents have, and may, occur from time to time, which could subject us to claims and liabilities for personal injuries. Incidents in connection with our live music events at ACL Live could also result in claims or reduce attendance at our events, which could cause a decrease in our revenue or reduce our operating income. We maintain insurance policies that provide coverage for personal injuries sustained by persons at our venues or events or accidents in the ordinary course of business, and there can be no assurance that such insurance will be adequate at all times and in all circumstances.\nRisks Relating to Ownership of Shares of Our Common Stock\nOur common stock is thinly traded; therefore, our stock price may fluctuate more than the stock market as a whole.\nAs a result of the thin trading market for shares of our common stock, our stock price may fluctuate significantly more than the stock market as a whole or the stock prices of similar companies. Without a larger public float, shares of our common stock will be less liquid than the shares of common stock of companies with broader public ownership, and as a result, the trading prices for shares of our common stock may be more volatile. Among other things, trading of a relatively small volume of shares of our common stock may have a greater effect on the trading price than would be the case if our public float were larger.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law may make an acquisition of us more difficult.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law may make an acquisition of us more difficult. These provisions:\n\u2022\nProvide for a classified Board serving staggered three-year terms;\n\u2022\nAuthorize the Board to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval and to designate the rights, preferences and privileges of each class; if issued, such preferred stock would increase the number of outstanding shares of our capital stock and could include terms that may deter an acquisition of us;\n\u2022\nEstablish advance notice requirements for nominations to the Board or for proposals that can be presented at stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\nLimit who may call stockholder meetings or act by written consent; and\n\u2022\nRequire a supermajority stockholder vote for certain transactions with a 20% stockholder, subject to certain exceptions.\nThese provisions may discourage potential takeover attempts, discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over market price or adversely affect the market price of, and the voting and other rights of the holders of, our common stock. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors other than the candidates nominated by our Board.\nIn addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may prohibit large stockholders from consummating a merger with, or acquisition of, us. These provisions may deter an acquisition of us that might otherwise be attractive to our stockholders.\nWe may not pay dividends on our common stock or repurchase shares of our common stock.\nHolders of our common stock are only entitled to receive dividends when and if they are declared by our Board. Further, our Comerica credit facility prohibits us from paying a dividend on our common stock without the bank\u2019s prior written consent. Although we declared a special cash dividend on our common stock in March 2017 after receiving written consent from Comerica Bank, we are not required to do so and we may not pay special cash dividends in the future. Comerica\u2019s consent to the payment of a dividend in March 2017 is not indicative of the bank\u2019s willingness to consent to the payment of future dividends. Additionally, our Comerica credit facility contains a restrictive covenant limiting common stock repurchases to $1.0 million in the aggregate during the term of the facility. Any repurchases of our common stock in excess of $1.0 million would require a waiver from Comerica. The declaration of future dividends and share repurchases, which is subject to our Board's discretion and the restrictions under our Comerica credit facility, will depend on our financial results, cash requirements, projected compliance with covenants in our debt agreements, outlook and other factors deemed relevant by our Board.", "PERMNO": 77790, "SIC": 7011, "TIC": "STRS"}
