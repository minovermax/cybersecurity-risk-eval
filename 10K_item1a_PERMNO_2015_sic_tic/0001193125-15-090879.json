{"cik": "1057083", "company": "PC TEL INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-13", "item_1A": "Item 1A: Risk Factors\nFactors That May Affect Our Business, Financial Condition and Future Operations\nRisks Related to Our Business\nCompetition within the wireless product industry is intense and is expected to increase significantly. Our failure to compete successfully could materially harm our prospects and financial results.\nThe antenna market is highly fragmented and is served by many local product providers. We may not be able to displace established competitors from their customer base with our products.\nMany of our present and potential competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing, technical and other resources with which to pursue engineering, manufacturing, marketing, and distribution of their products. These competitors may succeed in establishing technology standards or strategic alliances in the connectivity products markets, obtain more rapid market acceptance for their products, or otherwise gain a competitive advantage. We can offer no assurance that we will succeed in developing products or technologies that are more effective than those developed by our competitors. We can offer no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against existing and new competitors as the connectivity wireless markets evolve and the level of competition increases.\nOur wireless business is dependent upon the continued growth and evolution of the wireless industry.\nOur future success is dependent upon the continued growth and evolution of the wireless industry. The growth in demand for wireless products and services may not continue at its current rate or at all. Any decrease in the growth of the wireless industry could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations.\nOur future success depends on our ability to develop and successfully introduce new and enhanced products for the wireless market that meet the needs of our customers.\nOur revenue depends on our ability to anticipate our existing and prospective customers\u2019 needs and develop products that address those needs. Our future success will depend on our ability to introduce new products for the wireless market, anticipate improvements and enhancements in wireless technology and wireless standards, and to develop products that are competitive in the rapidly changing wireless industry. Introduction of new products and product enhancements will require coordination of our efforts with those of our customers, suppliers, and manufacturers to rapidly achieve volume production. If we fail to coordinate these efforts, develop product enhancements or introduce new products that meet the needs of our customers as scheduled, our operating results will be materially and adversely affected and our business and prospects will be harmed. We cannot assure that product introductions will meet the anticipated release schedules or that our wireless products will be competitive in the market. Furthermore, given the emerging nature of the wireless market, there can be no assurance our products and technology will not be rendered obsolete by alternative or competing technologies.\nWe may experience integration or other problems with potential acquisitions, which could have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations. New acquisitions could dilute the interests of existing stockholders, and the announcement of new acquisitions could result in a decline in the price of our common stock.\nWe may in the future make acquisitions of, or large investments in, businesses that offer products, services, and technologies that we believe would complement our products or services, including wireless products and technology. We may also make acquisitions of or investments in, businesses that we believe could expand our distribution channels. Even if we were to announce an acquisition, we may not be able to complete it. Additionally, any future acquisition or substantial investment would present numerous risks, including:\n\u2022\ndifficulty in integrating the technology, operations, internal accounting controls or work force of the acquired business with our existing business,\n\u2022\ndisruption of our on-going business,\n\u2022\ndifficulty in realizing the potential financial or strategic benefits of the transaction,\n\u2022\ndifficulty in maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies,\n\u2022\ndealing with tax, employment, logistics, and other related issues unique to international organizations and assets we acquire,\n\u2022\npossible impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of integration of new businesses and management personnel, and\n\u2022\nimpairment of assets related to resulting goodwill, and reductions in our future operating results from amortization of intangible assets.\nWe expect that future acquisitions could provide for consideration to be paid in cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination of cash and our common stock. If consideration for a transaction is paid in common stock, this would further dilute our existing stockholders. We may also incur debt to pay for an acquisition.\nOur gross profit may vary based on the mix of sales of our products, and these variations may cause our net income to decline.\nDepending on the mix of our products and services sold, our gross profit could vary significantly from quarter to quarter. Generally, antenna products and engineering services have a lower profit margin than scanning receiver products creating the variance in gross profits related to profit mix. In addition, due in part to the competitive pricing pressures that affect our products and in part to increasing component and manufacturing costs, we expect gross profit from both existing and future products to decrease over time. A variance or decrease of our gross profit could have a negative impact on our financial results and cause our net income to decline.\nAny delays in our sales cycles could result in customers canceling purchases of our products.\nSales cycles for our products with major customers can be lengthy, often lasting nine months or longer. In addition, it can take an additional nine months or more before a customer commences volume production of equipment that incorporates our products. Sales cycles with our major customers are lengthy for a number of reasons, including:\n\u2022\nour OEM customers and carriers usually complete a lengthy technical evaluation of our products, over which we have no control, before placing a purchase order,\n\u2022\nthe development and commercial introduction of products incorporating new technologies frequently are delayed.\nA significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed and is based in large part on our forecasts of volume and timing of orders. The lengthy sales cycles make forecasting the volume and timing of product orders difficult. In addition, the delays inherent in lengthy sales cycles raise additional risks of customer decisions to cancel or change product phases. If customer cancellations or product changes were to occur, this could result in the loss of anticipated sales without sufficient time for us to reduce our operating expenses.\nWe generally rely on independent companies to manufacture, assemble and test our products. If these companies do not meet their commitments to us, or if our own assembly operations are impaired, our ability to sell products to our customers would be impaired.\nWe have limited manufacturing capability. For some product lines we outsource the manufacturing, assembly, and testing of printed circuit board subsystems. For other product lines, we purchase completed hardware platforms and add our proprietary software. While there is no unique capability with these suppliers, any failure by these suppliers to meet delivery commitments would cause us to delay shipments and potentially be unable to accept new orders for product.\nIn addition, in the event that these suppliers discontinued the manufacture of materials used in our products, we would be forced to incur the time and expense of finding a new supplier or to modify our products in such a way that such materials were not necessary. Either of these alternatives could result in increased manufacturing costs and increased prices of our products.\nWe assemble our antenna products in our facilities located in Illinois and China. We may experience delays, disruptions, capacity constraints or quality control problems at our assembly facilities, which could result in lower yields or delays of product shipments to our customers. In addition, we are having a number of our antenna products manufactured in China via contract manufacturers. Any disruption of our own or contract manufacturers\u2019 operations could cause us to delay product shipments, which would negatively impact our sales, competitive reputation and position. In addition, if we do not accurately forecast demand for our products, we will have excess or insufficient parts to build our products, either of which could seriously affect our operating results.\nIn order for us to operate at a profitable level and continue to introduce and develop new products for emerging markets, we must attract and retain our executive officers and qualified technical, sales, support and other administrative personnel.\nOur performance is substantially dependent on the performance of our current executive officers and certain key engineering, sales, marketing, financial, technical and customer support personnel. If we lose the services of our executives or key employees, replacements could be difficult to recruit and, as a result, we may not be able to grow our business.\nCompetition for personnel, especially qualified engineering personnel, is intense. We are particularly dependent on our ability to identify, attract, motivate and retain qualified engineers with the requisite education, background and industry experience. As of December 31, 2014, we employed a total of 57 people in our research and development department. If we lose the services of one or more of our key engineering personnel, our ability to continue to develop products and technologies responsive to our markets may be impaired.\nWe may be subject to litigation regarding intellectual property associated with our wireless business and this could be costly to defend and could prevent us from using or selling the challenged technology.\nIn recent years, there has been significant litigation in the United States involving intellectual property rights. We expect potential claims in the future, including with respect to our wireless business. Intellectual property claims against us, and any resulting lawsuits, may result in our incurring significant expenses and could subject us to significant liability for damages and invalidate what we currently believe are our proprietary rights. These claims, regardless of their merits or outcome, would likely be time-consuming and expensive to resolve and could divert management\u2019s time and attention. This could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operation, financial condition and prospects. Any intellectual property litigation disputes related to our wireless business could also force us to do one or more of the following:\n\u2022\ncease selling, incorporating or using technology, products or services that incorporate the disputed intellectual property,\n\u2022\nobtain from the holder of the disputed intellectual property a license to sell or use the relevant technology, which license may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all, or\n\u2022\nredesign those products or services that incorporate the disputed intellectual property, which could result in substantial unanticipated development expenses.\nIf we are subject to a successful claim of infringement related to our wireless intellectual property and we fail to develop non-infringing intellectual property or license the infringed intellectual property on acceptable terms and on a timely basis, operating results could decline, and our ability to grow and sustain our wireless business could be materially and adversely affected. As a result, our business, financial condition, results of operation and prospects could be impaired.\nWe may in the future initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our intellectual property rights or to determine the scope and validity of our proprietary rights or the proprietary rights of our competitors. These claims could also result in significant expense and the diversion of technical and management personnel\u2019s attention.\nUndetected failures found in new products may result in a loss of customers or a delay in market acceptance of our products.\nTo date, we have not been made aware of any significant failures in our products. However, despite testing by us and by current and potential customers, errors may be found in new products after commencement of commercial shipments, which could result in loss of revenue, loss of customers or delay in market acceptance, any of which could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. We cannot assure that our efforts to monitor, develop, modify and implement appropriate test and manufacturing processes for our products will be sufficient to avoid failures in our products that result in delays in product shipment, replacement costs or potential damage to our reputation, any of which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nConducting business in foreign countries involve additional risks.\nA substantial portion of our manufacturing, research and development, and marketing activities is conducted outside the United States, including the United Kingdom, Israel, Hong Kong, and China. There are a number of risks inherent in doing business in foreign countries, including: unfavorable political or economic factors; unexpected legal or regulatory changes; lack of sufficient protection for intellectual property rights; difficulties in recruiting and retaining personnel and managing international operations; and less developed infrastructure. If we are unable to manage successfully these and other risks pertaining to our international activities, our operating results, cash flows and financial position could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur financial position and results of operations may be adversely affected if tax authorities challenge us and the tax challenges result in unfavorable outcomes.\nWe currently have international subsidiaries located in China, United Kingdom, and Israel as well as an international branch office located in Hong Kong. The complexities resulting from operating in several different tax jurisdictions increase our exposure to worldwide tax challenges. In the event a review of our tax filings results in unfavorable adjustments to our tax returns, our operating results, cash flows and financial position could be materially and adversely affected.\nConducting business in international markets involves foreign exchange rate exposure that may lead to reduced profitability.\nWe currently have operations in United Kingdom, Israel, Hong Kong, and China. Fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies may impact our revenues, cost of revenues and operating margins and may result in foreign currency translation gains and losses.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nChallenging economic conditions worldwide have from time to time contributed, and may continue to contribute, to slowdowns in the wireless industry at large, resulting in:\n\u2022\nreduced demand for our products as a result of continued constraints on corporate and government spending by our customers,\n\u2022\nincreased price competition for our products,\n\u2022\nrisk of excess and obsolete inventory,\n\u2022\nrisk of supply constraints,\n\u2022\nrisk of excess facilities and manufacturing capacity, and\n\u2022\nhigher costs as a percentage of revenue and higher interest expense.\nOur industry is characterized by rapidly changing technologies and rapidly changing competitive environments. If we are not successful in responding to these changes, our products may become obsolete and we may not be able to compete effectively.\nWe must continue to evaluate, develop and introduce technologically advanced products that will position us for possible growth in the wireless market. If we are not successful in doing so, our products may not be accepted in the market or may become obsolete and we may not be able to compete effectively.\nConsolidation and vertical integration in our industry, and particularly integration of our customers with our competitors, may significantly reduce our ability to successfully market our products to long-standing customers and may adversely affect our vertically integrated customers\u2019 ability to choose our products even if our products are technologically superior.\nChanges in laws or regulations, in particular future Federal Communications Commission (\u201cFCC\u201d) regulations or international regulations affecting the broadband market, internet service providers, or the communications industry, could negatively affect our ability to develop new technologies or sell new products and, therefore, reduce our profitability.\nThe jurisdiction of the FCC extends to the entire communications industry, including our customers and their products and services that incorporate our products. Future FCC regulations affecting the broadband access services industry, our customers or our products may harm our business. For example, future FCC regulatory policies that affect the availability of data and Internet services may impede our customers\u2019 penetration into their markets or affect the prices that they are able to charge. In addition, FCC regulatory policies that affect the specifications of wireless data devices may impede certain of our customers\u2019 ability to manufacture their products profitably, which could, in turn, reduce demand for our products. Furthermore, international regulatory bodies are beginning to adopt standards for the communications industry. Although our business has not been hurt by any regulations to date, in the future, delays caused by our compliance with regulatory requirements may result in order cancellations or postponements of product purchases by our customers, which would reduce our profitability.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nThe trading price of our stock price may be volatile based on a number of factors, many of which are not under our control.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been highly volatile. The common stock price fluctuated from a low of $7.00 to a high of $9.51 during 2014. Our stock price could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors, many of which are out of our control, including:\n\u2022\nadverse change in domestic or global economic conditions,\n\u2022\nnew products or services offered by us or our competitors,\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results,\n\u2022\nchanges in financial estimates by securities analysts,\n\u2022\nannouncements of technological innovations,\n\u2022\nour announcement of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments,\n\u2022\nconditions or trends in our industry,\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel,\n\u2022\nmergers and acquisitions, and\n\u2022\nsales of common stock by our stockholders or us or repurchases by us.\nIn addition, the NASDAQ Global Select Market, where many publicly held telecommunications companies, including PCTEL, are traded, often experiences extreme price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies.\nProvisions in our charter documents may inhibit a change of control or a change of management, which may cause the market price for our common stock to fall and may inhibit a takeover or change in our control that a stockholder may consider favorable.\nProvisions in our charter documents could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control transaction that our stockholders may favor. Specifically, our charter documents do not permit stockholders to act by written consent, do not permit stockholders to call a stockholders meeting, and provide for a classified board of directors, which means stockholders can only elect, or remove, a limited number of our directors in any given year. These provisions could have the effect of discouraging others from making tender offers for our shares, and as a result, these provisions may prevent the market price of our common stock\nfrom reflecting the effects of actual or rumored takeover attempts and may prevent stockholders from reselling their shares at or above the price at which they purchased their shares. These provisions may also prevent changes in our management that our stockholders may favor.\nOur board of directors has the authority to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series. The board of directors can fix the price, rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of this preferred stock without any further vote or action by our stockholders. The rights of the holders of our common stock will be affected by, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future. Further, the issuance of shares of preferred stock may delay or prevent a change in control transaction without further action by our stockholders. As a result, the market price of our common stock may drop.\nIf we are unable to successfully maintain processes and procedures required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 to achieve and maintain effective internal control over our financial reporting, our ability to provide reliable and timely financial reports could be harmed and our stock price could be adversely affected.\nWe must comply with the rules promulgated under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Section 404 requires an annual management report assessing the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and a report by our independent registered public accounting firm addressing this assessment.\nWhile we are expending significant resources in maintaining the necessary documentation and testing procedures required by Section 404, we cannot be certain that the actions we are taking to achieve and maintain our internal control over financial reporting will be adequate. If the processes and procedures that we implement for our internal control over financial reporting are inadequate, our ability to provide reliable and timely financial reports, and consequently our business and operating results, could be harmed. This in turn could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial reports, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.", "PERMNO": 87361, "SIC": 3663, "TIC": "PCTI"}
