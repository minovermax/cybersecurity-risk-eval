RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our common stock is speculative and illiquid and involves a high degree of risk including the risk of a loss of your entire investment. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and the other information contained in this report and our other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The risks set forth below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties may exist that could also adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition. If any of the following risks actually materialize, our business, financial condition and/or operations could suffer. In such event, the value of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or a substantial portion of the money that you pay for our common stock.\nRisk Related to our Company and our Business\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Capital\nWe are a clinical stage pharmaceutical company with a limited operating history.\nWe are a clinical stage pharmaceutical company with a limited operating history. We must complete clinical studies and other development activity and receive regulatory approval of a New Drug Application, or NDA, before commercial sales of a product can commence. The likelihood of success of our business plan must be considered in light of the problems, substantial expenses, difficulties, complications and delays frequently encountered in connection with developing and expanding early-stage businesses and the regulatory and competitive environment in which we operate. Pharmaceutical product development is a highly speculative undertaking, involves a substantial degree of risk and is a capital-intensive business.\nAccordingly, you should consider our prospects in light of the costs, uncertainties, delays and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in the early stages of development, especially clinical pharmaceutical companies such as ours. Potential investors should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties that a company with a limited operating history will face. In particular, potential investors should consider that we cannot assure you that we will be able to:\n\u25cf successfully implement or execute our current business plan, and we cannot assure you that our business plan is sound;\n\u25cf successfully manufacture our clinical products and establish commercial drug supply;\n\u25cf obtain Drug Enforcement Administration, or DEA, licenses necessary for the manufacturing of lenabasum and for evaluating lenabasum in our clinical trials;\n\u25cf successfully complete the preclinical and clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory approval for the marketing of our drug candidates, including lenabasum and our cannabinoid drug candidates;\n\u25cf secure market exclusivity and/or adequate intellectual property protection for our drug candidates;\n\u25cf attract and retain an experienced management and advisory team;\n\u25cf secure acceptance of our drug candidates in the medical community and with third party payors and consumers;\n\u25cf launch commercial sales of our drug candidates, whether alone or in collaboration with others; and\n\u25cf raise sufficient funds in the capital markets to effectuate our business plan.\nIf we cannot successfully execute any one of the foregoing, our business may not succeed and your investment will be adversely affected.\nWe have incurred operating losses in each year since our inception and expect to continue to incur substantial losses for the foreseeable future. We may never become profitable or, if we achieve profitability, be able to sustain profitability.\nWe expect to incur substantial expenses without corresponding revenues unless and until we are able to obtain regulatory approval and successfully commercialize any of our drug candidates. To date, we have not generated any revenue from our drug candidates and we expect to incur significant expense to complete our preclinical and clinical program for our drug candidates in the United States and elsewhere. We may never be able to obtain regulatory approval for the marketing of our drug candidates in any indication in the United States or internationally. Even if we are able to commercialize our drug candidates, there can be no assurance that we will generate significant revenues or ever achieve profitability. Our net losses for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 were approximately $111,269,000 and $71,454,000, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $304.1 million.\nWe may elect to pursue FDA approval for lenabasum in other indications and for other drug candidates, which will result in significant additional research and development expenses. As a result, we expect to continue to incur substantial losses for the foreseeable future, and these losses will increase. We are uncertain when or if we will be able to achieve or sustain profitability. If we achieve profitability in the future, we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods. Failure to become and remain profitable would impair our ability to sustain operations and adversely affect the price of our common stock and our ability to raise capital.\nOur cash or cash equivalents will only fund our operations for a limited time and we will need to raise additional capital to support our development and commercialization efforts.\nWe are currently operating at a loss and expect our operating costs will increase significantly as we incur further costs related to preclinical development and the clinical trials for our drug candidates. As of December 31, 2020, we held cash and cash equivalents of approximately $85.4 million.\nOn January 26, 2018, we entered into the Cystic Fibrosis Program Related Investment Agreement (the \u201cInvestment Agreement\u201d) with the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, a non-profit drug discovery and development corporation, pursuant to which we received a development award for up to $25 million in funding (the \u201c2018 CFF Award\u201d) to support a Phase 2b clinical trial (the \u201cPhase 2b Clinical Trial\u201d) of lenabasum in patients with cystic fibrosis, of which we received $22.5 million to date. The remainder of the 2018 CFF Award is payable to us incrementally upon the achievement of the remaining milestones related to the progress of the Phase 2b Clinical Trial, as set forth in the Investment Agreement and we expect to receive the remainder before the end of the first half of 2021.\nOn January 3, 2019, we entered into a strategic collaboration with Kaken Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (\u201cKaken\u201d) for the development and commercialization in Japan of lenabasum for the treatment of SSc and DM. Under the terms of the agreement, Kaken receives an exclusive license to commercialize and market lenabasum in Japan for SSc and DM. Kaken made an upfront payment to us of $27 million. We are eligible to receive in addition up to $173 million upon achievement of certain regulatory, development and sales milestones as well as double-digit royalties.\nOn July 28, 2020, we entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the \u201cLoan Agreement\u201d) with our subsidiary, Corbus Pharmaceuticals, Inc., as borrower, us, as guarantor, each lender party thereto (the \u201cLenders\u201d), K2 HealthVentures LLC (\u201cK2HV\u201d), an unrelated third party, as administrative agent for the Lenders, and Ankura Trust Company, LLC, an unrelated third party, as collateral agent for the Lenders, pursuant to which K2HV may provide us with term loans in an aggregate principal amount of up to a $50,000,000.\nOn August 7, 2020, we entered into an Open Market Sale AgreementSM (the \u201cAugust 2020 Sale Agreement\u201d) with Jefferies LLC (\u201cJefferies\u201d), as sales agent, pursuant to which we may issue and sell, from time to time, through Jefferies, shares of our common stock. We will pay Jefferies a commission of 3.0% of the aggregate gross proceeds from each sale of common stock and have agreed to provide Jefferies with customary indemnification and contribution rights. We have also agreed to reimburse Jefferies for certain specified expenses. As of August 7, 2020, we were authorized to offer and sell up to $150 million of our common stock pursuant to the August 2020 Sale Agreement. As of December 31, 2020 we have sold 15,546,151 shares of our common stock for gross proceeds to us totaling $21,404,000, less issuance costs incurred of approximately $642,000.\nWe expect the cash and cash equivalents of approximately $85.4 million at December 31, 2020, $58.9 million of proceeds raised from the August 2020 Sale Agreement from January 1, 2021 through March 15, 2021, and the remaining $2.5 million of proceeds that we expect to receive under the 2018 CFF Award before the end of the first half of 2021 to be sufficient to meet our operating and capital requirements into 2024, based on planned expenditures.\nWe may seek additional capital through a combination of private and public equity offerings, debt financings and strategic collaborations. Debt financing, if obtained, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, and could increase our expenses and require that our assets secure such debt.\nEquity financing, if obtained, could result in dilution to our then existing stockholders and/or require such stockholders to waive certain rights and preferences. If such financing is not available on satisfactory terms, or is not available at all, we may be required to delay, scale back or eliminate the development of business opportunities and our operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected. We can provide no assurances that any additional sources of financing will be available to us on favorable terms, if at all. In addition, if we are unable to secure sufficient capital to fund our operations, we may choose to pursue, as an alternative, strategic collaborations that could require us to share commercial rights to our drug candidates with third parties in ways that we currently do not intend or on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we choose to pursue additional indications and/or geographies for our drug candidates or otherwise expand more rapidly than we presently anticipate we may also need to raise additional capital sooner than expected.\nOur Loan and Security Agreement contains restrictive and financial covenants that may limit our operating flexibility.\nOur Loan Agreement with K2HV for up to $50,000,000 is secured by a lien covering substantially all of our personal property, excluding intellectual property.\nThe Loan Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants. including restrictive covenants by the Company and Borrower limiting additional indebtedness, liens, mergers and acquisitions, dispositions, investments, distributions, subordinated debt, transactions with affiliates and fundamental changes. We therefore may not be able to engage in any of the foregoing types of transactions unless we obtain the consent of K2 Health Ventures or prepay the outstanding amount under the Loan Agreement. The Loan Agreement also contains certain financial covenants, including requirements to maintain unrestricted cash in the amount of $10,000,000 or the amount of all principal loans outstanding if certain regulatory and developmental milestones do not occur.\nThe restrictions and covenants in the Loan Agreement, as well as those contained in any future debt financing agreements that we may enter into, may restrict our ability to finance our operations and engage in, expand or otherwise pursue our business activities and strategies. Our ability to comply with these covenants and restrictions may be affected by events beyond our control, and breaches of these covenants and restrictions could result in a default under the loan agreement and any future financing agreements that we may enter into.\nRisks Related to Product Development, Regulatory Approval, Manufacturing and Commercialization\nOur near-term success is substantially dependent upon successful development of lenabasum, our first compound to enter clinical development, and our longer-term success is dependent upon successful development of other compounds in our pipeline or that we may acquire. If we are unable to generate revenues from lenabasum, or any other product candidates our ability to create stockholder value will be limited.\nWe do not generate revenues from any FDA approved drug products. Our current business currently depends heavily on the successful development, regulatory approval, and commercialization of lenabasum, which may never occur. Currently, our most advanced product candidate is lenabasum, for which we have completed a Phase 3 double-blind, placebo-controlled study in systemic sclerosis and a double-blind, placebo-controlled study Phase 2b study in cystic fibrosis, and have an ongoing double-blind, placebo-controlled study Phase 3 study in DM. The Phase 3 study in systemic sclerosis and Phase 2 study in cystic fibrosis did not meet their primary efficacy endpoints. There is no guarantee that our Phase 3 trial in DM will be successful or that, if positive, it would support FDA approval of a New Drug Application for lenabasum for treatment of DM.\nWe are currently conducting pre-clinical trials and testing for a number of CB1 inverse agonists and CB2 agonists. We note that most drug candidates never reach the clinical development stage and even those that do have only a small chance of successfully completing clinical development and gaining regulatory approval.\nThe coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic or the widespread outbreak of any other communicable disease could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face risks related to health epidemics or outbreaks of communicable diseases, for example, the outbreak around the world of the highly transmissible and pathogenic coronavirus, COVID-19. The outbreak of such communicable diseases, including COVID-19 and variants, could result in a widespread health crisis that could adversely affect general commercial activity and the economies and financial markets of many countries.\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus, COVID-19, was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China and on March 11, 2020 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. The extent to which COVID-19 may impact our preclinical and clinical trial operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, such as the duration of the outbreak, the severity of COVID-19, including its variants, and the effectiveness of actions to contain and treat COVID-19, including the effectiveness of vaccines and the ability of governments and healthcare providers to administer vaccines quickly and effectively\nTo limit the spread of COVID-19, governments have taken various actions from time to time including the issuance of travel restrictions, complete or partial prohibitions of non-essential activities, restrictions or shutdowns of non-essential businesses, stay-at-home orders and social distancing guidelines. Such events may result in a period of business, supply and drug product manufacturing disruption, and in reduced operations, any of which could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSome of our business partners and manufacturing operations, including production of our commercial and clinical active pharmaceutical ingredient of lenabasum, are conducted internationally and may be impacted by the global spread of COVID-19. Although we have not experienced any material disruptions to these manufacturing operations or any material delays in shipping our commercial and clinical active pharmaceutical ingredient to our clinical trial sites to date, the continued impact resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak where we have operations, or if the COVID-19 outbreak in these areas were to increase in severity, and the measures taken by the governments of countries affected could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations by limiting our ability to manufacture or ship materials or forcing temporary closure of facilities that we rely upon.\nThe global spread of COVID-19 has created significant volatility and uncertainty in global financial markets and may materially affect us economically and such conditions continue to persist. While the potential economic impact brought by, and the duration of, COVID-19 may be difficult to assess or predict, a widespread pandemic could result in significant disruption of global financial markets, reducing our ability to access capital, which could in the future negatively affect our liquidity. In addition, a recession or market correction resulting from the spread of COVID-19 could materially affect our business and the value of our common shares.\nThe continued spread of COVID-19 globally, and the resulting travel restrictions in place by governments to help stop the spread of COVID-19, could adversely impact our clinical trial operations, including the ability of our patients, principal investigators and site staff to travel to our clinical trial sites, and our ability to recruit and retain principal investigators and site staff who, as healthcare providers, may have heightened exposure to COVID-19 if an outbreak occurs in their geography. We cannot predict whether clinical testing sites will withdraw from participation in any of our studies temporarily or permanently. In addition, if the patients enrolled in our clinical trials become infected with COVID-19, we may have more adverse events and deaths in our clinical trials as a result. We may also face difficulties enrolling patients in our clinical trials if the patient populations that are eligible for our clinical trials are impacted by the coronavirus disease. Vulnerable patients, including patients with autoimmune disorders like the patients enrolled in our clinical trials, may be at a higher risk of contracting COVID-19 and may experience more severe symptoms from the disease, adversely affecting our chances for regulatory approval or requiring further clinical studies.\nThe COVID-19 outbreak may also affect the ability of our staff and the parties we work with to carry out our non-clinical, clinical, and drug development and manufacturing activities. We rely on clinical sites, investigators and other study staff, consultants, independent contractors, contract research organizations and other third-party service providers to assist us in managing, monitoring and otherwise carrying out our nonclinical studies and clinical trials. We also rely on consultants, independent contractors, contract development and manufacturing organizations, and other third-party service providers to assist us in managing, monitoring and otherwise carrying out our API production, formulation, and drug manufacturing activities. COVID-19 may affect the ability of any of these external people, organizations, or companies to devote sufficient time and resources to our programs or to travel to perform work for us.\nPotential negative impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak on the conduct of current or future clinical studies include delays in gaining feedback from regulatory agencies, starting new clinical studies, and recruiting subjects to studies that are enrolling. Although we have implemented remote data monitoring procedures for our clinical trials, the potential negative impacts also include inability to have study visits at study sites, incomplete collection of safety and efficacy data, and higher rates of drop-out of subjects from ongoing studies, delays in site entry of study data into the data base, delays in monitoring of study data because of restricted physical access to study sites, delays in site responses to queries, delays in data-base lock, delays in data analyses, delays in time to top-line data, and delays in completing study reports. New or worsening COVID-19 disruptions or restrictions could have the potential to further negatively impact our non-clinical studies, clinical trials, and drug manufacturing activities.\nAs a result of the factors described above, the expected timeline for data readouts of our drug manufacturing activities, non-clinical studies, clinical trials, and certain regulatory filings may be negatively impacted, which would adversely affect our ability to obtain regulatory approval for and to commercialize our product candidates, increase our operating expenses and have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nIf we are not able to obtain any required regulatory approvals for our drug candidates, we will not be able to commercialize our product candidates and our ability to generate revenue will be limited.\nOur clinical trials may be unsuccessful, which would materially harm our business. Even if our ongoing clinical trials are successful, we will be required to conduct additional clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of our drug candidates, before a New Drug Application, or NDA, can be filed with the FDA for marketing approval of any of our drug candidates.\nClinical testing is expensive, is difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and is uncertain as to outcome. Success in early phases of pre-clinical and clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful, and interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results. A failure of one or more of our clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing. We may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, the clinical trial process that could delay or prevent our ability to receive regulatory approval or commercialize our drug candidates. The research, testing, manufacturing, labeling, packaging, storage, approval, sale, marketing, advertising and promotion, pricing, export, import and distribution of drug products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory authorities in the United States and other countries, which regulations differ from country to country. We are not permitted to market any of our drug candidates as prescription pharmaceutical products in the United States until we receive approval of an NDA from the FDA or in foreign markets until we receive the requisite approval from comparable regulatory authorities in such countries. In the United States, the FDA generally requires the completion of clinical trials of each drug to establish its safety and efficacy and extensive pharmaceutical development to ensure its quality before an NDA is approved. Regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions impose similar requirements. Of the large number of drugs in development, only a small percentage result in the submission of an NDA to the FDA and even fewer are eventually approved for commercialization. We have never submitted an NDA to the FDA or any comparable applications to other regulatory authorities. If our development efforts for our drug candidates, including regulatory approval, are not successful for our planned indications, or if adequate demand for our drug candidates is not generated, our business will be harmed.\nReceipt of necessary regulatory approval is subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u25a0 the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities or institutional review boards, or IRBs, may disagree with the design or implementation of our clinical trials, including the shortened duration of treatment in our DETERMINE phase 3 study of lenabasum for treatment of dermatomyositis from 52 weeks to 26 weeks;\n\u25a0 we may not be able to provide acceptable evidence of the safety and efficacy of our drug candidates;\n\u25a0 the results of our clinical trials may not be satisfactory or may not meet the level of statistical or clinical significance required by the FDA, the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities for marketing approval;\n\u25a0 the dosing of our drug candidates in a particular clinical trial may not be at an optimal level;\n\u25a0 patients in our clinical trials may suffer adverse effects for reasons that may or may not be related to our drug candidates;\n\u25a0 the data collected from clinical trials may not be sufficient to support the submission of an NDA or other submission or to obtain regulatory approval in the United States or elsewhere;\n\u25a0 the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may fail to approve the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with which we contract for clinical and commercial supplies;\n\u25a0 the approval policies or regulations of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may significantly change in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient for approval; and\n\u25a0 the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may decide that the clinical trial endpoints we have chosen, the statistical analysis plans that we use, or any other parameter that we rely on to show the safety and efficacy of our drugs, are not parameters that can be used to support approval of our products.\nFailure to obtain regulatory approval for any of our drug candidates for the foregoing or any other reasons will prevent us from commercializing such product candidate as a prescription product, and our ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired. We cannot guarantee that regulators will agree with the endpoints that we have chosen to use in our clinical trials, our assessment of the results of our clinical trials or that such trials will be considered by regulators to have shown safety or efficacy of our product candidates. The FDA, EMA and other regulators have substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that our data is insufficient for approval and require additional clinical trials, or pre-clinical or other studies. In addition, varying interpretations of the data obtained from pre-clinical and clinical testing could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval of a product candidate.\nWe have only limited experience in filing the applications necessary to gain regulatory approvals and expect to rely on consultants and third party contract research organizations, or CROs, with expertise in this area to assist us in this process. Securing FDA approval requires the submission of pre-clinical, clinical and/or pharmacokinetic data, information about product manufacturing processes and inspection of facilities and supporting information to the FDA for each therapeutic indication to establish a product candidate\u2019s safety and efficacy for each indication. Our drug candidates may prove to have undesirable or unintended side effects, toxicities or other characteristics that may preclude our obtaining regulatory approval or prevent or limit commercial use with respect to one or all intended indications.\nThe process of obtaining regulatory approvals is expensive, often takes many years, if approval is obtained at all, and can vary substantially based upon, among other things, the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidates involved, the jurisdiction in which regulatory approval is sought and the substantial discretion of regulatory authorities. Changes in the regulatory approval policy during the development period, changes in or the enactment of additional statutes or regulations, or changes in regulatory review for a submitted product application may cause delays in the approval or rejection of an application. Regulatory approval obtained in one jurisdiction does not necessarily mean that a product candidate will receive regulatory approval in all jurisdictions in which we may seek approval, but the failure to obtain approval in one jurisdiction may negatively impact our ability to seek approval in a different jurisdiction. Failure to obtain regulatory marketing approval for any of our drug candidates in any indication will prevent us from commercializing such product candidates, and our ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired.\nClinical drug development involves a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome, and results of earlier studies and trials may not be predictive of future trial results.\nClinical testing is expensive and can take many years to complete, and its outcome is inherently uncertain. Failure can occur at any time during the clinical trial process. Our drug candidates are in various stages of preclinical and clinical testing. Preclinical tests are performed at an early stage of a product's development and provide information about a drug candidate's safety and effectiveness on laboratory animals. Preclinical tests can last years. If a product passes its preclinical tests satisfactorily and we determine that further development is warranted, we would file an IND application for the product with the FDA, and if the FDA gives its approval, we would begin Phase 1 clinical tests. If Phase 1 test results are satisfactory and the FDA gives its approval, we can begin Phase 2 clinical tests. If Phase 2 test results are satisfactory and the FDA gives its approval, we can begin Phase 3 pivotal studies. Once clinical testing is completed and a BLA or NDA is filed with the FDA, it may take more than a year to receive FDA approval.\nThe results of pre-clinical studies and early clinical trials may not be predictive of the results of later-stage clinical trials. We cannot assure you that the FDA will view the results as we do or that any future trials of our drug candidates will achieve positive results. Product candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy traits despite having progressed through pre-clinical studies and initial clinical trials. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials due to lack of efficacy or adverse safety profiles, notwithstanding promising results in earlier trials. Any future clinical trial results for our drug candidates may not be successful.\nIn all cases, we must show that a drug candidate is both safe and effective before the FDA, or drug approval agencies of other countries where we intend to sell the product, will approve it for sale. Our research and testing programs must comply with drug approval requirements both in the United States and in other countries, since we are developing our drug candidates with the intention to, or could later decide to, commercialize them both in the U.S. and abroad. A product may fail for safety or effectiveness at any stage of the testing process. A major risk we face is the possibility that none of our products under development will come through the testing process to final approval for sale, with the result that we cannot derive any commercial revenue from them after investing significant amounts of capital in multiple stages of preclinical and clinical testing. In addition, a number of factors could contribute to a lack of favorable safety and efficacy results for our drug candidates. For example, our trials could result in increased variability due to varying site characteristics, such as local standards of care, differences in evaluation period and surgical technique, and due to varying patient characteristics, including demographic factors and health status.\nEven if we receive regulatory approval for our drug candidates, we still may not be able to successfully commercialize any of our products, and the revenue that we generate from sales, if any, may be limited.\nIf approved for marketing, the commercial success of our drug candidates will depend upon their acceptance by the medical community, including physicians, patients and health care payors. The degree of market acceptance of our drug candidates will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u25a0 demonstration of clinical safety and efficacy;\n\u25a0 relative convenience, pill burden and ease of administration;\n\u25a0 the prevalence and severity of any adverse effects;\n\u25a0 the willingness of physicians to prescribe our drug candidates and of the target patient population to try new therapies;\n\u25a0 safety, tolerability and efficacy of our drug candidates compared to competing products;\n\u25a0 the introduction of any new products that may in the future become available to treat indications for which our drug candidates may be approved;\n\u25a0 new procedures or methods of treatment that may reduce the incidences of any of the indications in which our drug candidates may show utility;\n\u25a0 pricing and cost-effectiveness;\n\u25a0 the inclusion or omission of our drug candidates in applicable treatment guidelines;\n\u25a0 the effectiveness of our or any future collaborators\u2019 sales and marketing strategies;\n\u25a0 limitations or warnings contained in FDA-approved labeling;\n\u25a0 our ability to obtain and maintain sufficient third-party coverage or reimbursement from government health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, private health insurers and other third-party payors; and\n\u25a0 the willingness of patients to pay out-of-pocket in the absence of third-party coverage or reimbursement.\nIf any of our drug candidates are approved, but do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, health care payors and patients, we may not generate sufficient revenue and we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability. Our efforts to educate the medical community and third-party payors on the benefits of our drug candidates may require significant resources and may never be successful.\nIn addition, even if we obtain regulatory approvals, the timing or scope of any approvals may prohibit or reduce our ability to commercialize our drug candidates successfully. For example, if the approval process takes too long, we may miss market opportunities and give other companies the ability to develop competing products or establish market dominance. Any regulatory approval we ultimately obtain may be limited or subject to restrictions or post-approval commitments that render our drug candidates not commercially viable. For example, regulatory authorities may approve our drug candidates for fewer or more limited indications than we request, may not approve the prices we intend to charge for our drug candidates, may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly post-marketing clinical trials, or may approve our drug candidates with labels that do not include the labeling claims necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of a particular indication. Further, the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may place conditions on approvals, such as risk management plans and a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, to assure the safe use of the drug. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the NDA without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA may also require a REMS for an approved product when new safety information emerges. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of our drug candidates. Moreover, product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur following the initial marketing of the product. Any of the foregoing scenarios could materially harm the commercial success of our drug candidates.\nEven if we obtain marketing approval for our drug candidates, we will be subject to ongoing obligations and continued regulatory review, which may result in significant additional expense. Additionally, our drug candidates could be subject to labeling and other restrictions and withdrawal from the market and we may be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if we experience unanticipated problems with our drug candidates.\nEven if we obtain United States regulatory approval of our drug candidates for an indication, the FDA may still impose significant restrictions on their indicated uses or marketing or the conditions of approval, or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly and time-consuming post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and post-market surveillance to monitor safety and efficacy. Our drug candidates will also be subject to ongoing regulatory requirements governing the manufacturing, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, safety surveillance, advertising, promotion, recordkeeping and reporting of adverse events and other post-market information. These requirements include registration with the FDA, continued compliance with current Good Clinical Practices regulations, or cGCPs, for any clinical trials that we conduct post-approval, continued compliance with the CSA and ongoing review by the DEA. In addition, manufacturers of drug products and their facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, requirements relating to quality control, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents.\nWith respect to sales and marketing activities by us or any future partner, advertising and promotional materials must comply with FDA rules in addition to other applicable federal, state and local laws in the United States and similar legal requirements in other countries. In the United States, the distribution of product samples to physicians must comply with the requirements of the U.S. Prescription Drug Marketing Act. Application holders must obtain FDA approval for product and manufacturing changes, depending on the nature of the change. We may also be subject, directly or indirectly through our customers and partners, to various fraud and abuse laws, including, without limitation, the U.S. Anti-Kickback Statute, U.S. False Claims Act, and similar state laws, which impact, among other things, our proposed sales, marketing, and scientific/educational grant programs. If we participate in the U.S. Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, the Federal Supply Schedule of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, or other government drug programs, we will be subject to complex laws and regulations regarding reporting and payment obligations. All of these activities are also potentially subject to U.S. federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. Similar requirements exist in many of these areas in other countries.\nIn addition, if any of our drug candidates are approved for an indication, our product labeling, advertising and promotion would be subject to regulatory requirements and continuing regulatory review. The FDA strictly regulates the promotional claims that may be made about prescription products. In particular, a product may not be promoted for uses that are not approved by the FDA as reflected in the product\u2019s approved labeling. If we receive marketing approval for any of our drug candidates, physicians may nevertheless legally prescribe such products to their patients in a manner that is inconsistent with the approved label. However, if we are found to have promoted such off-label uses, we may become subject to significant liability and government fines. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion and has enjoined several companies from engaging in off-label promotion. The FDA has also requested that companies enter into consent decrees of permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed.\nIf we or a regulatory agency discover previously unknown problems with a product, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured, or if we or our manufacturers fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, we may be subject to the following administrative or judicial sanctions:\n\u25a0 restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, withdrawal of the product from the market, or voluntary or mandatory product recalls;\n\u25a0 issuance of warning letters or untitled letters;\n\u25a0 injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties or monetary fines;\n\u25a0 suspension of any ongoing clinical trials;\n\u25a0 refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications filed by us, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;\n\u25a0 suspension of, or imposition of restrictions on, operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements; or\n\u25a0 product seizure or detention or refusal to permit the import or export of product.\nThe occurrence of any event or penalty described above may inhibit our ability to commercialize our drug candidates and generate revenue. Adverse regulatory action, whether pre- or post-approval, can also potentially lead to product liability claims and increase our product liability exposure.\nThe collaboration and license agreement, or the Collaboration Agreement, with Kaken Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd., or Kaken, is important to our business. If we or Kaken fail to adequately perform under the Collaboration Agreement, or if we or Kaken terminate the Collaboration Agreement, the development and commercialization of lenabasum for the treatment of SSc and DM in Japan would be delayed or terminated and our business would be adversely affected.\nOn January 3, 2019, we entered into the Collaboration Agreement with Kaken, pursuant to which we granted to Kaken an exclusive license to commercialize and market lenabasum for the prevention and treatment of DM and SSc in Japan. Our ability to generate revenue under the Collaboration Agreement will depend in large part on our success in further clinical development of lenabasum and Kaken\u2019s success in achieving regulatory approval for, and commercializing lenabasum, in Japan. Such efforts are subject to significant uncertainty. We have no control over the resources, time and effort that Kaken may devote to the commercialization of lenabasum. Any of several events or factors could have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate revenue from Kaken\u2019s commercialization of lenabasum in Japan. For example, Kaken:\n\u25a0 may not achieve satisfactory levels of market acceptance and reimbursement by physicians, patients and third-party payers for lenabasum for the treatment of DM and SSc;\n\u25a0 may not compete successfully against other products and therapies for DM and SSc\u037e\n\u25a0 may have to comply with additional requests and recommendations from foreign regulatory authorities;\n\u25a0 may not make all regulatory filings and obtain all necessary approvals from foreign regulatory agencies and all commercially necessary reimbursement approvals\u037e\n\u25a0 may not commit sufficient resources to the marketing and distribution of lenabasum, whether for competitive or strategic reasons or otherwise due to a change in business priorities\u037e and\n\u25a0 may cease to perform its obligations under the terms of the Collaboration Agreement.\nIn addition, pursuant to the Collaboration Agreement, we and Kaken have agreed to negotiate in good faith to enter into a supply agreement and a quality agreement. There can be no assurance that we will be able to reach mutually agreeable terms on such agreements with Kaken, and the absence of agreement on such terms would prevent us from gaining the expected benefit of the Collaboration Agreement.\nFurther, we and Kaken agreed to provide mutual indemnification against losses in connection with third-party claims arising out of breaches of or inaccuracies in the Collaboration Agreement, gross negligence or willful misconduct, and the development or commercialization of lenabasum pursuant to the Collaboration Agreement. Conflicts may arise in connection with these indemnification obligations.\nAfter a specified period of time, Kaken may unilaterally terminate the Collaboration Agreement on 180 days\u2019 prior written notice without any reason and without any further commitment. Kaken may also terminate in the event of certain safety concerns and clinical failures, and either we or Kaken may terminate in the case of the other party\u2019s material breach or insolvency. Termination of the Collaboration Agreement could cause significant delays in our product candidate development and commercialization efforts, which could prevent us from commercializing lenabasum without first expanding our internal capabilities or entering into another agreement with a third party. Any suitable alternative collaboration or license agreement would take considerable time to negotiate and could also be on less favorable terms to us.\nWe have entered into, and may in the future enter into, collaboration agreements for the licensing, development and ultimate commercialization of some of our drug candidates. In such cases, we will depend greatly on our third-party collaborators to license, develop and commercialize such drug candidates, and they may not meet our expectations.\nWe may enter into further co-development and commercialization partnerships for our drug candidates where appropriate. The process of identifying collaborators and negotiating collaboration agreements for the licensing, development and ultimate commercialization of some of our drug candidates may cause delays and increased costs. We may not be able to enter into collaboration agreements on terms favorable to us or at all. Furthermore, some of those agreements may give substantial responsibility over our drug candidates to the collaborator. Some collaborators may be unable or unwilling to devote sufficient resources to develop our drug candidates as their agreements require. They often face business risks similar to ours, and this could interfere with their efforts. Also, collaborators may choose to devote their resources to products that compete with ours. If a collaborator does not successfully develop any one of our products, we will need to find another collaborator to do so. The success of our search for a new collaborator will depend on our legal right to do so at the time and whether the product remains commercially viable.\nIf we enter into collaboration agreements for one or more of our drug candidates, the success of such drug candidates will depend in great part upon our and our collaborators\u2019 success in promoting them as superior to other treatment alternatives. We believe that our drug candidates can be proven to offer disease treatment with notable advantages over drugs in terms of patient compliance and effectiveness. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to prove these advantages or that the advantages will be sufficient to support the successful commercialization of our drug candidates.\nWe currently have a limited sales and marketing organization. If we are unable to secure a sales and marketing partner or establish satisfactory sales and marketing capabilities, we may not successfully commercialize our drug candidates.\nAt present, we have a team of three employees in the commercial organization in order to commercialize products that are approved for commercial sales in the United States. We must either collaborate with third parties that have such commercial infrastructure or continue to develop our own sales and marketing infrastructure. If we are not successful in entering into appropriate collaboration arrangements, or recruiting sales and marketing personnel or in building a sales and marketing infrastructure, we will have difficulty successfully commercializing our drug candidates, which would adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to enter into collaboration agreements on terms acceptable to us or at all. In addition, even if we enter into such relationships, we may have limited or no control over the sales, marketing and distribution activities of these third parties. Our future revenues may depend heavily on the success of the efforts of these third parties. If we elect to establish a sales and marketing infrastructure we may not realize a positive return on this investment. In addition, we will have to compete with established and well-funded pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to recruit, hire, train and retain sales and marketing personnel. Factors that may inhibit our efforts to commercialize our drug candidates without strategic partners or licensees include:\n\u25a0 our inability to recruit and retain adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel;\n\u25a0 the inability of sales personnel to obtain access to or persuade adequate numbers of physicians to prescribe our drug candidates;\n\u25a0 the lack of complementary products to be offered by sales personnel, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies with more extensive product lines; and\n\u25a0 unforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating an independent sales and marketing organization.\nWe face competition from other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies and our operating results will suffer if we fail to compete effectively.\nThe biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. We have competitors in a number of jurisdictions, many of which have substantially greater name recognition, commercial infrastructures and financial, technical and personnel resources than we have. Established competitors may invest heavily to quickly discover and develop novel compounds that could make our drug candidates obsolete or uneconomical. Any new product that competes with an approved product may need to demonstrate compelling advantages in efficacy, cost, convenience, tolerability and safety to be commercially successful. Other competitive factors, including generic competition, could force us to lower prices or could result in reduced sales. In addition, new products developed by others could emerge as competitors to our drug candidates. If we are not able to compete effectively against our current and future competitors, our business will not grow and our financial condition and operations will suffer.\nRecently enacted and future legislation may increase the difficulty and cost for us to obtain marketing approval of and commercialize our drug candidates and affect the prices we may obtain.\nIn the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval for our drug candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to profitably sell our drug candidates. Legislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products. We do not know whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether the FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on the marketing approvals of our drug candidates, if any, may be. In addition, increased scrutiny by the U.S. Congress of the FDA\u2019s approval process may significantly delay or prevent marketing approval, as well as subject us to more stringent product labeling and post-marketing testing and other requirements.\nIn the United States, under the Medicare Modernization Act, or MMA, Medicare Part D provides coverage to the elderly and disabled for outpatient prescription drugs by approving and subsidizing prescription drug plans offered by private insurers. The MMA also authorizes Medicare Part D prescription drug plans to use formularies where they can limit the number of drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class. The Part D plans use their formulary leverage to negotiate rebates and other price concessions from drug manufacturers. Also under the MMA, Medicare Part B provides coverage to the elderly and disabled for physician-administered drugs on the basis of the drug\u2019s average sales price, a price that is calculated according to regulatory requirements and that the manufacturer reports to Medicare quarterly.\nBoth Congress and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the agency that administers the Medicare program, from time to time consider legislation, regulations, or other initiatives to reduce drug costs under Medicare Parts B and D. For example, under the 2010 Affordable Care Act, drug manufacturers are required to provide a 50% discount on prescriptions for branded drugs filled while the beneficiary is in the Medicare Part D coverage gap, also known as the \u201cdonut hole.\u201d There have been legislative proposals to repeal the \u201cnon-interference\u201d provision of the MMA to allow CMS to leverage the Medicare market share to negotiate larger Part D rebates. Further cost reduction efforts could decrease the coverage and price that we receive for our drug candidates and could seriously harm our business. Private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates, and any reduction in reimbursement under the Medicare program may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors.\nThe 2010 Affordable Care Act is intended to broaden access to health insurance and reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending. Further, the Affordable Care Act imposes a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import branded prescription drug products. It also increased the amount of the rebates drug manufacturers must pay to state Medicaid programs, required that Medicaid rebates be paid on managed Medicaid utilization, and increased the additional rebate on \u201cline extensions\u201d (such as extended release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products. The law also contains substantial provisions affecting fraud and abuse compliance and transparency, which may require us to modify our business practices with healthcare practitioners, and incur substantial costs to ensure compliance.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011 included, among other things, provisions that have led to 2% across-the-board reductions in Medicare payment amounts. Several states have adopted or are considering adopting laws that require pharmaceutical companies to provide notice prior to raising prices and to justify price increases. We expect that additional healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, and in turn could significantly reduce the projected value of certain development projects and reduce our profitability.\nOur future growth depends, in part, on our ability to enter into and succeed in markets outside of the United States, where we may choose to rely on third party collaborations and will be subject to additional regulatory and commercial burdens, risks and other uncertainties.\nOur future profitability will depend, in part, on our ability to gain approval of and commercialize our drug candidates in non-U.S. markets. In some or all of these non-U.S. markets, we intend to enter into licensing and contractual collaborations with third parties, such as Kaken, to handle some or all of the tasks and responsibilities necessary to succeed. Our activities in non-U.S. markets are subject to additional risks and uncertainties, including:\n\u25a0 our ability to enter into favorable licensing and contractual arrangements with our partners;\n\u25a0 our ability to select partners who are capable of achieving success at the tasks they agree to perform;\n\u25a0 obtaining timely and sufficient favorable approval terms for our drug candidates;\n\u25a0 obtaining favorable pricing and reimbursement;\n\u25a0 our inability to directly control commercial activities because we are relying on third parties;\n\u25a0 the burden of complying with complex and changing foreign regulatory, tax, accounting and legal requirements;\n\u25a0 different medical practices and customs in foreign countries affecting acceptance in the marketplace;\n\u25a0 import or export licensing requirements;\n\u25a0 longer accounts receivable collection times;\n\u25a0 longer lead times for shipping;\n\u25a0 language barriers for technical training;\n\u25a0 reduced protection of intellectual property rights in some foreign countries;\n\u25a0 foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; and\n\u25a0 the interpretation of contractual provisions governed by foreign laws in the event of a contract dispute.\nInternational sales of our drug candidates could also be adversely affected by the imposition of governmental controls, political and economic instability, and trade restrictions and changes in tariffs, any of which may adversely affect our results of operations.\nIf we market our drug candidates in a manner that violates healthcare fraud and abuse laws, or if we violate government price reporting laws, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties.\nThe FDA enforces laws and regulations which require that the promotion of pharmaceutical products be consistent with the approved prescribing information. While physicians may prescribe an approved product for a so-called \u201coff label\u201d use, it is unlawful for a pharmaceutical company to promote its products in a manner that is inconsistent with its approved label and any company which engages in such conduct may be subject to significant liability. Similarly, industry codes in the European Union and other foreign jurisdictions prohibit companies from engaging in off-label promotion and regulatory agencies in various countries enforce violations of the code with civil penalties. While we intend to ensure that our promotional materials are consistent with our label, regulatory agencies may disagree with our assessment and may issue untitled letters, warning letters or may institute other civil or criminal enforcement proceedings. In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal healthcare fraud and abuse laws have been applied in recent years to restrict certain marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry. These laws include the U.S. Anti-Kickback Statute, U.S. False Claims Act and similar state laws. Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the safe harbors, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of these laws.\nThe U.S. Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce, or in return for, purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs. This statute has been interpreted broadly to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Although there are several statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor. Our practices may not, in all cases, meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection from anti-kickback liability. Moreover, recent health care reform legislation has strengthened these laws. For example, the Health Care Reform Law, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the U.S. Anti-Kickback Statute and criminal health care fraud statutes; a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the Health Care Reform Law provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the U.S. Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the U.S. False Claims Act. Federal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to get a false claim paid.\nOver the past few years, pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for a variety of alleged promotional and marketing activities, such as: allegedly providing free trips, free goods, sham consulting fees and grants and other monetary benefits to prescribers; reporting to pricing services inflated average wholesale prices that were then used by federal programs to set reimbursement rates; engaging in off-label promotion that caused claims to be submitted to Medicare or Medicaid for non-covered, off-label uses; and submitting inflated best price information to the Medicaid Rebate Program to reduce liability for Medicaid rebates. Most states also have statutes or regulations similar to the U.S. Anti-Kickback Statute and the U.S. False Claims Act, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. Sanctions under these federal and state laws may include substantial civil monetary penalties, exclusion of a manufacturer\u2019s products from reimbursement under government programs, substantial criminal fines and imprisonment.\nWe are, and will be, completely dependent on third parties to manufacture our drug candidates, and our commercialization of our drug candidates could be halted, delayed or made less profitable if those third parties fail to obtain manufacturing approval from the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, fail to provide us with sufficient quantities of our drug candidates or fail to do so at acceptable quality levels or prices.\nWe do not currently have, nor do we plan to acquire, the capability or infrastructure to manufacture the active pharmaceutical ingredients of our drug candidates, or the finished drug products, for use in our clinical trials or for commercial product, if any. As a result, we will be obligated to rely on contract manufacturers if and when our drug candidates are approved for commercialization.\nWe currently rely on a single foreign supplier for manufacturing the starting chemical intermediates and finished bulk drug product for lenabasum. We also rely on a single foreign supplier for the manufacturing of the finished lenabasum capsules. The facilities used by our two contract manufacturers to manufacture lenabasum must be approved by the FDA pursuant to inspections that will be conducted after we submit our NDAs to the FDA. We do not control the manufacturing processes of, and are completely dependent on, our two contract manufacturing partners for compliance with cGMPs for manufacture of all active drug substances and finished drug products. These cGMP regulations cover all aspects of the manufacturing, testing, quality control and record keeping relating to our drug candidates. If our contract manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and the strict regulatory requirements of the FDA or others, they will not be able to secure and/or maintain regulatory approval for their manufacturing facilities. If the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority does not approve these facilities for the manufacture of lenabasum or our other product candidates or if it withdraws any such approval in the future, we may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities, which would significantly impact our ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval for or market our drug candidates, if approved.\nOur contract manufacturers will be subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and corresponding state and foreign agencies for compliance with cGMPs and similar regulatory requirements. We will not have control over our contract manufacturers\u2019 compliance with these regulations and standards. Failure by any of our contract manufacturers to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, failure to grant approval to market our drug candidates, delays, suspensions or withdrawals of approvals, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could significantly and adversely affect our business. In addition, we will not have control over the ability of our contract manufacturers to maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance and qualified personnel. Failure by our contract manufacturers to comply with or maintain any of these standards could adversely affect our ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval for or market our drug candidates.\nIf for any reason, these third parties are unable or unwilling to perform, we may not be able to terminate our agreements with them, and we may not be able to locate alternative manufacturers or formulators or enter into favorable agreements with them and we cannot be certain that any such third parties will have the manufacturing capacity to meet future requirements. If these manufacturers or any alternate manufacturer of finished drug product experiences any significant difficulties in its respective manufacturing processes for our active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, or our finished products or should cease doing business with us, we could experience significant interruptions in the supply of our drug candidates or may not be able to create a supply of our drug candidates at all. Were we to encounter manufacturing issues, our ability to produce a sufficient supply of our drug candidates might be negatively affected. Our inability to coordinate the efforts of our third party manufacturing partners, or the lack of capacity available at our third party manufacturing partners, could impair our ability to supply our drug candidates at required levels. Because of the significant regulatory requirements that we would need to satisfy in order to qualify a new bulk or finished product manufacturer, if we face these or other difficulties with our current manufacturing partners, we could experience significant interruptions in the supply of our drug candidates if we decided to transfer the manufacture of our drug candidates to one or more alternative manufacturers in an effort to deal with the difficulties.\nAny manufacturing problem or the loss of a contract manufacturer could be disruptive to our operations and result in lost sales. Additionally, we rely on third parties to supply the raw materials needed to manufacture our potential products. Any reliance on suppliers may involve several risks, including a potential inability to obtain critical materials and reduced control over production costs, delivery schedules, reliability and quality. Any unanticipated disruption to a future contract manufacturer caused by problems at suppliers could delay shipment of our drug candidates, increase our cost of goods sold and result in lost sales.\nWe cannot guarantee that our manufacturing and supply partners will be able to manufacture our drug candidates at commercial scale on a cost-effective basis. If the commercial-scale manufacturing costs of our drug candidates are higher than expected, these costs may significantly impact our operating results. In order to reduce costs, we may need to develop and implement process improvements. However, in order to do so, we will need, from time to time, to notify or make submissions with regulatory authorities, and the improvements may be subject to approval by such regulatory authorities. We cannot be sure that we will receive these necessary approvals or that these approvals will be granted in a timely fashion. We also cannot guarantee that we will be able to enhance and optimize output in our commercial manufacturing process. If we cannot enhance and optimize output, we may not be able to reduce our costs over time.\nThere are risks associated with scaling up manufacturing to commercial scale. If our contract manufacturers are unable to manufacture our drug candidates on a commercial scale, this could potentially delay regulatory approval and commercialization or materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nThere are risks associated with scaling up manufacturing to commercial volumes including, among others, cost overruns, technical problems with process scale-up, process reproducibility, stability issues, and lot consistency. Even if we obtain regulatory approval for our drug candidates, there is no assurance that our contract manufacturers will be able to manufacture the approved products to specifications acceptable to the FDA or other regulatory authorities, to produce them in sufficient quantities to meet the requirements for the potential launch of the product or to meet potential future demand. If our manufacturers are unable to produce sufficient quantities of approved products for commercialization, either on a timely basis or at all, our commercialization efforts would be impaired, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nOur lead product candidate, lenabasum, is currently classified as a Schedule I controlled substance subject to U.S. controlled substance laws and regulations, including regulations of the Drug Enforcement Agency and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Failure to obtain the necessary licenses and registrations and failure to comply with these laws could result in the delay in the manufacturing and distribution of lenabasum and could delay the completion of clinical studies. Such delays and the cost of compliance with these laws and regulations, could adversely affect our business operations and our financial condition.\nIn the United States, our lead product candidate, lenabasum, is currently classified as a Schedule I controlled substance as defined in the Controlled Substance Act, or CSA. This designation is mainly based on lenabasum\u2019s chemical structure (it is a synthetic compound that is structurally related to the non-psychoactive terminal metabolite of tetrahydrocannabinol).\nSchedule I controlled substances are pharmaceutical products subject to specific regulations under the CSA, which establishes, among other things, certain registration, manufacturing quotas, security, recordkeeping, reporting, import, export and other requirements administered by the DEA. All parties responsible for the manufacturing, distribution and testing of the drug in clinical studies must apply for and obtain a license from the DEA before they are permitted to perform these activities with lenabasum. Furthermore, these parties must have the security, control, recordkeeping, reporting and inventory mechanisms required by the DEA to prevent drug loss and diversion. All licensed facilities are required to renew their registrations annually if they intend to continue to work with our drug. The DEA conducts periodic inspections of certain registered establishments that handle controlled substances. We have been working with our manufacturers, distributors, exporters and clinical sites to obtain the necessary licenses to work with lenabasum. The parties responsible for the manufacturing, distribution and export of lenabasum have already applied for and have been granted DEA licenses and a number of institutions responsible for conducting our current clinical studies have also been granted DEA licenses. However, the failure to maintain the necessary registrations, and the delay or failure of additional clinical sites to obtain DEA registrations, could delay the manufacturing, distribution and export of lenabasum and could delay the completion of the clinical studies. Furthermore, failure to maintain compliance with the CSA, particularly non-compliance resulting in loss or diversion, could result in regulatory action that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The DEA may seek civil penalties, refuse to renew necessary registrations, or initiate proceedings to restrict, suspend or revoke those registrations. In certain circumstances, violations could lead to criminal proceedings. In addition, if the FDA, DEA, or any foreign regulatory authority determines that lenabasum may have potential for abuse, it may require us to generate more clinical or other data than we currently anticipate to establish whether or to what extent the substance has an abuse potential, which could increase the cost and/or delay the launch of lenabasum.\nIndividual states have also established controlled substance laws and regulations. Though state-controlled substances laws often mirror federal law, because the states are separate jurisdictions, they may separately schedule drugs, as well. While some states automatically schedule a drug based on federal action, other states schedule drugs through rulemaking or a legislative action. The requirement for state registrations could also result in delay of the manufacturing and distribution of lenabasum or in the completion of our clinical studies. We and our manufacturing vendors and clinical sites must also obtain separate state registrations, permits or licenses in order to be able to obtain, handle and distribute controlled substances for clinical trials or commercial sale, and failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements could lead to enforcement and sanctions by the states in addition to those from the DEA or otherwise arising under federal law.\nThe manufacturing and distribution of lenabasum is subject to the DEA\u2019s annual manufacturing and procurement quota requirements. The annual quota allocated to us or our contract manufacturers for the controlled substances in lenabasum may not be sufficient to complete clinical trials. Consequently, any delay or refusal by the DEA in establishing our, or our contract manufacturers\u2019, procurement and/or production quota for controlled substances could delay or stop our clinical trials or product launches, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and operations.\nWhile lenabasum is a Schedule I controlled substance, if lenabasum is approved for medical use by the FDA, it will have satisfied the \u201caccepted medical use\u201d requirement of the CSA. If and when lenabasum receives FDA approval, the DEA will make a scheduling determination and place lenabasum in a schedule other than Schedule I or declassify it in order for it to be prescribed to patients in the United States. As part of the scheduling determination, FDA will assess the abuse and dependence potential of lenabasum and make a scheduling recommendation to DEA. If approved by the FDA, the length of time the DEA takes to complete the rescheduling or declassification of lenabasum is uncertain and could be lengthy and we will not be able to sell the drug until the rescheduling is complete. Any delays in the rescheduling could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nDelays in shipping our drug candidates could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe import and export of our drug candidates requires import and export licenses. In addition, because lenabasum is currently a Schedule I controlled substance in the United States, in addition to the FDA and U.S. Customs and Border Protection, its import and export is also regulated by the DEA. We may not be granted, or if granted, maintain, such licenses for import or export from the authorities these regulatory agencies. Even if we obtain the relevant licenses, shipments of our drug candidates may be held up in transit by any of these authorities, which could cause significant delays and may lead to product batches which no longer meet specifications for use in clinical trials or commercial distribution. Such events could result in delayed development timelines, increased expenses and partial or total loss of revenue from our drug candidates.\nWe expect that we will rely on third parties to assist us in conducting clinical trials for our drug candidates. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our drug candidates and our business would be substantially harmed.\nWe expect to enter into agreements with third-party CROs to assist us in conducting and managing our clinical programs, including contracting with clinical sites to perform our clinical studies. We plan to rely on these parties for execution of clinical studies for our drug candidates and we will control only certain aspects of conducting the clinical studies. Nevertheless, we will be responsible for ensuring that each of our studies is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol, legal, regulatory and scientific standards, and our reliance on CROs and clinical sites will not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. We and our CROs will be required to comply with cGCPs, which are regulations and guidelines enforced by the FDA, the Competent Authorities of the Member States of the European Economic Area and comparable foreign regulatory authorities for any products in clinical development. The FDA enforces these cGCP regulations through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and trial sites. If we or our CROs fail to comply with applicable cGCPs, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. We cannot assure you that, upon inspection, the FDA will determine that any of our clinical trials comply with cGCPs. In addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with products produced under cGMP regulations and will require a large number of test subjects. Our failure or the failure of our CROs or clinical sites to comply with these regulations may require us to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process and could also subject us to enforcement action up to and including civil and criminal penalties.\nAlthough we intend to design the clinical trials for our drug candidates in consultation with CROs, we expect that the CROs will manage and assist us with the clinical trials conducted at contracted clinical sites. As a result, many important aspects of our drug development programs would be outside of our direct control. In addition, the CROs and clinical sites may not perform all of their obligations under arrangements with us or in compliance with regulatory requirements. If the CROs or clinical sites do not perform clinical trials in a satisfactory manner, or if they breach their obligations to us or fail to comply with regulatory requirements, the development and commercialization of our drug candidates for the subject indications may be delayed or our development program materially and irreversibly harmed. We cannot control the amount and timing of resources these CROs and clinical sites will devote to our program or our drug candidates. If we are unable to rely on clinical data collected by our CROs, we could be required to repeat, extend the duration of, or increase the size of our clinical trials, which could significantly delay commercialization and require significantly greater expenditures.\nIf any of our relationships with these third-party CROs or clinical sites terminate, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative CROs or clinical sites. If CROs do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines, if they need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols, regulatory requirements or for other reasons, any such clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our drug candidates. As a result, our financial results and the commercial prospects for our drug candidates would be harmed, our costs could increase and our ability to generate revenue could be delayed.\nAny termination or suspension of or delays in the commencement or completion of any necessary studies of our drug candidates for any indications could result in increased costs to us, delay or limit our ability to generate revenue and adversely affect our commercial prospects.\nThe commencement and completion of clinical studies can be delayed for a number of reasons, including delays related to:\n\u25a0 the FDA failing to grant permission to proceed and placing the clinical study on hold;\n\u25a0 subjects failing to enroll or remain in our trials at the rate we expect;\n\u25a0 a facility manufacturing any of our drug candidates being ordered by the FDA or other government or regulatory authorities to temporarily or permanently shut down due to violations of cGMP requirements or other applicable requirements, or cross-contaminations of product in the manufacturing process;\n\u25a0 any changes to our manufacturing process that may be necessary or desired;\n\u25a0 subjects choosing an alternative treatment for the indications for which we are developing our drug candidates, or participating in competing clinical studies;\n\u25a0 subjects experiencing severe or unexpected drug-related adverse effects;\n\u25a0 reports of similar technologies and products raising safety and/or efficacy concerns;\n\u25a0 third-party clinical investigators losing their license or permits necessary to perform our clinical trials, not performing our clinical trials on our anticipated schedule or employing methods consistent with the clinical trial protocol, cGCP requirements, or other third parties not performing data collection and analysis in a timely or accurate manner;\n\u25a0 inspections of clinical study sites by the FDA or IRBs finding regulatory violations that require us to undertake corrective action, result in suspension or termination of one or more sites or the imposition of a clinical hold on the entire study, or that prohibit us from using some or all of the data in support of our marketing applications;\n\u25a0 third-party contractors becoming debarred or suspended or otherwise penalized by the FDA or other government or regulatory authorities for violations of regulatory requirements, in which case we may need to find a substitute contractor, and we may not be able to use some or any of the data produced by such contractors in support of our marketing applications;\n\u25a0 one or more IRBs refusing to approve, suspending or terminating the study at an investigational site precluding enrollment of additional subjects, or withdrawing its approval of the trial; reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective CROs and clinical trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;\n\u25a0 deviations of the clinical sites from trial protocols or dropping out of a trial;\n\u25a0 adding new clinical trial sites;\n\u25a0 the inability of the CRO to execute any clinical trials for any reason;\n\u25a0 government or regulatory delays or \u201cclinical holds\u201d requiring suspension or termination of a trial; and\n\u25a0\ndelays related to the impacts of COVID-19, including slowdowns in enrollment or our ability complete our clinical trials on our expected timeline.\nProduct development costs for our drug candidates will increase if we have delays in testing or approval or if we need to perform more or larger clinical studies than planned. Additionally, changes in regulatory requirements and policies may occur and we may need to amend study protocols to reflect these changes. Amendments may require us to resubmit our study protocols to the FDA and IRBs for reexamination, which may impact the costs, timing or successful completion of that study. If we experience delays in completion of, or if we, the FDA or other regulatory authorities, any IRBs, or other reviewing entities, or any of our clinical study sites suspend or terminate any of our clinical studies of our drug candidates, our commercial prospects may be materially harmed and our ability to generate product revenues will be delayed. Any delays in completing our clinical trials will increase our costs, slow down our development and approval process and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenues. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition and prospects significantly. In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, termination or suspension of, or a delay in the commencement or completion of, clinical studies may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of our drug candidates. In addition, if one or more clinical studies are delayed, our competitors may be able to bring products to market before we do, and the commercial viability of our drug candidates could be significantly reduced.\nWe may not be able to obtain or maintain orphan drug designation or exclusivity for our product candidates.\nWe have been granted orphan drug designation in the United States and in the European Union for lenabasum for the treatment of CF, SSc and DM. Upon receipt of regulatory approval, orphan drug status will provide us with seven years of market exclusivity in the United States under the Orphan Drug Act. However, there is no guarantee that the FDA will grant orphan drug designation for any of our drug candidates for any future indication, which would make us ineligible for the additional exclusivity and other benefits of orphan drug designation. Moreover, there can be no assurance that another company also holding orphan drug designation for the same indication or which may receive orphan drug designation in the future will not receive approval prior to us, in which case our competitor would have the benefit of the seven years of market exclusivity, and we would be unable to commercialize our product for the same indication until the expiration of such seven-year period. Even if we are the first to obtain approval for the orphan drug indication, there are circumstances under which a competing product may be approved for the same indication during our seven-year period of exclusivity.\nUnder the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug available in the Unites States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of regulatory review and approval process. In addition to the potential period of exclusivity, orphan designation makes a company eligible for grant funding of up to $400,000 per year for four years to defray costs of clinical trial expenses, tax credits for clinical research expenses and potential exemption from the FDA application user fee.\nIf a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as (i) the drug\u2019s orphan designation is revoked; (ii) its marketing approval is withdrawn; (iii) the orphan exclusivity holder consents to the approval of another applicant\u2019s product; (iv) the orphan exclusivity holder is unable to assure the availability of a sufficient quantity of drug; or (v) a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity by a competitor product. If a drug designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan drug exclusivity. There can be no assurance that we will receive orphan drug designation for any of our drug candidates for any additional indications, if we elect to seek such designation.\nAny fast track designation or grant of priority review status by the FDA may not actually lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process, nor will it assure FDA approval of our product candidates. Additionally, our product candidates may treat indications that do not qualify for priority review vouchers.\nWe have received fast track designation for lenabasum for the treatment of cystic fibrosis and systemic sclerosis in the United States and European Union and may seek fast track designation or priority review of applications for approval of our product candidate for future indications. If a drug is intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition and the drug demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for this condition, the drug sponsor may apply for FDA fast track designation. If a product candidate offers major advances in treatment, the FDA may designate it eligible for priority review. The FDA has broad discretion whether or not to grant these designations, so even if we believe a particular product candidate is eligible for these designations, we cannot assure you that the FDA would decide to grant them. Even if we do receive fast track designation or priority review, we may not experience a faster development process, review or approval compared to conventional FDA procedures. The FDA may withdraw fast track designation if it believes that the designation is no longer supported by data from our clinical development program.\nAny breakthrough therapy designation granted by the FDA for our product candidate may not lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process, and it does not increase the likelihood that our product candidate will receive marketing approval.\nWe have applied for, and may in the future apply for, a breakthrough therapy designation of our product candidates for future indications. A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. For drugs and biologics that have been designated as breakthrough therapies, interaction and communication between the FDA and the sponsor of the trial can help to identify the most efficient path for clinical development while minimizing the number of patients placed in ineffective control regimens. Drugs designated as breakthrough therapies by the FDA may also be eligible for accelerated approval if the relevant criteria are met.\nDesignation of a product candidate as a breakthrough therapy is within the discretion of the FDA. Accordingly, even if we believe our product candidate meets the criteria for designation as a breakthrough therapy, the FDA may disagree and instead determine not to make such designation. In any event, the receipt of a breakthrough therapy designation for a product candidate may not result in a faster development process, review or approval compared to drugs considered for approval under conventional FDA procedures and does not assure ultimate approval by the FDA. In addition, even if one or more of our product candidates qualify as breakthrough therapies, the FDA may later decide that the products no longer meet the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened.\nThird-party coverage and reimbursement and health care cost containment initiatives and treatment guidelines may constrain our future revenues.\nOur ability to successfully market our drug candidates will depend in part on the level of reimbursement that government health administration authorities, private health coverage insurers and other organizations provide for the cost of our products and related treatments. Countries in which our drug candidates are expected to be sold through reimbursement schemes under national health insurance programs frequently require that manufacturers and sellers of pharmaceutical products obtain governmental approval of initial prices and any subsequent price increases. In certain countries, including the United States, government-funded and private medical care plans can exert significant indirect pressure on prices. We may not be able to sell our drug candidates profitably if adequate prices are not approved or coverage and reimbursement is unavailable or limited in scope. Increasingly, third-party payors attempt to contain health care costs in ways that are likely to impact our development of products including:\n\u25a0 failing to approve or challenging the prices charged for health care products;\n\u25a0 introducing reimportation schemes from lower priced jurisdictions;\n\u25a0 limiting both coverage and the amount of reimbursement for new therapeutic products;\n\u25a0 denying or limiting coverage for products that are approved by the regulatory agencies but are considered to be experimental or investigational by third-party payors; and\n\u25a0 refusing to provide coverage when an approved product is used in a way that has not received regulatory marketing approval.\nRisks Relating to Our Intellectual Property Rights\nIt is difficult and costly to protect our intellectual property rights, and we cannot ensure the protection of these rights.\nOur commercial success will depend, in part, on maintaining and obtaining additional patent protection for our technologies, products and processes, successfully defending these patents against third-party challenges and successfully enforcing these patents against third party competitors. The patent positions of pharmaceutical companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions for which important legal principles remain unresolved. Changes in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws may diminish the value of our intellectual property. Accordingly, we cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowable in our pending applications or, the enforceability of our existing and future patents. Our pending patent applications for lenabasum and its uses may never be approved by United States or foreign patent offices and the existing patents and patent applications relating to lenabasum and related technologies may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by third parties and may not protect us against competitors with similar products or technologies.\nThe degree of our current and future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain, because legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights, permit us to gain or keep our competitive advantage, or provide us with any competitive advantage at all. For example, others have filed, and in the future are likely to file, patent applications covering products and technologies that are similar, identical or competitive to lenabasum, or important to our business. We cannot be certain that any patents or patent application owned by a third party will not have priority over patents and patent applications filed by us, or that we will not be involved in interference, opposition or invalidity proceedings before United States or foreign patent offices.\nWe also rely on trade secrets to protect technology, especially in cases when we believe patent protection is not appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. While we require employees, academic collaborators, consultants and other contractors to enter into confidentiality agreements, we may not be able to adequately protect our trade secrets or other proprietary or licensed information. Typically, research collaborators and scientific advisors have rights to publish data and information in which we may have rights. If we cannot maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary technology and other confidential information, our ability to receive patent protection and our ability to protect valuable information owned by us may be imperiled. Enforcing a claim that a third-party entity illegally obtained and is using any of our trade secrets is expensive and time consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, courts are sometimes less willing to protect trade secrets than patents. Moreover, our competitors may independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how.\nIf we fail to maintain or obtain additional patent protection or trade secret protection for lenabasum or our technologies, third parties could use our proprietary information, which could impair our ability to compete in the market and adversely affect our ability to generate revenues and attain profitability.\nWe may also rely on the trademarks we may develop to distinguish our products from the products of our competitors. We cannot guarantee that any trademark applications filed by us or our business partners will be approved. Third parties may also oppose such trademark applications, or otherwise challenge our use of the trademarks. In the event that the trademarks we use are successfully challenged, we could be forced to rebrand our products, which could result in loss of brand recognition, and could require us to devote resources to advertising and marketing new brands. Further, we cannot provide assurance that competitors will not infringe the trademarks we use, or that we will have adequate resources to enforce these trademarks.\nWe have in-licensed a portion of our intellectual property, and if we fail to comply with our obligations under these arrangements, we could lose such intellectual property rights or owe damages to the licensor of such intellectual property.\nWe are a party to a license agreement with Jenrin pursuant to which we licensed the exclusive worldwide rights to develop, manufacture and market drug candidates from Jenrin. This agreement is important to our business, and we may enter into additional license agreements in the future. Certain of our in-licensed intellectual property covers, or may cover and potential cannabinoid developmental candidates. Our existing license agreement imposes, and we expect that future license agreements will impose, various diligence, milestone payment, royalty and other obligations on us. If there is any conflict, dispute, disagreement or issue of non-performance between us and our licensing partners regarding our rights or obligations under the license agreements, including any such conflict, dispute or disagreement arising from our failure to satisfy payment obligations under any such agreement, we may owe damages, our licensor may have a right to terminate the affected license, and our ability to utilize the affected intellectual property in our product discovery and development efforts and our ability to enter into collaboration or marketing agreements for an affected product candidate may be adversely affected.\nLenabasum and our other product candidates may infringe the intellectual property rights of others, which could increase our costs and delay or prevent our development and commercialization efforts.\nOur success depends in part on avoiding infringement of the proprietary technologies of others. The pharmaceutical industry has been characterized by frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. Identification of third-party patent rights that may be relevant to our proprietary technology is difficult because patent searching is imperfect due to differences in terminology among patents, incomplete databases and the difficulty in assessing the meaning of patent claims. Additionally, because patent applications are maintained in secrecy until the application is published, we may be unaware of third-party patents that may be infringed by commercialization of lenabasum or any of our other product candidates. There may be certain issued patents and patent applications claiming subject matter that we may be required to license in order to research, develop or commercialize lenabasum or our other product candidates, and we do not know if such patents and patent applications would be available to license on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Any claims of patent infringement asserted by third parties would be time-consuming and may:\n\u25a0 result in costly litigation;\n\u25a0 divert the time and attention of our technical personnel and management;\n\u25a0 prevent us from commercializing a product until the asserted patent expires or is held finally invalid or not infringed in a court of law;\n\u25a0 require us to cease or modify our use of the technology and/or develop non-infringing technology; or\n\u25a0 require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements.\nAlthough no third party has asserted a claim of infringement against us, others may hold proprietary rights that could prevent our product candidates from being marketed. Any patent-related legal action against us claiming damages and seeking to enjoin commercial activities relating to our product candidates or our processes could subject us to potential liability for damages and require us to obtain a license to continue to manufacture or market lenabasum or any other product candidates. We cannot predict whether we would prevail in any such actions or that any license required under any of these patents would be made available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. In addition, we cannot be sure that we could redesign lenabasum or any other product candidates or processes to avoid infringement, if necessary. Accordingly, an adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding, or the failure to obtain necessary licenses, could prevent us from developing and commercializing lenabasum or another product candidate, which could harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nA number of companies, including several major pharmaceutical companies, have conducted research on anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrosis therapies which resulted in the filing of many patent applications related to this research. If we were to challenge the validity of these or any issued United States patent in court, we would need to overcome a statutory presumption of validity that attaches to every issued United States patent. This means that, in order to prevail, we would have to present clear and convincing evidence as to the invalidity of the patent\u2019s claims.\nIf we were to challenge the validity of these or any issued United States patent in an administrative trial before the Patent Trial and Appeal Board in the United States Patent and Trademark Office, we would have to prove that the claims are unpatentable by a preponderance of the evidence. There is no assurance that a jury and/or court would find in our favor on questions of infringement, validity or enforceability.\nWe may be subject to claims that we have wrongfully hired an employee from a competitor or that we or our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged confidential information or trade secrets of their former employers.\nAs is commonplace in our industry, we employ individuals who were previously employed at other pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although no claims against us are currently pending, we may be subject in the future to claims that our employees or prospective employees are subject to a continuing obligation to their former employers (such as non-competition or non-solicitation obligations) or claims that our employees or we have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nWe may be subject to claims challenging the inventorship of our patents and other intellectual property.\nAlthough we are not aware of any asserted third-party claims challenging inventorship on our patents or ownership of our intellectual property, we may in the future be subject to claims that former employees, strategic partners, commercial counterparties or other third parties associated with us or one of our predecessors in ownership of lenabasum have an interest in our patents or other intellectual property as an inventor or co-inventor. While it is our policy to require our employees and contractors who may be involved in the conception or development of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we cannot fully control the enforcement of these policies by third parties with which we contract, nor can we be certain that assignment agreements between us and our employees, between us and our counterparties, or between our counterparties and their employees or between our predecessors of ownership and their employees and counterparties, will effectively protect our interests as to any party who conceives or develops intellectual property that we regard as our own. Among other issues, the assignment of intellectual property rights may not be self-executing, the assignment agreements may be breached, or we may have disputes arise from conflicting obligations of consultants or others who are involved in developing our product candidates. As we approach potential commercialization of our product candidates, we are more closely analyzing all facts that we believe might be used to assert an inventorship claim against us. Determinations like these involve complex sets of fact and applications of sometimes-unsettled patent law, resulting in inherent uncertainties regarding ownership rights. Determining the history of development of certain of our intellectual property is made more difficult by the fact that certain of our intellectual property was developed by other companies for other indications before being acquired by us. Consequently, we cannot be sure that we have all of the documentary records relevant to such an analysis. In the course of our analysis we identified a potential issue regarding incomplete inventorship on certain aspects of our lenabasum portfolio that were developed prior to our acquisition of lenabasum. Since identifying this potential issue, we reached agreement with the relevant third-party co-inventors and received assignments of such co-inventors\u2019 rights in and to the relevant patents.\nIf claims challenging inventorship are made against us, we may need to resort to litigation to resolve those claims. If we fail in defending against any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights, such as exclusive ownership of valuable intellectual property rights or the right to assert those rights against third-parties marketing competing products. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees.\nThere are risks to our Intellectual Property based on our international business operations.\nWe may face risks to our technology and intellectual property as a result of our conducting business outside of the United States, including as a result of our license and collaboration agreement with Kaken, and particularly in jurisdictions that do not have comparable levels of protection of corporate proprietary information and assets such as intellectual property, trademarks, trade secrets, know-how and customer information and records. While these risks are common to many companies, conducting business in certain foreign jurisdictions, housing technology, data and intellectual property abroad, or licensing technology to joint ventures with foreign partners may have more significant exposure. Pursuant to our license and collaboration agreement with Kaken, we have granted Kaken an exclusive license to commercialize lenabasum in Japan, and an exclusive, worldwide license for the development and manufacturing of lenabasum in connection with Kaken\u2019s commercialization efforts. As a result, and in the event Kaken partners with other companies in other foreign jurisdictions in connection with the development and manufacturing of lenabasum, we may be exposed to material risks of theft of our proprietary information and other intellectual property, including technical data, manufacturing processes, data sets or other sensitive information. For example, our products or components may be reverse engineered by other business partners or other parties, which could result in our patents being infringed or our know-how or trade secrets stolen. The risk can be by direct intrusion wherein technology and intellectual property is stolen or compromised through cyber intrusions or physical theft through corporate espionage, including with the assistance of insiders, or via more indirect routes.\nGeneral Company-Related Risks\nWe will need to grow the size of our organization, and we may experience difficulties in managing this growth.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had 76 full-time employees. As our development and commercialization plans and strategies develop, we will need to expand the size of our employee base for managerial, operational, sales, marketing, financial and other resources. Future growth would impose significant added responsibilities on members of management, including the need to identify, recruit, maintain, motivate and integrate additional employees. In addition, our management may have to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from our day-to-day activities and devote a substantial amount of time to managing these growth activities. Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize our drug candidates and our ability to compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to effectively manage our future growth.\nFuture capital raises may dilute our existing stockholders\u2019 ownership and/or have other adverse effects on our operations.\nIf we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our existing stockholders\u2019 percentage ownership will be reduced and these stockholders may experience substantial dilution. We may also issue equity securities that provide for rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our common stock. If we raise additional funds by issuing debt securities, these debt securities would have rights senior to those of our common stock and the terms of the debt securities issued could impose significant restrictions on our operations, including liens on our assets. If we raise additional funds through collaborations and licensing arrangements, we may be required to relinquish some rights to our technologies or candidate products, or to grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.\nIf we are not successful in attracting and retaining highly qualified personnel, we may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy. In addition, the loss of the services of certain key employees, including Yuval Cohen, our Chief Executive Officer, Barbara White, our Chief Medical Officer, Craig Millian, our Chief Commercial Officer, and Sean Moran, our Chief Financial Officer would adversely impact our business prospects.\nOur ability to compete in the highly competitive pharmaceuticals industry depends in large part upon our ability to attract highly qualified managerial, scientific and medical personnel. In order to induce valuable employees to remain with us, we intend to provide employees with stock options that vest over time. The value to employees of stock options that vest over time will be significantly affected by movements in the price of our common stock that we will not be able to control and may at any time be insufficient to counteract more lucrative offers from other companies.\nOur management team has expertise in many different aspects of drug development and commercialization. However, we will need to hire additional personnel as we further develop our drug candidates. Competition for skilled personnel in our market is intense and competition for experienced scientists may limit our ability to hire and retain highly qualified personnel on acceptable terms. Despite our efforts to retain valuable employees, members of our management, scientific and medical teams may terminate their employment with us on short notice. We have entered into employment agreements with certain of our executive officers. However, these employment arrangements provide for at-will employment, which means that any of our employees could leave our employment at any time, with or without notice. The loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees could potentially harm our business, operating results or financial condition. In particular, we believe that the loss of the services of Yuval Cohen, Ph.D., our Chief Executive Officer, Barbara White, M.D., our Chief Medical Officer, Craig Millian, our Chief Commercial Officer and Sean Moran, C.P.A., M.B.A., our Chief Financial Officer, would have a material adverse effect on our business. Our success also depends on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled junior, mid-level, and senior managers as well as junior, mid-level, and senior scientific and medical personnel.\nOther pharmaceutical companies with which we compete for qualified personnel have greater financial and other resources, different risk profiles, and a longer history in the industry than we do. They also may provide more diverse opportunities and better chances for career advancement. Some of these characteristics may be more appealing to high-quality candidates than what we have to offer. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain high-quality personnel, the rate and success at which we can develop and commercialize product candidates would be limited.\nIf product liability lawsuits are brought against us, we may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of our drug candidates.\nWe face a potential risk of product liability as a result of the clinical testing of our drug candidates and will face an even greater risk if we commercialize our drug candidates. For example, we may be sued if any product we develop or any materials that we use in our products allegedly causes injury or is found to be otherwise unsuitable during product testing, manufacturing, marketing or sale. Any such product liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product, negligence, strict liability and a breach of warranties. Claims could also be asserted under state consumer protection acts. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit commercialization of our drug candidates. Even successful defense would require significant financial and management resources. Regardless of the merits or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u25cf decreased demand for our drug candidates;\n\u25cf injury to our reputation;\n\u25cf withdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u25cf costs to defend the related litigation;\n\u25cf a diversion of management\u2019s time and our resources;\n\u25cf substantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients;\n\u25cf product recalls, withdrawals or labeling, marketing or promotional restrictions;\n\u25cf the inability to commercialize our drug candidates; and\n\u25cf a decline in the value of our stock.\nOur inability to obtain and retain sufficient product liability insurance at an acceptable cost to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of products we develop. We intend to obtain product liability insurance covering our clinical trials. Although we will maintain such insurance, any claim that may be brought against us could result in a court judgment or settlement in an amount that is not covered, in whole or in part, by our insurance or that is in excess of the limits of our insurance coverage. Our insurance policies also have various exclusions, and we may be subject to a product liability claim for which we have no coverage. We may have to pay any amounts awarded by a court or negotiated in a settlement that exceed our coverage limitations or that are not covered by our insurance, and we may not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient capital to pay such amounts.\nWe may acquire businesses, assets or products, or form strategic alliances, in the future, and we may not realize the benefits of such acquisitions.\nWe may acquire additional businesses, assets or products, form strategic alliances or create joint ventures with third parties that we believe will complement or augment our existing business. If we acquire businesses with promising markets or technologies, we may not be able to realize the benefit of acquiring such businesses if we are unable to successfully integrate them with our existing operations and company culture. We may encounter numerous difficulties in developing, manufacturing and marketing any new delay or prevent us from realizing their expected benefits or enhancing our business. We cannot assure you that, following any such acquisition, we will achieve the expected synergies to justify the transaction.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nWe will be unable to issue additional shares for future capital raising transactions or strategic transactions unless we obtain stockholder approval to amend our certificate of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of our common stock available for issuance.\nWe have 150,000,000 authorized shares of common stock. As of March 15, 2021, we have 125,033,006 shares of common stock outstanding and 23,370,094 shares of common stock reserved for future issuance related to stock options and warrants. As a result, as of March 15, 2021, we have approximately 90,694 shares of authorized shares of common stock available for future issuance. We will be limited by the number of additional shares available for future capital raising transactions or business development transactions unless we obtain stockholder approval of an amendment to our certificate of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock. We plan to solicit the approval of our stockholders to amend our certificate of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock, but we cannot be certain that our stockholders will approve the amendment. A delay in securing, or a failure to secure, stockholder approval to amend our certificate of incorporation could cause a delay in our future capital raising, collaboration, partnership or other strategic transactions, and may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nOur affiliates may control our company for the foreseeable future, including the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval.\nOur officers, directors, and five percent stockholders collectively owned approximately 20.2% of our outstanding shares of common stock as of December 31, 2020. This concentration of voting power and control could have a significant effect in delaying, deferring or preventing an action that might otherwise be beneficial to our other stockholders and be disadvantageous to our stockholders with interests different from those entities and individuals. Certain of these individuals also have significant control over our business, policies and affairs as officers or directors of our company. Therefore, you should not invest in reliance on your ability to have any control over our company.\nAn active, liquid trading market for our common stock may not be sustained.\nPresently, our common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Market, or Nasdaq, and an investment in our company may require a long-term commitment, with no certainty of return. If we are unable to maintain an active, liquid active trading market:\n\u25cf investors may have difficulty buying and selling or obtaining market quotations;\n\u25cf market visibility for shares of our common stock may be limited; and\n\u25cf a lack of visibility for shares of our common stock may have a depressive effect on the market price for shares of our common stock.\nThe lack of an active market could impair your ability to sell your shares at the time you wish to sell them or at a price that you consider reasonable. The lack of an active market may also reduce the fair market value of your shares. An inactive market may also impair our ability to raise capital to continue to fund operations by selling shares and may impair our ability to acquire additional intellectual property assets by using our shares as consideration.\nWe are currently listed on the Nasdaq Global Market. If we are unable to maintain listing of our securities on the Nasdaq Global Market or any stock exchange, our stock price could be adversely affected and the liquidity of our stock and our ability to obtain financing could be impaired and it may be more difficult for our stockholders to sell their securities.\nAlthough our common stock is currently listed on the Nasdaq Global Market, we may not be able to continue to meet the exchange\u2019s minimum listing requirements or those of any other national exchange. If we are unable to maintain listing on Nasdaq or if a liquid market for our common stock does not develop or is sustained, our common stock may remain thinly traded.\nThe Listing Rules of Nasdaq require listing issuers to comply with certain standards in order to remain listed on its exchange. If, for any reason, we should fail to maintain compliance with these listing standards and Nasdaq should delist our securities from trading on its exchange and we are unable to obtain listing on another national securities exchange, a reduction in some or all of the following may occur, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our stockholders:\n\u25cf the liquidity of our common stock;\n\u25cf the market price of our common stock;\n\u25cf our ability to obtain financing for the continuation of our operations;\n\u25cf the number of institutional and general investors that will consider investing in our common stock;\n\u25cf the number of investors in general that will consider investing in our common stock;\n\u25cf the number of market makers in our common stock;\n\u25cf the availability of information concerning the trading prices and volume of our common stock; and\n\u25cf the number of broker-dealers willing to execute trades in shares of our common stock.\nThe market price of our common stock may be significantly volatile.\nThe market price for our common stock may be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors including the following:\n\u25cf actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly or annual operating results;\n\u25cf changes in financial or operational estimates or projections;\n\u25cf conditions in markets generally;\n\u25cf changes in the economic performance or market valuations of companies similar to ours; and\n\u25cf general economic or political conditions in the United States or elsewhere.\nIn particular, the market prices of biotechnology companies like ours have been highly volatile due to factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf any delay or failure to conduct a clinical trial for our product or receive approval from the FDA and other regulatory agencies;\n\u25cf developments or disputes concerning a company\u2019s intellectual property rights;\n\u25cf technological innovations of such companies or their competitors;\n\u25cf changes in market valuations of similar companies;\n\u25cf announcements by such companies or their competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, capital commitments, new technologies, or patents; and\n\u25cf failure to complete significant transactions or collaborate with vendors in manufacturing a product.\nThe securities market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are not related to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of shares of our common stock.\nFuture sales of shares by existing stockholders could cause our stock price to decline.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time. These sales, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares of common stock intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had outstanding options to purchase an aggregate of 14,289,643 shares of our common stock at a weighted average exercise price of $5.15 per share and warrants to purchase an aggregate of 1,506,206 shares of our common stock at a weighted average exercise price of $9.46 per share. The exercise of such outstanding options and warrants will result in further dilution of your investment. If our existing stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or if the public perceives that such sales could occur, this could have an adverse impact on the market price of our common stock, even if there is no relationship between such sales and the performance of our business.\nWe do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future, and consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends to holders of our common stock in the foreseeable future. Consequently, investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investments. There is no guarantee that shares of our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which our investors have purchased their shares.\nThere may be limitations on the effectiveness of our internal controls, and a failure of our control systems to prevent error or fraud may materially harm our company.\nWe are required, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, to furnish a report by our management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This assessment will need to include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nEffective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable and timely financial reports and, together with adequate disclosure controls and procedures, are designed to reasonably detect and prevent fraud. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. Undetected material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting could lead to financial statement restatements and require us to incur the expense of remediation.\nWe do not expect that our disclosure controls or internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error or all fraud. We may in the future discover weaknesses in our system of internal control over financial reporting that could result in a material misstatement of our financial statements. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system\u2019s objectives will be met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud will be detected. If we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal controls, investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, the market price of our stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by The Nasdaq Stock Market, the SEC or other regulatory authorities. Failure of our control systems to detect or prevent error or fraud could materially adversely impact us.\nWe may be unable to complete our analysis of our internal controls over financial reporting in a timely manner, or these internal controls may not be determined to be effective, which may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nWe may not be able to complete our evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting and any required remediation in a timely fashion. During the evaluation and testing process, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will be unable to assert that our internal controls are effective.\nIf we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or, if applicable, our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which would cause the price of our common stock to decline, and we may be subject to investigation or sanctions by the SEC. We will also be required to disclose changes made in our internal control and procedures on a quarterly basis.\nIf we identify a material weakness, our remediation efforts may not enable us to avoid a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting in the future. Any of the foregoing occurrences, should they come to pass, could negatively impact the public perception of our company, which could have a negative impact on our stock price.\nUpon dissolution of our company, you may not recoup all or any portion of your investment.\nIn the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of our company, whether voluntary or involuntary, the proceeds and/or assets of our company remaining after giving effect to such transaction, and the payment of all of our debts and liabilities and distributions required to be made to holders of any outstanding preferred stock will then be distributed to the stockholders of common stock on a pro rata basis. There can be no assurance that we will have available assets to pay to the holders of common stock, or any amounts, upon such a liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of our Company. In this event, you could lose some or all of your investment.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nWe have incurred substantial losses during our history and do not expect to become profitable in the near future, and we may never achieve profitability. Unused federal net operating losses for tax years beginning before January 1, 2018 may be carried forward to offset future taxable income, if any, until such unused net operating losses expire. Under legislation enacted in 2017, informally titled the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the Tax Act, as modified by legislation enacted on March 27, 2020, entitled the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or the CARES Act, federal net operating losses incurred in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, can be carried forward indefinitely, but the deductibility of such federal net operating losses in tax years beginning after December 31, 2020 is limited to 80% of taxable income. In addition, as a result of our merger in April 2014 with Corbus Pharmaceuticals, Inc., our wholly-owned subsidiary, our ability to utilize our federal net operating loss, carryforwards and federal tax credit prior to that date may be limited under Sections 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. The limitations apply if an \u201cownership change,\u201d as defined by Section 382, occurs. Generally, an ownership change occurs if the percentage of the value of the stock that is owned by one or more direct or indirect \u201cfive percent shareholders\u201d increases by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage at any time during the applicable testing period (typically three years). In addition, future changes in our stock ownership, which may be outside of our control, may trigger an \u201cownership change\u201d and, consequently, Section 382 limitations. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes to offset United States federal taxable income may be subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us.\nLegislation or other changes in U.S. tax law could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nThe rules dealing with U.S. federal, state, and local income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the Internal Revenue Service and the U.S. Treasury Department. Changes to tax laws (which changes may have retroactive application) could adversely affect us or holders of our common stock. In recent years, many changes have been made to applicable tax laws and changes are likely to continue to occur in the future. For example, the Tax Act, made significant changes to corporate taxation, including reduction of the corporate tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35% to a flat rate of 21%; limitation of the tax deduction for interest expense to 30% of adjusted earnings (except for certain small businesses); and, subject to certain changes in tax law made by the CARES Act as discussed above, limitation of the deduction of net operating losses generated in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 to 80% of taxable income, indefinite carryforward of net operating losses generated in tax years after 2018 and elimination of net operating loss carrybacks generated in tax years ending after December 31, 2017; changes in the treatment of offshore earnings regardless of whether they are repatriated; current inclusion in U.S. federal taxable income of certain earnings of controlled foreign corporations, mandatory capitalization of research and development expenses beginning in 2022; immediate deductions for certain new investments instead of deductions for depreciation expense over time; further deduction limits on executive compensation; and modifying, repealing and creating many other business deductions and credits, including the reduction in the orphan drug credit from 50% to 25% of qualifying expenditures. We continue to examine the impact this tax reform legislation may have on our business. Notwithstanding the reduction in the corporate income tax rate, the overall impact of the Tax Act is uncertain and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected. The impact of this tax reform on holders of our common stock is also uncertain and could be adverse. This periodic report does not discuss any such tax legislation or the manner in which it might affect us or our stockholders in the future. We urge our stockholders to consult with their legal and tax advisors with respect to such legislation. In addition, the CARES Act included certain changes in tax law intended to stimulate the U.S. economy in light of the COVID-19 outbreak, including temporary beneficial changes to the treatment of net operating losses, interest deductibility limitations and payroll tax matters.\nIt cannot be predicted whether, when, in what form, or with what effective dates, new tax laws may be enacted, or regulations and rulings may be enacted, promulgated or issued under existing or new tax laws, which could result in an increase in our or our shareholders\u2019 tax liability or require changes in the manner in which we operate in order to minimize or mitigate any adverse effects of changes in tax law or in the interpretation thereof.\nOur certificate of incorporation, as amended, allows for our board to create new series of preferred stock without further approval by our stockholders, which could adversely affect the rights of the holders of our common stock.\nOur board of directors has the authority to fix and determine the relative rights and preferences of preferred stock. We anticipate that our board of directors will have the authority to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of our preferred stock without further stockholder approval. As a result, our board of directors could authorize the issuance of a series of preferred stock that would grant to holders the preferred right to our assets upon liquidation and the right to receive dividend payments before dividends are distributed to the holders of common stock. In addition, our board of directors could authorize the issuance of a series of preferred stock that has greater voting power than our common stock or that is convertible into our common stock, which could decrease the relative voting power of our common stock or result in dilution to our existing stockholders.", "PERMNO": 15287, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "CRBP"}
