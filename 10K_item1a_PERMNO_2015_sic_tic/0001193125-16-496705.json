{"cik": "751978", "company": "VICOR CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-08", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements as a result of, among other factors, the risk factors set forth below.\nOur future operating results are difficult to predict and are subject to fluctuations.\nOur operating results, including revenues, gross margins, operating expenses, and net income (loss), have fluctuated on a quarterly and annual basis. Our focus on higher volume opportunities with OEMs and their contract manufacturers has caused the impact of a relative few such customers to disproportionately influence our operating results. Unanticipated delays in purchase orders from and shipments to these customers have resulted in lower revenue, contributing to our recent operating losses. We cannot predict when, or if, we will return to profitability. Our future operating results may be materially affected by a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nchanges in demand for our products and for our customers\u2019 end-products incorporating our products, as well as our ability to respond efficiently to such changes in demand, including changes in order lead times and the volume of product for which orders are received and the product shipped within an individual quarter;\n\u2022\nour ability to manage our supply chain, inventory levels, and our own manufacturing capacity or that of third-party partners in the event of delays or cancellation of significant customer orders;\n\u2022\nour ability to effectively coordinate changes in the mix of products we manufacture and sell, while managing our ongoing transition in organizational focus from traditional brick power components to our new products;\n\u2022\nour ability to provide and maintain a high level of support to an increasing number of demanding, high volume customers;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our third party suppliers, service subcontractors, and manufacturers to supply us with sufficient quantities of high quality products, components, or services on a timely basis;\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of our efforts to continuously reduce product costs and manage operating expenses;\n\u2022\nour ability to utilize our manufacturing facilities and personnel at efficient levels, maintaining production capacity and manufacturing yields;\n\u2022\nthe timing of our new product introductions and our ability to meet customer expectations for timely delivery of fully qualified products;\n\u2022\nthe timing of new product introductions or other competitive actions (e.g., product price reductions) by our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe ability to hire, retain, and motivate qualified employees to meet the demands of our customers;\n\u2022\nintellectual property disputes;\n\u2022\npotential significant litigation-related costs;\n\u2022\nadverse economic conditions in the United States and those international markets in which we operate;\n\u2022\nadverse budgetary conditions within the U.S. government, particularly the Department of Defense, which continue to limit spending on current and anticipated programs into which we sell or anticipate to sell our products;\n\u2022\ncosts related to compliance with increasing worldwide governance, quality, environmental, and other regulations; and\n\u2022\nthe effects of events outside of our control, including natural disasters, public health emergencies, terrorist activities, political risks, including international conflicts, information security breaches, communication interruptions, and other force majeure.\nAs a result of these and other factors, we cannot assure you we will not experience significant fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis. In addition, if our operating results do not meet the expectations of investors, the market price of our Common Stock may decline.\nOur stock price has been volatile and may fluctuate in the future.\nBecause of the factors set forth below, among others, the trading price of our Common Stock has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate significantly:\n\u2022\nvolatility of the financial markets;\n\u2022\nuncertainty regarding the prospects of domestic and foreign economies;\n\u2022\nuncertainty regarding domestic and international political conditions, including tax policies;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating performance or that of our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe performance and prospects of our major customers;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant new products, technical innovations, or litigation;\n\u2022\ninvestor perception of our company and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022\nthe absence of earnings estimates and supporting research by investment analysts;\n\u2022\nthe liquidity of the market for our Common Stock;\n\u2022\nthe uncertainty of the declaration and payment of future cash dividends on our Common Stock; and\n\u2022\nthe concentration of ownership of our Common Stock by Dr. Vinciarelli, our Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer, and President.\nWe do not actively communicate with investment analysts and, as a consequence, there are no earnings estimates or supporting research coverage of Vicor and our Common Stock. While we seek to be transparent in our financial reporting, public statements, and related disclosures, the absence of research coverage may limit investor interest in our Common Stock. Because our operating results have fluctuated on a quarterly and annual basis, investors may have difficulty in assessing our current and future performance.\nIn the past, we have declared and paid cash dividends on our Common Stock. The payment of dividends is based on the periodic determination by our Board of Directors that we have adequate capital to fund anticipated operating requirements and that excess cash is available for distribution to stockholders via a dividend. We have no formal policy regarding dividends and, as such, investors cannot make assumptions regarding the possibility of future dividend payments nor the amounts and timing thereof.\nThe ownership of our Common Stock is concentrated between Dr. Vinciarelli and a limited number of institutional investors. Dr. Vinciarelli owned, as of December 31, 2015, 9,828,271 shares of our Common Stock, as well as 11,023,648 shares of our Class B Common Stock (convertible on a one-for-one basis into Common Stock), together representing 54.8% of total issued and outstanding shares. Accordingly, the market float for our Common Stock and average daily trading volumes are relatively small, which can negatively impact investors\u2019 ability to buy or sell shares of our Common Stock in a timely manner.\nDr. Vinciarelli owns 93.7% of our issued and outstanding Class B shares, which possess 10 votes per share. Dr. Estia J. Eichten, a member of our Board of Directors, owns the majority of the balance of Class B shares\nissued and outstanding. As such, Dr. Vinciarelli, controlling in aggregate 82.9% of our outstanding voting securities, has effective control of our governance.\nThe ongoing uncertainty in global economies could materially and adversely affect our business and consolidated operating results.\nDisruption and further deterioration of global economic conditions, including relative strength of the U.S. Dollar, may reduce customer purchases of our products, thereby reducing our revenues and earnings. In addition, such adverse conditions may, among other things, result in increased price competition for our products, increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories, increased risk in the collectability of our accounts receivable from our customers, increased risk in potential reserves for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable, and higher operating costs as a percentage of revenues.\nWe compete with many companies possessing far greater resources.\nSome of our competitors have greater financial, manufacturing, technical, sales and marketing resources than we have. We compete with domestic and foreign manufacturers of integrated power supplies and power conversion components. With the growth of our VI Chip and Picor product lines, we increasingly are competing with global manufacturers of power management products with far larger organizations and broader semiconductor-based product lines. Competition is generally based on design and quality of products, product performance, features and functionality, and product pricing, availability and capacity, with the relative importance of these factors varying among products, markets and customers. Existing or new competitors may develop products or technologies that more effectively address the demands of our customers and markets with enhanced performance, features and functionality or lower cost. If we fail to develop and commercialize leading-edge technologies and products that are cost effective and maintain high standards of quality, and introduce them to the market on a timely basis, our competitive position and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nOur future success depends upon our ability to develop and market differentiated, leading-edge power conversion products for larger customers, potentially contributing to lengthy product development and sales cycles that may result in significant expenditures before revenues are generated. Our future operating results are dependent on the growth in such customers\u2019 businesses and on our ability to profitably develop and deliver products meeting customer requirements.\nThe power system industry and the industries in which many of our customers operate are characterized by intense competition, rapid technological change, quickened product obsolescence, and price erosion for mature products, each of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. We are following a strategy based on the development of differentiated products addressing what we believe to be the long-term limitations of traditional power architectures, while at the same time sustaining the performance of the BBU, which manufactures and markets our lines of legacy brick products. The development of new products is often a complex, time-consuming, and costly process involving significant investment in research and development, with no assurance of return on investment. Although we have introduced many products over the past three years, there can be no assurance we will be able to continue to develop and introduce new and improved products in a timely or efficient manner. Similarly, there can be no assurance recently introduced or to be developed products will achieve customer acceptance.\nOur future success depends substantially upon customer acceptance of our innovative products. As we have been in the early stages of market penetration for these products, we have experienced lengthy periods during which we have focused our product development efforts on the specific requirements of a limited number of large customers, followed by further periods of delay before meaningful purchase orders are received. These lengthy development and sales cycle times increase the possibility a customer may decide to cancel or change product plans, which could reduce or eliminate our sales to that customer. As a result, we may incur significant\nproduct development expenses, as well as significant sales and marketing expenses, before we generate the related revenues for these products. Furthermore, we may never generate the anticipated revenues from a product after incurring such expenses if our customer cancels or changes its product plans.\nWe are shifting our go-to-market strategy to focus on larger opportunities with global OEMs and their contract manufacturers. Our growth is therefore dependent on: the pace at which these OEMs develop their own new products, the acceptance of our products by these OEMs, and the success of the OEM products incorporating our new products. If we fail to anticipate changes in our customers\u2019 businesses and their changing product needs or do not successfully identify and enter new markets, our results of operations and financial position could be negatively impacted. We cannot assure you the markets we serve will grow in the future, our existing and new products will meet the requirements of these markets, or we can maintain adequate gross margins or operating profits in these markets.\nOur operating results recently have been influenced by a limited number of customers, and our future results may be similarly influenced.\nSince it was established, our VI Chip subsidiary has derived a substantial portion of its revenue in any given year from one customer, whether through sales directly to the customer or indirectly to the customer\u2019s contract manufacturers. Similarly, our Picor subsidiary has derived a substantial portion of its third-party revenue from a limited number of customers, including those customers served by VI Chip. This concentration of revenue is a reflection of the relatively early stage of adoption of the technologies, architectures, and products offered by these subsidiaries, and their targeting of market leading innovators as initial customers. Our current sales and marketing efforts, in part, are focused on accelerating the adoption of VI Chip and Picor products by a diversified customer base across a number of identified market segments. However, we cannot assure you our new strategy will be successful and such diversification of customers will be achieved.\nFurther stagnation of spending by the U.S. Department of Defense or a pronounced shift in the nature of such spending may negatively influence our operating results.\nCustomers in the defense electronics segment historically have contributed a meaningful portion of our revenue, primarily in the BBU, which sells military-grade brick modules and, through our Vicor Custom Power businesses, customer-specific systems incorporating our brick modules, primarily for C4I (Command, Control, Communications, Computing, and Intelligence) applications. However, shifts in Department of Defense spending priorities and ongoing budget constraints have contributed to a decline in such revenue as a percentage of our consolidated revenue. An additional risk to our defense electronics volume is associated with the organizational structure, capacity, and ownership of our Vicor Custom Power businesses. In December 2015, we completed the statutory merger of one Vicor Custom Power subsidiary, Mission Power Solutions, Inc. with and into another subsidiary, Northwest Power, Inc., after which we closed the Mission Power Solutions location. Also in December 2015, we sold our 49% ownership interest in Aegis Power Systems, Inc. to Aegis Power Systems, thereby ending our formal relationship with the subsidiary. We undertook these transactions in order to consolidate our custom organization, reduce manufacturing capacity, and reduce our cost structure. Also, Converpower Corporation, in which we hold a 49% ownership interest, ceased operations in December 2015, transferring its inventory and certain fixed assets to Granite Power Technologies, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary we established to assume the operations of a previously unincorporated Vicor Custom Power location (i.e., a division). We anticipate the formal transaction with Converpower will be completed during the first quarter of 2016. If the performance of the remaining three Vicor Custom Power subsidiaries does not improve during 2016, we may choose to further consolidate our locations or otherwise rationalize our associated cost structure, which may impact our ability to compete cost effectively in this market segment.\nWe may not be able to procure necessary key components for our products, or we may purchase excess raw material inventory or unusable inventory, possibly impacting our operating results.\nThe power systems industry, and the electronics industry as a whole, can be subject to pronounced business cycles and otherwise subject to sudden and sharp changes in demand. Our success, in part, is dependent on our ability to forecast and procure inventories of raw materials and components to match production schedules and customer delivery requirements. Many of our products require raw materials supplied by a limited number of vendors and, in some instances, a single vendor. During certain periods, key components or materials required to build our products may become unavailable in the timeframe required for us to meet our customers\u2019 needs. Our inability to secure sufficient materials and components to build products for our customers has, in the past, negatively impacted our sales and operating results and could do so again. We may choose, and have chosen, to mitigate this risk by increasing the levels of inventory for certain materials and components. Such increased inventory levels may increase the potential risk for excess or obsolete inventories, should our forecasts fail to materialize or if there are negative factors impacting our customers\u2019 end markets, leading to order cancellation. If we identify excess inventory or determine certain inventory is obsolete (i.e., unusable), we may record additional inventory reserves (i.e., expenses representing the write-off of the excess or obsolete inventory), which could have an adverse effect on our gross margins and on our operating results.\nWe rely on third-party vendors and subcontractors for supply of components, assemblies, and services and, therefore, cannot control the availability or quality of such components, assemblies, and services.\nWe depend on third-party vendors and subcontractors to supply components, assemblies, and services used in our products, some of which are supplied by a single vendor, and have experienced shortages of certain semiconductor components, incurred additional and unexpected costs to address the shortages, and experienced delays in production and shipping. If suppliers or subcontractors cannot provide their products or services on time or to our specifications, we may not be able to meet the demand for our products and our delivery times may be negatively affected. In addition, we cannot directly control the quality of the products and services provided by third parties. In order to grow revenue, we likely will need to identify and qualify new suppliers and subcontractors to supplant or replace existing suppliers and subcontractors which is a time-consuming and expensive process. In addition, any qualification of new suppliers may require customers of our products utilizing products and services from new suppliers and service providers to undergo a re-qualification process. Such circumstances likely would lead to disruptions in our production, increased production costs, delays in shipping to our customers, and/or increases in prices paid to third parties for products and services.\nWe are exposed to foreign economic, political, and other external risks.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, our revenues from sales outside the United States were 59.6%, 60.5%, and 59.5%, respectively, of the Company\u2019s total revenues. We expect international sales will continue to be a significant component of total sales, since many of the global manufacturers we target as customers increasingly utilize offshore contract manufacturers and rely upon those contract manufacturers to place orders directly with us. We also expect international revenue from our distributors to increase.\nWhile our currency risks are limited, as our sales are denominated in U.S. Dollars worldwide, with the exception of sales by VJCL and Vicor B.V., our international activities expose us to special risks including, but not limited to, regulatory requirements, economic and political instability, transportation delays, foreign currency controls and market fluctuations, trade barriers and tariffs, and unfavorable shifts in foreign exchange rates. In addition, our international customers\u2019 business may be negatively affected by the ongoing crisis in the global credit and financial markets, or by economic sanctions, as were imposed in 2014 by the U.S. Department of the Treasury against certain Russian entities. Sudden or unexpected changes in the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nWe may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary rights, which may limit our ability to compete effectively.\nWe operate in an industry in which the ability to compete depends on the development or acquisition of proprietary technologies that must be protected to preserve the exclusive use of such technologies. We devote substantial resources to establish and protect our patents and proprietary rights, and we rely on patent and intellectual property law to protect such rights. This protection, however, may not prevent competitors from independently developing products similar or superior to our products. We may be unable to protect or enforce current patents, may rely on unpatented technology that competitors could restrict, or may be unable to acquire patents in the future, all of which may have a material adverse effect on our competitive position. In addition, the intellectual property laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as those of the United States. We have been and may need to continue to defend or challenge patents. We have incurred and expect to incur significant financial costs in the defense of our patented technologies and have devoted and expect to devote significant resources to these efforts which, if unsuccessful, may have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial position.\nWe face intellectual property infringement claims that could be disruptive to operations and costly to resolve and may encounter similar infringement claims in the future.\nThe power supply industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights. We have in the past and may in the future receive communications from third parties asserting that our products or manufacturing processes infringe on a third party\u2019s patent or other intellectual property rights. Such assertions, if publicly disclosed, have in the past and may in the future inhibit the willingness of potential customers to purchase certain of our products. In the event a third party makes a valid intellectual property claim against us and a license is not available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, we could be forced to either redesign or stop production of products incorporating that technology, and our operating results could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, litigation may be necessary to defend us against claims of infringement, and this litigation could be costly, extend over a lengthy period of time, and divert the attention of key personnel. An adverse outcome in these types of matters could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition.\nPlease see Part I, Item 3 - \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d for information regarding current litigation related to our intellectual property.\nAny expenses or liability resulting from the outcome of litigation could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nFrom time to time, we may be subject to claims or litigation, including intellectual property litigation as described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any such claims or litigation may be time-consuming and costly, divert management resources, require us to change our products, or have other adverse effects on our business. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and could require us to pay significant monetary damages.\nThe outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. An estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred. In determining whether a loss should be accrued, we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our financial statements. As of December 31, 2015, our evaluation led us to conclude no accrual of a loss contingency was warranted.\nWe may face legal claims and litigation from product warranty or other claims that could be costly to resolve.\nWe have in the past and may in the future encounter legal action from customers, vendors, or others concerning product warranty or other claims. We generally offer a two-year warranty from the date title passes from us for all of our standard products. We invest significant resources in the testing of our products; however, if any of our products contain defects, we may be required to incur additional development and remediation costs, pursuant to our warranty policies. These issues may divert our technical and other resources from other product development efforts and could result in claims against us by our customers or others, including liability for costs associated with product returns, which may adversely impact our operating results. If any of our products contain defects, or have reliability, quality or compatibility problems, our reputation may be damaged, which could make it more difficult for us to sell our products to existing and prospective customers and could adversely affect our operating results. We are currently party to a limited number of supply agreements with certain customers contractually committing us to warranty and indemnification requirements exceeding those to which we have been exposed in the past. While we maintain insurance coverage for such exposure, we could incur significant financial cost beyond the limits of such coverage, as well as operational disruption and damage to our competitive position and image if faced with a significant product warranty or other claim.\nOur ability to successfully implement our business strategy may be limited if we do not retain our key personnel and attract and retain skilled and experienced personnel.\nOur success depends on our ability to retain the services of our executive officers. The loss of one or more members of senior management could materially adversely affect our business and financial results. In particular, we are dependent on the services of Dr. Vinciarelli, our founder, Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer, and President. The loss of the services of Dr. Vinciarelli could have a material adverse effect on our development of new products and on our results of operations. In addition, we depend on highly skilled engineers and other personnel with technical skills that are in high demand and are difficult to replace. Our continued operations and growth depend on our ability to attract and retain skilled and experienced personnel in a very competitive employment market. If we are unable to attract and retain these employees, our ability to successfully implement our business strategy may be harmed.\nExtended interruption of production at our manufacturing facility in Andover, Massachusetts, could materially reduce our revenue and increase costs.\nAll modular power components, whether for direct sale to customers or for sale to our subsidiaries for incorporation into their respective products, as well as all configurable products, are manufactured at our Andover, Massachusetts, production facility. Substantial damage to this facility due to fire, natural disaster, power loss or other events could interrupt manufacturing. While we have never experienced any meaningful interruption of manufacturing in our history, any prolonged inability to utilize all or a significant portion of our Andover facility could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nDisruption of our information technology infrastructure could adversely affect our business.\nWe depend heavily on our computing and communications infrastructure to achieve our business objectives, particularly for email communications, financial and operational record keeping, and our computer-integrated manufacturing processes that control all aspects of our operations in our manufacturing facility in Andover, Massachusetts. If a problem occurs impairing this infrastructure, the resulting disruption could impede our ability to record or process orders, manufacture and ship in a timely manner, or otherwise carry on business in the normal course. From time to time, we have experienced brief (i.e., periods of several hours) disruptions of our computing and communications infrastructure due to the effects of inclement weather on our access to the power grid or the public telecommunications infrastructure. To address this specific vulnerability, in 2012 we established our own proprietary fiber optic loop to connect our two facilities in Andover, Massachusetts, and\ninvested in expanded data storage capabilities at each location, enabling robust data backup and failover routines. Since 2012, we have experienced no interruption of our computing and communications capabilities. While we carry business interruption insurance that would mitigate financial losses from such an interruption to an extent, such insurance may be insufficient to compensate us for the potentially significant amounts incurred. Any such events, if prolonged, could have a material and adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nOur systems are designed to protect us from network security breaches and associated disruptions. However, we remain vulnerable to computer viruses and related software-based challenges to the integrity of our systems, unauthorized or illegal break-ins or malicious network hacking, equipment or software sabotage, acts of vandalism to our systems by third parties, and, in the extreme, forms of cyber-terrorism. Our security measures or those of our third-party service providers may not detect or prevent such network security breaches or associated disruptions. Also, we provide confidential information to third-party business partners in certain circumstances when doing so is necessary to conduct business. While we employ confidentiality agreements to protect such information, our own security measures or those of our third-party service providers may not be sufficient to protect such information in the event the computing infrastructure of these third-party business partners is compromised. Security breaches of our computing and communications infrastructure or that of a third-party business partner could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized release of confidential information belonging to us or to our employees, partners, customers or suppliers, which could result in an interruption to our operations, result in a violation of privacy or other laws, expose us to a risk of litigation, or damage our reputation, any of which could have a material and adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls over financial reporting or discover material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately or timely or detect fraud, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAn effective internal control environment is necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and is an important part of our effort to prevent financial fraud. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires our management to report on, and our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. As of year-end 2015, we implemented the new framework for internal control, Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013), as issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nWe have an ongoing program to perform the system and process evaluation and testing necessary to comply with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and to continuously improve and, when necessary, remediate internal controls over financial reporting.\nWhile management evaluates the effectiveness of our internal controls on a regular basis, these controls may not always be effective. There are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of internal controls, including collusion, management override, and failure in human judgment. In addition, control procedures are designed to reduce rather than eliminate business risks. In the event our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, or independent registered public accounting firm determines our internal controls over financial reporting are not effective as defined under Section 404, we may be unable to produce reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, which could materially adversely affect our business. In addition, we may be subject to sanctions or investigation by government authorities or self-regulatory organizations, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission or The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC. Any such actions could affect investor perceptions of the Company and result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which could cause the market price of our Common Stock to decline or limit our access to capital.\nNew regulations related to conflict minerals could adversely impact our business.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act contains provisions to improve transparency and accountability concerning the supply of certain minerals, known as conflict minerals (including\ngold, tantalum, tin, and tungsten, and their related ores), originating from the Democratic Republic of Congo (\u201cDRC\u201d) and adjoining countries. As a result, in August 2012 the SEC released final rules for annual disclosure and reporting for those companies who use conflict minerals mined from the DRC and adjoining countries in their products. We began to implement processes within our supply chain to comply these rules beginning in 2012 and filed our initial Form SD in May 2014. There have been and will continue to be costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including due diligence to determine the sources of conflict minerals used in our products and other potential changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. The implementation of these rules could adversely affect the sourcing, supply, and pricing of materials used in our products. As there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering \u201cconflict free\u201d conflict minerals, we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain necessary conflict minerals from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Also, we may face reputational challenges if we determine that certain of our products contain minerals not determined to be conflict free or if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all conflict minerals used in our products through the procedures we may implement.", "PERMNO": 76128, "SIC": 3679, "TIC": "VICR"}
