{"cik": "1080029", "company": "Dougherty's Pharmacy, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-05-06", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nWe are in default under our revolver credit facility, and as a result have no significant source of lender financing to maintain and grow our operations.\nOn August 1, 2018, we were obligated to make payment of the outstanding principal of $3,956,000 plus $18,000 in accrued and unpaid interest under the revolving credit facility. Failure to make this payment on the August 1, 2018, maturity date was an event of default under the revolving credit facility. The accrued interest of $18,000 was paid on August 2, 2018. An event of default under the revolving credit facility permitted the First National Bank of Omaha, among other things, to foreclose on the assets securing the revolving credit facility, which includes certain retail pharmacy assets, specifically but not limited to, inventory, equipment, software, accounts receivable, intangibles and deposit accounts of the Company. In addition to the failure to make the payment on the maturity date, as of August 1, 2018, we were not in compliance with its covenant to maintain a minimum debt service coverage ratio of not less than 1.00 to 1.00, as defined under the revolving credit facility. Failure to maintain this financial covenant also constituted an event of default under the revolving credit facility. On August 10, 2018, First National Bank of Omaha notified us that the revolving credit facility had been sold to OSK VII, LLC, effective on August 10, 2018. As a result of this default, we have no source of lender financing to support and maintain our operations other than a March 22, 2019 letter of credit from Legacy Bank for the benefit of our subsidiary, Associated Food Stores, Inc., in the amount of $825,000, with automatic annual reductions of $100,000 of this amount. Without a significant source of lender financing, we will find it difficult, if not impossible, to maintain our current operations, implement our plans for material growth in our business, or even continue operating as a going concern.\nAlthough our financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, we must significantly increase our revenue or raise additional capital to continue to fund our operations and continue as a going concern.\nWhitley Penn LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, has included an explanatory paragraph in their opinion that accompanies our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018, indicating that our current liquidity position raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. If we are unable to improve our liquidity position, we may not be able to continue as a going concern. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result if we are unable to continue as a going concern and, therefore, be required to realize our assets and discharge our liabilities other than in the normal course of business which could cause investors to suffer the loss of all or a substantial portion of their investment.\nWe anticipate that our principal sources of liquidity will only be sufficient to fund our activities and debt service needs for the next 6 months / through January 1, 2020. In order to have sufficient cash to fund our operations, we will need to significantly increase our revenues or raise additional equity or debt capital by January 1, 2020 in order to continue as a going concern, and we cannot provide any assurance that we will be successful in doing so.\nWe have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting which could, if not remediated, result in material misstatements in our financial statements.\nAlthough we have concluded that our consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2018, , present fairly, in all material respects, the results of operations, financial position, and cash flows of our company and its subsidiaries in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, we have identified a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting related to the controls around the company's license reporting process such that our usage reports utilized in determining obligations under certain software license agreements did not have formal change management control processes in place. Under standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, a material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected and corrected on a timely basis. See Item 9A, \"Controls and Procedures.\"\nOur auditors have identified certain deficiencies in internal control that they consider to be material weaknesses. (1) The Company did not perform internal evaluations of the valuation of deferred tax assets during 2018, and whether the deferred tax assets recorded were capable of being realized in future periods. This resulted in an audit adjustment to record a full valuation allowance against the remaining $2 million deferred tax asset maintained during 2018. (2) The Company has an inadequate number of personnel with requisite expertise in the key functional areas of finance and accounting to be able to have appropriately designed and operating entity level controls including risk assessment; information and communication; monitoring; and financial reporting. This lack of adequate personnel with accounting and financial reporting experience led to delays in preparing necessary schedules, reconciliations, and required SEC reports.\nWe are initiating remedial measures, but if our remedial measures are insufficient to address the material weakness, or if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting are discovered or occur in the future, our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements, and we could be required to restate our financial results. In addition, if we are unable to successfully remediate this material weakness and if we are unable to produce accurate and timely financial statements, our stock price may be adversely affected, and we may be unable to maintain compliance with the listing requirements for the over-the-counter bulletin board on which our common stock currently trades.\nWe need significant amounts of cash to service our debt. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash to service our debt, our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected.\nOur business requires us to rely on cash flow from operations and our debt agreements as our primary sources of funding for our liquidity needs. As of December 31, 2018, our outstanding debt totaled $6.9 million and our unrestricted cash totaled $248,000. Our level of indebtedness could have significant consequences. For example, it could:\n\u2022 Increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022 Require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations and proceeds from asset sales to pay or provide for our indebtedness, thus reducing the availability of cash flows to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, investments and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022 Limit our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and the market in which we operate;\n\u2022 Place us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors that have less debt; and\n\u2022 Limit our ability to borrow money to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements and other financing needs.\nHistorically, much of our debt has been renewed or refinanced in the ordinary course of business. In the future we may not be able to obtain sufficient external sources of liquidity on attractive terms, if at all, or otherwise renew, extend or refinance a significant portion of our outstanding debt scheduled to become due in the near future. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will maintain cash reserves and generate sufficient cash flow from operations in an amount sufficient to enable us to service our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs. Any of these occurrences may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. For example, our inability to extend, repay or refinance our debt when it becomes due, including upon a default or acceleration event, could force us to sell properties on unfavorable terms or ultimately result in foreclosure on properties pledged as collateral, which could result in a loss of our investment and harm our reputation.\nThe terms of the agreements governing our indebtedness include restrictive covenants and require that certain financial ratios be maintained. Failure to comply with any of these covenants could result in a default that may, if not cured, accelerate the payment under our debt obligations which would likely have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. Our ability to comply with our covenants will depend upon our future economic performance. These covenants may adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities that may be desirable or advantageous to us. In order to maintain compliance with the covenants in our debt agreements and carry out our business plan, we may need to raise additional capital through equity transactions or obtain waivers or modifications of covenants from our lenders. Such additional funding may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all, when needed. We also may need to incur additional indebtedness in the future in the ordinary course of business to fund our development projects and our operations. There can be no assurance that such additional financing would be available when needed or, if available, offered on acceptable terms. If new debt is added to current debt levels, the risks described above could intensify.\nWe may not be able to renegotiate our current prime vendor agreement on terms favorable to us, if at all.\nWe source substantially all of our generic and branded pharmaceutical drugs to fill prescriptions from a single supplier, Cardinal Health 110, Inc. and Cardinal Health 411, Inc. under a long-term prime vendor agreement that was amended in November of 2016. The current agreement extends through April 30, 2019. We are currently in discussions with Cardinal Health to negotiate terms for an extension of this agreement , however, we can make no assurances that we can obtain extension terms favorable to us, and if we were unable to continue to purchase under this agreement Any significant disruptions in our relationship with Cardinal Health could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe have determined that our disclosure controls are not effective.\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC\u2019s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our Chief Executive Officer has determined that as of December 31, 2018, these disclosures are not effective, in part because we were delinquent in filing our Quarterly report on Form 10-Q and this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If our disclosure controls are not effective, there is a risk that information required in such reports may not be communicated effectively and that material information may not be included in such reports or that such reports will not be filed timely and in accordance with the SEC\u2019s rules and forms.\nWe may not be able to effectively integrate and manage our current and anticipated growth strategies.\nOur failure to effectively manage our recent and anticipated future growth could strain our management infrastructure and other resources and adversely affect our results of operations. We expect our recent and anticipated future growth to present management, infrastructure, systems, and other operating issues and challenges. These issues include controlling expenses, retention of employees, the diversion of management attention, the development and application of consistent internal controls and reporting processes, the integration and management of a geographically diverse group of employees, and the monitoring of third parties.\nOur recent change in management may make it more difficult for us to maintain and grow our business.\nWe currently have one individual who was only recently appointed to serve as management, our President and Chief Executive Officer and interim Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Stewart I. Edington. We are heavily dependent upon our management\u2019s skills, talents and abilities to implement our business plan, and we are dependent upon the successful implementation of Mr. Edington\u2019s strategy. Because investors will not be able to evaluate the merits of our future Pharmacy Acquisition Opportunities, they should critically assess the information concerning our management and Board of Directors. Should we not successful integrate Mr. Edington into these roles, our business operations and growth strategies may be impaired, perhaps significantly.\nThe recent failure of our pharmacy location at The Campus at Legacy West in Plano, Texas may have a negative effect on our reputation.\nIn February of 2018, we opened a new retail pharmacy location at The Campus at Legacy West in Plano, Texas. This retail pharmacy location was open for only one year, and its closing in such a short amount of time may be viewed negatively by investors, lenders, vendors, and suppliers, and may affect our ability to attract, negotiate, and close future Pharmacy Acquisitions.\nWe are dependent on a small staff to execute our business plan.\nBecause of the limited size of our staff, each Pharmacy Acquisition becomes more difficult to integrate. Furthermore, it is difficult to maintain a complete segregation of duties related to the authorization, recording, processing and reporting of all such transactions. In addition, our strategy of pursuing Pharmacy Acquisitions will require our management and other personnel to devote significant amounts of time to integrating the acquired businesses with our existing operations. These efforts may temporarily distract their attention from day-to-day business and other business opportunities.\nUnforeseen costs associated with Pharmacy Acquisitions could reduce our profitability.\nWe have implemented our business strategy and made Pharmacy Acquisitions that may not prove to be successful over time. It is likely that we will encounter unanticipated difficulties and expenditures relating to our Pharmacy Acquisitions, including contingent liabilities, or needs for significant management attention that would otherwise be devoted to our general business strategies related to our other Pharmacy Acquisitions. These factors may negatively affect our results of operations. Unforeseen costs of our Pharmacy Acquisitions and potentially upon the closing of the purchase of future Pharmacy Acquisition Opportunities, which may have significant liabilities and commitments, could result in our inability to make required payments on our indebtedness, which would have a material adverse affect on our ability to implement our pursuit of Pharmacy Acquisition Opportunities, manage our existing Pharmacy Acquisitions, retain Pharmacy Acquisitions for which outstanding payment obligations remain, or continue our business as a going concern.\nWe may enter into additional leveraged transactions in connection with a Pharmacy Acquisition Opportunity.\nBased on our current cash position, it is likely that if we enter into any additional Pharmacy Acquisitions, such acquisitions will be leveraged, i.e., we may finance the acquisition of the business opportunity by borrowing against the assets of the Pharmacy Acquisition, or against the projected future revenues or profits of the Pharmacy Acquisition. This could increase our exposure to larger losses. A Pharmacy Acquisition Opportunity acquired through a leveraged transaction is profitable only if it generates enough cash flow to cover the related debt and expenses. Failure to make payments on the debt incurred to complete the Pharmacy Acquisition could result in the loss of a portion or all of the assets acquired. There is no assurance that any Pharmacy Acquisition effected through a leveraged transaction will generate sufficient cash flow to cover the related debt and expenses.\nAny debt service obligations relating to any future indebtedness for future Pharmacy Acquisitions will reduce the funds available for other business purposes.\nTo the extent we incur significant debt in the future for Pharmacy Acquisitions, capital expenditures, working capital, or otherwise, we will be subject to risks typically associated with debt financing, such as insufficient cash flow to meet required debt service payment obligations and the inability to refinance existing indebtedness.\nWe are restricted in our use of net operating loss carryforwards.\nOur federal net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carryforwards permit us the opportunity to offset net operating losses from prior years to taxable income in future years in order to reduce our tax liability. The use of these losses to reduce future income taxes will depend on the generation of sufficient taxable income prior to the expiration of the NOL carryforwards.\nThe federal net operating loss carryforwards, if not fully utilized, will expire between 2020 and 2035. Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d) imposes an annual limitation on the portion of our federal NOL carryforwards that may be used to offset taxable income.\nIn order to preserve our NOL carryforwards, we must ensure that there has not been a \u201cchange of control\u201d of our Company. A \u201cchange of control\u201d includes a more than 50 percentage point increase in the ownership of our company by certain equity holders who are defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code as \u201c5 percent stockholders\u201d. Calculating whether an ownership change has occurred is subject to uncertainty, both because of the complexity of Section 382 of the Code and because of limitations on a publicly-traded company\u2019s knowledge as to the ownership of, and transactions in, its securities. Therefore, the calculation of the amount of our NOL carryforwards may be changed as a result of a challenge by a governmental authority or our learning of new information about the ownership of, and transactions in, our securities. Our ability to fully utilize our NOL could be limited if there have been past ownership changes or if there are future ownership changes resulting in a change of control for Code Section 382. Additionally, future changes in tax legislation could negatively affect our ability to use the tax benefits associated with our net operating losses. Therefore, we can provide no assurance that a change in ownership of the Company would allow for the transfer of our existing NOL\u2019s to the surviving entity.\nWe are controlled by our principal stockholders, officers and directors.\nOur principal stockholders, officer and directors beneficially own approximately 31.6% of our Common Stock. As a result, such persons may have the ability to control and direct our affairs and business, perhaps in ways contrary to the interests of the Company\u2019s other stockholders. Such concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control or other transaction that could benefit the Company\u2019s stockholders.\nCertain provisions of the Company\u2019s charter and rights plan may make a takeover of our company difficult even if such takeover could be beneficial to some of the Company\u2019s stockholders\nThe Company\u2019s restated articles of incorporation authorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock with such designations, rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by the Company\u2019s board of directors. Accordingly, the Company\u2019s board is empowered, without further stockholder action, to issue shares or series of preferred stock with dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights that could adversely affect the voting power or other rights, including the ability to receive dividends, of the Company\u2019s common stockholders. The issuance of such preferred stock could be utilized, under certain circumstances, as a method of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control.\nOur industry is highly litigious and future litigation or other proceedings could subject us to significant monetary damages or penalties or require us to change our business practices, which could impair our reputation and result in a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are subject to risks relating to litigation, enforcement actions, regulatory proceedings, government inquiries and investigations, and other similar actions in connection with our business operations, including the dispensing of pharmaceutical products by pharmacies, claims, and complaints related to the various regulations to which we are subject and services rendered in connection with business activities. While we are currently not subject to any material litigation of this nature, such litigation is not unusual in our industry. Further, while certain costs are covered by insurance, we may incur uninsured costs related to the defense of such proceedings that could be material to our financial performance. In addition, as a public company, any material decline in the market price of our common stock may expose us to purported class action lawsuits that, even if unsuccessful, could be costly to defend or indemnify (to the extent not covered by insurance) and a distraction to management. Furthermore, unexpected volatility in insurance premiums or retention requirements or claims in excess of our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nOur business is subject to extensive regulation.\nOur pharmacists and pharmacies are required to be licensed by State Boards of Pharmacy. The pharmacies are also registered with the United States Drug Enforcement Administration. By virtue of these license and registration requirements, the entities owned by us are obligated to observe certain rules and regulations, and a violation of such rules and regulations could result in fines and/or in a suspension or revocation of a license or registration.\nIn addition, a portion of our revenue is derived from high-end, technical pharmacy services, such as compounded prescriptions and pain management products that are not typically offered by chain drug stores, grocery pharmacies or mass merchandise pharmacies. Additional federal and/or state regulations could also affect our business by putting additional burdens on us.\nIf we do not adequately respond to competitive pressures, demand for our products and services could decrease.\nOur retail pharmacies operate in a highly competitive industry. The markets we serve are subject to relatively few barriers to entry. These pharmacies compete primarily on the basis of customer service; convenience of location; and store design, price and product mix and selection. Some of our competitors have greater financial, technical, marketing, and managerial resources than we have. Local, regional, and national companies are currently competing in many of the health care markets we serve and others may do so in the future. In addition to traditional competition from independent pharmacies and other drugstore and pharmacy chains, our pharmacies face competition from discount stores, supermarkets, combination food and drugstores, mass merchants, warehouse clubs, mail order prescription providers online and omni-channel pharmacies and retailers, hospitals and health maintenance organizations (\u201cHMOs\u201d). These other formats have experienced significant growth in their market share of the prescription and over-the-counter drug business. Consolidation among our competitors, such as pharmacy benefit managers (PBM\u2019s) and regional and national pharmacy providers could result in price competition and other competitive factors that could cause a decline in our revenue and profitability.\nWe expect to continue to encounter competition in the future that could limit our ability to grow revenue and/or maintain acceptable pricing levels.\nRisk related to third party payors.\nOur revenues and profitability are affected by the continuing efforts of all third-party payors, including but not limited to HMOs, managed care organizations, PBMs and government programs (which are subject to statutory and regulatory requirements, administrative rulings, interpretations of policy, implementation of reimbursement procedures, retroactive payment adjustments, governmental funding restrictions and changes to existing legislation such as Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state funded programs) to contain or reduce the costs of health care by lowering reimbursement rates, narrowing the scope of covered services, increasing case management review of services and negotiating reduced contract pricing. Any changes in reimbursement levels from these third-party payor sources and any changes in applicable government regulations could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability. While manufacturers have increased the price of drugs, payors have generally decreased reimbursement rates as a percentage of drug cost. We expect pricing pressures from third-party payors to continue given the high and increasing costs of pharmaceutical drugs. Changes in the mix of pharmacy prescriptions covered by third party payors among Medicare, Medicaid and other payor sources may also impact our revenues and profitability. There can be no assurance that we will continue to maintain the current payor, revenue or profitability mix.\nCollectability of accounts receivable.\nOur failure to maintain controls and processes over billing and collecting, or the deterioration of the financial condition of our payors, could have a significant negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition. The collection of accounts receivable is one of our most significant challenges and requires constant focus and involvement by management. Further some of our payors and/or patients may experience financial difficulties, or may otherwise not pay accounts receivable when due, resulting in increased write-offs. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current levels of collectability and days sales outstanding in future periods. If we are unable to properly bill and collect our accounts receivable, our operating results will be adversely affected.\nWe are substantially dependent on a single supplier of pharmaceutical products to sell products to us on satisfactory terms. A disruption in our relationship with this supplier could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe obtain a majority of our total merchandise, including over 90% of our pharmaceuticals, from a single supplier, Cardinal Health 110, Inc. and Cardinal Health 411, Inc. (\u201cCardinal Health\u201d), with whom we have a long-term supply contract expiring April 30, 2019. Any significant disruptions in our relationship with Cardinal Health, or deterioration in Cardinal Health\u2019s financial condition, could have a material adverse effect on us.\nFailure to maintain sufficient sales to qualify for favorable pricing under our current long term supply contract could increase the costs of our products.\nOur current long term supply agreement with Cardinal Health, as amended in November 2016, provides us with pricing and credit terms that are improved from those previously provided by Cardinal Health. The minimum purchase commitment includes at least 90% of pharmaceutical product requirements (if carried by Cardinal Health) and at least 90% of generic pharmaceutical product be purchased from the Cardinal Health Generic Source Product Program. If we are unable to satisfy these minimum purchase requirements, we may be required to purchase our pharmaceutical products on less favorable pricing and credit terms.\nOur business is seasonal in nature, and adverse events during the holiday and cough, cold and flu seasons could adversely impact our operating results.\nOur business is seasonal in nature, with the months of December, January and February typically generating a higher proportion of retail sales and earnings than other months. Adverse events, such as deteriorating economic conditions, higher unemployment, higher gas prices, public transportation disruptions, or unanticipated adverse weather, could result in lower-than-planned sales during key selling months. For example, frequent or unusually heavy snowfall, ice storms, rainstorms, windstorms or other extreme weather conditions could make it difficult for our customers to travel to our stores. This could lead to lower sales, thus negatively impacting our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, both prescription and non-prescription drug sales are affected by the timing and severity of the cough, cold and flu season, which can vary considerably from year to year.\nOur operating results may fluctuate significantly, which makes our future operating results difficult to predict and could cause our operating results to fall below expectations or our guidance.\nOur quarterly and annual operating results, and in particular our revenues, have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future. These fluctuations make it difficult for us to predict our future operating results. Our operating results may fluctuate due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control and are difficult to predict, including the following:\n\u00b7 changes in the reimbursement policies of payors;\n\u00b7 the effect of the expiration of drug patents and the introduction of generic drugs;\n\u00b7 whether revenues and margins on sales of drugs that come to market are properly estimated;\n\u00b7 expenditures that we will or may incur to acquire or develop additional capabilities; and\n\u00b7 timing of increases in drug costs by manufacturers; and the amount of DIR fees and the timing for assessing us for such fees.\nThese factors, individually or in the aggregate, could result in large fluctuations and unpredictability in our quarterly and annual operating results. Thus, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. Investors should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance. This variability and unpredictability could also result in our failing to meet the expectations of industry or financial analysts or investors for any period.\nWe could be adversely affected by a decrease in the introduction of new brand name and generic prescription drugs as well as increases in the cost to procure prescription drugs.\nNew brand name drugs can result in increased drug utilization and associated sales, while the introduction of lower priced generic alternatives typically results in relatively lower sales, but relatively higher gross profit margins. Accordingly, a decrease in the number or magnitude of significant new brand name drugs or generics successfully introduced, or delays in their introduction, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn addition, if we experience an increase in the amounts we pay to procure pharmaceutical drugs, including generic drugs, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our gross profit margins would be adversely affected to the extent we are not able to offset such cost increases. Any failure to fully offset any such increased prices and costs or to modify our activities to mitigate the impact could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Additionally, any future changes in drug prices could be significantly different than our projections.\nWe may experience a significant disruption in our computer systems.\nWe rely extensively on our computer systems to manage our ordering, pricing, point-of-sale, pharmacy fulfillment, inventory replenishment, finance and other processes. Our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches, cyber-attacks, vandalism, natural disasters, catastrophic events and human error, and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. If any of our systems are damaged, fail to function properly or otherwise become unavailable, we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them, and may experience loss or corruption of critical data and interruptions or disruptions and delays in our ability to perform critical functions, which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. In addition, we are currently making, and expect to continue to make, substantial investments in our information technology systems and infrastructure, some of which are significant. Upgrades involve replacing existing systems with successor systems, making changes to existing systems, or cost-effectively acquiring new systems with new functionality. Implementing new systems carries significant potential risks, including failure to operate as designed, potential loss or corruption of data or information, cost overruns, implementation delays, disruption of operations, and the potential inability to meet business and reporting requirements. While we are aware of inherent risks associated with replacing these systems and believe we are taking reasonable action to mitigate known risks, there can be no assurance that we will not experience significant issues with our existing systems prior to implementation, that our technology initiatives will be successfully deployed as planned or that they will be timely implemented without significant disruption to our operations. We also could be adversely affected by any significant disruption in the systems of third parties we interact with, including key payors and vendors.\nWe outsource certain operations of our business to third-party vendors, which could leave us vulnerable to data security failures of third parties.\nWe outsource certain operations to third-party vendors to achieve efficiencies. Such outsourced functions include but are not limited to pharmacy system software updates and maintenance, payment processing, prescription data processing, and technology services. Although we expect our business partners to maintain the same vigilance as we do with respect to data security, we cannot control the operations of these third parties. While we engage in certain actions to reduce the exposure resulting from outsourcing, vulnerabilities in the information security infrastructure of our business partners could make us vulnerable to attacks or disruptions in service.\nPossible changes in industry pricing benchmarks.\nIt is possible that the pharmaceutical industry or regulators may evaluate and/or develop an alternative pricing reference to replace average wholesale price (\u201cAWP\u201d), which is the pricing reference used for many pharmaceutical purchase agreements, retail network contracts, specialty payor agreements, and other contracts with third party payors in connection with the reimbursement of specialty drug payments. Future changes to the use of AWP or to other published pricing benchmarks used to establish pharmaceutical pricing, including changes in the basis for calculating reimbursement by federal and state health programs and/or other payors, could impact our pricing arrangements. The effect of these possible changes on our business cannot be predicted at this time.\nLegislative or regulatory policies in the U.S. designed to manage healthcare costs or alter healthcare financing practices or changes to government policies in general may adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nCurrently, there are numerous congressional, legislative and/or regulatory proposals which seek to amend and or replace the ACA, including proposals to manage the cost of healthcare, including prescription drug cost. Such proposals may include changes in reimbursement rates, restrictions on rebates and discounts, restrictions on access or therapeutic substitution, limits on more efficient delivery channels, taxes on goods and services, price controls on prescription drugs, and other significant healthcare reform proposals, including their repeal or replacement. Further, more exacting regulatory policies and requirements specific to the pharmacy sector may cause a rise in costs, labor, and time to meet all such requirements. We are unable to predict whether any such policies or proposals will be enacted, or the specific terms thereof. Certain of these policies or proposals, if enacted, could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nOur business operations involve the substantial receipt and use of confidential health information concerning individuals. A failure to adequately protect any of this information could result in severe harm to our reputation and subject us to significant liabilities, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nMost of our activities involve the receipt or use of personal health information (\u201cPHI\u201d) concerning individuals. There is substantial regulation at the federal and state levels addressing the use, disclosure, and security of PHI. At the federal level, HIPAA and the regulations issued thereunder impose extensive requirements governing the transmission, use, and disclosure of health information by all participants in health care delivery, including physicians, hospitals, insurers, and other payors. Many of these obligations were expanded under Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health, passed as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Failure to comply with standards issued pursuant to federal or state statutes or regulations may result in criminal penalties and civil sanctions. In addition to regulating privacy of PHI, HIPAA includes several anti-fraud and abuse laws, extends criminal penalties to private health care benefit programs and, in addition to Medicare and Medicaid, to other federal health care programs, and expands the Office of Inspector General\u2019s authority to exclude persons and entities from participating in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Further, future regulations and legislation that severely restrict or prohibit our use of patient identifiable or other information could limit our ability to use information critical to the operation of our business. If we violate a patient\u2019s privacy or are found to have violated any federal or state statute or regulation with regard to confidentiality or dissemination or use of PHI, we could be liable for significant damages, fines, or penalties and suffer severe reputational harm, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, our business, our results of operations, and our future prospects.\nOur business, financial position, and operations could be adversely affected by environmental regulations, and health and safety laws and regulations applicable to our business.\nCertain federal, state, and local environmental regulations and health and safety laws and regulations are applicable to our business, including the management of hazardous substances, storage, and transportation of possible hazardous materials, and various other disclosure and procedure requirements that may be promulgated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration or the Environmental Protection Agency that may apply to our operations. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in substantial statutory penalties, sanctions, and, in certain circumstances, a private right of action by consumers, employees, or the general public.\nHealth Reform Legislation\nCongress passed major health reform legislation, including the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Healthcare and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (the \u201cHealth Reform Laws\u201d), which enacted a number of significant healthcare reforms. Many of these reforms affect the coverage and plan designs that are provided by our health plan clients. As a result, these reforms impact a number of our services and business practices. President Donald Trump has stated his intentions to support the repeal and possible replacement of the Health Reform Laws during his term of office. While Congress has not passed repeal legislation, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the Health Reform Laws on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the \u201cindividual mandate.\u201d Congress may consider other legislation to repeal or replace elements of the Health Reform Laws. While not all of these reforms, or their repeal or replacement, affect our business directly, they could affect the coverage and plan designs that are or will be provided by many of our health plan clients. As a result, these reforms, or their repeal or replacement, could impact many of our services and business practices. There is considerable uncertainty as to the continuation of these reforms, their repeal, or their replacement.\nCurrent economic conditions may adversely affect our industry, business and results of operations.\nThe future economic environment is uncertain. This economic uncertainty could lead to reduced consumer spending. If consumer spending decreases or does not grow, we may not be able to sustain or grow sales. In addition, reduced or flat consumer spending may drive us and our competitors to offer additional products at promotional prices, which would have a negative impact on our gross profit. A softening in consumer spending may adversely affect our industry, business and results of operations. Reduced revenues as a result of decreased consumer spending may also reduce our liquidity and otherwise hinder our ability to implement our long term strategy.\nCertain risks are inherent in providing pharmacy services, and our insurance may not be adequate to cover any claims against us.\nPharmacies are exposed to risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other health care products. Although we maintain professional liability and errors and omissions liability insurance, we cannot assure you that the coverage limits under our insurance programs will be adequate to protect us against future claims, or that we will maintain this insurance on acceptable terms in the future.\nOur common stock is deemed a penny stock and trading in penny stocks are risky, speculative, and often trade infrequently due to certain regulatory restrictions.\nThe term \"penny stock\" generally refers to a security issued by a very small company that trades at less than $5 per share. Penny stocks may trade infrequently, which means that it may be difficult to sell penny stock shares once you own them. Moreover, because it may be difficult to find quotations for certain penny stocks, they may be difficult, or even impossible, to accurately price. For these, and other reasons, penny stocks are generally considered speculative investments. Consequently, investors in penny stocks should be prepared for the possibility that they may lose their whole investment (or an amount in excess of their investment if they purchased penny stocks on margin). Because of the speculative nature of penny stocks, Congress prohibited broker-dealers from effecting transactions in penny stocks unless they comply with the requirements of Section 15(h) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and the rules thereunder. These SEC rules provide, among other things, that a broker-dealer must (1) approve the customer for the specific penny stock transaction and receive from the customer a written agreement to the transaction; (2) furnish the customer a disclosure document describing the risks of investing in penny stocks; (3) disclose to the customer the current market quotation, if any, for the penny stock; and (4) disclose to the customer the amount of compensation the firm and its broker will receive for the trade. In addition, after executing the sale, a broker-dealer must send to its customer monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer's account. These regulatory requirements may significantly depress the market for our shares of common stock and limit your ability to liquidate your investment in our shares of common stock.", "PERMNO": 87375, "SIC": 5912, "TIC": "MYDP"}
