{"cik": "1674227", "company": "SCWorx Corp.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-04-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nCertain factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. You should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below, in addition to other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties of which we are unaware, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. If any of the following risks occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment.\nWe may not be able to maintain sufficient capital to continue as a going concern.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, our revenue was approximately $150,000 and we had a net loss of approximately $14.6 million. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our revenues were approximately $221,000, and we had a net loss of approximately $12.0 million. At December 31, 2018, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $31.3 million. At December 31, 2018, our ability to continue as a going concern was dependent upon completing the acquisition of SCWorx.\nAs a result of the recently consummated convertible note and Preferred Stock financings, as of December 19, 2018, the Company had approximately $5.4 million of restricted cash, which under the operative documents was required to be held in reserve pending the closing of the Acquisition. In addition, as of December 31, 2018, SCWorx was required to provide additional advances of $215,000 under the SPA, as amended. These advances were made in January of 2019.\nWith the completion of the SCWorx acquisition and related financings, the Company currently has approximately $3.0 million in cash on hand. Although the Company has historically generated operating losses and negative operating cash flows, with the completion of the SCWorx acquisition, the Company expects that the combined company will generate operating profits and positive operating cash flows.\nThe Company believes that these positive operating cash flows, coupled with the cash on hand, are such that, as of the date of this report, the Company has sufficient cash to support the business for at least the one-year period following the date of this report.\nA failure by us to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nMaintaining effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to produce accurate and complete financial reports and to help prevent financial fraud. In addition, such control is required in order to maintain the listing of our common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market. While we have undertaken remedial steps to improve our financial reporting process, including the implementation of a firm-wide accounting information system that collects, stores and processes financial and accounting data on a consolidated basis for use in meeting our reporting obligations, there are no assurances that our internal control over financial reporting has been effective at any time since then. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company did not have effective controls over financial reporting. Our management has identified material weakness in our internal controls related to deficiency in the design of internal controls and segregation of duties.\nIf we are unable to maintain adequate internal controls or fail to correct material weaknesses in such controls noted by our management or our independent registered public accounting firm, our business and operating results could be adversely affected, we could again fail to meet our obligations to report our operating results accurately and completely and our continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market could be jeopardized.\nComplying with the laws and regulations affecting public companies will increase our costs and the demands on management and could harm our operating results.\nAs a public company and particularly after we cease to be an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d we incur significant legal, accounting, and other expenses. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and rules subsequently implemented by the SEC and the Nasdaq Capital Market impose various requirements on public companies, including requiring changes in corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations have increased and will continue to increase our legal, accounting, and financial compliance costs and have made and will continue to make some activities more time-consuming and costly. For example, these rules and regulations make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or to incur substantial costs to maintain the same or similar coverage. These rules and regulations could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors or board committees or as executive officers.\nIf we do not manage our growth effectively, our revenue, business and operating results may be harmed.\nOur expansion strategy includes the possible acquisitions of other SaaS companies. We may not be able to identify, secure and manage future acquisitions successfully. The acquisition of SCWorx and any future businesses may require a greater than anticipated investment of operational and financial resources as we seek to institute uniform standards and controls across acquired businesses. Acquisitions may also result in the diversion of management and resources, increases in administrative costs, including those relating to the assimilation of new employees, and costs associated with any financings undertaken in connection with such acquisitions. We cannot assure you that any acquisition we undertake, including those we have already made, will be successful. Future growth will also place additional demands on our management, sales, and marketing resources, and may require us to hire and train additional employees. We will need to expand and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to accommodate our growth, and we may not have the resources to do so in the time frames required. The failure to manage our growth effectively will materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to implement our strategy of acquiring additional companies and such acquisitions may subject us to additional unknown risks.\nWe may make future acquisitions of SaaS companies in markets that we do not serve now. We may not be able to reach agreements with such companies on favorable terms or at all. In completing acquisitions, we rely upon the representations and warranties and indemnities made by the sellers with respect to each acquisition as well as our own due diligence investigation. We cannot assure you that such representations and warranties will be true and correct or that our due diligence will uncover all materially adverse facts relating to the operations and financial condition of the acquired companies or their businesses. To the extent that we are required to pay for undisclosed obligations of an acquired company, or if material misrepresentations exist, we may not realize the expected economic benefit from such acquisition and our ability to seek legal recourse from the seller may be limited.\nThe value of our goodwill and other intangible assets declined in 2018.\nAs of December 31, 2018, there was no goodwill or other intangible assets. In 2018, we recorded intangible assets impairment charges of approximately $231,000. The impairment was identified as part of management\u2019s review of impairment indicators during the second quarter. Accordingly, it was determined the recoverable value of the promotion segment was less than the carrying value and therefore, an impairment loss was recorded. We had recorded goodwill in connection with the acquisitions we have made. We expect to record goodwill for future acquisitions. Our other net intangible assets had included venue relationships, ticketing software, trademarks and brands, fighter contracts, promoter relationships and sponsor relationships, at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment, and we amortized such assets using a method reflecting the period(s) in which the economic benefit of the asset is utilized, which we estimated to be three to ten years.\nWe evaluate goodwill at least annually, and will do so more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. Many of the assumptions and estimates that we make in order to estimate the fair value of our intangible assets directly impact the results of impairment testing, including an estimate of future expected revenues, earnings and cash flows, and the discount rates applied to expected cash flows. We are able to influence the outcome and ultimate results based on the assumptions and estimates we choose for testing. To avoid undue influence, we have set criteria that are followed in making assumptions and estimates. The determination of whether goodwill or acquired intangible assets have become impaired involves a significant level of judgment in the assumptions underlying the approach used to determine the value of our reporting unit. Changes in our strategy or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require adjustments to recorded amounts of intangible assets.\nFuture acquisitions may result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of indebtedness and increased amortization expense.\nFuture acquisitions are likely to result in issuances of equity securities, which will be dilutive to the equity interests of existing stockholders, and may involve the incurrence of debt, which will require us to maintain cash flows sufficient to make payments of principal and interest, the assumption of known and unknown liabilities, and the amortization of expenses related to intangible assets, all of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, the acquisition of SCWorx resulted in a change of control of the Company involving the issuance of approximately 5.3 million post-split adjusted shares of common stock and 190,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock, convertible into 500,000 post-split adjusted shares of common stock (subject to adjustment), and the issuance of warrants to purchase an additional 250,000 post-split adjusted shares of common stock, at an exercise price of $5.70 per share.\nWe may become involved in litigation which could harm the value of our business.\nBecause of the nature of our business and the exit from lines of business, there is a risk of litigation. Any litigation could cause us to incur substantial expenses whether or not we prevail, which would add to our costs and affect the capital available for our operations. For example, we were recently sued by our former CEO.\nEconomic uncertainty impacts our business and financial results and a renewed recession could materially affect us in the future.\nPeriods of economic slowdown or recession could lead to a reduction in demand for our software and services, which in turn could reduce our revenues and results of operations and adversely affect our financial position. Our business will be dependent upon business discretionary spending and therefore is affected by business confidence as well as the future performance of the United States and global economies. As a result, our results of operations are susceptible to economic slowdowns and recessions.\nWe depend on the services of key executives, and the loss of these executives could materially harm our business and our strategic direction if we were unable to replace them with executives of equal experience and capabilities.\nOur future success significantly depends on the continued service and performance of our key management personnel, especially our new CEO and SCWorx founder, Marc Schessel. We cannot prevent members of senior management from terminating their employment with us even if we have an employment agreement with them. Losing the services of members of senior management could materially harm our business until a suitable replacement is found, and such replacement may not have equal experience and capabilities. We have not purchased life insurance covering any members of our senior management.\nThe markets in which we operate are highly competitive, rapidly changing and increasingly fragmented, and we may not be able to compete effectively, especially against competitors with greater financial resources or marketplace presence.\nWe face competition from other SaaS companies. Many of the companies with which we will compete have greater financial and technical resources than are available to us. Our failure to compete effectively could result in a significant loss of customers, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nOur limited operating history makes forecasting our revenues and expenses difficult.\nRevenues and operating results are difficult to forecast accurately because of our limited operating history as a combined business, which commenced in February of 2019, and because SCWorx\u2019s results generally depend on our ability to secure term service/license agreements, which are subject to varying degrees of uncertainty. As a result, we may be unable to adjust our spending appropriately to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall, which may result in substantial losses and a lower market price for our common stock.\nWe may need additional capital to support our operations or the growth of our business, and we cannot be certain that this capital will be available on reasonable terms when required, or at all.\nIn order for us to grow and execute our business plan successfully, we may require additional financing which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. If such financing is available, it may be dilutive to the equity interests of existing stockholders. Failure to obtain financing will have a material adverse effect on our financial position. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to support the operation or growth of our business could be significantly impaired and our operating results may be harmed.\nIf we fail to meet the continued listing standards and corporate governance requirements for Nasdaq Capital Market companies, we may be subject to de-listing.\nOur common stock is currently listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market. In order to maintain this listing, we are required to comply with various continued listing standards, including corporate governance requirements, set forth in the Nasdaq Listing Rules. These standards and requirements include, but are not limited to, maintaining a minimum bid price for our common stock, as well as having a majority of our Board members qualify as independent. If we fail to meet any one of these requirements for an extended period of time, we will be subject to possible de-listing.\nOur common stock may be affected by limited trading volume and price fluctuations, which could adversely impact the value of our common stock and our ability to grow our business.\nThere has been limited trading in our common stock and there can be no assurance that an active trading market in our common stock will either develop or be maintained. Our common stock has experienced, and is likely to experience in the future, significant price and volume fluctuations, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock without regard to our operating performance. In addition, we believe that factors such as quarterly fluctuations in our financial results and changes in the overall economy or the condition of the financial markets could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially. These fluctuations may also cause short sellers to enter the market periodically in the belief that we will have poor results in the future. We cannot predict the actions of market participants and, therefore, can offer no assurances that the market for our common stock will be stable or that our share price will appreciate over time.\nOur stock price may be volatile .\nThe market price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could fluctuate widely in price in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the following:\n\u00b7 our ability to obtain working capital financing;\n\u00b7 additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u00b7 sales of our common stock;\n\u00b7 our ability to execute our business plan;\n\u00b7 operating results that fall below expectations;\n\u00b7 regulatory developments; and\n\u00b7 economic and other external factors.\nIn addition, the securities markets from time to time experience significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOffers or availability for sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nThe periodic availability of shares for sale upon the expiration of any statutory holding period or lockup agreements, could create a circumstance commonly referred to as an \u201coverhang\u201d, in anticipation of which the market price of our common stock could fall. The existence of an overhang, whether or not sales have occurred or are occurring, also could make more difficult our ability to raise additional financing through the sale of equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem reasonable or appropriate. We are required under the Series A Preferred Stock documents to register under the Securities Act of 1933 the shares of common stock underlying the preferred stock and related warrants. Once this registration statement goes effective, a substantial number of additional shares of common stock will likely become freely tradable which could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nWe may be unable to establish, protect or enforce our intellectual property rights adequately.\nOur success will depend in part on our ability to establish, protect and enforce our intellectual property and other proprietary rights. Our inability to protect our tradenames, service marks and other intellectual property rights from infringement, piracy, counterfeiting or other unauthorized use could negatively affect our business. If we fail to establish, protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, we may lose an important advantage in the market in which we compete. Our intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to help us maintain our position in the market and our competitive advantages. Monitoring unauthorized uses of and enforcing our intellectual property rights can be difficult and costly. Legal intellectual property actions are inherently uncertain and may not be successful, and may require a substantial amount of resources and management attention.\nChanges in laws, regulations and other requirements could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe are subject to the laws, regulations and other requirements of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Changes to these laws could have a material adverse impact on the revenue, profit or the operation of our business.\nDisruptions in our information technology systems or security breaches of confidential customer information or personal employee information could have an adverse impact on our operations.\nOur operations are dependent upon the integrity, security and consistent operation of various information technology systems and data centers that process transactions, communication systems and various other software applications used throughout our operations. Disruptions in these systems could have an adverse impact on our operations. We could encounter difficulties in developing new systems or maintaining and upgrading existing systems. Such difficulties could lead to significant expenses or to losses due to disruption in our business operations.\nIn addition, our information technology systems are subject to the risk of infiltration or data theft. The techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage information technology systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect or prevent over long periods of time. Moreover, the hardware, software or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise the security of our information systems. Unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities through fraud or deception aimed at our employees, contractors or temporary staff. In the event that the security of our information systems is compromised, confidential information could be misappropriated and system disruptions could occur. Any such misappropriation or disruption could cause significant harm to our reputation, lead to a loss of sales or profits or cause us to incur significant costs to reimburse third parties for damages.\nOur current insurance policies may not provide adequate levels of coverage against all claims and we may incur losses that are not covered by our insurance.\nWe believe we maintain insurance coverage that is customary for businesses of our size and type; however, we may be unable to insure against certain types of losses or claims, or the cost of such insurance may be prohibitive. For example, although we carry insurance for breaches of our computer network security, there can be no assurance that such insurance will cover all potential losses or claims or that the dollar limits of such insurance will be sufficient to provide full coverage against all losses or claims. Uninsured losses or claims, if they occur, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, business and results of operations.\nWe may be required to pay for the defense of our clients, officers, or directors in accordance with certain indemnification provisions.\nThe Company provides indemnification of varying scope to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of the Company\u2019s services. In accordance with authoritative guidance for accounting for guarantees, the Company evaluates estimated losses for such indemnification. The Company considers such factors as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. To date, no such claims have been filed against the Company and, as a result, no liability has been recorded in the Company\u2019s financial statements.\nAs permitted under Delaware law, the Company has agreements whereby it indemnifies its officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is, or was, serving at the Company\u2019s request in such capacity. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, the Company has directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance coverage that is intended to reduce its financial exposure and may enable the Company to recover a portion of any such payments.", "PERMNO": 16376, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "WORX"}
