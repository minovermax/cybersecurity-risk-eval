{"cik": "824410", "company": "SANDY SPRING BANCORP INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-02-22", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in the Company\u2019s common stock involves risks, including the possibility that the value of the investment could fall substantially and that dividends or other distributions could be reduced or eliminated. Investors should carefully consider the following risk factors before making an investment decision regarding the Company\u2019s stock. The risk factors may cause future earnings to be lower or the financial condition to be less favorable than expected, which could adversely affect the value of, and return on, an investment in the Company. In addition, other risks that the Company is not aware of, or which are not believed to be material, may cause earnings to be lower, or may deteriorate the financial condition of the Company. Consideration should also be given to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as in the documents incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K.\nChanges in U.S. or regional economic conditions could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s business activities and earnings are affected by general business conditions in the United States and in the Company\u2019s local market area. These conditions include short-term and long-term interest rates, inflation, unemployment levels, consumer confidence and spending, fluctuations in both debt and equity capital markets, and the strength of the economy in the United States generally and in the Company\u2019s market area in particular. A favorable business environment is generally characterized by, among other factors, economic growth, efficient capital markets, low inflation, low unemployment, high business and investor confidence, and strong business earnings. Unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by declines in economic growth, business activity or investor or business confidence; limitations on the availability or increases in the cost of credit and capital; increases in inflation or interest rates; high unemployment, natural disasters; or a combination of these or other factors. Economic pressure on consumers and uncertainty regarding continuing economic improvement may result in changes in consumer and business spending, borrowing and savings habits. A return to elevated levels of unemployment, declines in the values of real estate, extended federal government shutdowns, or other events that affect household and/or corporate incomes could impair the ability of the Company\u2019s borrowers to repay their loans in accordance with their terms and reduce demand for banking products and services.\nThe geographic concentration of the Company\u2019s operations makes the Company susceptible to downturns in local economic conditions.\nThe Company\u2019s commercial and commercial real estate lending operations are concentrated in central Maryland, Northern Virginia and Washington D.C. The Company\u2019s success depends in part upon economic conditions in these markets. Adverse changes in economic conditions in these markets could limit growth in loans and deposits, impair the Company\u2019s ability to collect amounts due on loans, increase problem loans and charge-offs and otherwise negatively affect performance and financial condition. Declines in real estate values could cause some of the Company\u2019s residential and commercial real estate loans to be inadequately collateralized, which would expose the Company to a greater risk of loss in the event that the recovery on amounts due on defaulted loans is resolved by selling the real estate collateral.\nThe Company\u2019s allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover its actual loan losses, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company maintains an allowance for loan losses in an amount that is believed to be adequate to provide for probable losses inherent in the portfolio. The Company has a proactive program to monitor credit quality and to identify loans that may become non-performing; however, at any time there could be loans in the portfolio that may result in losses, but that have not been identified as non-performing or potential problem credits. There can be no assurance that the ability exists to identify all deteriorating credits prior to them becoming non-performing assets, or that the Company will have the ability to limit losses on those loans that are identified. As a result, future additions to the allowance may be necessary. Additionally, future additions to the allowance may be required based on changes in the loans comprising the portfolio and changes in the financial condition of borrowers, or as a result of assumptions by management in determining the allowance. Additionally, banking regulators, as an integral part of their supervisory function, periodically review the adequacy of Company\u2019s allowance for loan losses. These regulatory agencies may require an increase in the provision for loan losses or to recognize further loan charge-offs based upon their judgments, which may be different from the Company\u2019s. Any increase in the allowance for loan losses could have a negative effect on the financial condition and results of operations of the Company.\nThe Company may not be able to adequately measure and limit its credit risk, which could lead to unexpected losses.\nThe business of lending is inherently risky, including risks that the principal of or interest on any loan will not be repaid timely or at all or that the value of any collateral supporting the loan will be insufficient to cover the Company\u2019s outstanding exposure. These risks may be affected by the strength of the borrower\u2019s business sector and local, regional and national market and economic conditions. Many of the Company\u2019s loans are made to small to medium-sized businesses that may be less able to withstand competitive, economic and financial pressures than larger borrowers. The Company\u2019s risk management practices, such as monitoring the concentration of loans within specific industries and credit approval practices, may not adequately reduce credit risk, and credit administration personnel, policies and procedures may not adequately adapt to changes in economic or any other conditions affecting customers and the quality of the loan portfolio. A failure to effectively measure and limit the credit risk associated with the Company\u2019s loan portfolio could lead to unexpected losses and have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf non-performing assets increase, earnings will be adversely impacted.\nAt December 31, 2018, non-performing assets, which are comprised of non-accrual loans, 90 days past due loans, restructured accruing loans and other real estate owned, totaled $37.6 million, or 0.46% of total assets, compared to non-performing assets of $31.6 million, or 0.58% of total assets at December 31, 2017. Non-performing assets adversely affect net income in various ways. Interest income is not accrued on non-accrual loans or other real estate owned. The Company must record a reserve for probable losses on loans, which is established through a current period charge to the provision for loan losses, and from time to time must write-down the value of properties in the Company\u2019s other real estate owned portfolio to reflect changing market values. Additionally, there are legal fees associated with the resolution of problem assets as well as carrying costs such as taxes, insurance and maintenance related to other real estate owned. Further, the resolution of non-performing assets requires the active involvement of management, which can distract them from more profitable activities. Finally, if the estimate for the recorded allowance for loan losses proves to be incorrect and the allowance is inadequate, the allowance will have to be increased and, as a result, Company earnings would be adversely affected. A downturn in the Company\u2019s market areas could increase credit risk associated with the loan portfolio, as it could have a material adverse effect on both the ability of borrowers to repay loans as well as the value of the real property or other property held as collateral for such loans.\nThe Company\u2019s commercial real estate lending activities expose it to increased lending risks and related loan losses.\nAt December 31, 2018, the Company\u2019s commercial real estate loan portfolio totaled $3.8 billion, or 58% of its total loan portfolio. Commercial real estate loans generally expose a lender to greater risk of non-payment and loss than one-to-four family residential mortgage loans because repayment of the loans often depends on the successful operation of the properties and the income stream of the borrowers. These loans involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to one-to-four family residential mortgage loans. To the extent that borrowers have more than one commercial real estate loan outstanding, an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship could expose the Company to a significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a one-to-four family residential real estate loan. Moreover, if loans that are collateralized by commercial real estate become troubled and the value of the real estate has been significantly impaired, then the Company may not be able to recover the full contractual amount of principal and interest that the Company anticipated at the time it originated the loan, which could cause the Company to increase its provision for loan losses and would adversely affect the Company\u2019s earnings and financial condition.\nImposition of limits by the bank regulators on commercial real estate lending activities could curtail the Company\u2019s growth and adversely affect its earnings.\nIn 2006, the federal banking regulators issued joint guidance entitled \u201cConcentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending, Sound Risk Management Practices,\u201d referred to herein as the CRE Guidance. Although the CRE Guidance did not establish specific lending limits, it provides that a bank\u2019s commercial real estate lending exposure could receive increased supervisory scrutiny where total non-owner-occupied commercial real estate loans, including loans secured by apartment buildings, investor commercial real estate, and construction and land loans, represent 300% or more of an institution\u2019s total risk-based capital, and the outstanding balance of the commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased by 50% or more during the preceding 36 months. Additionally, in December 2015, the federal banking regulators released a new statement on prudent risk management for commercial real estate lending, referred to herein as the 2015 Statement. In the 2015 Statement, the federal banking regulators, among other things, indicate the intent to continue \u201cto pay special attention\u201d to commercial real estate lending activities and concentrations going forward. Taking into account this guidance, if the Federal Reserve, the Bank\u2019s primary federal regulator, were to impose restrictions on the amount of commercial real estate loans the Bank can hold in its portfolio, for reasons noted above or otherwise, the Company\u2019s earnings would be adversely affected.\nAt December 31, 2018, the Bank\u2019s total non-owner-occupied commercial real estate loans, including loans secured by apartment buildings, investor commercial real estate, and construction and land loans represented 343% of the Bank\u2019s total risk-based capital and the growth in the CRE portfolio exceeded 50% over the preceding 36 months. Management has established a CRE lending framework to monitor specific exposures and limits by types within the CRE portfolio and takes appropriate actions, as necessary.\nThe Company\u2019s concentration of residential mortgage loans exposes it to increased lending risks.\nAt December 31, 2018, 19%, of the Company\u2019s loan portfolio was secured by one-to-four family real estate, a significant majority of which is located in central Maryland, Northern Virginia and Washington, D.C. One-to-four family residential mortgage lending is generally sensitive to regional and local economic conditions that significantly impact the ability of borrowers to meet their loan payment obligations, making loss levels difficult to predict. A decline in residential real estate values as a result of a downturn in the housing market could reduce the value of the real estate collateral securing these types of loans. Declines in real estate values could cause some of the Company\u2019s residential mortgages to be inadequately collateralized, which would expose the Company to a greater risk of loss if it seeks to recover on defaulted loans by selling the real estate collateral.\nThe Company may be subject to certain risks related to originating and selling mortgage loans.\nWhen mortgage loans are sold, it is customary to make representations and warranties to the purchaser about the mortgage loans and the manner in which they were originated. Whole loan sale agreements require the repurchase or substitution of mortgage loans in the event the Company breaches any of these representations or warranties. In addition, there may be a requirement to repurchase mortgage loans as a result of borrower fraud or in the event of early payment default of the borrower on a mortgage loan. The Company receives a limited number of repurchase and indemnity demands from purchasers as a result of borrower fraud and early payment default of the borrower on mortgage loans. The Company has enhanced its underwriting policies and procedures; however, these steps may not be effective or reduce the risk associated with loans sold in the past. If repurchase and indemnity demands increase materially, the Company\u2019s results of operations could be adversely affected.\nAny delays in the Company\u2019s ability to foreclose on delinquent mortgage loans may negatively impact the Company\u2019s business.\nThe origination of mortgage loans occurs with the expectation that if the borrower defaults then the ultimate loss is mitigated by the value of the collateral that secures the mortgage loan. The ability to mitigate the losses on defaulted loans depends upon the ability to promptly foreclose upon the collateral after an appropriate cure period. In some states, the large number of mortgage foreclosures that have occurred has resulted in delays in foreclosing. Any delay in the foreclosure process will adversely affect the Company by increasing the expenses related to carrying such assets, such as taxes, insurance, and other carrying costs, and exposes the Company to losses as a result of potential additional declines in the value of such collateral.\nChanges in interest rates may adversely affect earnings and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s net income depends to a great extent upon the level of net interest income. Changes in interest rates can increase or decrease net interest income and net income. Net interest income is the difference between the interest income earned on loans, investments, and other interest-earning assets, and the interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Net interest income is affected by changes in market interest rates, because different types of assets and liabilities may react differently, and at different times, to market interest rate changes. When interest-bearing liabilities mature or re-price more quickly than interest-earning assets in a period, an increase in market rates of interest could reduce net interest income. Similarly, when interest-earning assets mature or re-price more quickly than interest-bearing liabilities, falling interest rates could reduce net interest income.\nChanges in market interest rates are affected by many factors beyond the Company\u2019s control, including inflation, unemployment, money supply, international events, and events in world financial markets. The Company attempts to manage its risk from changes in market interest rates by adjusting the rates, maturity, re-pricing, and balances of the different types of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, but interest rate risk management techniques are not exact. As a result, a rapid increase or decrease in interest rates could have an adverse effect on the net interest margin and results of operations. Changes in the market interest rates for types of products and services in various markets also may vary significantly from location to location and over time based upon competition and local or regional economic factors. At December 31, 2018, the Company\u2019s interest rate sensitivity simulation model projected that net interest income would increase by 2.38% if interest rates immediately rose by 200 basis points. The results of an interest rate sensitivity simulation model depend upon a number of assumptions which may not prove to be accurate. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully manage interest rate risk.\nThe Company\u2019s investment securities portfolio is subject to credit risk, market risk, and liquidity risk.\nThe investment securities portfolio has risk factors beyond the Company\u2019s control that may significantly influence its fair value. These risk factors include, but are not limited to, rating agency downgrades of the securities, defaults of the issuers of the securities, lack of market pricing of the securities, and instability in the credit markets. Lack of market activity with respect to some securities has, in certain circumstances, required the Company to base its fair market valuation on unobservable inputs. Any changes in these risk factors, in current accounting principles or interpretations of these principles could impact the Company\u2019s assessment of fair value and thus the determination of other-than-temporary impairment of the securities in the investment securities portfolio. Investment securities that previously were determined to be other-than-temporarily impaired could require further write-downs due to continued erosion of the creditworthiness of the issuer. Write-downs of investment securities would negatively affect the Company\u2019s earnings and regulatory capital ratios.\nThe Company is subject to liquidity risks.\nEffective liquidity management is essential for the operation of the Company\u2019s business. The Company requires sufficient liquidity to meet customer loan requests, customer deposit maturities/withdrawals, payments on debt obligations as they come due and other cash commitments under both normal operating conditions and other unpredictable circumstances causing industry or general financial market stress. The Company\u2019s access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance its activities on terms that are acceptable to the Company could be impaired by factors that affect the Company specifically or the financial services industry or economy generally. Core deposits and Federal Home Loan Bank advances are the Company\u2019s primary source of funding. A significant decrease in core deposits, an inability to renew Federal Home Loan Bank advances, an inability to obtain alternative funding to core deposits or Federal Home Loan Bank advances, or a substantial, unexpected, or prolonged change in the level or cost of liquidity could have a negative effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nImpairment in the carrying value of goodwill could negatively impact the Company\u2019s earnings.\nAt December 31, 2018, goodwill totaled $347.1 million. Goodwill represents the excess purchase price paid over the fair value of the net assets acquired in a business combination. The estimated fair values of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities may be subject to refinement as additional information relative to closing date fair values becomes available and may result in adjustments to goodwill within the first 12 months following the closing date of the acquisition. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. There could be a requirement to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill prior to the normal annual assessment if there is a disruption in the Company\u2019s business, unexpected significant declines in operating results, or sustained market capitalization declines. These types of events and the resulting analyses could result in goodwill impairment charges in the future, which would adversely affect the results of operations. A goodwill impairment charge does not adversely affect regulatory capital ratios or tangible capital. Based on an analysis, it was determined that the fair value of the Company\u2019s reporting units exceeded the carrying value of their assets and liabilities and, therefore, goodwill was not considered to be impaired at December 31, 2018.\nThe Company depends on its executive officers and key personnel to continue the implementation of its long-term business strategy and could be harmed by the loss of their services.\nThe Company believes that its continued growth and future success will depend in large part on the skills of its management team and its ability to motivate and retain these individuals and other key personnel. In particular, the Company relies on the leadership of its Chief Executive Officer, Daniel J. Schrider. The loss of service of Mr. Schrider or one or more of the Company\u2019s other executive officers or key personnel could reduce the Company\u2019s ability to successfully implement its long-term business strategy, its business could suffer and the value of the Company\u2019s common stock could be materially adversely affected. Leadership changes will occur from time to time and the Company cannot predict whether significant resignations will occur or whether the Company will be able to recruit additional qualified personnel. The Company believes its management team possesses valuable knowledge about the banking industry and the Company\u2019s markets and that their knowledge and relationships would be very difficult to replicate. Although the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have entered into employment agreements with the Company, it is possible that they may not complete the term of their employment agreements or renew them upon expiration. The Company\u2019s success also depends on the experience of its branch managers and lending officers and on their relationships with the customers and communities they serve. The loss of these key personnel could negatively impact the Company\u2019s banking operations. The loss of key personnel, or the inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future, could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or operating results.\nThe market price for the Company\u2019s stock may be volatile.\nThe market price for the Company\u2019s common stock has fluctuated, ranging between $29.87 and $43.56 per share during the 12 months ended December 31, 2018. The overall market and the price of the Company\u2019s common stock may experience volatility. There may be a significant impact on the market price for the common stock due to, among other things:\n\u00b7 past and future dividend practice;\n\u00b7 financial condition, performance, creditworthiness and prospects;\n\u00b7 quarterly variations in operating results or the quality of the Company\u2019s assets;\n\u00b7 operating results that vary from the expectations of management, securities analysts and investors;\n\u00b7 changes in expectations as to the future financial performance;\n\u00b7 announcements of innovations, new products, strategic developments, significant contracts, acquisitions and other material events by the Company or its competitors;\n\u00b7 the operating and securities price performance of other companies that investors believe are comparable to the Company;\n\u00b7 future sales of the Company\u2019s equity or equity-related securities;\n\u00b7 the credit, mortgage and housing markets, the markets for securities relating to mortgages or housing, and developments with respect to financial institutions generally; and\n\u00b7 changes in global financial markets and global economies and general market conditions, such as interest or foreign exchange rates, stock, commodity or real estate valuations or volatility or other geopolitical, regulatory or judicial events.\nThere can be no assurance that a more active or consistent trading market in the Company\u2019s common stock will develop. As a result, relatively small trades could have a significant impact on the price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nCombining acquired businesses may be more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected and the anticipated benefits and cost savings of acquisitions may not be realized.\nThe success of the Company\u2019s mergers and acquisitions, including anticipated benefits and cost savings, will depend, in part, on the Company\u2019s ability to successfully combine and integrate the acquired business in a manner that permits growth opportunities and does not materially disrupt existing customer relations nor result in decreased revenues due to loss of customers. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of either company\u2019s ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect the combined company\u2019s ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers, depositors, employees and other constituents or to achieve the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the transaction. The loss of key employees could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to successfully conduct its business, which could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial results and the value of its common stock. If the Company experiences difficulties with the integration process, the anticipated benefits of a transaction may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. As with any merger of financial institutions, there also may be business disruptions that cause the Company to lose customers or cause customers to remove their accounts from the Company and move their business to competing financial institutions. Integration efforts will also divert management attention and resources. These integration matters could have an adverse effect on the Company during this transition period and for an undetermined period after completion of a transaction. It is possible that the potential cost savings could turn out to be more difficult to achieve than anticipated. The cost savings estimates also depend on the ability to combine the businesses in a manner that permits those cost savings to be realized.\nMarket competition may decrease the Company\u2019s growth or profits.\nThe Company competes for loans, deposits, and investment dollars with other banks and other financial institutions and enterprises, such as securities firms, insurance companies, savings associations, credit unions, mortgage brokers, and private lenders, many of which have substantially greater resources than possessed by the Company. Credit unions have federal tax exemptions, which may allow them to offer lower rates on loans and higher rates on deposits than taxpaying financial institutions such as commercial banks. In addition, non-depository institution competitors are generally not subject to the extensive regulation applicable to institutions that offer federally insured deposits. Other institutions may have other competitive advantages in particular markets or may be willing to accept lower profit margins on certain products. These differences in resources, regulation, competitive advantages, and business strategy may decrease the Company\u2019s net interest margin, increase the Company\u2019s operating costs, and may make it harder to compete profitably.\nThe Company operates in a highly regulated industry, and compliance with, or changes to, the laws and regulations that govern its operations may adversely affect the Company.\nThe banking industry is heavily regulated. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect the federal deposit insurance funds and depositors, not shareholders. Sandy Spring Bank is subject to regulation and supervision by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and by Maryland banking authorities. Sandy Spring Bancorp is subject to regulation and supervision by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. The burdens imposed by federal and state regulations put banks at a competitive disadvantage compared to less regulated competitors such as finance companies, mortgage banking companies, and leasing companies. Changes in the laws, regulations, and regulatory practices affecting the banking industry may increase the cost of doing business or otherwise adversely affect the Company and create competitive advantages for others. Regulations affecting banks and financial services companies undergo continuous change, and the Company cannot predict the ultimate effect of these changes, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations or financial condition. Federal economic and monetary policy may also affect the Company\u2019s ability to attract deposits and other funding sources, make loans and investments, and achieve satisfactory interest spreads.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to pay dividends is limited by law.\nThe ability to pay dividends to shareholders largely depends on Sandy Spring Bancorp\u2019s receipt of dividends from Sandy Spring Bank. The amount of dividends that Sandy Spring Bank may pay to Sandy Spring Bancorp is limited by federal laws and regulations. The ability of Sandy Spring Bank to pay dividends is also subject to its profitability, financial condition and cash flow requirements. There is no assurance that Sandy Spring Bank will be able to pay dividends to Sandy Spring Bancorp in the future. In addition, as a bank holding company, the Company\u2019s ability to declare and pay dividends is dependent on federal regulatory considerations, including limits on dividends should the Company not maintain the required capital conservation buffer and guidelines of the Federal Reserve regarding capital adequacy and dividends. It is the policy of the Federal Reserve that bank holding companies should generally pay dividends on common stock only out of earnings, and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organization\u2019s expected future needs, asset quality and financial condition. The Company may limit the payment of dividends, even when the legal ability to pay them exists, in order to retain earnings for other uses.\nRestrictions on unfriendly acquisitions could prevent a takeover of the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could discourage takeover attempts that are not approved by the board of directors. The Maryland General Corporation Law includes provisions that make an acquisition of the Company more difficult. These provisions may prevent a future takeover attempt in which the shareholders otherwise might receive a substantial premium for their shares over then-current market prices.\nThese provisions include supermajority provisions for the approval of certain business combinations and certain provisions relating to meetings of shareholders. The Company\u2019s articles of incorporation also authorize the issuance of additional shares without shareholder approval on terms or in circumstances that could deter a future takeover attempt.\nFuture sales of the Company\u2019s common stock or other securities may dilute the value and adversely affect the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nIn many situations, the board of directors has the authority, without any vote of the Company\u2019s shareholders, to issue shares of authorized but unissued stock, including shares authorized and unissued under the Company\u2019s equity incentive plans. In the future, additional securities may be issued, through public or private offerings, in order to raise additional capital. Any such issuance would dilute the percentage of ownership interest of existing shareholders and may dilute the per share book value of the Company\u2019s common stock. In addition, option holders may exercise their options at a time when the Company would otherwise be able to obtain additional equity capital on more favorable terms.\nChanges in tax laws may negatively impact the Company\u2019s financial performance.\nChanges in tax laws contained in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was enacted in December 2017, include a number of provisions that could have an impact on the banking industry, borrowers and the market for single family residential and multifamily residential real estate. Included in this legislation was a reduction of the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. In addition, other changes included: lower limits on the deductibility of mortgage interest on single family residential mortgages; the elimination of interest deductions for home equity loans; a limitation on deductibility of business interest expense; and a limitation on the deductibility of property taxes and state and local income taxes. Such changes in the tax laws may have an adverse effect on the market for, and valuation of, single family residential properties and multifamily residential properties, and on the demand for such loans in the future. In addition, these changes may have a disproportionate effect on taxpayers in states with high residential home prices and high state and local taxes. If home ownership or multifamily residential property ownership becomes less attractive, demand for mortgage loans would decrease. The value of the properties securing loans in the Company\u2019s portfolio may be adversely impacted as a result of the changing economics of home ownership and multifamily residential ownership, which could require an increase in the Company\u2019s provision for loan losses, which would reduce its profitability and could materially adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, certain borrowers could become less able to service their debts as a result of higher tax obligations. These changes could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in accounting standards or interpretation of new or existing standards may affect how the Company reports its financial condition and results of operations.\nFrom time to time the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) and the SEC change accounting regulations and reporting standards that govern the preparation of the Company\u2019s financial statements. In addition, the FASB, SEC, bank regulators and the outside independent auditors may revise their previous interpretations regarding existing accounting regulations and the application of these accounting standards. These changes can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how to record and report the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, there could be a requirement to apply a new or revised accounting standard retroactively, resulting in the restatement of prior period financial statements.\nThe implementation of a new accounting standard could require the Company to increase its allowance for loan losses and may have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations.\nFASB has adopted a new accounting standard that will be effective for the Company\u2019s first fiscal year after December 15, 2019. This standard, referred to as Current Expected Credit Loss, or CECL, will require financial institutions to determine periodic estimates of lifetime expected credit losses on loans, and provide for the expected credit losses as allowances for loan losses. This will change the current method of providing allowances for loan losses that are probable, which the Company expects could require it to increase its allowance for loan losses, and will likely greatly increase the data the Company would need to collect and review to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses. Any increase in the allowance for loan losses, or expenses incurred to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses, may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company faces a risk of noncompliance and enforcement action with the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations.\nThe federal Bank Secrecy Act, the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (the \"PATRIOT Act\") and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain effective anti-money laundering programs and file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports as appropriate. The federal Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, established by the U.S. Treasury Department to administer the Bank Secrecy Act, is authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and engages in coordinated enforcement efforts with the individual federal banking regulators, as well as the U.S. Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration and Internal Revenue Service. Federal and state bank regulators also focus on compliance with Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering regulations. If the Company\u2019s policies, procedures and systems are deemed to be deficient or the policies, procedures and systems of the financial institutions that the Company may acquire in the future are deficient, the Company would be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions such as restrictions on its ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of its business plan, including its acquisition plans, which would negatively impact the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s accounting estimates and risk management processes rely on analytical and forecasting models.\nThe processes that the Company uses to estimate its inherent loan losses and to measure the fair value of financial instruments, as well as the processes used to estimate the effects of changing interest rates and other market measures on its financial condition and results of operations, depends upon the use of analytical and forecasting models. These models reflect assumptions that may not be accurate, particularly in times of market stress or other unforeseen circumstances. Even if these assumptions are adequate, the models may prove to be inadequate or inaccurate because of other flaws in their design or their implementation. If the models that the Company uses for interest rate risk and asset-liability management are inadequate, the Company may incur increased or unexpected losses upon changes in market interest rates or other market measures. If the models that the Company uses for determining its probable loan losses are inadequate, the allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to support future charge-offs. If the models that the Company uses to measure the fair value of financial instruments are inadequate, the fair value of such financial instruments may fluctuate unexpectedly or may not accurately reflect what the Company could realize upon sale or settlement of such financial instruments. Any such failure in the Company\u2019s analytical or forecasting models could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to keep up with technological change in the financial services industry could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s competitive position or profitability.\nThe financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. The Company\u2019s future success depends, in part, upon its ability to address the needs of its customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in the Company\u2019s operations. Many of the Company\u2019s competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. The Company may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to its customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s risk management framework may not be effective in mitigating risks and/or losses to the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s risk management framework is comprised of various processes, systems and strategies, and is designed to manage the types of risk to which the Company is subject, including, among others, credit, market, liquidity, interest rate and compliance. The Company\u2019s framework also includes financial or other modeling methodologies that involve management assumptions and judgment. The Company\u2019s risk management framework may not be effective under all circumstances and may not adequately mitigate any risk or loss to the Company. If the Company\u2019s risk management framework is not effective, the Company could suffer unexpected losses and the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. The Company may also be subject to potentially adverse regulatory consequences.\nThe Company\u2019s information systems may experience an interruption or security breach.\nThe Company relies heavily on communications and information systems to conduct its business. The Company, its customers, and other financial institutions with which the Company interacts, are subject to ongoing, continuous attempts to penetrate key systems by individual hackers, organized criminals, and in some cases, state-sponsored organizations. Any failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in the Company\u2019s customer relationship management, general ledger, deposit, loan and other systems, misappropriation of funds, and theft of proprietary Company or customer data. While the Company has policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the possible failure, interruption or security breach of the Company\u2019s information systems, there can be no assurance that any such failure, interruption or security breach will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed. The occurrence of any failure, interruption or security breach of the Company\u2019s information systems could damage its reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject the Company to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose the Company to civil litigation and possible financial liability.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise the Company\u2019s information and expose the Company to liability, which would cause its business and reputation to suffer.\nIn the ordinary course of the Company\u2019s business, the Company collects and stores sensitive data, including intellectual property, its proprietary business information and that of the Company\u2019s customers, suppliers and business partners, and personally identifiable information of its customers and employees, in the Company\u2019s data centers and on its networks. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to the Company\u2019s operations and business strategy. Despite the Company\u2019s security measures, the Company\u2019s information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise the Company\u2019s networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, and regulatory penalties, disrupt the Company\u2019s operations and the services it provides to customers, damage its reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in its products and services, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, revenues and competitive position.\nThe Company is subject to laws regarding the privacy, information security and protection of personal information and any violation of these laws or another incident involving personal, confidential or proprietary information of individuals could damage the Company\u2019s reputation and otherwise adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and earnings. The Company\u2019s business requires the collection and retention of large volumes of customer data, including personally identifiable information in various information systems that the Company maintains and in those maintained by third parties with whom the Company contracts to provide data services. The Company also maintains important internal company data such as personally identifiable information about its employees and information relating to its operations. The Company is subject to complex and evolving laws and regulations governing the privacy and protection of personal information of individuals (including customers, employees, suppliers and other third parties). For example, the Company\u2019s business is subject to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act which, among other things: (i) imposes certain limitations on the Company\u2019s ability to share nonpublic personal information about its customers with nonaffiliated third parties; (ii) requires that the Company provide certain disclosures to customers about its information collection, sharing and security practices and afford customers the right to \u201copt out\u201d of any information sharing by the Company with nonaffiliated third parties (with certain exceptions); and (iii) requires that the Company develop, implement and maintain a written comprehensive information security program containing appropriate safeguards based on the Company\u2019s size and complexity, the nature and scope of its activities, and the sensitivity of customer information it processes, as well as plans for responding to data security breaches. Various state and federal laws and regulations impose data security breach notification requirements with varying levels of individual, consumer, regulatory or law enforcement notification in certain circumstances in the event of a security breach. Ensuring that the Company\u2019s collection, use, transfer and storage of personal information complies with all applicable laws and regulations can increase costs.\nFurthermore, the Company may not be able to ensure that all of its clients, suppliers, counterparties and other third parties have appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of the information that they exchange with the Company, particularly where such information is transmitted by electronic means. If personal, confidential or proprietary information of customers or others were to be mishandled or misused (in situations where, for example, such information was erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information, or where such information was intercepted or otherwise compromised by third parties), the Company could be exposed to litigation or regulatory sanctions under personal information laws and regulations. Concerns regarding the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s measures to safeguard personal information, or even the perception that such measures are inadequate, could cause the Company to lose customers or potential customers for its products and services and thereby reduce its revenues. Accordingly, any failure or perceived failure to comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws and regulations may subject the Company to inquiries, examinations and investigations that could result in requirements to modify or cease certain operations or practices or in significant liabilities, fines or penalties, and could damage the Company\u2019s reputation and otherwise adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and earnings.\nThe reliance of the Company on third-party vendors could expose it to additional cyber risk and liability.\nThe operation of the Company\u2019s business involves outsourcing of certain business functions and reliance on third-party providers, which may result in transmission and maintenance of personal, confidential, and proprietary information to and by such vendors. Although the Company requires third-party providers to maintain certain levels of information security, such providers remain vulnerable to breaches, unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses, or other malicious attacks that could ultimately compromise sensitive information possessed by the Company. Although the Company contracts to limit its liability in connection with attacks against third-party providers, the Company remains exposed to risk of loss associated with such vendors.\nThe Company outsources certain aspects of its data processing to certain third-party providers which may expose it to additional risk.\nThe Company outsources certain key aspects of the Company\u2019s data processing to certain third-party providers. While the Company has selected these third-party providers carefully, it cannot control their actions. If the Company\u2019s third-party providers encounter difficulties, including those which result from their failure to provide services for any reason or their poor performance of services, or if the Company has difficulty in communicating with them, its ability to adequately process and account for customer transactions could be affected, and the Company\u2019s business operations could be adversely impacted. Replacing these third-party providers could also entail significant delay and expense.\nThe Company\u2019s third-party providers may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses, phishing schemes and other security breaches. Threats to information security also exist in the processing of customer information through various other third-party providers and their personnel. The Company may be required to expend significant additional resources to protect against the threat of such security breaches and computer viruses, or to alleviate problems caused by such security breaches or viruses. To the extent that the activities of the Company\u2019s third-party providers or the activities of the Company\u2019s customers involve the storage and transmission of confidential information, security breaches and viruses could expose the Company to claims, regulatory scrutiny, litigation and other possible liabilities.\nThe Company is dependent on its information technology and telecommunications systems third-party servicers and systems failures, interruptions or breaches of security could have an adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s business is highly dependent on the successful and uninterrupted functioning of its information technology and telecommunications systems third-party servicers. The Company outsources many of its major systems, such as data processing and deposit processing systems. The failure of these systems, or the termination of a third-party software license or service agreement on which any of these systems is based, could interrupt the Company\u2019s operations. Because the Company\u2019s information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, it could experience service denials if demand for such services exceeds capacity or such third-party systems fail or experience interruptions. If sustained or repeated, a system failure or service denial could result in a deterioration of the Company\u2019s ability to provide customer service, compromise its ability to operate effectively, damage the Company\u2019s reputation, result in a loss of customer business and/or subject the Company to additional regulatory scrutiny and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, the Company provides its customers the ability to bank remotely, including online over the Internet. The secure transmission of confidential information is a critical element of remote banking. The Company\u2019s network could be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses, phishing schemes, spam attacks, human error, natural disasters, power loss and other security breaches. The Company may be required to spend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches and computer viruses, or to alleviate problems caused by security breaches or viruses. Further, the Company outsources some of the data processing functions used for remote banking, and accordingly it is dependent on the expertise and performance of its third-party providers. To the extent that the Company\u2019s activities, the activities of its customers, or the activities of the Company\u2019s third-party service providers involve the storage and transmission of confidential information, security breaches and viruses could expose the Company to claims, litigation and other possible liabilities. Any inability to prevent security breaches or computer viruses could also cause existing customers to lose confidence in the Company\u2019s systems and could adversely affect its reputation, results of operations and ability to attract and maintain customers and businesses. In addition, a security breach could also subject the Company to additional regulatory scrutiny, expose it to civil litigation and possible financial liability and cause reputational damage.\nRegulation of the financial services industry is intense, and the Company may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations.\nThe Company is subject to extensive government regulation, supervision and examination. Such regulation, supervision and examination govern the activities in which the Company may engage, and are intended primarily for the protection of the deposit insurance fund and the Bank\u2019s depositors, rather than for stockholders.\nIn 2010 and 2011, in response to the financial crisis and recession that began in 2008, significant regulatory and legislative changes resulted in broad reform and increased regulation affecting financial institutions. The Dodd-Frank Act has created a significant shift in the way financial institutions operate. The Dodd-Frank Act also created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or CFPB, to implement consumer protection and fair lending laws, a function that was formerly performed by the depository institution regulators. The Dodd-Frank Act contains various provisions designed to enhance the regulation of depository institutions and prevent the recurrence of a financial crisis such as that which occurred in 2008 and 2009. The Dodd-Frank Act has had and may continue to have a material impact on the Company\u2019s operations, particularly through increased regulatory burden and compliance costs. On May 24, 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, or the EGRRCPA, became law. Among other things, the EGRRCPA changes certain regulatory requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act and includes provisions intended to relieve the regulatory burden on community banks. Any future legislative changes could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s profitability, the value of assets held for investment or the value of collateral for loans. Future legislative changes could also require changes to business practices and potentially expose the Company to additional costs, liabilities, enforcement action and reputational risk.\nFederal regulatory agencies have the ability to take strong supervisory actions against financial institutions that have experienced increased loan production and losses and other underwriting weaknesses or have compliance weaknesses. These actions include entering into formal or informal written agreements and cease and desist orders that place certain limitations on their operations. If the Company were to become subject to a regulatory action, such action could negatively impact the Company\u2019s ability to execute its business plan, and result in operational restrictions, as well as the Company\u2019s ability to grow, pay dividends, repurchase stock or engage in mergers and acquisitions.\nFederal banking agencies periodically conduct examinations of the Company\u2019s business, including compliance with laws and regulations; the failure to comply with any supervisory actions to which the Company is or becomes subject as a result of such examinations could adversely affect the Company.\nAs part of the bank regulatory process, the Federal Reserve and the Maryland Commissioner of Financial Regulation periodically conduct comprehensive examinations of the Company\u2019s business, including compliance with laws and regulations. If, as a result of an examination, either of these banking agencies were to determine that the financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity, asset sensitivity, risk management or other aspects of any of the Company\u2019s operations had become unsatisfactory, or that the Company, the Bank or their respective management were in violation of any law or regulation, it may take a number of different remedial actions as it deems appropriate. The Federal Reserve may enjoin \u201cunsafe or unsound\u201d practices or violations of law, require affirmative actions to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice, issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced, direct an increase in the Company\u2019s capital levels, restrict the Company\u2019s growth, assess civil monetary penalties against the Company, the Bank or their respective officers or directors, and remove officers and directors. The FDIC also has authority to review the Bank\u2019s financial condition, and, if the FDIC were to conclude that the Bank or its directors were engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, that the Bank was in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or that the Bank or the directors violated applicable law, the FDIC could move to terminate the Bank\u2019s deposit insurance. If the Company becomes subject to such regulatory actions, its business, financial condition, earnings and reputation could be adversely affected.\nThe Company is subject to numerous laws designed to protect consumers, including the Community Reinvestment Act (\u201cCRA\u201d) and fair lending laws, and failure to comply with these laws could lead to a wide variety of sanctions.\nThe CRA requires the Federal Reserve to assess the Bank\u2019s performance in meeting the credit needs of the communities it serves, including low and moderate income neighborhoods, and if the Federal Reserve determines that the Bank needs to improve its performance or is in substantial non-compliance with CRA requirements, various adverse regulatory consequences may ensue. In addition, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act and other fair lending laws and regulations impose nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions. The CFPB, the U.S. Department of Justice and other federal agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations. The CFPB was created under the Dodd-Frank Act to centralize responsibility for consumer financial protection with broad rulemaking authority to administer and carry out the purposes and objectives of federal consumer financial laws with respect to all financial institutions that offer financial products and services to consumers. The CFPB is also authorized to prescribe rules applicable to any covered person or service provider, identifying and prohibiting acts or practices that are \u201cunfair, deceptive, or abusive\u201d in connection with any transaction with a consumer for a consumer financial product or service, or the offering of a consumer financial product or service. The ongoing broad rulemaking powers of the CFPB have potential to have a significant impact on the operations of financial institutions offering consumer financial products or services.\nA successful regulatory challenge to an institution\u2019s performance under the CRA, fair lending laws or regulations, or consumer lending laws and regulations could result in a wide variety of sanctions, including damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, restrictions on mergers and acquisitions activity, restrictions on expansion, and restrictions on entering new business lines. Private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution\u2019s performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation. Such actions could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 83414, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "SASR"}
