The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we do not know about currently, or that we currently believe are less significant, may also adversely affect our business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition. If any of these risks actually occur, our business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nOur industry is influenced by cyclical macroeconomic factors and future downturns may adversely affect our revenue and profits.\nOur revenue is generated predominantly from the office furniture industry, and demand for office furniture is influenced by macroeconomic factors such as corporate profits, non-residential fixed investment, white-collar employment and commercial office construction and vacancy rates. The U.S. and European office furniture industries went through two major declines in demand in the past two decades, driven by global economic downturns. During these downturns, our revenue declined and our profitability was significantly reduced. Although we have made a number of changes to adapt our business model to weather these types of events and we believe that demand for office furniture is not as heavily influenced by macroeconomic factors today as it has been historically, our revenues and profitability could be impacted in the future by adverse changes in these macroeconomic factors. These macroeconomic factors are difficult to predict, and if we are unsuccessful in further adapting our business as economic cyclical changes occur, our results may be adversely affected.\nFailure to respond to changes in workplace trends and the competitive landscape may adversely affect our revenue and profits.\nAdvances in technology, the globalization of business, changing workforce demographics and shifts in work styles and behaviors have been changing the world of work and having an impact on the types of workplace products and services purchased by our customers. In recent years, these trends have resulted in (1) a reduction in the number, size and price of typical workstations, (2) an increase in demand for residential and lounge-type settings, and for products with a broader range of price points, quality levels and warranty coverage, (3) shifting demand among product categories and (4) more frequent refreshment of workplace settings. These trends have also had an impact on our competitive landscape, leading to the emergence of smaller furniture competitors, diversification by some of our larger competitors into other industries and the entry of new competitors from outside the traditional office furniture industry, such as real estate management service firms, flexible workspace providers, technology-based firms, general construction contractors and retail and online residential furniture providers.\nWe compete on a variety of factors, including: brand recognition and reputation; insights from our research; product design and features; price, lead time, delivery and service; product quality; strength of dealers and other distributors and relationships with customers and key influencers, such as architects, designers and facility managers. If we are unsuccessful in developing and offering a wide variety of solutions which respond to changes in workplace trends and generate revenue to offset the impact of reduced numbers, size and price of typical workstations, or we or our dealers are unsuccessful in competing with existing competitors and new competitive offerings which could arise from outside our industry, our revenue and profits may be adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to successfully develop, implement and manage our diversification and growth strategies.\nOur longer-term success depends on our ability to successfully develop, implement and manage strategies that will preserve our position as the world\u2019s largest office furniture manufacturer, as well as expand our offerings into adjacent and emerging markets. In particular, our diversification and growth strategies include:\n\u2022\ntranslating our research regarding the world of work into innovative solutions which address market and user needs,\n\u2022\ngrowing our market share with existing dealers and customers and new customers,\n\u2022\nrealizing the value from recent acquisitions and investing in new acquisitions and business ventures,\n\u2022\ncontinuing our expansion into adjacent markets such as healthcare clinical spaces, classrooms, libraries and other educational settings and smaller companies,\n\u2022\ngrowing our market share in markets such as China, India and central, eastern and southern Europe, the Middle East and Africa,\n\u2022\nexpanding our product categories to include additional architecture and technology product offerings and\n\u2022\ndeveloping and realizing growth from marketing partnerships and additional channels of distribution.\nIf these strategies to diversify and increase our revenues are not sufficient, or if we do not execute these strategies successfully, our profitability may be adversely affected.\nChanges in tariffs, global trade agreements or government procurement could adversely affect our business.\nWe manufacture most of our products on a regional basis, and as a result, we often export products from where they are manufactured to where they are sold. We also source raw materials, components and finished goods from a global network of suppliers. In particular in 2019, more than 40% of the products we sold to customers in the U.S., including U.S. government agencies, were manufactured outside of the U.S., predominantly by our subsidiaries in Mexico, which operate as maquiladoras. Changes in tariffs or trade agreements could impact the cost of importing our products into the countries where they are sold and the cost of raw materials and components sourced from other countries, which in turn could adversely impact our gross margins and our price competitiveness. In addition, changes in U.S. government procurement rules requiring a certain amount of domestic content in goods, or requiring goods to be produced in the U.S., could have an adverse impact on our business, operating results or financial condition.\nWe may be adversely affected by changes in raw material, commodity and other input costs.\nWe procure raw materials (including steel, petroleum-based products, aluminum, other metals, wood and particleboard) from a significant number of sources globally. These raw materials are not rare or unique to our industry. The costs of these commodities, as well as fuel, energy, freight, labor and other input costs can fluctuate due to changes in global, regional or local supply and demand, larger currency movements and changes in import tariffs and trade barriers, which can also cause supply interruptions. In the short-term, significant increases in raw material, commodity and other input costs can be very difficult to offset with price increases because of existing contractual commitments with our customers, and it is difficult to find effective financial instruments to hedge against such changes. As a result, our gross margins can be adversely affected in the short-term by significant increases in these costs. If we are not successful in passing along higher raw material, commodity and other input costs to our customers over the longer-term because of competitive pressures, our profitability could be negatively impacted.\nOur global presence subjects us to risks that may negatively affect our profitability and financial condition.\nWe have manufacturing facilities, sales locations and offices in many countries, and as a result, we are subject to risks associated with doing business globally. Our success depends on our ability to manage the complexity associated with designing, developing, manufacturing and selling our solutions in a variety of countries. Our global presence is also subject to market risks, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition, including:\n\u2022\ndiffering business practices, cultural factors and regulatory requirements,\n\u2022\npolitical, social and economic instability, natural disasters, security concerns, including terrorist activity, armed conflict and civil or military unrest and global health issues and\n\u2022\nintellectual property protection challenges.\nOur global footprint makes us vulnerable to currency exchange rate fluctuations and currency controls.\nWe primarily sell our products in U.S. dollars and euros, but we generate some of our revenues and pay some of our expenses in other currencies. While we seek to manage our foreign exchange risk largely through operational means by matching revenue with same-currency costs, our results are affected by the strength of the currencies in countries where we manufacture or purchase goods relative to the strength of the currencies in countries where our products are sold. We use foreign currency derivatives to hedge some of the short-term volatility of these exposures. There can be no assurance that such hedging will be economically effective. If we are not successful in managing currency exchange rate fluctuations, it could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition.\nWe operate globally in multiple currencies, but we translate our results into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes, and thus our reported results may be positively or negatively impacted by the strengthening or weakening of the other currencies in which we operate against the U.S. dollar.\nIn addition, we face restrictions in certain countries that limit or prevent the transfer of funds to other countries or the exchange of the local currency to other currencies, which could have a negative impact on our profitability. We also face risks associated with fluctuations in currency exchange rates that may lead to a decline in the value of the funds held in certain jurisdictions, as well as the value of intercompany balances denominated in foreign currencies.\nWe are increasingly reliant on a global network of suppliers that exposes us to certain risks outside of our control.\nWe are reliant on the timely flow of raw materials, components and finished goods from a global network of third-party suppliers. The flow of such materials, components and goods may be affected by:\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the availability and quality of raw materials,\n\u2022\nthe financial solvency of our suppliers and their supply chains,\n\u2022\ndisruptions caused by labor activities and\n\u2022\ndamage and loss of production from accidents, natural disasters, severe weather events, systems and equipment failures and other causes.\nAny disruptions or fluctuations in the supply and delivery of raw materials, component parts and finished goods or deficiencies in our ability to manage our global network of suppliers could have an adverse impact on our business, operating results or financial condition.\nThe lack of redundant capabilities among our regional manufacturing facilities could adversely affect our business.\nMany of our products are currently produced in only one location in each of the three geographic regions in which we operate (the Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific), and our manufacturing model is predominately make-to-order. As a result, any issue which impacts the production capabilities of one of our manufacturing locations, such as natural disasters, severe weather events, disruptions in the supply of materials or components, systems and equipment failures or disruptions caused by labor activities, could have an adverse impact on our business, operating results or financial condition.\nWe rely largely on a network of independent dealers to market, deliver and install our products, and disruptions and increasing consolidations within our dealer network could adversely affect our business.\nOur business is dependent on our ability to manage our relationships with our independent dealers. From time to time, we or a dealer may choose to terminate our relationship, or the dealer could face financial insolvency or difficulty in transitioning to new ownership, and establishing a new dealer in a market can take considerable time and resources. Disruption of dealer coverage within a specific local market could have an adverse impact on our business within the affected market. The loss or termination of a significant number of dealers or the inability to establish new dealers could cause difficulties in marketing and distributing our products and have an adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition. In the event that a dealer in a strategic market experiences financial difficulty, we may choose to make financial investments in the dealership, which would reduce the risk of disruption but increase our financial exposure. Alternatively, we may elect to purchase and operate dealers in certain markets which also would require use of our capital and increase our financial exposure.\nOur diversification and growth strategies into adjacent markets, such as healthcare and education, and the increasing complexity of our technology and architectural products are driving the need for our dealers to develop additional capabilities and invest in additional resources to support such products and markets. Some of our smaller dealers do not have the scale to leverage such investments, and as a result, we have seen and may continue to see increased consolidation within our dealer network. This increased concentration and size of dealers could increase our exposure to the risks discussed above.\nWe may be adversely impacted by losses and reputational damage related to product defects.\nProduct defects can occur within our own product development and manufacturing processes or through our increasing reliance on third parties for product development and manufacturing activities. We incur various expenses related to product defects, including product warranty costs, product recall and retrofit costs and product liability costs, which can have an adverse impact on our results of operations. In addition, the reputation of our brands may be diminished by product defects and recalls.\nWe maintain a reserve for our product warranty costs based on certain estimates and our knowledge of current events and actions. While we have made significant investments to improve product quality and our warranty reserve has declined over the past three years based on historical claims experience, our actual warranty costs may exceed our reserve, resulting in a need to increase our accruals for warranty charges. We purchase insurance coverage to reduce our exposure to significant levels of product liability claims and maintain a reserve for our self-insured losses based upon estimates of the aggregate liability using claims experience and actuarial assumptions. Incorrect estimates or any significant increase in the rate of our product defect expenses could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe may be required to record impairment charges related to goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets which would adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe have net goodwill of $240.8 and indefinite-lived intangible assets of $12.8 as of February 22, 2019. Goodwill and other acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually in Q4 or whenever an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is more likely than not that an impairment may exist. Poor performance in portions of our business where we have goodwill or intangible assets, including failure to achieve projected performance from acquisitions, or declines in the market value of our equity, may result in impairment charges, which would adversely affect our results of operations.\nChanges in corporate tax laws could adversely affect our business.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions, and more than 39% of our income tax expense in 2019 related to the U.S. federal corporate income tax. As of February 22, 2019, we had deferred tax assets of $135.8 based on the effective rates in the jurisdictions where the deferred tax assets are held. The future effective tax rate could be affected by changes in mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation which are being considered in many jurisdictions. Such tax law changes, if enacted, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial position. Specifically, a reduction in applicable tax rates may require us to revalue and write-down our deferred tax assets.\nThere may be significant limitations to our utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards to offset future taxable income.\nWe have deferred tax assets related to net operating loss (\"NOL\") and tax credit carryforwards totaling $46.5 and $38.7, respectively, against which valuation allowances totaling $7.9 have been recorded. NOL carryforwards are primarily related to foreign jurisdictions. Tax credit carryforwards consist of U.S. foreign tax credits and foreign investment tax credits. We may be unable to generate sufficient taxable income from future operations in the jurisdictions in which we maintain deferred tax assets related to NOL and tax credit carryforwards, or implement tax, business or other planning strategies, to fully utilize the recorded value of our NOL and tax credit carryforwards. These deferred tax assets are recorded in various currencies that are also subject to foreign exchange risk, which could reduce the amount we may ultimately realize. Additionally, future changes in tax laws or interpretations of such tax laws may limit our ability to fully utilize our NOL and tax credit carryforwards.\nCosts related to our participation in a multi-employer pension plan could increase.\nOur subsidiary SC Transport Inc. contributes to the Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Fund (\"the Fund\"), a multi-employer pension plan, based on obligations arising under a collective bargaining agreement with our SC Transport Inc. employees. Under current law, an employer that withdraws or partially withdraws from a multi-employer pension plan may incur a withdrawal liability to the plan, which represents the portion of the plan\u2019s underfunding that is allocable to the withdrawing employer under very complex actuarial and allocation rules. In Q3 2019, the Fund asserted that SC Transport Inc.'s absence of hiring additional union employees over the past ten years, coupled with restructuring of SC Transport Inc.'s business, constituted an adverse selection practice under the Fund and, if not remedied, will result in the assessment of a withdrawal liability. As a result of the Fund\u2019s assertion, SC Transport Inc. recorded an $11.2 charge related to its estimated future obligations under a withdrawal liability.\nIn Q1 2020, we finalized a new collective bargaining agreement (\"CBA\") with our SC Transport Inc. employees that no longer requires us to contribute to the fund after March 31, 2019. We have notified the Fund of our CBA and we expect the Fund to issue a final assessment of our withdrawal liability from the Fund during 2020. The amount that may ultimately be required to settle any potential obligation may be lower or higher than the estimated liability, which will be adjusted as needed, if and when additional information becomes available. If actual settlements are significantly lower or higher than the estimated reserve, our results of operations may be materially affected. In addition, if the Fund were to experience a mass withdrawal within three years from the date of our withdrawal, our liability could increase by approximately $13. A mass withdrawal could occur if all participating employers in the Fund withdraw at the same time, if the trustees terminate the Fund or if all union employees decertify the union.", "PERMNO": 85796, "SIC": 2522, "TIC": "SCS"}
