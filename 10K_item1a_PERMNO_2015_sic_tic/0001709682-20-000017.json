{"cik": "1709682", "company": "NESCO HOLDINGS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nAny of the risk factors described in this Annual Report could result in a significant or material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Additional risk factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business or results of operations.\nInvestors should carefully consider the following risk factors, together with all of the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to these reports as well as our other SEC filings. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also have adverse impact to our business operations. Should any of these risks materialize, our business, results of operations, financial condition and future prospects could be negatively impacted, which could in turn affect the trading value of our securities.\nDemand for our services is cyclical and vulnerable to industry downturns and regional and national downturns, which may result from the current economic conditions.\nThe demand for specialty equipment services in the T&D, telecommunications, and rail industries has been, and will likely continue to be, cyclical in nature and vulnerable to downturns specific to the industry, as well as to the United States economy in general. If the general level of economic activity were to decrease below historic norms, or the time frames for updating the electricity, telecommunications, and rail infrastructure, or compliance periods for government-regulated reliability levels were extended, financing conditions for our industry could be adversely affected and our customers may delay commencement of work on, or cancel, new projects or maintenance activity on existing projects. A number of other factors, including changes in government infrastructure spending programs, outside of our control could adversely affect T&D, telecommunications, and rail project spending, which would result in lower demand from our customers for our services. As a result, demand for our services could decline for extended periods, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Additionally, each of T&D, telecommunication and rail industries may be affected at different times from market fluctuations specific to those industries. A worsening of economic conditions, in particular with respect to industrial activities, could cause weakness in our end markets and adversely affect our revenues and operating results.\nOur revenue and operating results have historically fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate, which could result in a decline in our profitability and make it more difficult for us to grow our business.\nOur revenue and operating results have historically varied from quarter to quarter. Periods of decline could result in an overall decline in profitability and make it more difficult for us grow our business. We expect our quarterly results to continue to fluctuate in the future due to a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions in the markets where we operate;\n\u2022\nthe cyclical nature of our customers\u2019 business; (T&D, telecommunications and rail)\n\u2022\nseasonal rental patterns of our customers, with rental activity tending to be lower in the winter and summer months;\n\u2022\nsevere weather and seismic conditions temporarily affecting the regions where we operate;\n\u2022\nchanges in governmental regulations specific to the industries in which we operate;\n\u2022\nchanges in government spending for infrastructure projects;\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of integrating acquired businesses and new start-up businesses;\n\u2022\nthe cost and availability of capital to make acquisitions;\n\u2022\nthe cost and availability of equipment to replenish and grow our fleet;\n\u2022\nchanges in demand for, or utilization of, our equipment or in the prices we charge due to changes in economic conditions, competition or other factors;\n\u2022\nincreases in interest rates and related increases in our interest expense and our debt service obligations;\n\u2022\ncurrency risks and other risks associated with international operations;\n\u2022\nan overcapacity of fleet in the equipment rental industry; and\n\u2022\nchanges in the size of our rental fleet and/or in the rate at which we sell our used equipment.\nUnfavorable conditions or disruptions in the capital and credit markets may adversely impact industry conditions and the availability of credit to our customers and suppliers, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nDisruptions in the global capital and credit markets as a result of economic downturns, economic uncertainty, changing or increased regulation, reduced alternatives or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our customers\u2019 ability to access capital. Additionally, unfavorable market conditions could impede the rate of economic recovery, which may depress demand for our products and services or make it more difficult for our customers to obtain financing and credit on reasonable terms. Also, more of our customers may be unable to meet their payment obligations to us, increasing delinquencies and credit losses. Moreover, our suppliers may be adversely impacted, causing disruption or delay of product availability.\nIn addition, if the financial institutions that commit to lend us money under any debt facilities we have entered into or may enter into in the future are adversely affected by the conditions of the capital and credit markets, they may become unable to fund borrowings under those commitments, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and our ability to borrow funds, if needed, for working capital, acquisitions, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes. These events could negatively impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe purchase a significant amount of our equipment from a limited number of manufacturers and suppliers. An adverse change in or termination of our relationships with any of those manufacturers or suppliers could result in our inability to obtain equipment on an adequate or timely basis, negatively impacting our relationships with our customers and having a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe purchase most of our equipment from a limited group of leading OEMs. For the year ended December 31, 2019, three vendors, on a combined basis, accounted for more than 10% of purchases. We rely on these suppliers and manufacturers to provide us with equipment that we then rent to our customers. To the extent we are unable to rely on these suppliers and manufacturers, due to an adverse change in our relationships with them, if they fail to continue operating as a going concern, if they significantly raise their costs, if a large amount of our rental equipment is subject to simultaneous recalls that would prevent us from renting such equipment for a significant period of time, or such suppliers or manufacturers simply are unable to supply us with equipment or needed replacement parts in a timely manner, our business could be adversely affected through higher costs or the resulting potential inability to service our customers. We may experience delays in receiving equipment from some manufacturers due to factors beyond our control, including parts and material shortages, and, to the extent that we experience any such delays, our customer relationships could be hurt by the resulting inability to service our customers. In addition, the payment terms we have negotiated with the suppliers that provide us with the majority of our equipment may not be available to us at a later time. Although we believe that we have alternative sources of supply for the rental equipment we purchase in each of our core product categories, termination of one or more of our relationships with any of these major suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nChanges to international trade agreements, tariffs, import and excise duties, taxes or other governmental rules and regulations could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThe U.S. federal government or other governmental bodies may propose changes to international trade agreements, tariffs, taxes and other government rules and regulations. Any changes to the international trading system, or the emergence or escalation of an international trade dispute, could significantly impact our business and have a negative impact on our revenues. In addition, the U.S. and other countries from which materials used heavily in the industries that we serve may impose import and excise duties, tariffs and other taxes on products in varying amounts. Any significant increases in import and excise duties or other taxes on products that ultimately impact and are used in the industries in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations.\nIn the United States and globally, international trade policy is undergoing review and revision, introducing significant uncertainty with respect to future trade regulations and existing international trade agreements. These major revisions include the negotiation of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) (in Canada, known as the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA)), which is intended to supersede the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). USMCA/CUSMA has been signed but not ratified by the legislature of each of the United States, Canada and Mexico. NAFTA provides protection against tariffs, duties and other charges or fees and assures access by the signatories. The impact of USMCA/CUSMA, if ratified, on the industries in which we operate is uncertain but could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are subject to competition, which may have a material adverse effect on our business by reducing our ability to increase or maintain revenues or profitability.\nThe specialty equipment rental industry is highly competitive and highly fragmented. Many of the markets in which we operate are served by numerous competitors, ranging from national and regional equipment rental companies to small, independent businesses with a limited number of locations. We generally compete on the basis of availability, quality, reliability, delivery and price. Some of our competitors have significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do, and may be able to reduce rental rates or sales prices. In addition, we cannot be certain that our existing or prospective customers will continue to rent equipment in the future. If they instead choose to purchase equipment, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nEffective management of our rental equipment is vital to our business.\nOur rental equipment has a long economic life and managing this equipment is a critical element to our business. We must successfully maintain and repair our equipment cost-effectively to maximize the economic life of our products and the level of proceeds from the sale of such products. As the needs of our customers change, we may need to incur costs to relocate or retrofit our assets to better meet shifts in demand. If the distribution of our assets is not aligned with regional demand, we may be unable to take advantage of opportunities despite excess inventory in other regions. If we are not able to successfully manage our assets, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.\nThe cost of new equipment that we purchase for use in our rental fleet may increase and therefore we may spend more for such equipment, and in some cases, we may not be able to procure equipment on a timely basis due to supplier constraints.\nThe cost of new equipment from manufacturers that we purchase for use in our rental fleet may increase as a result of factors beyond our control, such as inflation, higher interest rates and increased raw material costs, including increases in the cost of steel, which is a primary material used in most of the equipment we use. For example, on March 1, 2018, the President of the United States announced a plan to indefinitely impose a 25% tariff on certain imported steel products and a 10% tariff on certain imported aluminum products under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. Application of the tariffs commenced March 23, 2018, with temporary or long-term exemptions for a number of countries and subject to a product exemption process. These tariffs could increase the cost of steel to the manufacturers from whom we purchase our rental equipment, which in turn could increase our costs. Such increases could materially impact our financial condition or results of operations in future periods if we are not able to pass such cost increases through to our customers in the form of higher prices. In addition, based on changing demands of our customers, the types of equipment we rent to our customers may become obsolete resulting in a negative impact to our financial condition based on the increased capital expenditures required to replace the obsolete equipment, and our potential inability to sell the obsolete equipment in the used equipment market.\nIf our operating costs increase as our rental equipment fleet ages and we are unable to pass along such costs, our earnings will decrease. In addition, we may incur losses upon dispositions of our rental fleet due to residual value risk.\nIf the average age of our fleet of rental equipment were to increase, the cost of maintaining our equipment, if not replaced within a certain period of time, will likely increase. As of December 31, 2019, the average age of our rental equipment fleet excluding Mexico was approximately 3.6 years, compared to 3.7 years at December 31, 2018, and 3.5 years at December 31, 2017.\nThe costs of maintenance may materially increase in the future. Any significant increase in such costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn addition, the market value of any given piece of rental equipment could be less than its depreciated value at the time it is sold. The market value of used rental equipment depends on several factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe market price for new equipment of a like kind;\n\u2022\nwear and tear on the equipment relative to its age;\n\u2022\nthe time of year that it is sold (prices are generally higher during the construction seasons);\n\u2022\nworldwide and domestic demands for used equipment;\n\u2022\nthe supply of used equipment on the market; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions.\nWe include in operating income the difference between the sales price and the depreciated value of equipment sold. Changes in our assumptions regarding depreciation could change our depreciation expense, as well as the gains or losses realized upon disposal of equipment. We cannot assure that used equipment selling prices will not decline. Any significant decline in the selling prices for used equipment could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may be unsuccessful at acquiring companies or at integrating companies that we acquire and, as a result, may not achieve expected benefits, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOne of our growth strategies is to selectively pursue, on an opportunistic basis, acquisitions of additional companies that will allow us to continue to expand our service offering and geographic footprint. We expect to face competition for acquisition candidates, which may limit the number of acquisition opportunities and may lead to higher acquisition prices. We may not be able to identify, acquire or profitably manage additional businesses or to integrate successfully any acquired businesses without substantial costs, delays or other operational or financial problems. Further, acquisitions involve a number of special risks, including failure of the acquired business to achieve expected results, diversion of management\u2019s attention, failure to retain key personnel of the acquired business and risks associated with unanticipated events or liabilities, some or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, we may not be able to obtain the necessary acquisition financing or we may have to increase our indebtedness in order to finance an acquisition. Furthermore, general economic conditions or unfavorable global capital and credit markets could affect the timing and extent to which we implement our strategy and limit our ability to successfully acquire new businesses. Our future business, financial condition and results of operations could suffer if we fail to successfully implement our acquisition strategy.\nWe might not be able to recruit and retain the experienced personnel we need to compete in our industries.\nOur future success depends on our ability to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled personnel. Competition for personnel in our industry is intense and we must have talented personnel to succeed. Our ability to meet our performance goals depends upon the personal efforts and abilities of the principal members of our senior management, who provide strategic direction, develop the business, manage our operations, and maintain a cohesive and stable work environment. We cannot provide assurance that the Company will retain or successfully recruit senior executives, or that their services will remain available to us. We will regularly evaluate on an ongoing basis our senior management capabilities in light of, among other things, our business strategy, changes to our capital structure, developments in our industry and markets and our ongoing financial performance and consider, where appropriate, supplementing, changing or otherwise enhancing our senior management team and operational and financial management capabilities in order to maximize our performance. Accordingly, our organizational structure and senior management team may change in the future. Changes to our senior management team could result in a material business interruption as a result of losing their services.\nOur work force could become unionized in the future, which could negatively impact the stability of our production, materially reduce our profitability and increase the risk of work stoppages.\nWe currently operate with non-union employees. Our employees have the right at any time under the National Labor Relations Act to form or affiliate with a union, and unions may conduct organizing activities in this regard. If our employees choose to form or affiliate with a union and the terms of a union collective bargaining agreement are significantly different from our current compensation and job assignment arrangements with our employees, these arrangements could negatively impact the stability of our production, materially reduce our profitability and increase the risk of work stoppages. In addition, even if our managed operations remain non-union, our business may still be adversely affected by work stoppages at any of our suppliers that are unionized.\nDisruptions in our information technology systems or a compromise of security with respect to our systems could adversely affect our operating results by limiting our ability to effectively monitor and control our operations, adjust to changing market conditions, implement strategic initiatives.\nOur information technology systems facilitate our ability to monitor and control our operations and adjust to changing market conditions. Any disruption of these systems or the failure of any of these systems to operate as expected could, depending on the magnitude of the problem, adversely affect our operating results by limiting our capacity to effectively monitor and control our operations and adjust to changing market conditions. In addition, because our systems may contain information about individuals and businesses, our failure to maintain the security of the data we hold, whether the result of our own error or the malfeasance or errors of others, could harm our reputation or give rise to legal liabilities leading to lower revenues, increased costs and other potential material adverse effects on our results of operations.\nWe may experience threats to our data and systems, including malware and computer virus attacks. We have implemented a multi-layered approach to protect our data and systems from software attacks and conduct annual security awareness training sessions for all Nesco employees. Additionally, we support web filters in place that prevent users from accessing suspect sites and deploy endpoint protection on user computers in addition to multiple mail filters that are in place to help manage spam and phishing attempts. We rely on our security software layer vendors to stay current with threats, and if any of these breaches of security occur or there are new threats that are not covered by our current software, we could be required to expend additional capital and other resources, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, train employees and engage third-party experts and consultants. In addition, because our systems sometimes contain information about individuals and businesses, our failure to appropriately maintain the security of the data we hold,\nwhether as a result of our own error or the malfeasance or errors of others, could lead to unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information or corruption of data. Our failure to appropriately maintain the security of the data we hold could also violate applicable privacy, data security and other laws and subject us to lawsuits, fines and other means of regulatory enforcement. Complying with any new regulatory requirements could force us to incur substantial expenses or require us to change our business practices in a manner that could harm our business. Further, any compromise or breach of our systems could result in adverse publicity, harm our reputation, lead to claims against us and affect our relationships with our customers and employees, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Certain of our software applications are also utilized by third parties who provide outsourced administrative functions, which may increase the risk of a cybersecurity incident. Although we maintain insurance coverage for various cybersecurity risks, there can be no guarantee that all costs or losses incurred will be fully insured.\nIf we are unable to obtain additional capital as required, we may be unable to fund the capital outlays required for the success of our business.\nIf the cash that we generate from our business, together with cash that we may borrow under any debt facilities we have or may enter into in the future is not sufficient to fund our capital requirements, we will require additional debt and/or equity financing. However, we may not succeed in obtaining the requisite additional financing or such financing may include terms that are not satisfactory to us. We may not be able to obtain additional debt financing as a result of prevailing interest rates or other factors, including the presence of covenants or other restrictions under the agreements governing our current and future debt. In the event we seek to obtain equity financing, our stockholders may experience dilution as a result of the issuance of additional equity securities. This dilution may be significant depending upon the number of equity securities that we issue and the prices at which we issue such securities. If we are unable to obtain sufficient additional capital in the future, we may be unable to fund the capital outlays required for the success of our business, including those relating to purchasing equipment, growth plans and refinancing existing indebtedness.\nWe are exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings or claims that could adversely affect our operating results. The nature of our business exposes us to various liability claims, which may exceed the level of our insurance coverage and thereby not fully protect us.\nWe are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business. Litigation in general can be expensive, lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations. Moreover, the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict. Responding to lawsuits brought against us, or legal actions that we may initiate, can often be expensive and time-consuming. Unfavorable outcomes from these claims and/or lawsuits could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, and we could incur substantial monetary liability and/or be required to change our business practices.\nOur business exposes us to claims for personal injury, death or property damage resulting from the use of the equipment we rent or sell and from injuries caused in motor vehicle accidents in which our delivery and service personnel are involved and other employee related matters. Additionally, we could be subject to potential litigation associated with compliance with various laws and governmental regulations at the federal, state or local levels, such as those relating to the protection of persons with disabilities, employment, health, safety, security and other regulations under which we operate.\nWe carry comprehensive insurance, subject to deductibles, at levels we believe are sufficient to cover existing and future claims made during the respective policy periods. However, we may be exposed to multiple claims that do not exceed our deductibles and, as a result, we could incur significant out-of-pocket costs that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the cost of such insurance policies may increase significantly upon renewal of those policies as a result of general rate increases for the type of insurance we carry, as well as our historical experience and experience in our industry. Our existing or future claims may exceed the coverage level of our insurance, and such insurance may not continue to be available on economically reasonable terms. If we are required to pay significantly higher premiums for insurance, are not able to maintain insurance coverage at affordable rates, or if we must pay amounts in excess of claims covered by our insurance, or if we are exposed to multiple claims that do not exceed our deductibles, we could experience higher costs that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business relies to some extent on third-party contractors to provide us with various services to assist us with conducting our business, which could adversely affect our business upon the termination or disruption of our third-party contractor relationships.\nOur operations rely on third-party contractors to provide us with timely services to assist us with conducting our business. Any material disruption, termination, or substandard provision of these services could adversely affect our brand, customer relationships, operating results and financial condition. In addition, if a third-party contractor relationship is terminated, we may be adversely affected if we are unable to enter into a similar agreement with alternate providers in a timely manner or on terms that we consider favorable. Further, in the event a third-party relationship is terminated and we are unable to enter into a similar relationship, we may not have the internal capabilities to perform such services in a cost-effective manner.\nWe may need to recognize impairment charges related to goodwill, identified intangible assets and fixed assets, which would negatively impact our operating results.\nWe have substantial balances of goodwill and identified intangible assets as a result of prior acquisitions and the merger and other transactions consummated in connection with the acquisition of us by Energy Capital Partners III, LP and certain of its affiliates. We are required to test goodwill and other intangible assets with an indefinite life for possible impairment on the same date each year and on an interim basis if there are indicators of a possible impairment. We are also required to evaluate amortizable intangible assets and fixed assets for impairment if there are indicators of a possible impairment.\nThere is significant judgment required in the analysis of a potential impairment of goodwill, identified intangible assets and fixed assets. If, as a result of a general economic slowdown, deterioration in one or more of the markets in which we operate or in our financial performance and/or future outlook, the estimated fair value of our long-lived assets decreases. We may determine that one or more of our long-lived assets is impaired. An impairment charge would be determined based on the estimated fair value of the assets and any such impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nFederal and state legislative and regulatory developments that we believe should encourage electric power transmission infrastructure spending may fail to result in increased demand for our rental equipment.\nIn recent years, federal and state legislation has been passed and resulting regulations have been adopted that could significantly increase spending on electric power transmission infrastructure, including the Energy Act of 2005 and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the \u201cARRA\u201d). However, much fiscal, regulatory and other uncertainty remains as to the impact this legislation and related regulations will ultimately have on the demand for our rental equipment and, as such, the effect of these regulations is uncertain and may not result in increased spending on the electric power transmission infrastructure. Continued uncertainty regarding the implementation of the Energy Act of 2005 and ARRA may result in slower growth in demand for our rental equipment.\nRenewable energy initiatives, including ARRA, may not lead to increased demand for our rental equipment. In addition, we cannot predict when programs under ARRA will be implemented or the timing and scope of any investments to be made under these programs, particularly in light of capital constraints on potential developers of these projects. In addition, some of these programs have expired, which may affect the economic feasibility of future projects. Investments for renewable energy and electric power infrastructure under ARRA may not occur, may be less than anticipated or may be delayed, or any resulting contracts may not be awarded to us, any of which could negatively impact demand for our rental equipment.\nWe are subject to, and could be adversely affected by, safety and environmental requirements, which could force us to increase significant capital and other operational costs and may subject us to unanticipated liabilities.\nOur operations are subject to federal, state and local occupational health and safety and environmental laws and regulations. We are subject to potential civil or criminal fines or penalties if we fail to comply with any of these requirements. We have made and will continue to make capital and other expenditures in order to comply with these laws and regulations. However, the requirements of these laws and regulations are complex, change frequently, and could become more stringent in the future. It is possible that these requirements will change or that liabilities will arise in the future in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe have made, and will continue to make, expenditures to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including, among others, expenditures for the investigation and cleanup of contamination at or emanating from currently and formerly owned and leased properties, as well as contamination at other locations at which our wastes have reportedly been identified. Some of these laws impose strict, and in certain circumstances joint and several liability on current and former owners or operators of contaminated sites and other potentially responsible parties for investigation, remediation and other costs.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations and the costs of complying with them, or any liability or obligation imposed under them, could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.\nWe are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations with respect to the ownership and operation of tanks for the storage of petroleum products, such as gasoline, diesel fuel and motor and waste oils. We cannot assure you that our tanks will at all times remain free from leaks or that the use of these tanks will not result in significant spills or leakage. If leakage or a spill occurs, it is possible that the resulting costs of cleanup, investigation and remediation, as well as any resulting fines, could be significant. We cannot assure you that compliance with existing or future environmental laws and regulations will not require material expenditures by us or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or cash flows.\nThe U.S. Congress and other federal and state legislative and regulatory authorities in the U.S. and internationally have considered, and will likely continue to consider, numerous measures related to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions. Should rules establishing limitations on greenhouse gas emissions or rules imposing fees on entities deemed to be responsible for greenhouse gas emissions become effective, demand for our services could be affected, our vehicle, and/or other, costs could increase, and our business could be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to collect on contracts with customers, our operating results would be adversely affected.\nOne of the reasons some of our customers find it more attractive to rent equipment than own equipment is the need to deploy their capital elsewhere. Some of our customers may have liquidity issues and ultimately may not be able to fulfill the terms of their rental agreements with us. If we are unable to manage credit risk issues adequately, or if a large number of customers should have financial difficulties at the same time, our credit losses could increase above historical levels and our operating results would be adversely affected. Further, delinquencies and credit losses generally can be expected to increase during economic slowdowns or recessions.\nWe have operations throughout the United States, which exposes us to multiple state and local regulations, in addition to federal law and requirements as a government contractor. Changes in applicable law, regulations or requirements, or our material failure to comply with any of them, can increase our costs and have other negative impacts on our business.\nWe are geographically diverse and, as of December 31, 2019, operate 23 leased facilities and maintain access to more than 50 third-party service locations geographically dispersed across the U.S. and Canada, which exposes us to a host of different state and local regulations, in addition to federal law and regulatory requirements. These laws and requirements address multiple aspects of our operations, such as worker safety, consumer rights, privacy, employee benefits and more, and there are often different requirements in different jurisdictions. Changes in these requirements, or any material failure by our branches to comply with them, can increase our costs, affect our reputation, limit our business, occupy management time and attention and otherwise impact our operations in adverse ways.\nWe are subject to certain risks arising from our Mexican operations.\nWe have had operations in Mexico. We began commencing activities for the closure of its Mexican operations in 2019, although the closure is not yet complete. As a result, we are subject to risks of doing business internationally, including changes in the economic strength of Mexico, difficulties in enforcing contractual obligations and intellectual property rights, burdens of complying with a wide variety of international and U.S. laws, economic sanctions and social, political and economic instability. We must also comply with applicable anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials. We cannot guarantee compliance with all applicable laws, and violations could result in substantial fines, sanctions, civil or criminal penalties, competitive or reputational harm, litigation or regulatory action and other consequences that might adversely affect our results of operations and our consolidated performance. Factors that substantially affect the operations of our business in Mexico may have a material adverse effect on our overall results of operations.\nOur operations in Mexico are subject to changes in political or economic conditions and regulations in that country.\nThe risks with respect to Mexico or other developing countries include, but are not limited to: nationalization of properties, military repression, extreme fluctuations in currency exchange rates, criminal activity, lack of personal safety or ability to safeguard property, labor instability or militancy and high rates of inflation. We may be affected in varying degrees by government regulation with respect to price controls, export controls, income taxes, expropriation of property, maintenance of claims, environmental legislation and opposition from non-governmental organizations. The effect of these factors cannot be accurately predicted and may adversely impact our operations.\nEscalating security disruptions in regions of Mexico we serve could adversely affect the closure of our Mexican operations, and, as a result, the levels of revenue and operating cash flow from our Mexican operations could be reduced.\nIn recent years, incidents of security disruptions throughout many regions of Mexico have increased. Drug-related gang activity has grown in Mexico. Certain incidents of violence have occurred in regions in which we operate and have resulted in the interruption of our operations, and these interruptions could increase in the future.\nWe have operations outside the United States. As a result, we may incur losses from currency conversions and have higher costs than we otherwise would have due to the need to comply with foreign laws.\nOur operations in Canada are subject to the risks normally associated with international operations. These include the need to convert currencies, which could result in a gain or loss depending on fluctuations in exchange rates and the need to comply with foreign laws and regulations, as well as U.S. laws and regulations applicable to our operations in foreign jurisdictions. See \u201cNesco\u2019s Management\u2019s\nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures About Market Risk - Exchange Rate Risk.\u201d\nWe may incur significant costs and obligations as a result of being a public company.\nAs a publicly traded company, we have incurred and will continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses, particularly after we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined under the JOBS Act. In addition, new and changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the rules and regulations promulgated and to be promulgated thereunder, as well as under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the JOBS Act, and the rules and regulations of the SEC and national securities exchanges have created uncertainty for public companies and increased the costs and the time that our board of directors and management must devote to complying with these rules and regulations. We expect these rules and regulations to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and lead to a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities.\nFurthermore, the need to establish the corporate infrastructure demanded of a public company may divert management\u2019s attention from implementing our growth strategy, which could prevent us from improving our business, results of operations and financial condition. We have made, and will continue to make, changes to our internal controls and procedures for financial reporting and accounting systems to meet our reporting obligations as a publicly traded company. However, the measures we take may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations as a publicly traded company.\nFor as long as we remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies.\u201d We may remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d until August 21, 2022 (the fifth anniversary of the consummation of Capitol\u2019s initial public offering) or until such earlier time that we have more than $1.0 billion in annual revenues, have more than $700.0 million in market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates, or issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period. Further, there is no guarantee that the exemptions available to us under the JOBS Act will result in significant savings. To the extent we choose not to use exemptions from various reporting requirements under the JOBS Act, we will incur additional compliance costs, which may impact earnings.\nAs an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, and we have elected to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to obtain an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting from our independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. In addition, the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This allows an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of these accounting standards until they would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of such extended transition period. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active market for our common stock and our share price may be more volatile.\nThe requirements of being a public company, including compliance with the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, and the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, increases costs and distracts management, and we may be unable to comply with these requirements in a timely or cost-effective manner.\nAs a public company, we are subject to laws, regulations and requirements, certain corporate governance provisions, related regulations of the SEC and the requirements of Nasdaq. We rely on a small number of key personnel to manage compliance with these regulations, and compliance with such regulations causes additional costs to our operations and diverts management\u2019s attention from implementing our growth strategy, which could prevent us from improving our business, results of operations and financial condition. We have made, and will continue to make, changes to our internal control over financial reporting, accounting systems disclosure controls and procedures, auditing functions and other procedures related to public reporting in order to meet our reporting obligations as a public company.\nWe identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to our reporting for rental equipment as of December 31, 2018. We may identify additional material weaknesses in the future or otherwise fail to maintain an effective system of\ninternal controls, which may result in material misstatements of our financial statements or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations.\nIn connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018, we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to accounting for rental equipment. A material weakness is defined as a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As of December 31, 2018, we did not have adequate controls in place to ensure that we have adequate review, including evidence of reviews in a sufficient amount of detail, of the activity in our rental equipment accounts. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2018, we recorded adjustments to correct for rental equipment acquired using capital leases, as well as the classification of rental equipment on our consolidated balance sheet.\nBeginning in the second quarter of 2019, management developed a remediation plan, whereby we implemented changes to our internal control to add a suite of key controls regarding the review of the activity in our rental equipment accounts, including lease financing activities. The changes in controls included, but were not limited to, supplementing the internal rental equipment accounting personnel with three additional and experienced supervisory and managerial employees. We implemented changes to the design of controls to separately identify several key controls regarding the verification and reconciliation of activity related to our rental equipment that is processed and recorded in our books and records, including reconciliation activities over the subsidiary system utilized for calculating depreciation and cost of equipment sold expense. The modifications to the design of internal controls and the additional resources addressed the purchasing and receiving of rental equipment, calculations of depreciation expense, analysis and reconciliation of costs associated with our maintenance of the rental equipment (including amounts capitalized), and costs recognized as \u201ccost of equipment sales\u201d expense from sales of our rental equipment, including the purchase and sale of rental equipment that had been acquired under a capital lease. The material weakness is now considered to be remediated as the applicable controls and procedures implemented through our remediation plan have operated for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls were operating effectively as of December 31, 2019.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud. If we are unable to successfully remediate our existing or any future material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or identify any additional material weaknesses that may exist, the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting may be adversely affected. Additionally, we may be unable to maintain compliance with securities law requirements regarding timely filing of periodic reports as well as applicable stock exchange listing requirements. We may be unable to prevent fraud, investors may lose confidence in our financial reporting, and our stock price may also decline. Our reporting obligations as a public company could place a significant strain on our management, operational and financial resources and systems for the foreseeable future and may cause us to fail to timely achieve and maintain the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations. Internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. As a result, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. We cannot assure you that the measures we are currently undertaking or may take in the future will be sufficient to maintain effective internal controls or to avoid potential future deficiencies in internal control, including material weaknesses.\nNeither our management nor an independent registered public accounting firm has ever performed an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act because no such evaluation has been required. Had we or our independent registered public accounting firm performed an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, additional material weaknesses may have been identified. Our independent registered public accounting firm is not required to attest to and report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting until after we are no longer an emerging growth company. At that time, our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our internal controls over financial reporting are documented, designed, or operating. Failing to maintain effective disclosure controls and internal controls over financial reporting could have a material and adverse effect on our business and operating results and could cause a decline in the price of our securities.\nReports published by analysts, including projections in those reports that differ from our actual results, could adversely affect the price and trading volume of common stock.\nWe currently expect that securities research analysts will establish and publish their own periodic projections for our business. However, there is no assurance that they will in fact publish reports on our company. Any projections included in research analyst reports may vary widely and may not accurately predict the results we actually achieve. Our stock price may decline if our actual results do not match the projections of these securities research analysts. Similarly, if one or more of the analysts who write reports on us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price could decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly, our stock price or trading volume could decline. We cannot assure you that any research analysts will cover our securities and if no analysts commence coverage of us, the trading price and volume for our common stock could be adversely affected.\nOur charter contains anti-takeover provisions that could adversely affect the rights of our shareholders.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains provisions to limit the ability of others to acquire control of our company or cause us to engage in change-of control transactions, including, among other things:\n\u2022\nprovisions that authorize our board of directors, without action by our stockholders, to issue additional shares of common stock and preferred stock with preferential rights determined by our board of directors;\n\u2022\nprovisions that impose advance notice requirements, minimum shareholding periods and ownership thresholds, and other requirements and limitations on the ability of stockholders to propose matters for consideration at stockholder meetings; and\n\u2022\na staggered board whereby our directors are divided into three classes, with each class subject to retirement and re-election once every three years on a rotating basis.\nThese provisions could have the effect of depriving our stockholders of an opportunity to sell their common stock at a premium over prevailing market prices by discouraging third parties from seeking to obtain control of our company in a tender offer or similar transaction. With our staggered board of directors, at least two general meetings of stockholders will generally be required in order to effect a change in a majority of our directors. Furthermore, we are party to a principal stockholders agreement by and among the Capitol Sponsors and affiliates of ECP (the \u201cStockholders\u2019 Agreement\u201d), that requires us to support the nomination and election of directors proposed to be nominated by Energy Capital Partners for so long as it maintains certain ownership levels in us. The nomination provisions of our constitutional documents are subject to the stockholders\u2019 agreement for as long as it is in effect. Our staggered board of directors and the provisions of the stockholders\u2019 agreement can discourage proxy contests for the election of our directors and purchases of substantial blocks of our shares by making it more difficult for a potential acquirer to gain control of our board of directors in a relatively short period of time.\nFuture resales of common stock may cause the market price of Nesco\u2019s securities to drop significantly, even if Nesco\u2019s business is performing well.\nAffiliates of Capitol and its founders (collectively, the \u201cCapitol Sponsors\u201d) and, together with Energy Capital Partners, the \u201cSponsors\u201d) have certain rights, pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, to require us to register, in certain circumstances, the resale under the Securities Act of common stock held by them, subject to certain conditions. The sale or possibility of sale of these shares could have the effect of increasing the volatility in our share price or putting significant downward pressure on the price of our stock.\nNesco\u2019s securities may not continue to be listed on a national securities exchange which could limit investors\u2019 ability to make transactions in Nesco\u2019s securities and subject Nesco to additional trading restrictions.\nIf we fail to continue to meet the listing requirements of the NYSE, investors in our common stock could face significant material adverse consequences, including:\n\u2022\na limited availability of market quotations for our securities;\n\u2022\na limited amount of news and analyst coverage for the company; and\n\u2022\nthe consequences of our decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile.\nThe price of our common stock may fluctuate due to a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly and annual results and those of other public companies in industry;\n\u2022\nmergers in the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022\nmarket prices and conditions in the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022\nchanges in government regulation;\n\u2022\npotential or actual military conflicts or acts of terrorism;\n\u2022\nthe failure of securities analysts to publish research about us, or shortfalls in our operating results compared to levels forecast by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nannouncements concerning us or our competitors; and\n\u2022\nthe general state of the securities markets.\nThese market and industry factors may materially reduce the market price of our common stock shares, regardless of our operating performance.\nWe have, and may incur, significant indebtedness and may be unable to service our debt. This indebtedness could adversely affect our financial position, limit our available cash and our access to additional capital, prevent us from growing our business and negatively impact the market price of our common stock.\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness and may incur additional indebtedness in the future, including in connection with the implementation of our growth strategies. As of December 31, 2019, our total indebtedness was $756.6 million, consisting of the aggregate amounts outstanding under our senior secured notes due 2024 (the \u201cSecured Notes\u201d), $250.0 million of borrowings under our 2019 Credit Facility (as defined below) and $3.5 million of obligations under promissory notes incurred in connection with previous acquisitions and capital lease obligations of $28.1 million. In addition, as of December 31, 2019, we had an additional $96.9 million of availability under our 2019 Credit Facility (subject to a borrowing base). Although the indenture governing the Secured Notes (the \u201cIndenture\u201d) and the credit agreement governing the 2019 Credit Facility contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant exceptions and qualifications, and the additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. On March 10, 2020, we entered into an agreement (the \u201cIncremental Agreement\u201d) amending the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility. The Incremental Agreement amends the syndicate of banks for a new participant that increased the maximum amount of the facility by $35.0 million to a total of $385.0 million. The increase in facility size expands liquidity for Nesco.\nMoreover, the Indenture does not impose any limitation on our incurrence of certain liabilities or obligations that are not considered \u201cIndebtedness\u201d (such as operating leases), nor does it impose any limitation on the amount of liabilities incurred by our subsidiaries, if any, that might be designated as \u201cunrestricted subsidiaries\u201d under the Indenture. Similarly, the credit agreement governing the 2019 Credit Facility does not impose any limitation on our incurrence of certain liabilities or obligations that are not considered \u201cIndebtedness\u201d under such credit agreement (such as operating leases).\nThe level of our indebtedness could have important consequences, including:\n\u2022\na portion of our cash flow from operations is dedicated to debt service and may not be available for other purposes;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes, including acquisitions, and potentially impeding our ability to secure favorable lease terms;\n\u2022\nexposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as borrowings under our 2019 Credit Facility will be subject to variable rates of interest;\n\u2022\nmaking us more vulnerable to economic downturns and industry conditions and possibly limiting our ability to withstand competitive pressures;\n\u2022\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with less indebtedness;\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Secured Notes and our other debt;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in the industry in which we compete; and\n\u2022\nincreasing our cost of borrowing.\nIf new debt is added to our current debt levels, the risks that we now face would intensify. Similarly, these factors may impact our operating results and cause us to fail to meet the expectations of stock market analysts and investors. If this happens, the market price of our common stock may be adversely affected.\nTo service our indebtedness, we will require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors, some of which are beyond our control. An inability to service our indebtedness could lead to a default under the Indenture or the credit agreement that governs our 2019 Credit Facility, which may result in an acceleration of our indebtedness.\nA significant amount of cash is required to service our existing Indebtedness. Our ability to pay interest and principal in the future on our indebtedness and to fund our capital expenditures and acquisitions will depend upon our future operating performance and the availability of refinancing indebtedness, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions, the availability of capital, as well as financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control.\nOur future cash flow may not be sufficient to meet our obligations and commitments. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our indebtedness and to meet our other commitments, we will be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as refinancing or restructuring our indebtedness, selling material assets or operations or seeking to raise additional debt or equity capital. These actions may not be effected on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms or at all, and these actions may not enable us to continue to satisfy our capital requirements. In addition, our existing or future debt agreements, including the Indenture and the credit agreement that governs 2019 Credit Facility, may contain restrictive covenants prohibiting us from adopting any of these alternatives. Our failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of our indebtedness. In such circumstances we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nThe elimination of LIBOR could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe U. K.\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. The U.S. Federal Reserve has begun publishing a Secured Overnight Funding Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d), which is intended to replace U.S. dollar LIBOR. Plans for alternative reference rates for other currencies have also been announced. At this time, we cannot predict how markets will respond to these proposed alternative rates or the effect of any changes to LIBOR or the discontinuation of LIBOR. If LIBOR is no longer available or if our lenders have increased costs due to changes in LIBOR, we may experience potential increases in interest rates on our variable rate debt, which could adversely impact our interest expense, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Indenture and the credit agreement that governs our 2019 Credit Facility impose significant operating and financial restrictions on our company and our subsidiaries, which may prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities.\nThe Indenture and the credit agreement that governs our 2019 Credit Facility imposes significant operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions will limit our ability, among other things, to:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\npay dividends or certain other distributions on our capital stock or repurchase our capital stock;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments or other restricted payments;\n\u2022\nplace restrictions on the ability of subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to us;\n\u2022\nengage in transactions with stockholders or affiliates;\n\u2022\nsell certain assets or merge with or into other companies, reorganize our companies, or suspend or go out of a substantial portion of our business;\n\u2022\nprepay or modify the terms of our other indebtedness;\n\u2022\nguarantee indebtedness; and\n\u2022\ncreate liens.\nThese restrictions could limit our ability to obtain future financing, make strategic acquisitions or needed capital expenditures, withstand economic downturns in our business or the economy in general, conduct operations or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities that may arise. A failure to comply with the restrictions in the Indenture and the credit agreement that governs our 2019 Credit Facility could result in an event of default under such instruments. Our future operating results may not be sufficient to enable compliance with the covenants in the Indenture or credit agreement governing our 2019 Credit Facility or to remedy any such default. In addition, in the event of an acceleration, we may not have or be able to obtain sufficient funds to refinance our indebtedness or make any accelerated payments, including those under the Secured Notes and under our 2019 Credit Facility. Also, we may not be able to obtain new financing. Even if we were able to obtain new financing, we cannot guarantee that the new financing will be on commercially reasonable terms or terms that are acceptable to us. If we default on our indebtedness, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. If we fail to maintain compliance with these covenants in the future, we may be unable to obtain waivers from the lenders and/or amend the covenants.\nOur debt obligations may limit our flexibility in managing our business.\nThe Indenture and the credit agreement that governs our 2019 Credit Facility require us to comply with a number of customary financial and other covenants, such as maintaining leverage ratios in certain situations and maintaining insurance coverage. These covenants may limit our flexibility in our operations, and breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments governing the applicable indebtedness even if we had satisfied our payment obligations. If we were to default on the Indenture, the credit agreement that governs our 2019 Credit Facility or other debt instruments, our financial condition and liquidity would be adversely affected.\nWe are controlled by affiliates of ECP, whose interests in our business may be different than yours.\nAs of December 31, 2019, ECP owned 53% of our common stock and is able to control our affairs in all cases. Pursuant to the Stockholders\u2019 Agreement, four of the members of our board of directors have been designated by ECP. So long as ECP continues to own a majority of our common shares, they will have the ability to control the vote in any election of directors and will have the ability to prevent any transaction that requires shareholder approval regardless of whether other shareholders believe the transaction is in our best interests. Additionally, pursuant to our principal stockholders agreement, ECP will continue to have the ability to designate four of our directors until it owns less than 45% of the outstanding common shares. In any of these matters, the interests of ECP or other controlling shareholders may differ from or conflict with the interests of holders of our common stock or other securities. Moreover, this concentration of share ownership may also adversely affect the trading price for our common shares to the extent investors perceive disadvantages in owning shares of a company with a controlling shareholder. In addition, our Sponsors are in the business of making investments in companies and may, from time to time, acquire interests in businesses that directly or indirectly compete with our business, as well as businesses that are our significant existing or potential suppliers or customers. Our significant shareholders may acquire or seek to acquire assets that we seek to acquire and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us or may be more expensive for us to pursue.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common shares and, consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.\nWe do not intend to declare and pay dividends on our common shares for the foreseeable future. We currently intend to invest our future earnings, if any, to fund our growth and potentially reduce our indebtedness. Therefore, you are not likely to receive any dividends on your common shares for the foreseeable future and the success of an investment in our common shares will depend upon any future appreciation in their value. There is no guarantee that our common shares will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which our shareholders have purchased their shares. The payment of future dividends, however, will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other things, our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, level of indebtedness, statutory and contractual restrictions applying to the payment of dividends and other considerations that our board of directors deems relevant. The credit agreement that governs our 2019 Credit Facility and the Indenture also effectively limit our ability to pay dividends. As a consequence of these limitations and restrictions, we may not be able to make, or may have to reduce or eliminate, the payment of dividends on our common shares.\nWe may redeem unexpired Warrants prior to their exercise at a time that is disadvantageous to the holders of our Warrants, thereby making such Warrants worthless.\nWe have the ability to redeem outstanding Warrants (as defined below) (other than the certain private Warrants issued to affiliates) at any time after they become exercisable and prior to their expiration, at $0.01 per Warrant, if the last reported sales price (or the closing bid price of our shares of common stock in the event the shares of common stock are not traded on any specific trading day) of the shares of common stock equals or exceeds $18 per share for each of 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period ending on the third business day prior to the date we send proper notice of such redemption, provided that on the date we give notice of redemption and during the entire period thereafter until the time we redeem the warrants, we have an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d) covering the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrants and a current prospectus relating to them is available. If and when the Warrants become redeemable by us, we may exercise our redemption right even if we are unable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable state securities laws. Redemption of the outstanding Warrants could force a warrant holder: (i) to exercise Warrants and pay the exercise price therefore at a time when it may be disadvantageous for holders of our Warrants to do so, (ii) to sell Warrants at the then-current market price when holders might otherwise wish to hold their Warrants or (iii) to accept the nominal redemption price which, at the time the outstanding warrants are called for redemption, will be substantially less than the market value of such Warrants.\nWe may issue additional shares of our common stock or other equity securities without shareholder approval, which would dilute shareholder ownership interests and may depress the market price of our common stock.\nECP has the right to receive: (1) up to an additional 1,800,000 shares of common stock for a period of five years following the closing of the Transactions (the \u201cClosing\u201d), in increments of 900,000 shares, if (x) the trading price of the common stock exceeds $13.00 per share or $16.00 per share for any 20 trading days during a 30 consecutive trading day period or (y) a sale transaction of Nesco occurs in which the consideration paid per share to holders of common stock of Nesco exceeds $13.00 per share or $16.00 per share, and (2) an additional 1,651,798 shares of common stock if during the seven-year period following the Closing, the trading price of common stock exceeds $19.00 per share for any 20 trading days during a 30 consecutive trading day period or if a sale transaction of Nesco occurs in which the consideration paid per share to holders of common stock exceeds $19.00 per share.\nOur issuance of additional shares of common stock or other equity securities of equal or senior rank would have the following effects:\n\u2022\nour existing shareholders\u2019 proportionate ownership interest will decrease;\n\u2022\nthe amount of cash available per share, including for payment of dividends in the future, may decrease;\n\u2022\nthe relative voting strength of each previously outstanding common share may be diminished; and\nthe market price of our shares of common stock may decline.\nOur business and results of operations may be adversely affected by the recent COVID-19 outbreak or other similar outbreaks.\nHealth concerns arising from the outbreak of a health epidemic or pandemic, including COVID-19, may have an adverse effect on our business. Our business could be materially and adversely affected by the outbreak of a widespread health epidemic or pandemic, including arising from various strains of coronavirus, such as COVID-19, or avian flu or swine flu, such as H1N1, particularly if located in regions where inputs for our supply chain are manufactured. COVID-19 has spread to a significant number of countries and has had a global economic impact on the financial markets and economies of many countries. Our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected to the extent that the United States and Canada impose widespread quarantines that may limit our ability to offer our products and services to our customers. Furthermore, a significant outbreak of contagious diseases in the human population could result in a widespread health crisis that could adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many countries, resulting in an economic downturn that could affect our operating results. Any of the foregoing could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 17032, "SIC": 5063, "TIC": "NSCO"}
