{"cik": "1660690", "company": "Versum Materials, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-12-21", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K in evaluating us and our common stock. The risk factors generally have been separated into three groups: risks related to our business, risks related to the Separation and risks related to our common stock.\nAny of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Our operations could be affected by various risks, many of which are beyond our control. Based on current information, we believe that the following list identifies the most significant risk factors that could affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. There may be additional risks and uncertainties that adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in the future that are not presently known, are not currently believed to be material, or are not identified below because they are common to all businesses. Past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. For more information, see \u201cCautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOverall Economic and Supply/Demand Conditions - Economic conditions or product supply versus demand imbalance in the semiconductor industry or in certain geographic markets in which we do business may decrease the demand for our goods and services and adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nDemand for our products and services depends in part on global and regional economic conditions affecting the countries in which we do business and the semiconductor industry. Our revenue is primarily dependent on semiconductor demand. Semiconductor demand, in turn, is impacted by changes in consumer demand, since in recent years the industry has seen a significant shift in demand from semiconductor devices for personal computers, which now are largely enterprise-related, to those for mobile internet devices, which are more consumer-oriented. Historically, semiconductor demand has fluctuated significantly due to economic and industry cycles and seasonal shifts in demand, which can dramatically affect our business, causing demand for our products to fluctuate. Furthermore, competitive dynamics within the semiconductor industry may impact our business. If the global economy or the semiconductor industry weakens, whether in general or as a result of specific factors, such as macroeconomic factors, or unpredictable events such as natural disasters, we could experience material adverse impacts on our results of operations and financial condition. In the past few years, uncertain or adverse economic conditions in certain geographies and changing supply and demand balances in areas served by us have impacted and may in the future impact demand for our products and services, in turn negatively impacting our results of operations. Any changes in demand in the semiconductor industry may negatively impact our cash flow, our ability to service our debt and our results of operations.\nUnfavorable global or regional economic conditions could have other negative impacts to our business or our results of operations, including depressing demand in a given region or industry, affecting our margins, constraining our operating flexibility and impacting our customers. Any excess capacity in our or our competitors\u2019 manufacturing facilities resulting from unfavorable economic conditions could decrease our ability to maintain pricing and margins and generate profits. Adverse global economic and industry conditions could have other negative effects on our company. For instance, we could experience negative impacts on cash flows due to the inability of our customers to pay their obligations to us, or our production process could be harmed if our suppliers cannot fulfill their obligations to us. In such circumstances, we may also have to reduce the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets, which could harm our financial position and results of operations.\nSome additional factors that affect demand for our products include: the types of electronic devices that are in demand; products that our customers may produce, such as logic IC devices versus memory devices; the various technology nodes at which those products are manufactured and whether our products are part of the production process; customers\u2019 specific manufacturing process integration schemes; the short order to delivery time for our products; quarter-to-quarter changes in customer order patterns; market share gains and losses; and pricing changes by us and our competitors.\nConcentrated Customer Base - We are exposed to risks associated with a concentrated customer base.\nOur customer base historically has been, and is becoming even more, concentrated as a result of economic and industry conditions. In fiscal 2016, three customers accounted for approximately 47% percent of Versum\u2019s global sales. In 2016, our top twenty customers accounted for approximately 80% of our global sales. Certain customers have experienced significant ownership or management changes, consolidated with other manufacturers, outsourced manufacturing activities, or engaged in collaboration arrangements with other manufacturers. Customers have entered into strategic alliances or industry consortia that have increased the influence of key industry participants in technology decisions made by their partners. Certain semiconductor and display customers are making an increasingly greater percentage of their respective industry\u2019s capital equipment investments.\nIn this environment, contracts or orders from a relatively limited number of semiconductor and display manufacturers have accounted for, and are expected to continue to account for, a substantial portion of our business, which may result in added complexities in managing customer relationships and transactions. The mix and sales to any single customer may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year. If customers do not place orders, or they substantially reduce, delay or cancel orders, or if our products are not specified for our customers\u2019 products or production processes we may not be able to replace the business. Because our products are configured to customer specifications, the changing, rescheduling or canceling of orders may result in significant, non-recoverable costs. Changes in customer qualification requirements could result in significant delays in the sale of our products. Major customers may also seek and on occasion receive, pricing, payment, intellectual property-related, or other commercial terms that are less favorable to Versum. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nConsolidation between customers, changes in technologies or solutions used by customers, changes in products manufactured by customers or in end-user demand for those products, selection of suppliers other than us, customer bankruptcies or customer departures from the industry may result in even fewer customers accounting for a high percentage of our revenue and reduced demand from any single major customer. The cancellation, reduction or deferral of purchases of our products by even a single customer could significantly reduce our revenues in any particular quarter. If we were to lose any of our significant customers, if our products are not specified for these customers\u2019 products or production processes, or if we suffer a material reduction in their purchase orders, revenue could decline and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Furthermore, due to continued industry consolidation, the loss of any one customer or significant order may have a greater impact than we anticipate. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to retain long-term relationships or secure renewals of short-term relationships with our more substantial customers in the future.\nOur DS&S operating segment is dependent upon the capital expenditures of manufacturers of microelectronics, semiconductors, computers, wireless communications and other electronic products. The capital equipment market for microelectronics, semiconductor, and consumer electronics manufacturers has historically been characterized by sudden and severe cyclical variations in product supply and demand due to a number of factors including capacity utilization, timing of customers\u2019 new product introductions and demand for their products, inventory levels relative to demand and access to\naffordable capital. The timing, severity and duration of these market cycles are difficult or impossible to predict. As a result, business levels can vary significantly from quarter to quarter or year to year. Significant volatility in investment cycles in the market for microelectronics, and semiconductors used in electronic devices or in demand for consumer electronics may reduce demand for our products and may materially and adversely affect the DS&S operating segment. The degree of the impact of any downturn depends on a number of factors, including: the strength of the global economies, particularly those of Asia and the United States; the overall level of demand for consumer electronics products; the stability of global financial systems; and the overall health of the microelectronics, semiconductor, and consumer electronics industries.\nProduct Innovation - If we are not able to continue our technological innovation and successful commercial introduction of new products, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow could be adversely affected.\nThe electronics and semiconductor industries into which we sell our products experience periodic technological change and product improvement. Our customers continually introduce new generations of products or require new technological capacity to further develop their products. Our customers rely on us to develop new materials to support their new product development. Our future growth will depend on our ability to gauge the direction of the commercial and technological progress in all key end-use markets and upon our ability to fund and successfully develop, manufacture and market products in such changing end-use markets. We will have to continue to identify, develop and market innovative products on a timely basis to replace or enhance existing products in order to maintain our profit margins and our competitive position. We may not be successful in developing new products and technology, either alone or with third parties, or licensing intellectual property rights from third parties on a commercially competitive basis. Our new products may not be accepted by our customers. If we fail to keep pace with the evolving technological innovations in our end-use markets on a competitive basis, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nIntellectual Property Rights - If our intellectual property is compromised or copied by competitors, if our competitors were to develop similar or superior intellectual property or technology, or, if our intellectual property or technology violate third-party rights, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow could be negatively affected.\nIntellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets, confidential information, trademarks, and trade names, are important to our business. Our success depends to a significant degree upon our ability to protect and preserve our intellectual property rights. We endeavor to protect our material intellectual property rights in both the jurisdictions in which our products are produced and used, and also in the jurisdictions into which our products are imported and used. However, we may be unable to obtain protection for our intellectual property in key jurisdictions. For example, although patents were granted in several countries related to a key technology, the relevant patent was invalidated in South Korea in 2015. Although we own and have applied for numerous patents and trademarks throughout the world, we may have to rely on local judicial enforcement of our patents and other proprietary rights. Our patents and other intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, and rendered unenforceable or otherwise compromised. An inability to protect, defend or enforce our intellectual property could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nSimilarly, third parties may assert claims against us and our customers and distributors alleging our products infringe upon or otherwise violate third party intellectual property rights. If we were to discover that our products infringe or otherwise violate the valid intellectual property rights of others, we might need to obtain licenses or substantially re-engineer our products to avoid infringement. We may not be able to obtain licenses on acceptable terms, or at all, or be able to re-engineer our products successfully.\nWe also rely materially upon unpatented proprietary technology, know-how and other trade secrets to maintain our competitive position. While we enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to protect our proprietary expertise and other trade secrets, these agreements may not be enforceable or, even if legally enforceable, we may not have adequate remedies for breaches of such agreements. We also may not be able to readily detect breaches of such agreements. The failure of our patents or confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary technology, know-how or trade secrets could negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf we must take legal action to protect, defend or enforce our intellectual property rights, any suits or proceedings could result in significant costs and diversion of our resources and our management\u2019s attention, and we may not prevail in any such suits or proceedings. Any failure to protect, defend or enforce our intellectual property rights could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nSubstantial Leverage - Our available cash and access to additional capital may be limited by substantial leverage and debt service obligations.\nWe are highly leveraged and have significant debt service obligations. This level of indebtedness could have important negative consequences, including:\n\u2022\nWe will need to use a substantial portion of our available cash flow to pay interest and principal on our debt, which will reduce the amount of money available to finance our operations and other business activities.\n\u2022\nWe may have difficulty obtaining financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, research and development, acquisitions or other purposes.\n\u2022\nOur debt level increases our vulnerability to general economic downturns and adverse industry conditions.\n\u2022\nOur debt level could limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and in our industry in general.\n\u2022\nIf our foreign cash is needed to pay interest or principal on our U.S. debt, we may be required to accrue and pay material amounts of tax on repatriation of that cash.\n\u2022\nA portion of our debt has a variable interest rate, and if interest rates increase, our interest expense could increase significantly, affecting earnings and reducing cash flow available for working capital, expenditures, acquisitions, and other purposes.\n\u2022\nOur substantial amount of debt and the amount we need to pay to service our debt obligations could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to any competitors that have less debt.\n\u2022\nOur failure to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our debt instruments which, among other things, may require us to maintain specified financial ratios and limit our ability to incur debt and sell assets, could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could cause our lenders to terminate commitments under our debt agreements, declare all amounts, including accrued interest, due and payable, and enforce their rights in respect of collateral.\n\u2022\nWe may enter into interest rate swap agreements from time to time to manage some of our exposure to interest rate volatility. These swap agreements involve risks, such as the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements. In addition, these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to changes in interest rates.\nAdditional Capital Needs - We may need additional capital in the future and may not be able to obtain it on favorable terms.\nWe may require additional capital in the future to finance our growth and development, implement further marketing and sales activities, fund ongoing research and development activities, fund mergers or acquisitions and meet general working capital needs. Our capital requirements will depend on many factors, including acceptance of and demand for our products, the extent to which we invest in new technology and research and development projects, and the status and timing of these developments, as well as general availability of capital from debt and equity markets.\nHowever, debt or equity financing may not be available to us on terms we find acceptable, if at all. If we incur additional debt or raise equity through the issuance of our preferred stock, the terms of the debt or our preferred stock issued may give the holders rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock, particularly in the event of liquidation. If we raise funds through the issuance of additional equity, your ownership in us would be diluted. Also, regardless of the terms of our debt or equity financing, our agreements and obligations under the Tax Matters Agreement with Air Products entered into in connection with the Separation may limit our ability to issue stock. If we are unable to raise additional capital when needed, it may impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAdditionally, our failure to maintain expected credit ratings on our debt securities could negatively affect our ability to access capital and could increase our interest expense on certain existing and future indebtedness. We expect the credit rating agencies to periodically review our capital structure and the quality and stability of our earnings. Deterioration in our capital structure or the quality and stability of our earnings could result in a downgrade of the credit ratings on our debt securities. Any negative ratings actions could constrain the capital available to us and could limit our access to funding for our operations and increase the cost of such capital. If, as a result, our ability to access capital when needed becomes constrained, our interest costs could increase, which may impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRestrictions Under Debt Agreements - The agreements governing our indebtedness may restrict our current and future operations, and hamper our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions.\nThe agreements governing our indebtedness (including our senior credit facilities and senior notes) contain, and the agreements governing future indebtedness and future debt securities may contain, restrictive covenants, such as financial maintenance covenants and other covenants restricting our ability to sell assets; pay dividends and make other distributions; redeem or repurchase our capital stock; incur additional debt and issue capital stock; create liens; consolidate, merge or sell substantially all of our assets; enter into certain transactions with our affiliates; make loans, investments or advances; repay subordinated indebtedness; undergo a change in control; and enter into sale and leaseback transactions, that may limit our operations, including our ability to engage in certain activities that may be in our long-term best interests. These restrictive covenants may limit us and our restricted subsidiaries from taking certain corporate actions, or may give rights to the holders of our indebtedness under the agreements governing our indebtedness if we or our restricted subsidiaries take such actions.\nOur failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of some or all of our indebtedness, which could lead to bankruptcy, reorganization or insolvency.\nOperational, Political, and Legal Risks of International Operations - Our international operations may be adversely impacted by political or economic instability, nationalization or expropriation of property, or undeveloped property rights and legal systems.\nThe majority of our revenue is derived from international operations. For the period ended September 30, 2016, 72% of our revenue was generated by sales to customers outside of the United States, including in South Korea, Taiwan, China and the European Union. Our operations in certain foreign jurisdictions, including manufacturing, research and development, sales and customer support, may be affected directly and indirectly by global and local regulation, and economic and political conditions and may be subject to disruption due to:\n\u2022\nthe U.K. vote in favor of leaving the European Union may cause instability in European economies and may negatively impact the outlook for the global economy;\n\u2022\nlocal political, economic and social instability, including hyperinflationary conditions;\n\u2022\nunanticipated government actions, such as trade wars, nationalization of private enterprises and expropriation risk;\n\u2022\nnew and different legal and regulatory requirements in some jurisdictions;\n\u2022\npotential difficulties in protecting intellectual property;\n\u2022\ncontrols on the investment, repatriation and exchange rates of capital;\n\u2022\npotentially adverse tax consequences, including the imposition of or increase in taxes on repatriation or other payments, or challenges to the taxation of the Separation from Air Products in connection with the spin-off in such countries; and\n\u2022\ncancellation of contractual relationships within these jurisdictions without full compensation for loss.\nIn addition, economic and political conditions within foreign jurisdictions, social unrest, or strained relations between\ncountries can cause fluctuations in demand, price volatility, supply disruptions, or loss of property. Our developing market operations may be subject to greater risks than those faced by our operations in mature economies, including geopolitical, legal, economic and talent risks. The occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nNature of Chemical Manufacturing Business - Hazards associated with specialty chemical manufacturing could disrupt our operations or the operations of our suppliers or customers, having a negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nDue to the nature of our business and those of some of our key suppliers, we are exposed to the hazards associated with specialty chemical manufacturing and the related storage and transportation of raw materials, products and waste in our manufacturing facilities or distribution centers and those of our suppliers, such as fires, explosions and accidents. Our operations could be impacted by catastrophic events outside our control, including natural disasters and severe weather conditions such as hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, and storms, epidemics, or acts of war and terrorism. Any such event could cause a material business disruption that could affect our ability to produce and distribute our products and have an adverse effect on the productivity and profitability of our Company.\nOur operations by their nature involve the use and manufacture of hazardous materials. Other hazards include piping and storage tank leaks and ruptures, mechanical failure, employee or third-party exposure to hazardous substances, lack of process safety, chemical spills and other discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases. These hazards may cause personal injury and loss of life, damage to property and contamination of the environment, which could lead to government fines or work stoppage injunctions and lawsuits by injured persons. Such events could impact our suppliers or customers, in which case raw materials may be unavailable to us, or our customers may be unable to purchase or accept our products and services. Any such occurrence could have a negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRegulation of Raw Materials, Products and Facilities - Our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow could be adversely affected by regulation to which our raw materials, products and facilities are subject.\nSome of the raw materials we handle, and our products and facilities, are subject to government regulation. These regulations affect the manufacturing processes, handling, storage, transportation, uses and applications of our products. In addition, some of our products contain raw materials, such as hydrogen chloride, that are deemed hazardous materials. The use and handling of these materials is regulated and some of these regulations require product registrations, which also are subject to renewal and potential revocation. These regulations and changes to the current regulatory framework under which we operate may affect our ability to market certain materials we produce. In addition, some of these products, such as certain process gases and hydrides, are subject to significant restrictions on storage and transportation via certain types of carriers.\nThere is also a risk that key raw materials or one or more of our products may be found to have, or be recharacterized as having, a toxicological or health-related impact on the environment or on our customers or employees. If such a finding or recharacterization occurs, the relevant raw materials or products, including products of customers incorporating our products, may be recalled or banned or we may incur increased costs in order to comply with new regulatory requirements. Changes in regulations, or their interpretation, may also affect the marketability of certain of our products. We cannot predict how these and other findings from regulatory agencies may affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRaw Material Cost and Availability - Interruption in ordinary sources of supply or an inability to recover increases in raw material costs from customers could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe use a wide variety of raw materials, including tungsten powder, hydrogen fluoride, specialty silanes, ammonia, and nitrous oxide. Shortages or price escalation in these materials could negatively impact our financial results. For example, in 2016 we experienced a nitrous oxide supply disruption resulting from reduced production by a key supplier. We may not be able to find alternative sources of supply in sufficient quantities to meet the needs of our customers, and may not be able to raise prices to recover any increases in raw material costs due to competitive pressures. Increases in raw material costs that cannot be passed on to customers for competitive or other reasons could negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Even where costs are successfully passed through, price increases may result in lower sales volume.\nSuppliers - If any of our sole source or limited source suppliers, or suppliers that were required to satisfy our customers\u2019 rigorous qualification requirements, were unable to deliver to us in a timely manner or at all, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nOur operations depend on obtaining sufficient supplies of raw materials and components used in our manufacturing processes. In certain cases, qualification requirements in customers\u2019 manufacturing processes limit us to certain qualified suppliers. In the event that it becomes necessary for us to find another supplier, we would first be required to ensure such new supplier could be qualified through our customers\u2019 rigorous qualification processes for suppliers. Additionally, certain of our businesses rely on limited source suppliers to provide raw materials, such as hydrogen chloride and nitrous oxide, which are critical materials for certain of our customers. Although we have business continuity plans in place, our customers may be unwilling to qualify a new supplier, such suppliers may experience financial difficulties, be unable to deliver products to us in a timely manner, have insufficient capacity to meet our requirements, or suffer business disruption resulting from damage to or destruction of their facilities due to accidents, natural disasters or other events, and we might not be able to secure an alternative source of supply in a timely manner or at all. These events could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nEnvironmental, Health and Safety Compliance - Costs and expenses resulting from compliance with environmental, health and safety regulations may negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to extensive federal, state, local, and foreign environmental and health and safety laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions in the air; discharges to land and water; transportation safety; safety of employees and end product consumers; and the generation, handling, treatment, and disposal of hazardous waste and other materials. Compliance with laws and regulations and any failure to comply with such laws and regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in business practice that could materially impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, our production facilities require numerous operating permits that are subject to renewal requirements. Due to the nature of these requirements and changes in our operations, our operations may exceed limits under permits or we may not have proper permits. We may incur substantial costs, including fines, damages, criminal or civil sanctions and remediation costs, or experience interruptions in our operations, for violations arising under these laws or permit requirements.\nThe nature of our operations also exposes us to risk of liability for contamination, personal injury or third party impacts if hazardous materials are released into the environment, which could result in substantial losses, reputational harm, increase in our insurance cost or otherwise adversely impact our results of operations or our common stock.\nEnvironmental and health and safety laws are subject to change and have tended to become more strict over time. Such changes in environmental or health and safety laws or their interpretation, or the enactment of new laws, could result in materially increased capital expenditures and compliance costs. For example, U.S. and international commitments to reduce world-wide emissions of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, could result in legal requirements that materially and adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. Similarly, the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act, which was signed by President Obama on June 22, 2016, reforms the TSCA by requiring EPA to prioritize and evaluate the environmental and health risks of existing chemicals and providing EPA with greater authority to regulate chemicals posing unreasonable risks. The law also requires that EPA make an affirmative finding that\na new chemical will not pose an unreasonable risk before such chemical can go into production. These reforms update TSCA so that it operates in a similar fashion to the REACH legislation in Europe. Regulations similar to REACH have been enacted in South Korea and Taiwan. Any such changes could increase our cost of doing business and have a negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRegulatory Compliance - We are subject to extensive government regulation in jurisdictions around the globe. Any changes in regulations addressing, among other things, environmental compliance, import/export restrictions, and taxes, may negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to extensive government regulation in the United States and in the foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. Compliance with laws and regulations, including as a result of changes in those laws and regulations from time to time, may involve significant costs or require changes in business practice that could materially impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. For example, our subsidiaries are subject to rules and regulations related to anti-bribery prohibitions of the U.S. and other countries, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the United Kingdom Bribery Act and the China Anti-Unfair Competition Law. Moreover, export control and economic embargo regulations limit the ability to market, sell, distribute or otherwise transfer products or technology to prohibited countries or persons. In addition, we are subject to extensive import, export, storage and transportation regulations due to the hazardous classification of our products. Failure to comply with these regulations, many of which are aggressively enforced, could subject us to fines, enforcement actions and have an adverse effect on our reputation and the value of our common stock. Likewise, any public investigation or inquiry into alleged violations of these regulations could have an adverse effect on our reputation and the value of our common stock.\nInformation Security - The security of our information technology systems could be compromised, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe depend on information technology to enable us to operate efficiently and interface with customers as well as to maintain financial accuracy and efficiency. Our information technology capabilities are currently delivered through a combination of Air Products and other internal and outsourced service providers. If we, together with our service providers, do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure, we could be subject to transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, the loss of customers, business disruptions, or the loss of or damage to our confidential business information through a security breach. As with all large systems, our information systems could be penetrated by outside parties intent on extracting information, corrupting information, or disrupting business processes. Air Products\u2019 systems have in the past been and our systems likely will in the future be subject to sophisticated cyber security threats. Unauthorized access could disrupt our business operations, result in the loss of assets, intellectual property, employee or customer data, and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business involves the use, storage, and transmission of information about our employees, vendors, and customers. The protection of such information, as well as our information, is critical to us. The regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with the frequent imposition of new and constantly changing requirements. We also, from time to time, export sensitive customer data and technical information to recipients outside the United States. Breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure, or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or our customers, including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of fraud, trickery, or other forms of deception, could expose us, our customers, or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, result in litigation and potential liability for us, damage our reputation, or otherwise harm our business.\nForeign Currency Impacts - Our reported results could be adversely affected by currency exchange rates and currency devaluation could impair our competitiveness.\nDue to our international operations, we transact in many foreign currencies, including but not limited to the South Korean Won, New Taiwan Dollar, Japanese Yen, Chinese Renminbi and the Euro. As a result, we are subject to the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. During times of a strengthening U.S. dollar, our reported net revenues and operating income will be reduced because the local currency will be translated into fewer U.S. dollars. During periods of economic crisis, local currencies may be devalued significantly against the U.S. dollar, potentially reducing our margin. For example, unfavorable movement in Asian currencies negatively impacted our results of operations in fiscal year 2016 and 2015, and further strengthening of the U.S. dollar could affect future periods.\nWe also incur currency transaction risk whenever we enter into a transaction using a currency other than the local currency of the transacting entity. We may not be able to effectively manage our currency translation and transaction risk, and, as a result, volatility of currency exchange rates may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. We may enter into forward exchange contracts and other financial contracts in an attempt to mitigate the impact of transactional currency rate fluctuations. However, there can be no assurance that such actions will eliminate any adverse impact from variation in currency rates, and in some cases such actions may exacerbate the impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCompetition - The markets in which we compete are highly competitive. Our inability to compete effectively could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe face significant competition from major international producers as well as smaller regional competitors. Our most significant competitors include major chemicals and materials manufacturers and diversified companies, a number of which have revenues and capital resources exceeding ours. In addition, our products are facing increasing competition from market participants in Asia.\nWe face risk that certain events, such as new product development by our competitors, changing customer needs, production advances for competing products, price changes in raw materials and products, our failure to secure or protect patents or the expiration of patents, could result in declining demand for our products as our customers switch to substitute products or undertake manufacturing of such products on their own. If we are unable to develop, produce or market our products to effectively compete against our competitors, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may materially suffer.\nWe believe that our customers are increasingly looking for strong, long-term relationships with a few key suppliers that help them improve product performance, reduce costs, or support new product development. As a result, we may need to invest and spend more on research and development and marketing costs to strengthen existing customer relationships, as well as attract new customers. Our indebtedness could limit our flexibility to react to these industry trends and our ability to remain competitive.\nLitigation and Regulatory Proceedings - Our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings, including those involving customer claims, antitrust, tax, environmental, or other matters.\nWe are subject to litigation and regulatory proceedings in the normal course of business and could become subject to additional claims in the future, some of which could be material. We face risks arising from various unasserted and asserted litigation matters, including, but not limited to, product liability, patent infringement, regulatory claims, and claims for third party property damage or personal injury stemming from alleged environmental or other torts. In addition, we may have obligations to indemnify Air Products under the terms of the Separation Agreement we entered into with Air Products on September 29, 2016 (the \u201cSeparation Agreement\u201d) for certain product liability, environmental, personal injury, tax or other claims. Due to the nature of our products and services and how they are used by our customers, we may be subject to claims by our customers alleging our products or services, or our failure or inability to deliver products and services, impacted their production yield. While we seek to limit our liability in our commercial contractual arrangements, there are no guarantees that each contract will contain suitable limitations of liability or that limitations of liability will be enforceable at law or that we will be able to obtain insurance for any losses we incur. Also, the outcome of existing legal proceedings may differ\nfrom our expectations because the outcomes of litigation, including regulatory matters, are often difficult to predict reliably. Various factors or developments can lead us to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables, where applicable, or make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible to reasonable estimates, such as a judicial ruling or judgment, a settlement, regulatory developments, or changes in applicable law. While we believe our existing legal proceedings and claims will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, a future adverse ruling, settlement, claim or unfavorable development could result in charges that could have such a material adverse effect.\nRisks Associated with Acquisitions - We may not be able to complete acquisitions, or successfully integrate acquisitions we may undertake in the future.\nOur strategy includes acquiring other businesses. The process of combining or acquiring businesses involves risks. We may face difficulty integrating the new operations, technologies, products and services of future acquisitions or combinations, and may incur unanticipated expenses related to such transactions. The difficulties of combining operations may be magnified by integrating personnel with differing business backgrounds and corporate cultures. Failure to successfully manage and integrate acquisitions with our existing operations could lead to the potential loss of customers of the acquired business, the potential loss of employees who may be vital to the new operations, the potential loss of business opportunities or other adverse consequences that could affect our financial condition and results of operations. Even if integration occurs successfully, failure of any future acquisition or combination to achieve levels of anticipated sales growth, and profitability, productivity comparable with our existing operations, or expected synergies related to such transaction, or to otherwise perform as expected, may adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. In addition, certain acquisitions may trigger regulations designed to monitor competition and would therefore require regulatory approval. We cannot predict whether such authorities will approve or whether we would be able to complete any acquisitions we seek to accomplish in the future.\nRelocation of our headquarters and key activities - Our operations may be disrupted by relocation of our headquarters and key activities.\nIn connection with the Separation from Air Products, we have announced our intention to relocate our headquarters and senior management team and key commercial functions and activities from Allentown, Pennsylvania to Tempe, Arizona and our research and development activities from Allentown, Pennsylvania to other key sites. The process of implementing the relocation and adjustment to a new location may distract management and other key employees, lead to increased turnover, and disrupt our administrative, research and development and commercial functions. If we are unable to stabilize the workforce and staff and ramp up the relocated functions promptly, or have to incur unexpected costs to do so, it could harm our operations and affect our results of operations.\nRisks Related to the Separation\nWe may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve as a result of our Separation from Air Products.\nAs an independent publicly traded company, we will focus our financial and operational resources on our specific business, growth profile and strategic priorities, design and implement corporate strategies and policies targeted to our operational focus and strategic priorities, guide our processes and infrastructure to focus on our core strengths, implement and maintain a capital structure designed to meet our specific needs and more effectively respond to industry dynamics. However, we may be unable to achieve some or all of these benefits. For example, we completed a series of strategic, structural and process realignment and restructuring actions within our operations. These actions may not provide the benefits we currently expect, and could lead to disruption of our operations, loss of, or inability to recruit, key personnel needed to operate and grow our business, weakening of our internal standards, controls or procedures and impairment of our key customer and supplier relationships. If we fail to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve as an independent company, or do not achieve them in the time we expect, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may be unable to make, on a timely or cost-effective basis, the changes necessary to operate as an independent public company.\nWe have begun and will continue to execute a number of significant business and organization changes to support our transition to a new standalone public company. We expect these changes, which include staffing adjustments, new hires and reassignment of responsibilities, adoption of new processes, systems and controls, and transitioning services provided by Air Products to internally provided services, to continue for the foreseeable future.\nIn the past we received a variety of services from Air Products, including information technology, accounting, tax, finance, legal, insurance, human resources, compliance and other administrative activities, the effective and appropriate performance of which is critical to our operations. We may be unable to replace these services in a timely manner or on terms and conditions as favorable as those we receive from Air Products. In particular, Air Products\u2019 information technology networks and systems are complex, and duplicating these networks and systems will be challenging. Because our business previously operated as part of the wider Air Products organization, we may be unable to successfully establish the infrastructure or implement the changes necessary to operate independently, or we may incur additional costs that could adversely affect our business.\nImplementing and maintaining our independent internal controls requires significant attention from management and we cannot be certain that we will successfully implement and maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future. Difficulties encountered in their implementation could harm our results of operations or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. If we fail to operate our internal controls efficiently and effectively, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow may be materially and adversely affected.\nOur historical financial results are not necessarily representative of the results we would have achieved as an independent, publicly traded company and may not be a reliable indicator of our future results.\nOur historical financial results may not reflect what our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows would have been had we been an independent, publicly traded company during the periods presented or what our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be in the future when we are an independent company. This is primarily because:\n\u2022\nPrior to our Separation, our business was operated by Air Products as part of its broader corporate organization, rather than as an independent, publicly traded company. In addition, prior to our Separation, Air Products, or one of its affiliates, performed significant corporate functions for us, including information technology, accounting, tax, finance, legal, insurance, human resources, compliance and other administrative activities. Our historical financial statements reflect allocations of corporate expenses from Air Products for these and similar functions, which are not necessarily representative of the costs we will incur for similar services as an independent company. We are responsible for the additional costs associated with being an independent, publicly traded company, including costs related to corporate governance and external reporting.\n\u2022\nOur working capital requirements and capital for our general corporate purposes, including acquisitions and capital expenditures, historically have been satisfied as part of the company-wide cash management practices of Air Products. While our business historically has generated sufficient cash to finance our working capital and other cash requirements, we no longer have access to Air Products\u2019 cash pool. We may need to obtain additional financing from banks, through public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities or other arrangements.\n\u2022\nOther significant changes may occur in our cost structure, management, financing, tax profile and business operations as a result of our operating as a company separate from Air Products. The historical combined financial data include deferred tax assets and associated valuation allowances for U.S. and certain foreign net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards that were utilized against Air Products income and are not available as future deductions or credits on our tax returns.\nWe incurred interest expense as part of our debt in connection with the Separation and Distribution, whereas our historical financial data only includes debt incurred by certain Versum subsidiaries and does not include an allocation of interest expense attributable to the portion of Air Products\u2019 debt that has supported our operations.\nAs an independent publicly traded company, we may not enjoy the same benefits that we did as part of Air Products.\nWe may be more susceptible to market fluctuations and other adverse events now as an independent company than we were as a part of the Air Products organizational structure. As part of Air Products, we enjoyed certain benefits from Air Products\u2019 operating diversity, purchasing power and opportunities to pursue integrated strategies with Air Products\u2019 other businesses. As an independent, publicly traded company, we do not have similar diversity or integration opportunities and do not have similar purchasing power or access to capital markets. As part of Air Products, we were able to leverage the Air Products historical market reputation and performance and brand identity to recruit and retain key personnel to run our business. As an independent, publicly traded company, we do not have the same historical market reputation and performance or brand identity as Air Products and it may be more difficult for us to recruit or retain such key personnel.\nWe will incur significant costs operating as an independent, publicly traded company, which may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe expect to incur certain ongoing costs associated with operating as an independent, publicly traded company and extra costs related to the creation of an IT function and reporting systems. We expect to spend $35-40 million of capital for relocating some of our infrastructure and setting up our new IT systems. The ongoing costs of the Separation may adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. For more information regarding the Separation and our anticipated costs to operate as an independent, publicly traded company, see Note 1, \u201cBasis of Presentation\u201d, of the Annual Combined Financial Statements.\nOur customers, prospective customers, suppliers or other companies with whom we conduct business may need assurances that our financial stability on a stand-alone basis is sufficient to satisfy their requirements for doing or continuing to do business with them.\nSome of our customers, prospective customers, suppliers or other companies with whom we conduct business may need assurances that our financial stability on a stand-alone basis is sufficient to satisfy their requirements for doing or continuing to do business with them, and may require us to provide additional credit support, such as letters of credit or other financial guarantees. Any failure of parties to be satisfied with our financial stability could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn connection with our Separation we assumed certain liabilities. If we are required to make payments pursuant to our indemnification obligations to Air Products, we may need to divert cash to meet those obligations and our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted. In addition, Air Products may indemnify us for certain liabilities. Air Products\u2019 indemnity may not be sufficient to insure us against the full amount of liabilities for which it will be allocated responsibility, and Air Products may not be able to satisfy its indemnification obligations in the future.\nPursuant to the Separation Agreement, the Employee Matters Agreement and the Tax Matters Agreement, each of which we entered into with Air Products on September 29, 2016, we agreed to assume, and indemnify Air Products for, certain liabilities for uncapped amounts, which may include, among other items, associated defense costs, settlement amounts and judgments. Payments pursuant to these indemnities may be significant and could negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, particularly indemnities relating to our actions that could impact the tax-free nature of the Distribution and certain related transactions. Third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for liabilities of Air Products\u2019 business. Air Products agreed to indemnify us for such liabilities, but such indemnity from Air Products may not be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, and Air Products may not be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. Moreover, even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from Air Products any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves. Each of these risks could negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf the Distribution of Versum common stock from Air Products or certain related transactions were to fail to qualify as tax-free to Air Products stockholders, then Versum could be subject to significant tax liability or tax indemnity obligations.\nAir Products received an opinion of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP (\u201cSkadden\u201d), tax counsel to Air Products, on the basis of certain facts, representations, covenants and assumptions set forth in such opinion, substantially to the effect that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Distribution of Versum common stock from Air Products and certain related transactions should qualify as a transaction that generally is tax-free to Air Products and Air Products\u2019 stockholders, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code.\nNotwithstanding the tax opinion, the IRS could determine on audit that the Distribution should be treated as a taxable transaction if it determines that any of the facts, assumptions, representations or covenants set forth in the tax opinion are not correct or have been violated, or that the Distribution should be taxable for other reasons, including as a result of a significant change in stock or asset ownership after the Distribution, or if the IRS were to disagree with the conclusions of the tax opinion. If the Distribution were determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, Air Products and its stockholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities.\nUnder the Tax Matters Agreement, Versum is generally required to indemnify Air Products against taxes incurred by Air Products that arise as a result of Versum taking or failing to take, as the case may be, certain actions that may result in the Distribution of Versum common stock from Air Products or certain related transactions failing to qualify as tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Under the Tax Matters Agreement, Versum may also be required to indemnify Air Products for other tax liabilities, which could materially adversely affect Versum\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may not be able to engage in certain corporate transactions for two years following the Distribution.\nTo preserve the tax-free treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes to Air Products and its stockholders of the Distribution and certain related transactions, under the Tax Matters Agreement, Versum is restricted from taking any action that prevents the Distribution and certain related transactions from qualifying as tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, under the Tax Matters Agreement, we are prohibited, except in certain circumstances, from repurchasing or taking certain other actions with respect to certain of our debt issued in connection with the Distribution, or, for the two-year period following the Distribution:\n\u2022\nentering into any transaction resulting in the acquisition of 40 percent or more of our stock or substantially all of our assets, whether by merger or otherwise;\n\u2022\nmerging, consolidating or liquidating;\n\u2022\nissuing equity securities beyond certain thresholds;\n\u2022\nrepurchasing our capital stock;\n\u2022\nceasing to actively conduct our business; or\n\u2022\ntaking or failing to take any other action that would cause the Distribution or certain related transactions to fail to qualify as tax-free.\nThese restrictions may limit our ability to pursue certain strategic transactions or other transactions that we may believe to be in the best interests of our stockholders or that might increase the value of our business. Under the Tax Matters Agreement, we are required to indemnify Air Products against any tax liabilities resulting from the acquisition of our stock or assets, even if we do not participate in or otherwise facilitate the acquisition.\nCertain of our directors and officers may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their equity ownership in Air Products, and one of our directors may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because he also serves as an officer and on the board of directors of Air Products.\nCertain of our directors and executive officers may own shares of Air Products\u2019 common stock, and the individual holdings may be significant for some of these individuals compared to their total assets. In addition, Seifi Ghasemi, who serves as Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Air Products, also serves as a director of Versum and our non-executive Chairman. This ownership or service to both companies may create, or may create the appearance of, conflicts of interest when these directors and officers are faced with decisions that could have different implications for Air Products and us. For example, potential conflicts of interest could arise in connection with the resolution of any dispute that may arise between Air Products and us regarding the terms of the agreements governing the internal reorganization, the Distribution and the relationship thereafter between the companies, including with respect to the indemnification of certain matters. We have agreed with Air Products that officers and directors who serve at both companies will recuse themselves from decisions where conflicts arise due to their positions at both companies.\nFor more information, see the sections captioned \u201cCertain Relationships and Related Person Transactions\u201d and \u201cCorporate Governance and Related Matters - Director Independence\u201d in the Information Statement filed as Exhibit 99.1 to our Registration Statement on Form 10 filed with the SEC on September 12, 2016 (the \u201cInformation Statement\u201d).\nAs a public company, we are required to publish more detailed information about our business, operations and financial performance which is available for our customers, competitors and other third parties.\nHistorically, information about our business and operations was presented as part of the broader Air Products corporate organization. As an independent, publicly traded company, we are required to publicly provide more detailed information about our business and operations, including financial information, as a stand-alone company. This information is accessible to our customers, suppliers and competitors, each of which may factor the new information into their commercial dealings with us. The use of such information by third parties could have an adverse effect on us and our results of operations, including our relative level of profitability.\nThe Separation and Distribution and related internal reorganization transactions may expose Versum to potential liabilities arising out of state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws and legal dividend requirements.\nIf Versum files for bankruptcy or is otherwise determined or deemed to be insolvent under federal bankruptcy laws, a court could deem the Separation and Distribution or certain internal reorganization transactions undertaken by Air Products in connection with the Separation to be a fraudulent conveyance or transfer. Fraudulent conveyances or transfers are defined to include transfers made or obligations incurred with the actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud current or future creditors or transfers made or obligations incurred for less than reasonably equivalent value when the debtor was insolvent, or that rendered the debtor insolvent, inadequately capitalized or unable to pay its debts as they become due. A court could void the transactions or impose substantial liabilities upon Versum, which could adversely affect Versum\u2019s financial condition and its results of operations. Among other things, the court could require Versum stockholders to return to Air Products some or all of the shares of Versum common stock issued in the Separation and Distribution, or require Versum to fund liabilities of other companies involved in the reorganization transactions for the benefit of creditors.\nThe Distribution of Versum common stock is also subject to review under state corporate distribution statutes. Under the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \u201cDGCL\u201d), a corporation may only pay dividends to its stockholders either (i) out of its surplus (net assets minus capital) or (ii) if there is no such surplus, out of its net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared or the preceding fiscal year. Although Air Products intended to make the Distribution of Versum common stock entirely out of surplus, Versum cannot assure you that a court will not later determine that some or all of the Distribution to Air Products stockholders was unlawful.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock and the Securities Market\nOur stock price may fluctuate significantly.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors, some of which may be beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nour quarterly or annual earnings, or those of other companies in our industry;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings estimates by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates or our earnings guidance;\n\u2022\nthe operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies;\n\u2022\noverall market fluctuations and domestic and worldwide economic conditions; and\n\u2022\nother factors described in these \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nStock markets in general have experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nWe cannot guarantee the timing, amount, or payment of dividends on our common stock in the future.\nThe payment and amount of any future dividend will be subject to the sole discretion of our post-Distribution, independent board of directors and will depend upon many factors, including our financial condition and prospects, our capital requirements and access to capital markets, covenants associated with certain of our debt obligations, legal requirements and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant, and there can be no assurance that we will continue to pay a dividend in the future.\nYour percentage of ownership in us may be diluted in the future.\nYour percentage ownership in us may be diluted because of equity issuances for acquisitions, capital market transactions or otherwise, including, without limitation, equity awards that we may be granting to our directors, officers and employees. Such issuances may have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nIn addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designation, powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights, including preferences over our common stock with respect to dividends and distributions, as our board of directors generally may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common stock. For example, we could grant the holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of our common stock. For more information, see \u201cDescription of Our Capital Stock\u201d in the Information Statement.\nCertain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, and of Delaware law, may prevent or delay an acquisition of us, which could decrease the trading price of our common stock.\nVersum\u2019s amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws contain, and Delaware law contains, provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the bidder and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with Versum\u2019s board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. These provisions include, among others:\n\u2022\nthe inability of our stockholders to act by written consent;\n\u2022\nthe inability of our stockholders to call special meetings;\n\u2022\nrules regarding how stockholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\nthe right of our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval; and\n\u2022\nthe ability of our directors, and not stockholders, to fill vacancies (including those resulting from an enlargement of our board of directors) on our board of directors.\nIn addition, we are subject to Section 203 of the DGCL. Section 203 provides that, subject to limited exceptions, persons that (without prior board approval) acquire, or are affiliated with a person that acquires, more than 15 percent of the outstanding voting stock of a Delaware corporation shall not engage in any business combination with that corporation, including by merger, consolidation or acquisitions of additional shares, for a three-year period following the date on which that person or its affiliate becomes the holder of more than 15 percent of the corporation\u2019s outstanding voting stock.\nWe believe these provisions protect our stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors and by providing our board of directors with more time to assess any acquisition proposal. These provisions are not intended to make us immune from takeovers. However, these provisions could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control or the removal of existing management, of deterring potential acquirers from making an offer to our stockholders and of limiting any opportunity to realize premiums over prevailing market prices for our common stock in connection therewith. This could be the case notwithstanding that a majority of our stockholders might benefit from such a change in control or offer.", "PERMNO": 16279, "SIC": 2860, "TIC": "VSM"}
