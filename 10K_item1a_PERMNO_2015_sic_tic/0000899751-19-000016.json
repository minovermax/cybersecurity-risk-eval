{"cik": "899751", "company": "TITAN INTERNATIONAL INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-07", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS\nThe Company is subject to various risks and uncertainties that it believes are significant to our business. These risks relate to or arise out of the nature of the Company's business and overall business, economic, financial, legal, and other factors or conditions that may affect the Company. In addition to risks discussed elsewhere in this report, the following are factors that could, individually or in the aggregate, materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations and cause the Company's actual results to differ from past results and/or those anticipated, estimated or projected. In addition, other risks not presently known to the Company or that the Company currently believes to be immaterial may also adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations, perhaps materially. It is impossible to predict or identify all such risks and uncertainties and, as a result, you should not consider the following factors to be a complete discussion of all risks or uncertainties that may impact the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\n\u2022\nThe Company is exposed to price fluctuations of key commodities.\nThe Company uses various raw materials, most significantly steel, natural rubber, synthetic rubber, carbon black, bead wire, and fabric in manufacturing its products across all of its market segments. The Company does not generally enter into long-term commodity contracts and does not use derivative commodity instruments to hedge exposures to commodity market price fluctuations. Therefore, the Company is exposed to price fluctuations of key commodities. Although the Company attempts to pass on certain material price increases to its customers, there is no assurance that the Company will be able to do so in the future. Any increase in the price of steel and rubber that is not passed on to customers could result in declining margins and have a material adverse effect on Titan\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022\nThe Company relies on a limited number of suppliers.\nThe Company currently relies on a limited number of suppliers for certain key commodities, which consist primarily of steel and rubber, in the manufacturing of Titan products. If the Company\u2019s suppliers are unable to provide raw materials to Titan in a timely manner, or are unable to meet our quality, quantity or cost requirements, the Company may not in all cases be able to promptly obtain substitute sources. Any extended delay in receiving critical materials could impair Titan\u2019s ability to deliver products to its customers. The loss of key suppliers, the inability to establish relationships with replacement suppliers, or the inability of Titan's suppliers to meet price, quality, quantity, and delivery requirements could have a significant adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\n\u2022\nThe Company\u2019s revolving credit facility and other debt obligations contain covenants that could limit the Company's financial and operational flexibility.\nThe Company\u2019s revolving credit facility, the indenture relating to the Company\u2019s 6.50% senior secured notes due 2023 and other debt obligations contain covenants and restrictions that may impact the Company\u2019s business. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Debt Restrictions\u201d below for a further discussion of these covenants and restrictions. A breach of one or more of the covenants could result in adverse consequences that could negatively impact the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. These consequences could limit Titan\u2019s ability to respond to market conditions, to provide for unanticipated capital investments, to raise additional debt or equity capital, to pay dividends, or to take advantage of business opportunities, including future acquisitions. Titan\u2019s ability to comply with the covenants may be affected by events beyond its control, including prevailing economic, financial, and industry conditions.\n\u2022\nThe Company operates in cyclical industries and is subject to changes in the economy.\nThe Company's sales are substantially dependent on three major industries: agricultural equipment, earthmoving/construction equipment, and consumer products. The business activity levels in these industries are subject to specific industry and general economic cycles. Any downturn in these industries or the general economy could drive decreases in demand for Titan\u2019s products and have a material adverse effect on Titan\u2019s business.\nThe agricultural equipment industry is affected by crop prices, farm income and farmland values, weather, export markets, and government policies. The earthmoving/construction industry is affected by the levels of government and private construction spending and replacement demand. The mining industry, which is within the earthmoving/construction industry, is affected by raw material commodity prices. The consumer products industry is affected by consumer disposable income, weather, competitive pricing, energy prices, and consumer attitudes. In addition, the performance of these industries is sensitive to interest rate and foreign exchange rate changes and varies with the overall level of economic activity. The cyclicality and volatility of the industries on which our sales are substantially dependent results in significant fluctuations in profits and cash flow from period to period and over the business cycle.\n\u2022\nThe Company\u2019s revenues are seasonal in nature due to Titan\u2019s dependence on seasonal industries.\nThe agricultural, earthmoving/construction, and consumer markets are seasonal, with typically lower sales during the second half of the year. This seasonality in demand has resulted in fluctuations in the Company\u2019s revenues and operating results between the first half and the second half of the year. Because much of Titan\u2019s overhead expenses are fixed, seasonal trends can cause volatility in profit margins and Titan's financial condition, especially during slower periods.\n\u2022\nThe Company\u2019s customer base is relatively concentrated.\nThe Company\u2019s ten largest customers, which are primarily original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), accounted for 35% of Titan\u2019s net sales for 2018. No customer accounted for 10% or more of Titan's net sales in 2018. Titan\u2019s business could be adversely affected if one of its larger customers reduces, or otherwise eliminates in full, its purchases from Titan due to work stoppages or slow-downs, financial difficulties, as a result of termination provisions, competitive pricing, or other reasons. There is also continuing pressure from OEMs to reduce costs, including the cost of products and services purchased from outside suppliers such as Titan, and in that regard OEMs may develop in-house tire and wheel capabilities. There can be no assurance that Titan will be able to maintain its long-term relationships with its major customers which could have an adverse effect on the Company's results of operations.\n\u2022\nThe Company may be adversely affected by changes in government regulations and policies.\nDomestic and foreign political developments and government regulations and policies directly affect the agricultural, earthmoving/construction, and consumer products industries in the United States and abroad. Regulations and policies in the agricultural industry such as those concerning greenhouse gas emissions in the United States and ongoing U.S. budget issues could negatively impact the Company's business. The earthmoving/construction industry is affected by changes in construction activity, housing starts, and other regulations related to the mining and the construction of roads, bridges, and infrastructure. The modification or adoption of existing laws, regulations, or policies could have an adverse effect on any one or more of these industries and, therefore, on Titan\u2019s business.\n\u2022\nThe Company is subject to corporate governance requirements, and costs related to compliance with, or failure to comply with, existing and future requirements could adversely affect Titan\u2019s business.\nThe Company is subject to corporate governance requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). These laws, rules, and regulations continue to evolve and may become increasingly restrictive in the future. Failure to comply with these laws, rules, and regulations may have a material adverse effect on Titan\u2019s reputation, financial condition, and the value of the Company\u2019s securities.\n\u2022\nThe Company is subject to risks associated with maintaining adequate disclosure controls and internal controls over financial reporting.\nFailure to maintain adequate financial and management processes and controls could affect the accuracy and timing of the Company's financial reporting. Testing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosures involves significant costs and could divert management's attention from other matters that are important to Titan's business. If the Company does not maintain adequate financial and management personnel, processes, and controls, it may not be able to accurately report its financial performance on a timely basis, the Company may be otherwise unable to comply with the periodic reporting requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the listing of the Company\u2019s common stock on the NYSE could be suspended or terminated, each of which could have a material adverse effect on the confidence in the Company's financial reporting, its credibility in the marketplace, and the trading price of Titan's common stock.\n\u2022\nThe Company faces substantial competition from domestic and international companies.\nThe Company competes with several domestic and international competitors, some of which are larger and have greater financial and marketing resources than Titan. Titan competes on the basis of price, quality, sales support, customer service, design capability, and delivery time. The Company\u2019s ability to compete with international competitors may be adversely affected various factors including, currency fluctuations and tariffs imposed by domestic and foreign governments. In addition, certain OEM customers could elect to manufacture certain products to meet their own requirements or to otherwise compete with Titan. The success of the Company's business depends in large part on its ability to provide comprehensive wheel and tire assemblies to its customers. The development or enhancement by Titan's competitors of similar capabilities could adversely affect its business.\nThere can be no assurance that Titan\u2019s businesses will not be adversely affected by increased competition in the Company\u2019s markets, or that competitors will not develop products that are more effective or less expensive than Titan products or which could render certain products less competitive. From time to time certain competitors have reduced prices in particular product categories, which has caused Titan to reduce prices. There can be no assurance that in the future Titan\u2019s competitors will not further reduce prices or that any such reductions would not have a material adverse effect on Titan\u2019s business.\n\u2022\nThe Company may be affected by unfair trade.\nTitan faces intense competition from producers both in the United States and around the world, some of which may engage in unfair trade practices. For example, in early January 2016, Titan, along with the United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial and Service Worker International Union, AFL-CIO, CLC of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, filed petitions with the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) and the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) alleging that imported off-the-road tires from India and Sri Lanka and wheel and tire assemblies from China were being dumped and/or subsidized and were a cause of material injury to the domestic industry. Unfair trade may have a material adverse effect on Titan's business.\n\u2022\nThe Company could be negatively impacted if Titan fails to maintain satisfactory labor relations.\nTitan is party to collective bargaining agreements covering a portion of the Company's workforce. If Titan is unable to maintain satisfactory labor relations with its employees covered by collective bargaining agreements, these employees could engage in strikes, or the Company may otherwise experience work slowdowns or be subject to other labor actions. Any such actions, and any other labor disputes with the Company\u2019s employees domestically or internationally, could materially disrupt its operations. Future collective bargaining agreements may impose significant additional costs on Titan, which could adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022\nUnfavorable outcomes of legal proceedings could adversely affect results of operations.\nThe Company is a party to routine legal proceedings arising out of the normal course of business. Due to the difficult nature of predicting unresolved and future legal claims, the Company cannot anticipate or predict any material adverse effect on its consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows as a result of efforts to comply with, or its liabilities pertaining to, legal judgments. Any adverse outcome in any litigation involving Titan or any of its subsidiaries could negatively affect the Company's business, reputation, and financial condition.\n\u2022\nAcquisitions/divestitures may require significant resources and/or result in significant losses, costs, or liabilities.\nAny future acquisitions or divestitures will depend on the Company\u2019s ability to identify suitable opportunities, to negotiate acceptable terms, and to finance acquisitions. Titan will also face competition for suitable acquisition candidates, which may increase costs. In addition, acquisitions and divestitures require significant managerial attention, which may be diverted from current operations. Furthermore, acquisitions and divestitures of businesses or facilities entail a number of additional risks and challenges including: integrating acquisitions with existing operations; and separating operations in connection with dispositions; applying internal controls and processes throughout the acquired business; potential disruption of the Company's ongoing business; inability to maintain key customer, supplier, and employee relationships; potential that transactions do not produce satisfactory returns on a timely basis or at all; and exposure to unanticipated liabilities.\nInternational acquisitions or divestitures may be more complex and time consuming. Also, international acquisitions and divestitures may include a number of additional risks, including the integration of acquisitions or separation of divestitures in compliance with foreign laws and regulations and business and accounting systems.\nSubject to the terms of its existing indebtedness, the Company may finance future acquisitions with cash from operations, additional indebtedness, and/or by issuing additional equity securities. These commitments may impair the operation of Titan\u2019s businesses. In addition, the Company could face financial risks associated with incurring additional indebtedness, such as reducing liquidity and access to financing markets and increasing the amount of cash flow required to service such indebtedness.\n\u2022\nThe Company has international operations and purchases raw material from foreign suppliers.\nThe Company had total aggregate net sales outside the United States of approximately $890.5 million, $826.2 million, and $707.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Net sales outside the United States have become a significant proportion of total net sales, accounting for 56% of net sales for each of the years ending December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016. Net sales from these international operations are expected to continue to represent a similar portion of total net sales for the foreseeable future.\nInternational Operations and Sales - International operations and sales are subject to a number of risks, that are not generally applicable to Titan\u2019s North American operations including, but not limited to, risks with respect to currency exchange rates, economic and political destabilization, other disruption of foreign markets, and restrictive actions by foreign governments (such as restrictions on transfer of funds, export duties, and quotas and foreign customs). Other risks include changes in foreign laws regarding trade and investment; difficulties in establishing and maintaining relationships with respect to product distribution and support; nationalization; reforms of United States laws and policies affecting trade, restrictions on foreign investment, and restrictions on loans to foreign entities; and changes in foreign tax and other laws. There may also be restrictions on the Company's ability to repatriate earnings and investments from international operations. There can be no assurance that one or a combination of these factors will not have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s ability to increase or maintain its international sales.\nForeign Suppliers - The Company purchases raw materials from foreign suppliers. The production costs, profit margins, and competitive position of the Company are affected by the strength of the currencies in countries where Titan purchases goods, relative to the strength of the currencies in countries where the products are sold. The Company\u2019s results of operations, cash flows, and financial position may be affected by fluctuations in foreign currencies.\n\u2022\nThe Company is subject to anti-corruption laws and regulations.\nThe Company has international operations and must comply with anti-corruption laws and regulations including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). These anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA prohibits these payments regardless of local customs and practices. Safeguards that Titan may implement to discourage these practices could prove to be ineffective, and violations of these laws may result in criminal or civil sanctions or other liabilities or proceedings against Titan and could adversely affect the Company's business and reputation.\n\u2022\nThe Company may be subject to product liability and warranty claims.\nThe Company warrants its products to be free of certain defects and, accordingly, may be subject, in the ordinary course of business, to product liability or product warranty claims. Losses may result or be alleged to result from defects in Titan products, which could subject the Company to claims for damages, including consequential damages. There can be no assurance that the Company's insurance coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that adequate insurance will be available on terms acceptable to the Company. Any claims relating to defective products that result in liability exceeding Titan\u2019s insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on Titan's financial condition and results of operations. Further, claims of defects could result in negative publicity against Titan, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and reputation.\n\u2022\nThe Company may be adversely affected by a disruption in, or failure of, information technology systems.\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company relies upon information technology systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit, and store electronic information. Technology systems are used in a variety of business processes and activities, including purchasing, manufacturing, distribution, invoicing, and financial reporting. The Company utilizes security measures and business continuity plans to prevent, detect, and remediate damage from computer viruses, natural disasters, unauthorized access (whether through cybersecurity attacks or otherwise), utility failures, and other similar disruptions. Despite Titan's security measures and safeguards, a security breach or information technology system interruption or failure may disrupt and affect the Company's business, resulting in customer dissatisfaction, potential legal claims and adversely affect Titan\u2019s results of operations and financial conditions. There can be no assurance that any such security measures or plans will be sufficient to mitigate all potential risks to Titan's systems, networks, and information. Further a significant theft, loss, or fraudulent use of customer or employee information could adversely impact the Company's reputation and could result in unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information, significant costs, fines, and litigation, including with respect to enhanced cybersecurity protection and remediation costs. The Company is currently undergoing upgrades and improvements to its core enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems which are \u2018cloud based\u2019. Despite adequate security measures, these systems are vulnerable to disruption of service and security breaches as mentioned above. Further, investment in the \u2018cloud based\u2019 systems may have an adverse impact on short-term results of operations and financial condition.\n\u2022\nThe Company is subject to governmental laws, regulations and other legal obligations related to privacy and data protection.\nThe legislative and regulatory framework for privacy and data protection issues worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. Titan collects personally identifiable information (PII) and other data as integral parts of its business processes and activities. This data is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws and regulations, including oversight by various regulatory or other governmental bodies. Many foreign countries and governmental bodies, including the European Union, Canada, and other relevant jurisdictions where we conduct business, have laws and regulations concerning the collection and use of PII and other data obtained from their residents or by businesses operating within their jurisdiction that are more restrictive than those in the U.S. Additionally, in 2016, the European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) that imposes more stringent data protection requirements and provides for greater penalties for noncompliance. Any inability, or perceived inability, to adequately address privacy and data protection concerns, even if unfounded, or comply with applicable laws, regulations, policies, industry standards, contractual obligations, or other legal obligations could result in additional cost and liability to the Company or Company officials, damage our reputation, inhibit sales, and otherwise adversely affect our business.\n\u2022\nThe Company is subject to risks associated with climate change regulations.\nGovernmental regulatory bodies in the United States and other countries have adopted, or are contemplating introducing regulatory changes in response to the potential impacts of climate change. Laws and regulations regarding climate change and energy usage may impact the Company directly through higher costs for energy and raw materials. The Company\u2019s customers may also be affected by climate change regulations that may impact future purchases of the Company's products. Physical climate change may potentially have a large impact on the Company\u2019s two largest industry segments, agriculture and earthmoving/construction. The potential impacts of climate change and climate change regulations are highly uncertain at this time, and the Company cannot anticipate or predict any material adverse effect on its consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows as a result of climate change and climate change regulations.\n\u2022\nThe Company is subject to risks associated with environmental laws and regulations.\nThe Company\u2019s operations are subject to federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations governing, among other things, emissions to air, discharge to waters, and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment, and disposal of waste and other materials. The Company\u2019s operations entail risks in these areas, and there can be no assurance that Titan will not incur material costs or liabilities. In addition, potentially significant expenditures could be required in order to comply with evolving environmental and health and safety laws, regulations, or requirements that may be adopted or imposed in the future. Titan\u2019s customers may also be affected by environmental laws and regulations that may impact future purchases of the Company's products.\n\u2022\nThe Company is subject to foreign currency translation risk.\nThe Company operates in many worldwide locations and transacts business in many foreign currencies. Titan's financial statements are reported in U.S. dollars with financial statements of international subsidiaries being initially recorded in foreign currencies and translated into U.S. dollars. Large fluctuations in currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other global currencies may have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.\n\u2022\nThe Company may incur additional tax expense or tax exposure.\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions, and has domestic and international tax liabilities which are dependent upon the distribution of income among these different jurisdictions. Titan's income tax provision and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors, including income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in tax laws and regulations.\n\u2022\nThe Company is subject to risks related to uncertainties in global and regional economic conditions.\nOur results of operations are materially affected by economic conditions globally, regionally and in the particular industries we serve. The demand for our products tends to be cyclical and can be significantly reduced in periods of economic weakness characterized by lower levels of government and business investment, lower levels of business confidence, lower corporate earnings, high real interest rates, lower credit activity or tighter credit conditions, higher unemployment and lower consumer spending. Economic conditions vary across regions and countries, and demand for our products generally increases in those regions and countries experiencing economic growth and investment. Slower economic growth or a change in the global mix of regions and countries experiencing economic growth and investment could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\u2022\nThe Company is not insured against all potential losses and could be harmed by natural disasters, catastrophes, or sabotage.\nThe Company's business activities involve substantial investments in manufacturing facilities and products are produced at a limited number of locations. These facilities could be materially damaged, including as a result of natural disasters, such as fires, floods, tornadoes, hurricanes, and earthquakes, or by sabotage. The Company could incur uninsured losses and liabilities arising from such events, as well as damage to its reputation, and/or suffer material losses in operational capacity and efficiency, which could have a material adverse impact on Titan's business, financial condition, and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 79198, "SIC": 3523, "TIC": "TWI"}
