They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, including those set forth below.\nFACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS\nRisks related to the proposed Merger with Vistra Energy\nWe may be unable to obtain necessary stockholder or regulatory approvals required to complete the Merger Agreement.\nOn October 30, 2017, we announced the execution of the Merger Agreement with Vistra Energy.\nBefore the Merger may be completed, both Dynegy and Vistra Energy will need to obtain stockholder approval in connection with the proposed transaction. In addition, various filings must be made with FERC and various regulatory, antitrust and other authorities in the United States. These governmental authorities may impose conditions on the completion, or require changes to the terms, of the Merger, including restrictions or conditions on the business, operations or financial performance of the combined company following completion of the Merger. These conditions or changes, including potential litigation brought in connection with the proposed Merger, could have the effect of delaying completion of the Merger or imposing additional costs on or limiting the revenues of the combined company following the Merger, which could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the combined company and/or cause either Dynegy or Vistra Energy to abandon the Merger.\nIf we are unable to complete the Merger, we still will incur and will remain liable for significant transaction costs, including legal, accounting, filing, printing and other costs relating to the Merger. Also, depending upon the reasons for not completing the Merger, we may be required to pay Vistra Energy a termination fee of $87 million.\nThe Merger may not achieve its intended results.\nWe entered into the Merger Agreement with the expectation that the Merger would result in various benefits, including, among other things, cost savings and operating efficiencies. Achieving the anticipated benefits of the Merger is subject to a number of uncertainties, including whether the businesses of Dynegy and Vistra Energy are integrated in an efficient and effective manner. Failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues generated by the combined company and diversion of management\u2019s time and energy and could have an adverse effect on the combined company\u2019s business, financial results and prospects.\nWe will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the Merger is pending that could adversely affect our financial results.\nUncertainty about the effect of the Merger with Vistra Energy on employees, customers and suppliers may have an adverse effect on our business. Although we intend to take steps designed to reduce any adverse effects, these uncertainties may impair our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the Merger is completed and for a period of time thereafter, and could cause customers, suppliers and others that deal with us to seek to change existing business relationships.\nEmployee retention and recruitment may be particularly challenging prior to the completion of the Merger, as employees and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company. If, despite our retention and recruiting efforts, key employees depart or prospective employees fail to accept employment with us because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with the combined company, our financial results could be affected.\nThe pursuit of the Merger and the preparation for the integration of Dynegy and Vistra Energy may place a significant burden on management and internal resources. The diversion of management attention away from ongoing business concerns and any difficulties encountered in the transition and integration process could affect our business, and our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, we are restricted under the Merger Agreement, without Vistra Energy\u2019s consent, from making certain acquisitions and taking other specified actions until the Merger occurs or the Merger Agreement terminates. These restrictions may prevent us from pursuing otherwise attractive business opportunities and making other changes to our business prior to completion of the Merger or termination of the Merger Agreement.\nBecause the market price of shares of Vistra Energy and Dynegy common stock will fluctuate and the exchange ratio is fixed, the market value of the Merger consideration at the date of the closing may vary significantly from the date the Merger Agreement was executed.\nUpon completion of the Merger, each outstanding share of Dynegy common stock will be converted into the right to receive 0.652 of a share of Vistra Energy common stock. The number of shares of Vistra Energy common stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger Agreement for each share of Dynegy common stock is fixed and will not change to reflect changes in the market price of Vistra Energy common stock or Dynegy common stock. The market prices of Vistra Energy common stock or Dynegy common stock at the time of completion of the Merger may vary significantly from the market prices of Vistra Energy common stock on the date the Merger agreement was executed.\nIn addition, the Merger might not be completed until a significant period of time has passed after the respective stockholder meetings. Because the exchange ratio is fixed, the market value of the Vistra Energy common stock issued in connection with the Merger and the Dynegy common stock surrendered in connection with the Merger may be higher or lower than the values of those shares on earlier dates. Stock price changes may result from market assessment of the likelihood that the Merger will be completed, changes in the business, operations or prospects of Vistra Energy or Dynegy prior to or following the Merger, litigation or regulatory considerations, general business, market, industry or economic conditions and other factors both within and beyond the control of Vistra Energy and Dynegy. Neither Vistra Energy nor Dynegy is permitted to terminate the Merger Agreement solely because of changes in the market price of either company\u2019s common stock.\nThe Merger Agreement contains provisions that limit Dynegy\u2019s ability to pursue alternatives to the Merger, could discourage a potential competing acquirer of Dynegy from making a favorable alternative transaction proposal and, in certain circumstances, could require Dynegy to pay a termination fee to Vistra Energy.\nUnder the Merger Agreement, Dynegy is restricted from entering into alternative transactions. Unless and until the Merger Agreement is terminated, subject to specified exceptions, Dynegy is restricted from soliciting, initiating or knowingly encouraging, inducing or facilitating, or participating in any discussions or negotiations with any person regarding, or cooperating in any way with any person with respect to, any alternative proposal or any inquiry or proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to an alternative proposal. While Dynegy\u2019s Board of Directors is permitted to change its recommendation to stockholders prior to the special meeting under certain circumstances, namely if Dynegy is in receipt of a superior proposal or an intervening event has occurred, before Dynegy\u2019s Board of Directors changes its recommendation to stockholders in such circumstances, Dynegy must, if requested by Vistra Energy, negotiate with Vistra Energy regarding potential amendments to the Merger Agreement. Dynegy may terminate the Merger Agreement and enter into an agreement with respect to a superior proposal only if specified conditions have been satisfied, including compliance with the provisions of the Merger Agreement restricting solicitation of alternative proposals and requiring payment of a termination fee in certain circumstances. These provisions could discourage a third party that may have an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of Dynegy from considering or proposing such an acquisition, even if such third party were prepared to pay consideration with a higher per share cash or market value than the market value proposed to be received or realized in the merger, or could result in a potential competing acquirer proposing to pay a lower price than it would otherwise have proposed to pay because of the added expense of the termination fee that may become payable in certain circumstances. As a result of these restrictions, Dynegy may not be able to enter into an agreement with respect to a more favorable alternative transaction without incurring potentially significant liability to the other.\nIf the Merger Agreement is terminated because Dynegy\u2019s Board of Directors changes its recommendation to stockholders or Dynegy enters into a definitive agreement for a superior proposal, Dynegy will be required to pay Vistra Energy a termination fee of $87 million. If such a termination fee is payable, the payment of this fee could have an adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of Dynegy.\nCurrent Dynegy stockholders will have a reduced ownership and voting interest after the Merger and will exercise less influence over management of the combined company.\nUpon completion of the Merger, Dynegy stockholders will own approximately 21 percent of the combined company. Dynegy stockholders currently have the right to vote for Dynegy\u2019s Board of Directors and on other matters affecting Dynegy. When the Merger occurs, each Dynegy stockholder will receive 0.652 shares of Vistra Energy common stock per share of Dynegy common stock, with a percentage ownership of the combined company that is significantly smaller than the stockholders\u2019 percentage ownership of Dynegy prior to the Merger. As a result of these reduced ownership percentages, current Dynegy stockholders will have less influence on the management and policies of the combined company than they now have with respect to Dynegy.\nRisks Related to the Operation of Our Business\nWholesale and retail power prices are subject to significant volatility and because many of our power generation facilities operate without long-term power sales agreements, our revenues and profitability are subject to wide fluctuations.\nThe majority of our facilities operate as \u201cmerchant\u201d facilities without long-term power sales agreements. As a result, we largely sell electric energy, capacity and ancillary services into the wholesale energy spot market or into other wholesale and retail power markets on a short-term basis and are not guaranteed any rate of return on our capital investments. Consequently, there can be no assurance that we will be able to sell any or all of the electric energy, capacity or ancillary services from those facilities at commercially attractive rates or that our facilities will be able to operate profitably. We depend, in large part, upon prevailing market prices for power, capacity and fuel. Given the volatility of commodity power prices, to the extent we do not secure long-term power sales agreements for the output of our power generation facilities, our revenues and profitability will be subject to volatility, and our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. Factors that may materially impact the power markets and our financial results include:\n\u2022\naddition of new supplies of power from existing competitors or new market entrants as a result of the development of new generation plants, expansion of existing plants or additional transmission capacity;\n\u2022\nuneconomic generation kept on line by utilities, aided by state-based subsidies;\n\u2022\nenvironmental regulations and legislation;\n\u2022\nweather conditions, including extreme weather conditions and seasonal fluctuations;\n\u2022\nelectric supply disruptions including plant outages;\n\u2022\nbasis risk from transmission losses and congestion and changes in power transmission infrastructure;\n\u2022\ndevelopment of new technologies for the production of natural gas;\n\u2022\nnatural gas and coal supply disruptions;\n\u2022\nfuel price volatility;\n\u2022\neconomic conditions;\n\u2022\ncapacity performance, or similar construct, requirements and penalties;\n\u2022\nincreased competition or price pressure driven by generation from renewable sources and other subsidized generation;\n\u2022\nregulatory constraints on pricing (current or future), including RTO and ISO rules, policies and actions, or the functioning of the energy trading markets and energy trading generally;\n\u2022\nthe existence and effectiveness of demand-side management; and\n\u2022\nconservation efforts and energy efficiency rules and the extent to which they impact electricity demand.\nOur commercial strategies for our wholesale and retail businesses may not be executed as planned, may result in lost opportunities or adversely affect financial performance.\nWe seek to commercialize our assets through sales arrangements of various types. In doing so, we attempt to balance a desire for greater predictability of earnings and cash flows in the short- and medium-terms with our expectation that commodity prices will rise over the longer term, creating upside opportunities for those with unhedged generation volumes. Our ability to successfully execute this strategy is dependent on a number of factors, many of which are outside our control, including market liquidity and design, correlation risk, commodity price cycles, the availability of counterparties willing to transact with us or to transact with us at prices we think are commercially acceptable, the availability of liquidity to post collateral in support of our derivative instruments and the reliability of the systems and models comprising our commercial operations function. The availability of market liquidity and willing counterparties could be negatively impacted by poor economic and financial market conditions, including impacts on financial institutions and other current and potential counterparties as well as counterparties\u2019 views of our creditworthiness. If we are unable to transact in the short- and medium-terms, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be subject to significant uncertainty and volatility. Alternatively, significant power sales for any such period may precede a run-up in commodity prices, resulting in lost up-side opportunities.\nFurther, financial performance may be adversely affected if we are unable to effectively manage our power portfolio. A portion of the generation power portfolio is used to provide power to wholesale and retail customers. To the extent portions of the power portfolio are not needed for that purpose, generation output is sold in the wholesale market. To the extent our power portfolio is not sufficient to meet the requirements of our customers, we must purchase power in the wholesale power markets. Our financial results may be negatively affected if we are unable to manage the power portfolio and cost-effectively meet the requirements of our customers.\nA decline in market liquidity and our ability to manage our counterparty credit risk could adversely affect us.\nOur counterparties may experience deteriorating credit. These conditions could cause counterparties in the natural gas, coal and power markets, particularly in the energy commodity derivative markets that we rely on for our hedging activities, to withdraw from participation in those markets. If multiple parties withdraw from those markets, market liquidity may be threatened, which in turn could adversely impact our business. Additionally, these conditions may cause our counterparties to seek bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 or liquidation under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. Our credit risk may be exacerbated to the extent collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount due to us. There can be no assurance that any such losses or impairments to the carrying value of our financial assets would not materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, retail sales subject us to credit risk through competitive electricity supply activities to serve commercial and industrial companies and governmental entities. This risk represents the loss that may be incurred due to the nonpayment of a customer\u2019s account balance, as well as the loss from the resale of energy previously committed to serve that customer, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are exposed to the risk of fuel and fuel transportation cost increases and interruptions in fuel supplies.\nWe purchase the fuel requirements for many of our power generation facilities, primarily those that are natural gas-fired, under short-term contracts or on the spot market. As a result, we face the risks of supply interruptions and fuel price volatility, as fuel deliveries may not exactly match those required for energy sales.\nFurther, any changes in the costs of coal, fuel oil, natural gas or transportation rates and changes in the relationship between such costs and the market prices of power will affect our financial results. If we are unable to procure fuel for physical delivery at prices we consider favorable, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nOperation of power generation facilities involves significant risks customary to the power industry that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe ongoing operation of our facilities involves risks customary to the power industry that include the breakdown or failure of equipment or processes, operational and safety performance below expected levels and the inability to transport our product to customers in an efficient manner due to a lack of transmission capacity. Unplanned outages of generating units, including extensions of scheduled outages due to mechanical failures or other problems, occur from time to time and are an inherent risk of our business. Any unexpected failure, including failure associated with breakdowns, forced outages or any unanticipated capital expenditures, could result in reduced profitability, or with respect to capacity performance, performance incentive or similar construct, significant penalties or exceptionally high real-time LMPs. Unplanned outages typically increase our operation and maintenance expenses and may reduce our revenues as a result of selling fewer MW or require us to incur significant costs as a result of running one of our higher cost units or obtaining replacement power from third parties in the open market to satisfy our forward power sales obligations. If we are unsuccessful in operating our facilities efficiently, such inefficiency could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCertain of our competitors may receive state-based subsidies that could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nA number of states in which we operate have either enacted or are considering regulations or legislation to subsidize otherwise uneconomic nuclear plants, and attempt to incent the development of new renewable resources as well as increase energy efficiency investments. In addition, in December 2015, federal renewable energy tax credits, including the wind power production tax credit and solar investment tax credits, were extended as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016. Dynegy has actively challenged these types of programs and will continue to do so, including initiating legal challenges where appropriate. At this time, the direct impact on the organized power markets is a change in the generation supply stack created by the continued operation of subsidized resources that would retire absent the subsidies. The net combined impact of existing subsidy programs on Dynegy is uncertain at this time. Continued growth of energy subsidies could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur costs of compliance with existing environmental requirements are significant, and costs of compliance with new environmental requirements or factors could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business is subject to extensive and frequently changing environmental regulation by federal, state and local authorities. Such environmental regulation imposes, among other things, capital and operating expenditures, restrictions, liabilities and obligations in connection with the generation, handling, use, transportation, treatment, storage and disposal of certain substances and wastes, including CCR, and in connection with spills, releases and emissions of various substances (including carbon emissions)\ninto the environment, as well as environmental impacts associated with cooling water intake structures. Existing environmental laws and regulations may be revised or reinterpreted, new laws and regulations may be adopted or may become applicable to us or our facilities, and litigation or enforcement proceedings could be commenced against us. Proposals being considered by federal and state authorities (including proposals regarding cooling water intake structures and carbon) could, if and when adopted or enacted, require us to make substantial capital and operating expenditures, impair assets, or limit or terminate operation of certain of our facilities. If any of these events occur, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nMany environmental laws require approvals or permits from governmental authorities before construction, modification or operation of a power generation facility may commence. Certain environmental permits must be renewed periodically in order for us to continue operating our facilities. The process of obtaining and renewing necessary permits can be lengthy and complex and can sometimes result in the establishment of permit conditions that make the project or activity for which the permit was sought unprofitable or otherwise unattractive. Even where permits are not required, compliance with environmental laws and regulations can require significant capital and operating expenditures. We are required to comply with numerous environmental laws and regulations, and to obtain numerous governmental permits when we modify and operate our facilities. If there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approvals or permits, if we fail to obtain any required approval or permit, or if we are unable to comply with the terms of such approvals or permits, the operation of our facilities may be interrupted or become subject to additional costs and/or legal challenges. Further, changed interpretations of existing regulations may subject historical maintenance, repair and replacement activities at our facilities to claims of noncompliance. With the trend toward stricter environmental standards and more extensive regulatory and permitting requirements, our capital and operating environmental expenditures are likely to be substantial and may significantly increase in the future. As a result, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nOur business is subject to complex government regulation. Changes in these regulations or in their implementation may affect costs of operating our facilities or our ability to operate our facilities, or increase competition, any of which would negatively impact our results of operations.\nWe are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the generation and sale of energy commodities in each of the jurisdictions in which we have operations. Compliance with these ever-changing laws and regulations requires expenses (including legal representation) and monitoring, capital and operating expenditures. Potential changes in laws and regulations that could have a material impact on our business include: the introduction, or reintroduction, of rate caps or pricing constraints; inability to pass on costs to customers; state regulatory initiatives, including subsidized generation; increased credit standards, collateral costs or margin requirements, as well as reduced market liquidity, as a result of potential OTC market regulation; or a variation of these. Furthermore, these and other market-based rules and regulations are subject to change at any time, and we cannot predict what changes may occur in the future or how such changes might affect any facet of our business.\nThe costs and burdens associated with complying with the increased number of regulations may have a material adverse effect on us if we fail to comply with the laws and regulations governing our business or if we fail to maintain or obtain advantageous regulatory authorizations and exemptions. Failure to comply with such requirements could result in the shutdown of any noncompliant facility, the imposition of liens or fines, or civil or criminal liability. Moreover, increased competition within the sector resulting from potential legislative changes, regulatory changes or other factors may create greater risks to the stability of our power generation earnings and cash flows.\nRegulators, politicians, non-governmental organizations and other private parties have expressed concern about GHG emissions and the potential risks associated with climate change and are taking actions which could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFor the last several years, there has been a robust public debate about climate change and the potential for regulations requiring lower emissions of GHG, primarily CO2 and methane. As discussed in Item 1. Business-Environmental Matters, at the federal and state levels, rules are in effect and policies are under development to regulate GHG emissions, thereby effectively putting a cost on such emissions in order to create financial incentives to reduce them. Power generating facilities are a major source of GHG emissions. We cannot confidently predict the final outcome of the current debate on climate change nor can we predict with confidence the ultimate requirements of proposed, anticipated or existing federal and state legislation and regulations intended to address climate change. These activities, and the highly politicized nature of climate change, suggest a trend toward increased regulation of GHG that could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Existing and anticipated federal and state regulations intended to address climate change may significantly increase the cost of providing electric power, resulting in far-reaching and significant impacts on us and others in the power generation industry over time. It is possible that federal and state actions intended to address climate change could result in costs assigned to GHG emissions that we would not be able to fully recover through market pricing or otherwise. If capital and/or operating costs related to compliance with regulations intended to address climate change become great enough to render the operations of certain plants uneconomical, we could, at our option and subject to any applicable financing agreements or other obligations,\nreduce operations or cease to operate such plants and forego such capital and/or operating costs. Though we consider our largest risk related to climate change to be legislative and regulatory changes, we are subject to physical risks inherent in industrial operations including severe weather events such as hurricanes and tornadoes. To the extent that changes in climate affect changes in weather patterns (such as more severe weather events), we could be adversely affected.\nAvailability and cost of emission allowances could materially impact our costs of operations.\nWe are required to maintain, either through allocation or purchase, sufficient emission allowances to support our operations in the ordinary course of operating our power generation facilities. These allowances are used to meet our obligations imposed by various applicable environmental laws, and the trend toward more stringent regulations (including regulations regarding GHG emissions) will likely require us to obtain new or additional emission allowances. If our operational needs require more than our allocated quantity of emission allowances, we may be forced to purchase such allowances on the open market, which could be costly. If we are unable to maintain sufficient emission allowances to match our operational needs, we may have to curtail our operations so as not to exceed our available emission allowances, or install costly new emissions controls. As we use the emissions allowances that we have purchased on the open market, costs associated with such purchases will be recognized as an operating expense. If such allowances are available for purchase, but only at significantly higher prices, their purchase could materially increase our costs of operations in the affected markets and materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCompetition in wholesale and retail power markets, together with subsidized generation, may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur power generation business competes with other non-utility generators, regulated utilities, unregulated subsidiaries of regulated utilities, other energy service companies and financial institutions in the sale of electric energy, capacity and ancillary services, as well as in the procurement of fuel, transmission and transportation services. Moreover, aggregate demand for power may be met by generation capacity based on several competing technologies, as well as power generating facilities fueled by alternative or renewable energy sources, including hydroelectric power, synthetic fuels, solar, wind, wood, geothermal, waste heat and solid waste sources. Regulatory initiatives designed to enhance and/or subsidize renewable generation increases competition from these types of facilities.\nWe also compete against other energy merchants on the basis of our relative operating skills, financial position and access to credit sources. Electric energy customers, wholesale energy suppliers and transporters often seek financial guarantees, credit support such as letters of credit and other assurances that their energy contracts will be satisfied. Companies with which we compete may have greater resources in these areas. Over time, some of our plants may become unable to compete because of subsidized generation, including public utility commission supported power purchase agreements, and the construction of new plants. Such new plants could have a number of advantages including: more efficient equipment, newer technology that could result in fewer emissions or more advantageous locations on the electric transmission system. Additionally, these competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new laws and regulations because of the newer technology utilized in their facilities or the additional resources derived from owning more efficient facilities.\nOther factors may contribute to increased competition in wholesale power markets. New forms of capital and competitors have entered the industry, including financial investors who perceive that asset values are at levels below their true replacement value. As a result, a number of generation facilities in the U.S. are now owned by lenders and investment companies. Furthermore, mergers and asset reallocations in the industry could create powerful new competitors. Under any scenario, we anticipate that we will face competition from numerous companies in the industry.\nIn addition, our retail marketing efforts compete for customers in a competitive environment, which impacts the margins that we can earn on the volumes we are able to serve. Further, with retail competition, residential customers where we serve load can switch to and from competitive electric generation suppliers for their energy needs. If fewer customers switch to another supplier than anticipated, the load we must serve will be greater and, if market prices have increased, our costs will increase due to the need to go to the market to cover the incremental supply obligation. If more customers switch to another supplier than anticipated, the load we must serve will be lower and, if market prices have decreased, we could lose opportunities in the market. To the extent that competition increases, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be materially adversely affected.\nGenerally, we do not own or control transmission facilities required to sell wholesale power from our generation facilities. If transmission services are inadequate, our ability to sell and deliver wholesale power may be materially adversely affected. Furthermore, RTOs and ISOs administer the transmission infrastructure and market, which are subject to changes in structure and operation and impose various pricing limitations. These changes and pricing limitations may affect our ability to deliver power to the market that would, in turn, adversely affect the profitability of our generation facilities.\nWith the exception of EEI, which owns and controls transmission lines interconnecting the Joppa facility in EEI\u2019s control area to MISO, Tennessee Valley Authority and Louisville Gas and Electric Company, we do not own or control the transmission facilities required to deliver the power from our generation facilities to the market. If transmission services from these facilities are unavailable or disrupted, or if the transmission capacity infrastructure is inadequate, our ability to sell and deliver wholesale power may be materially adversely affected, which could result in reduced profitability, or with respect to capacity performance in PJM and performance incentives in ISO-NE, significant penalties. RTOs and ISOs provide transmission services, administer transparent and competitive power markets and maintain system reliability. Many of these RTOs and ISOs operate in the real-time and day-ahead markets in which we sell energy. The RTOs and ISOs that oversee most of the wholesale power markets impose price limitations, offer caps, capacity performance requirements, penalties, and other mechanisms to guard against the potential exercise of market power in these markets. Price limitations and other regulatory mechanisms may adversely affect the profitability of our generation facilities that sell energy and capacity into the wholesale power markets. Problems or delays that may arise in the formation and operation of maturing RTOs and similar market structures, or changes in geographic scope, rules or market operations of existing RTOs, may also affect our ability to sell, the prices we receive or the cost to transmit power produced by our generating facilities. Market design as well as rules governing the various regional power markets may also change from time to time, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur Retail business is subject to the risk that sensitive customer data may be compromised, which could result in an adverse impact to our reputation and/or the results of operations of the Retail business.\nThe Retail business requires access to sensitive customer data in the ordinary course of business. Examples of sensitive customer data are names, addresses, account information, historical electricity usage, expected patterns of use, payment history, credit bureau data and bank account information. The Retail business may need to provide sensitive customer data to vendors and service providers who require access to this information in order to provide services, such as call center operations, to the Retail business. If a significant breach occurred, our reputation may be adversely affected, customer confidence may be diminished or we may be subject to legal claims, any of which may contribute to the loss of customers and have a negative impact on our business and/or financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nUnauthorized hedging and related activities by our employees could result in significant losses.\nWe intend to continue our commercial strategy, which emphasizes forward power sales opportunities intended to reduce the market price exposure of the Company to power price declines. We have various internal policies and procedures designed to monitor hedging activities and positions. These policies and procedures are designed, in part, to prevent unauthorized purchases or sales of products by our employees. We cannot assure, however, that these steps will detect and prevent inaccurate reporting and all other violations of our risk management policies and procedures, particularly if deception or other intentional misconduct is involved. A significant policy violation that is not detected could result in a substantial financial loss.\nOur risk management policies cannot fully eliminate the risk associated with our commodity hedging activities.\nOur asset-based power position as well as our power marketing, fuel procurement and other commodity hedging activities expose us to risks of commodity price movements. We attempt to manage this exposure through enforcement of established risk limits and risk management procedures. These risk limits and risk management procedures may not work as planned and cannot eliminate all risks associated with these activities. Even when our policies and procedures are followed, and decisions are made based on projections and estimates of future performance, results of operations may be diminished if the judgments and assumptions underlying those decisions prove to be incorrect. Factors, such as future prices and demand for power and other energy-related commodities, become more difficult to predict and the calculations become less reliable the further into the future estimates are made. As a result, we cannot fully predict the impact that our commodity hedging activities and risk management decisions may have on our business and/or financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nStrikes, work stoppages or an inability to negotiate future collective bargaining agreements on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nA majority of the employees at our facilities are subject to collective bargaining agreements with various unions. Additionally, unionization activities, including votes for union certification, could occur at the non-union generating facilities in our fleet. If union employees strike, participate in a work stoppage or slowdown or engage in other forms of labor strike or disruption, we could experience reduced power generation or outages if replacement labor is not procured. The ability to procure such replacement labor is uncertain. Strikes, work stoppages or an inability to negotiate future collective bargaining agreements\non commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nTerrorist attacks and/or cyber-attacks may result in our inability to operate and fulfill our obligations, and could result in material repair costs.\nAs a power generator, we face heightened risk of terrorism, including cyber terrorism, either by a direct act against one or more of our generating facilities or an act against the transmission and distribution infrastructure that is used to transport our power. We rely on information technology networks and systems, including third party cloud systems, to operate our generating facilities, engage in asset management activities, and process, transmit and store electronic information. Security breaches of this information technology infrastructure, including cyber-attacks and cyber terrorism, could lead to system disruptions, generating facility shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information related to our employees, vendors and counterparties, including retail counterparties.\nSystemic damage to one or more of our generating facilities and/or to the transmission and distribution infrastructure could result in our inability to operate in one or all of the markets we serve for an extended period of time. If our generating facilities are shut down, we would be unable to respond to the ISOs and RTOs or fulfill our obligations under various energy and/or capacity arrangements, resulting in lost revenues and potential fines, penalties and other liabilities. Pervasive cyber-attacks across our industry could affect the ability of ISOs and RTOs to function in some regions. The cost to restore our generating facilities after such an occurrence could be material.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Structure\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our ability in the future to raise additional capital to fund our operations. It could also expose us to the risk of increased interest rates and limit our ability to react to changes in the economy, or our industry as well as impact our cash available for distribution.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had approximately $8.6 billion of total indebtedness and approximately $8.3 billion of indebtedness net of cash. Our debt could have negative consequences for our financial condition including:\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nrequiring a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, therefore reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to enter into long-term power sales or fuel purchases which require credit support;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to fund operations or future acquisitions;\n\u2022\nrestricting our ability to make certain distributions with respect to our capital stock and the ability of our subsidiaries to make certain distributions to us, in light of restricted payment and other financial covenants in our credit facilities and other financing agreements;\n\u2022\ninhibiting the growth of our stock price;\n\u2022\nexposing us to the risk of increased interest rates because certain of our borrowings, including borrowings under our revolving credit facility, are at variable rates of interest;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital including collateral postings, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes; and\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who may have less debt.\nWe may not be successful in obtaining additional capital for these or other reasons. Furthermore, we may be unable to refinance or replace our existing indebtedness on favorable terms or at all upon the expiration or termination thereof. Our failure to obtain additional capital or enter into new or replacement financing arrangements when due may constitute a default under such existing indebtedness and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur existing credit facilities contain, and agreements we enter into in the future may contain, covenants that could restrict our financial flexibility.\nOur existing credit facilities contain covenants imposing certain requirements on our business. These requirements may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise and may adversely affect the conduct of our current business, including restricting our ability to finance future operations and capital needs and limiting our ability to engage in other business activities. These covenants could place restrictions on our ability and the ability of our operating subsidiaries\nto, among other things:\n\u2022\ndeclare or pay dividends, repurchase or redeem stock or make other distributions to stockholders;\n\u2022\nincur additional debt or issue some types of preferred shares;\n\u2022\ncreate liens;\n\u2022\nmake certain restricted investments;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nenter into any agreements which limit the ability of certain subsidiaries to make dividends or otherwise transfer cash or assets to us or certain other subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nsell or transfer assets; and\n\u2022\nconsolidate or merge.\nAgreements we enter into in the future may also have similar or more restrictive covenants. A breach of any covenant in the existing credit facilities or the agreements governing our other indebtedness would result in a default. A default, if not waived, could result in acceleration of the debt outstanding under any such agreement and in a default with respect to, and acceleration of, the debt outstanding under any other debt agreements. The accelerated debt would become due and payable immediately. If that should occur, we may not be able to make all of the required payments or borrow sufficient funds to refinance our debt obligations. Even if new financing were then available, it may not be on terms that are acceptable to us.\nOur sub-investment grade status may adversely impact our commercial operations, increase our liquidity requirements and increase the cost of refinancing opportunities. We may not have adequate liquidity to post required amounts of additional collateral.\nOur corporate family credit rating is currently below investment grade and we cannot assure you that our credit ratings will improve, or that they will not decline, in the future. Our credit ratings may affect the evaluation of our creditworthiness by trading counterparties and lenders, which could put us at a disadvantage to competitors with higher or investment grade ratings. We use a portion of our capital resources, in the form of cash, short-term investments, lien capacity and letters of credit, to satisfy these counterparty collateral demands. Our commodity agreements are tied to market pricing and may require us to post additional collateral under certain circumstances. If we are unable to reliably forecast or anticipate collateral calls or if market conditions change such that counterparties are entitled to additional collateral, our liquidity could be strained and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Factors that could trigger increased demands for collateral include changes in our credit rating or liquidity and changes in commodity prices for power and fuel, among others. Should our ratings continue at their current levels, or should our ratings be further downgraded, we would expect these negative effects to continue and, in the case of a downgrade, become more pronounced.\nIf our goodwill, amortizable intangible assets, or long-lived assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.\nWe have significant goodwill, amortizable intangible assets and long-lived assets recorded on our balance sheet. In accordance with the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles of the United States of America (\u201cGAAP\u201d), goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually. Additionally, we review goodwill, our amortizable intangible assets and long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. Factors that may be considered include a decline in future cash flows, slower growth rates in the energy industry, and a sustained decrease in the price of our common stock.\nWe have performed our annual goodwill assessment and determined that no impairment was required. Please read Critical Accounting Policies-Goodwill Impairment for further discussion. However, further goodwill impairment testing will be performed in future periods and may result in an impairment loss, which could be material. In 2017, in connection with our asset sales, we wrote off approximately $27 million of goodwill. We performed certain asset impairment analyses in 2017 and, as a result, recorded impairment charges of $148 million. Please read Note 8-Property, Plant and Equipment-Impairments for further discussion.\nIssuances or acquisitions of our common stock, or sales or dispositions of our common stock by stockholders, that result in an ownership change as defined in Internal Revenue Code (\u201cIRC\u201d) \u00a7382 could further limit our ability to use our federal net operating losses or alternative minimum tax credits to offset our future taxable income.\nIf an \u201cownership change,\u201d as defined in Section 382 of the IRC (\u201cIRC \u00a7382\u201d) occurs, the amount of NOLs and AMT credits that could be used in any one year following such ownership change could be substantially limited. In general, an \u201cownership change\u201d would occur when there is a greater than 50 percentage point increase in ownership of a company's stock by stockholders, each of which owns (or is deemed to own under IRC \u00a7382) 5 percent or more of such company's stock. Given IRC \u00a7382\u2019s broad definition, an ownership change could be the unintended consequence of otherwise normal market trading in our stock that is\noutside our control. Dynegy has already experienced two \u201cownership changes\u201d under IRC \u00a7382 that limit the use of our NOLs and AMT credits that existed at the time and prior to our emergence from bankruptcy. NOLs that have been generated subsequent to our emergence from bankruptcy are not currently subject to the limitations imposed by IRC \u00a7382. If, however, there is another \u201cownership change,\u201d the utilization of all NOLs and AMT credits existing at that time would be subject to additional annual limitations based upon a formula provided under IRC \u00a7382 that is based on the fair market value of the Company and prevailing interest rates at the time of the ownership change.\nThe effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on our business have not yet been fully analyzed and could have an adverse effect on our financial statements.\nThe TCJA, enacted on December 22, 2017, reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent. This resulted in a reduction to our net deferred tax assets with a corresponding reduction to our valuation allowance. The TCJA also repealed the corporate AMT, which resulted in a $223 million tax benefit for Dynegy related to the expected refund of our excess AMT credits.\nThe amounts discussed above are considered to be provisional as we continue to assess available tax methods and elections and refine our computations. Additionally, further regulatory guidance related to the TCJA may be issued in 2018 which could result in changes to our assessment and current estimates. We continue to analyze the TCJA and its possible effects on the Company. Any changes or clarifications to the TCJA may change our expectation on the amount of our net deferred tax assets and our expectation on the amount or timing of the AMT credit refunds.", "PERMNO": 90352, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "DYN.2"}
