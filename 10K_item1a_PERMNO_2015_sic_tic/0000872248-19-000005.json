{"cik": "872248", "company": "PETROQUEST ENERGY INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-28", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nRisks Related to Our Business, Industry and Strategy\nOur Chapter 11 proceedings may have disrupted our business and may have materially and adversely affected our operations.\nWe have attempted to minimize the adverse effect of our Chapter 11 reorganization on our relationships with our employees, suppliers, customers and other parties. Nonetheless, our relationships with our customers, suppliers, certain liquidity providers, employees and other parties may have been adversely impacted and our operations, currently and going forward, could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur Chapter 11 plan of reorganization (the \"Plan\") is based in large part upon assumptions and analyses developed by us. Our actual financial results may vary materially from the projections that we filed in connection with the Plan. If these assumptions and analyses prove to be incorrect, the Plan may be unsuccessful in its execution.\nThe Plan affects both our capital structure and the ownership, structure and operation of our business and reflects assumptions and analyses based on our experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors that we consider appropriate under the circumstances. In addition, the Plan relies upon financial projections, including with respect to revenue, EBITDA, capital expenditures, debt service and cash flow. The financial projections were prepared solely for the purpose of the bankruptcy proceedings and have not been, and will not be, updated on an ongoing basis and should not be relied upon by investors. Financial forecasts are necessarily speculative, and it is likely that one or more of the assumptions and estimates that were the basis of these financial forecasts will not be accurate. In our case, the forecasts were even more speculative than normal, because they involved fundamental changes in the nature of our capital structure. Accordingly, we expect that our actual financial condition and results of operations will differ, perhaps materially, from what we have anticipated. Consequently, there can be no assurance that the results or developments contemplated by the Plan will occur or, even if they do occur, that they will have the anticipated effects on us and our subsidiaries or our business or operations. The failure of any such results or developments to materialize as anticipated could materially adversely affect the successful execution of the Plan.\nOur historical financial information may not be indicative of our future financial performance.\nOn February 8, 2019, the effective date of our emergence from bankruptcy, we expect to adopt fresh start accounting and in accordance with the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification No. 852 - Reorganizations, we anticipate applying fresh start accounting in our financial statements commencing with our financial statements as of and for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2019. We expect that this will impact materially our 2019 operating results, as certain pre-bankruptcy debts were discharged in accordance with the Plan immediately prior to our emergence from bankruptcy, and our assets and liabilities were adjusted to their fair values upon emergence. Accordingly, our financial condition and results of operations following our emergence from Chapter 11 will not be comparable to the financial condition and results of operations reflected in our historical financial statements. Further, as a result of the implementation of the Plan and the transactions contemplated thereby, our historical financial information may not be indicative of our future financial performance.\nUpon our emergence from bankruptcy, the composition of our board of directors changed significantly.\nUnder the Plan, the composition of our board of directors changed significantly. All of our board members, other than Charles T. Goodson, are new to the Company. Our new directors have different backgrounds, experiences and perspectives from those individuals who previously served on the board and, thus, may have different views on the issues that will determine the future of the Company. As a result, the future strategy and plans of the Company may differ materially from those of the past.\n#20#\nThe ability to attract and retain key personnel is critical to the success of our business and may be affected by our emergence from bankruptcy.\nThe success of our business depends on key personnel. Our operations are dependent upon a diverse group of key senior management. In addition, we employ numerous other skilled technical personnel, including geologists, geophysicists and engineers that are essential to our operations. The ability to attract and retain these key personnel may be difficult in light of our emergence from bankruptcy, the uncertainties currently facing the business and changes we may make to the organizational structure to adjust to changing circumstances. We may need to enter into retention or other arrangements that could be costly to maintain. If executives, managers or other key personnel resign, retire or are terminated, or their service is otherwise interrupted, we may not be able to replace them in a timely manner and we could experience significant declines in productivity.\nThe carrying value of our oil and natural gas assets is expected to be restated under fresh start accounting upon our emergence from bankruptcy. The restated amount could exceed the full cost ceiling limit at March 31, 2019, which would result in a ceiling test write-down.\nAs a result of our reorganization under Chapter 11 and subsequent emergence from bankruptcy on February 8, 2019, we expect to apply fresh start accounting to our balance sheet which results in the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties being restated based on their fair value. We are still in the process of estimating the fair value. It is possible that our estimate of the fair value of our oil and natural gas properties utilized as the fresh start opening balance upon our emergence from bankruptcy could result in the carrying value exceeding the full cost ceiling limit at March 31, 2019, which would require us to record a ceiling test write-down.\nOil and natural gas prices are volatile and an extended decline in the prices of oil and natural gas would likely have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity, ability to meet our financial obligations and results of operations.\nOur future financial condition, revenues, results of operations, profitability and future growth, and the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties depend primarily on the prices we receive for our oil and natural gas production. Our ability to maintain or increase our borrowing capacity and to obtain additional capital on attractive terms also substantially depends upon oil and natural gas prices. These markets will likely continue to be volatile in the future. The prices we will receive for our production, and the levels of our production, will depend on numerous factors beyond our control.\nThese factors include:\n\u2022\nrelatively minor changes in the supply of or the demand for oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nthe condition of the United States and worldwide economies;\n\u2022\nthe level of global exploration and production;\n\u2022\nthe level of global inventories;\n\u2022\nmarket uncertainty;\n\u2022\nthe level of consumer product demand;\n\u2022\nprevailing prices on local price indices in the areas in which we operate;\n\u2022\nthe proximity, capacity, cost and availability of gathering and transportation facilities;\n\u2022\nweather conditions in the United States, such as hurricanes;\n\u2022\ntechnological advances affecting energy companies;\n\u2022\nthe actions of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries;\n\u2022\ndomestic and foreign governmental regulation and taxes, including price controls adopted by the FERC;\n\u2022\npolitical conditions or hostilities in oil and natural gas producing regions, including the Middle East, Africa, South America and Russia;\n\u2022\nthe effect of worldwide energy conservation and environmental protection efforts;\n\u2022\nshareholder activism and activities by non-governmental organizations to restrict the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas so as to minimize emissions of greenhouse gas;\n\u2022\nthe price and level of foreign imports of oil and natural gas; and\n#21#\n\u2022\nthe price and availability of alternate energy sources.\nWe cannot predict future oil and natural gas prices and such prices may decline further. The extended decline in oil and natural gas prices has, and may continue to, adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity, ability to meet our financial obligations and results of operations. Lower prices have reduced and may further reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically and has required and may require us to record additional ceiling test write-downs and may cause our estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2019 to decline compared to our estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2018. Substantially all of our oil and natural gas sales are made in the spot market or pursuant to contracts based on spot market prices.\nOur sales are not made pursuant to long-term fixed price contracts. To attempt to reduce our price risk, we periodically enter into hedging transactions with respect to a portion of our expected future production; however in the current commodity price market, our ability to enter into effective hedging transactions may be limited. We cannot assure you that we can enter into effective hedging transactions in the future or that such transactions will reduce the risk or minimize the effect of any decline in oil or natural gas prices. Any substantial or extended decline in the prices of or demand for oil or natural gas would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity, ability to meet our financial obligations and results of operations.\nOur outstanding indebtedness may adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to operate our business, remain in compliance with debt covenants and make payments on our debt.\nThe aggregate principal amount of our outstanding indebtedness as of February 8, 2019 is $130 million. We currently have no additional availability under the Exit Facility. We may incur additional indebtedness in the future. Our high level of debt could have important consequences for you, including the following:\n\u2022\nit may be more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our outstanding indebtedness, including amounts borrowed under the Exit Facility and our 2024 PIK Notes, and any failure to comply with the obligations of any of our debt agreements, including financial and other restrictive covenants, could result in an event of default under the agreements governing such indebtedness;\n\u2022\nthe covenants contained in our debt agreements limit our ability to borrow money in the future for acquisitions, capital expenditures or to meet our operating expenses or other general corporate obligations and may limit our flexibility in operating our business;\n\u2022\nwe will need to use a portion of our cash flows to pay interest on our debt, including approximately $3.9 million in 2019 for interest on amounts borrowed under the Exit Facility, which will reduce the amount of money we have for operations, capital expenditures, expansion, acquisitions or general corporate or other business activities;\n\u2022\nwe may have a higher level of debt than some of our competitors, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage;\n\u2022\nour 2024 PIK Notes will increase our debt level at each semi-annual interest payment date if we elect not to pay the interest in cash;\n\u2022\nwe may be more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our industry or the economy in general, especially extended or further declines in oil and natural gas prices; and\n\u2022\nour debt level could limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate.\nOur ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors. We will not be able to control many of these factors, such as economic conditions and governmental regulation. We cannot be certain that our cash flow from operations will be sufficient to allow us to pay the principal and interest on our debt, including amounts borrowed under the Exit Facility, and meet our other obligations. If we do not have enough cash to service our debt, we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt, including amounts borrowed under the Exit Facility, sell assets, borrow more money or raise equity. We may not be able to refinance our debt, sell assets, borrow more money or raise equity on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nTo service our indebtedness, we will require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control, and any failure to meet our debt obligations could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, including amounts borrowed under the Exit Facility, and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future. To a certain extent, this is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory conditions and other factors that are beyond our control, including the prices that we receive for our oil and natural gas production.\n#22#\nWe cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay principal and interest on our indebtedness, including amounts borrowed under the Exit Facility, or to fund our other liquidity needs. If our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt obligations, we may be forced to reduce our planned capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional equity or debt capital or restructure our debt. We cannot assure you that any of these remedies could, if necessary, be affected on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. In addition, any failure to make scheduled payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness on acceptable terms. Our cash flow and capital resources may be insufficient for payment of interest on and principal of our debt in the future, including amounts borrowed under the Exit Facility, and any such alternative measures may be unsuccessful or may not permit us to meet scheduled debt service obligations, which could cause us to default on our obligations and could impair our liquidity.\nWe may not be able to obtain adequate financing when the need arises to execute our long-term operating strategy.\nOur ability to execute our long-term operating strategy is highly dependent on having access to capital when the need arises. We historically have addressed our long-term liquidity needs through bank credit facilities, second lien term credit facilities, issuances of equity and debt securities, sales of assets, joint ventures and cash provided by operating activities. We will examine the following alternative sources of long-term capital as dictated by current economic conditions:\n\u2022\nborrowings from banks or other lenders;\n\u2022\nthe sale of certain assets;\n\u2022\nthe issuance of debt securities;\n\u2022\nthe sale of common stock, preferred stock or other equity securities;\n\u2022\njoint venture financing; and\n\u2022\nproduction payments.\nThe availability of these sources of capital when the need arises will depend upon a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include general economic and financial market conditions, oil and natural gas prices, our credit ratings, interest rates, market perceptions of us or the oil and gas industry, our market value and our operating performance. We may be unable to execute our long-term operating strategy if we cannot obtain capital from these sources when the need arises.\nOur failure to comply with a significant financial ratio under the Exit Facility may require us to repay borrowings or be in default thereunder.\nUnder the terms of the Exit Facility, we may not permit or allow the ratio of (i) the present value, discounted at 10% per annum, of the estimated future net revenues in respect of our oil and gas properties, before any state, federal, foreign or other income taxes, attributable to total proved reserves, using three-year strip prices then in effect at the end of each calendar quarter, including swap agreements in place at the end of each quarter, to (ii) the sum of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the term loans thereunder to be less than 1.5 to 1.0 as measured on the last day of each calendar quarter. We may not be able to comply with this restrictive financial ratio in the future and, as a result, we may either (i) prepay the outstanding term loans such that after giving effect to such prepayment, the financial covenant is met or (ii) be in default under the Exit Facility, in which case the term loans and all other amounts owed pursuant to the Exit Facility would become immediately due and payable. If that should occur, we may not be able to pay all such debt or borrow funds sufficient to refinance it. An event of default under the Exit Facility, if not cured or waived, could result in an event of default under the 2024 PIK Notes.\nRestrictive debt covenants could limit our growth and our ability to finance our operations, fund our capital needs, respond to changing conditions and engage in other business activities that may be in our best interests.\nThe Exit Facility and the indenture governing our 2024 PIK Notes contain a number of significant covenants that, among other things, restrict or limit our ability to:\n\u2022\npay dividends or distributions on our capital stock or issue preferred stock;\n\u2022\nrepurchase, redeem or retire our capital stock or subordinated debt;\n\u2022\nmake certain loans and investments;\n\u2022\nplace restrictions on the ability of subsidiaries to make distributions;\n\u2022\nsell assets, including the capital stock of subsidiaries;\n#23#\n\u2022\nenter into certain transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\ncreate or assume certain liens on our assets;\n\u2022\nenter into sale and leaseback transactions;\n\u2022\nmerge or enter into other business combination transactions;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions that would result in a change of control of us; or\n\u2022\nengage in other corporate activities.\nAlso, the Exit Facility requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios and satisfy certain financial condition tests. Our ability to comply with these ratios and financial condition tests may be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will meet these ratios and financial condition tests.\nFurther, these financial ratio restrictions and financial condition tests could limit our ability to obtain future financings, make needed capital expenditures, withstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general or otherwise conduct necessary corporate activities. We may also be prevented from taking advantage of business opportunities that arise because of the limitations that the restrictive covenants under the Exit Facility and the indenture governing our 2024 PIK Notes impose on us.\nA breach of any of these covenants or our inability to comply with the required financial ratios or financial condition tests could result in a default under the Exit Facility and the 2024 PIK Notes. A default, if not cured or waived, could result in all indebtedness outstanding under the Exit Facility and the 2024 PIK Notes to become immediately due and payable. If that should occur, we may not be able to pay all such debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it. Even if new financing were then available, it may not be on terms that are acceptable to us. If we were unable to repay those amounts, the lenders could accelerate the maturity of the debt or proceed against any collateral granted to them to secure such defaulted debt.\nWe may be able to incur substantially more debt, which could exacerbate the risks associated with our indebtedness.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. Although covenants under the Exit Facility and the indenture governing our 2024 PIK Notes will limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be significant. Our 2024 PIK Notes will increase our debt level at each semi-annual interest payment date if we elect not to pay the interest in cash.\nIf new debt is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we and our subsidiaries now face could intensify. Any of these risks could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, business prospects and ability to satisfy our obligations under our outstanding indebtedness.\nA financial downturn or negative credit market conditions may have lasting effects on our liquidity, business and financial condition that we cannot predict.\nLiquidity is essential to our business. Our liquidity could be substantially negatively affected by an inability to obtain capital in the long-term or short-term debt capital markets or equity capital markets or an inability to access bank or other financing. A prolonged credit crisis or turmoil in the domestic or global financial systems could materially affect our liquidity, business and financial condition. These conditions have adversely impacted financial markets previously and created substantial volatility and uncertainty, and could do so again, with the related negative impact on global economic activity and the financial markets. A weak economic environment could also adversely affect the collectability of our trade receivables or performance by our suppliers and cause our commodity derivative arrangements to be ineffective if our counterparties are unable to perform their obligations or seek bankruptcy protection. Additionally, negative economic conditions could lead to reduced demand for oil, natural gas and NGLs or lower prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs, which could have a negative impact on our revenues.\nWe may be responsible for offshore decommissioning liabilities for offshore interests we no longer own.\nUnder state and federal law, oil and gas companies are obligated to plug and abandon a well and restore the lease to pre-operating conditions after operations cease. Federal regulations allow in certain circumstances the government to call upon predecessors in interest of oil and gas leases to pay for plugging and abandonment, restoration and decommissioning obligations if the current operator fails to fulfill those obligations, which can be very significant. In January 2018, we completed a strategic shift from offshore Gulf of Mexico operations to onshore operations when we sold our remaining Gulf of Mexico assets. In connection with the divestiture of our Gulf of Mexico assets, we entered into various arrangements with the purchasers whereby the purchasers assumed our plugging and abandonment liabilities and other liabilities related to decommissioning such Gulf of Mexico assets. If purchasers of our former Gulf of Mexico assets, or any successor owners of those assets, are unable to meet their\n#24#\nplugging and abandonment and other decommissioning obligations due to bankruptcy, dissolution or other related liquidity issues, we may be unable to rely on our arrangements with them to fulfill (or provide reimbursement for) those obligations. In those circumstances, the Federal government may seek to impose the purchasers' or other successors' plugging and abandonment obligations on us and any other predecessors in interest. Such payments could be significant and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nMoreover, recent changes to the BOEM\u2019s supplemental bonding requirements have the potential to adversely impact the financial condition of operators in the Gulf of Mexico and increase the number of operators seeking bankruptcy protection, given the current pricing of commodities. In July 2016, BOEM issued a Notice to Lessees and Operators (NTL) that augments requirements for the posting of additional financial assurance by offshore lessees, among others, to assure that sufficient funds are available to perform decommissioning obligations with respect to offshore wells, platforms, pipelines and other facilities. The NTL, which became effective in September 2016, eliminates the agency\u2019s past practice of waiving supplemental bonding obligations where a company could demonstrate a certain level of financial strength. Instead, BOEM will allow companies to \"self-insure,\" but only up to 10% of a company\u2019s \"tangible net worth,\" which is defined as the difference between a company\u2019s total assets and the value of all liabilities and intangible assets.\nThe NTL provides new procedures for how BOEM determines a lessee\u2019s decommissioning obligations, and the agency continues to negotiate with offshore operators to post additional financial assurance and develop tailored plans to meet BOEM\u2019s revised estimates for offshore decommissioning obligations. Projected decommissioning costs of operations in the Gulf of Mexico continue to increase, and the volatile price of oil and gas has adversely affected the net worth of many operators. BOEM\u2019s revisions to its supplemental bonding process could result in demands for the posting of increased financial assurance by the entities to whom we divested our Gulf of Mexico assets as well as other operators in the Gulf of Mexico. This will force operators to obtain surety bonds or other forms of financial assurance, the costs of which could be significant. Moreover, BOEM\u2019s NTL is likely to result in the loss of supplemental bonding waivers for a large number of operators on the OCS, which will in turn force these operators to seek additional surety bonds and could, consequently, exceed the surety bond market\u2019s ability to provide such additional financial assurance. Operators who have already leveraged their assets as a result of the volatile commodities market could face difficulty obtaining surety bonds because of concerns the surety may have about the priority of their lien on the operators' collateral. Consequently, BOEM\u2019s changes could result in additional operators in the Gulf of Mexico initiating bankruptcy proceedings, which in turn could result in the government seeking to impose plugging and abandonment costs on predecessors in interest in the event that the current operator cannot meet its plugging and abandonment obligations. As a result, we could find ourselves liable to pay for the plugging and abandonment costs of any entity we divested our Gulf of Mexico assets to, which payments could be significant and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur future success depends upon our ability to find, develop, produce and acquire additional oil and natural gas reserves that are economically recoverable.\nAs is generally the case in the Gulf Coast Basin where approximately 44% of our current production is located, many of our producing properties are characterized by a high initial production rate, followed by a steep decline in production. In order to maintain or increase our reserves, we must constantly locate and develop or acquire new oil and natural gas reserves to replace those being depleted by production. We must do this even during periods of low oil and natural gas prices when it is difficult to raise the capital necessary to finance our exploration, development and acquisition activities. Without successful exploration, development or acquisition activities, our reserves and revenues will decline rapidly. We may not be able to find and develop or acquire additional reserves at an acceptable cost or have access to necessary financing for these activities, either of which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nApproximately 44% of our production is exposed to the additional risk of severe weather, including hurricanes and tropical storms, as well as flooding, coastal erosion and sea level rise.\nAt December 31, 2018 approximately 44% of our production and approximately 6% of our estimated proved reserves are located along the Gulf Coast Basin. Operations in this area are subject to severe weather, including hurricanes and tropical storms, as well as flooding, coastal erosion and sea level rise. Some of these adverse conditions can be severe enough to cause substantial damage to facilities and possibly interrupt production. For example, certain of our Gulf Coast Basin properties have experienced damages and production downtime as a result of past storms including Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, Gustav and Ike. In addition, according to certain scientific studies, emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and other gases commonly known as greenhouse gases may be contributing to global warming of the earth's atmosphere and to global climate change, which may exacerbate the severity of these adverse conditions. As a result, such conditions may pose increased climate-related risks to our assets and operations.\nIn accordance with customary industry practices, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks; however, losses could occur for uninsured risks or in amounts in excess of existing insurance coverage. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable or that any particular types of coverage will\n#25#\nbe available. An event that is not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nOur development and exploratory drilling efforts and our well operations may not be profitable or achieve our targeted returns.\nWe have acquired significant amounts of unproved property in order to further our development efforts and expect to continue to undertake acquisitions in the future. Development and exploratory drilling and production activities are subject to many risks, including the risk that no commercially productive reservoirs will be discovered. We acquire unproved properties and lease undeveloped acreage that we believe will enhance our growth potential and increase our results of operations over time. However, we cannot assure you that all prospects will be economically viable or that we will not abandon our investments. Additionally, we cannot assure you that unproved property acquired by us or undeveloped acreage leased by us will be profitably developed, that wells drilled by us in prospects that we pursue will be productive or that we will recover all or any portion of our investment in such unproved property or wells.\nApproximately 58% of our net leasehold acreage is undeveloped, and that acreage may not ultimately be developed or become commercially productive, which could cause us to lose rights under our leases as well as have a material adverse effect on our oil and natural gas reserves and future production and, therefore, our future cash flow and income.\nAs of December 31, 2018, approximately 58% of our net leasehold acreage was undeveloped, or acreage on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial quantities of oil and natural gas regardless of whether such acreage contains proved reserves. Unless production is established on the undeveloped acreage covered by our leases, such leases will expire. Our future oil and natural gas reserves and production and, therefore, our future cash flow and income are highly dependent on successfully developing our undeveloped leasehold acreage.\nSEC rules could limit our ability to book additional proved undeveloped reserves or require us to write down our proved undeveloped reserves.\nSEC rules require that, subject to limited exceptions, proved undeveloped reserves may only be booked if they relate to wells scheduled to be drilled within five years of the date of booking. This requirement may limit our potential to book additional proved undeveloped reserves as we pursue our drilling program. Moreover, we may be required to write down our proved undeveloped reserves if we do not develop those reserves within the required five-year time frame.\nOur actual production, revenues and expenditures related to our reserves are likely to differ from our estimates of proved reserves. We may experience production that is less than estimated and drilling costs that are greater than estimated in our reserve report. These differences may be material.\nAlthough the estimates of our oil and natural gas reserves and future net cash flows attributable to those reserves were prepared by Ryder Scott Company, L.P., our independent petroleum and geological engineers, we are ultimately responsible for the disclosure of those estimates. Reserve engineering is a complex and subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner. Estimates of economically recoverable oil and natural gas reserves and of future net cash flows necessarily depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions, including:\n\u2022\nhistorical production from the area compared with production from other similar producing wells;\n\u2022\nthe assumed effects of regulations by governmental agencies;\n\u2022\nassumptions concerning future oil and natural gas prices; and\n\u2022\nassumptions concerning future operating costs, severance and excise taxes, development costs and work-over and remedial costs.\nBecause all reserve estimates are to some degree subjective, each of the following items may differ materially from those assumed in estimating proved reserves:\n\u2022\nthe quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered;\n\u2022\nthe production and operating costs incurred;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of future development expenditures; and\n\u2022\nfuture oil and natural gas sales prices.\nFurthermore, different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserves and cash flows based on the same available data. Historically, the difference between our actual production and the production estimated in a prior year's reserve report has not been material. However, our 2018 production, excluding the impact of asset sales and the results from successful\n#26#\nexploration wells which are not included in the prior year reserve report, was approximately 14% lower than amounts projected in our 2017 reserve report. We cannot assure you that these differences will not again be material in the future.\nApproximately 53% of our estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2018 are undeveloped and 1% were developed, non-producing. Recovery of undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations. The reserve data assumes that we will make significant capital expenditures to develop and produce our reserves. Although we have prepared estimates of our oil and natural gas reserves and the costs associated with these reserves in accordance with industry standards, we cannot assure you that the estimated costs are accurate, that the development will occur as scheduled or that the actual results will be as estimated. In addition, the recovery of certain developed non-producing reserves is generally subject to the approval of development plans and related activities by applicable state and/or federal agencies. Statutes and regulations may affect both the timing and quantity of recovery of estimated reserves. Such statutes and regulations, and their enforcement, have changed in the past and may change in the future, and may result in upward or downward revisions to current estimated proved reserves.\nYou should not assume that the standardized measure of discounted cash flows is the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves. In accordance with SEC requirements, the standardized measure of discounted cash flows from proved reserves at December 31, 2018 are based on twelve-month, first day of month, average prices and costs as of the date of the estimate. These prices and costs will change and may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the date of the estimate. Any changes in consumption by oil and natural gas purchasers or in governmental regulations or taxation may also affect actual future net cash flows. The actual timing of development activities, including related production and expenses, will affect the timing of future net cash flows and any differences between estimated development timing and actual could have a material effect on standardized measure. In addition, the 10% discount factor we use when calculating standardized measure of discounted cash flows for reporting requirements in compliance with accounting requirements is not necessarily the most appropriate discount factor. The effective interest rate at various times and the risks associated with our operations or the oil and natural gas industry in general will affect the accuracy of the 10% discount factor.\nWe may be unable to successfully identify, execute or effectively integrate future acquisitions, which may negatively affect our results of operations.\nAcquisitions of oil and gas businesses and properties have been an important element of our business, and we may continue to pursue acquisitions in the future. In the last several years, we have pursued and consummated acquisitions that have provided us opportunities to grow our production and reserves. Although we regularly engage in discussions with, and submit proposals to, acquisition candidates, suitable acquisitions may not be available in the future on reasonable terms. If we do identify an appropriate acquisition candidate, we may be unable to successfully negotiate the terms of an acquisition, finance the acquisition or, if the acquisition occurs, effectively integrate the acquired business into our existing business. Negotiations of potential acquisitions and the integration of acquired business operations may require a disproportionate amount of management's attention and our resources. Even if we complete additional acquisitions, continued acquisition financing may not be available or available on reasonable terms, any new businesses may not generate revenues comparable to our existing business, the anticipated cost efficiencies or synergies may not be realized and these businesses may not be integrated successfully or operated profitably. The success of any acquisition will depend on a number of factors, including the ability to estimate accurately the recoverable volumes of reserves, rates of future production and future net revenues attainable from the reserves and to assess possible environmental liabilities. Our inability to successfully identify, execute or effectively integrate future acquisitions may negatively affect our results of operations.\nEven though we perform due diligence reviews (including a review of title and other records) of the major properties we seek to acquire that we believe is consistent with industry practices, these reviews are inherently incomplete. It is generally not feasible for us to perform an in-depth review of every individual property and all records involved in each acquisition. However, even an in-depth review of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems or permit us to become familiar enough with the properties to assess fully their deficiencies and potential. Even when problems are identified, we may assume certain environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with the acquired businesses and properties. The discovery of any material liabilities associated with our acquisitions could harm our results of operations.\nIn addition, acquisitions of businesses may require additional debt or equity financing, resulting in additional leverage or dilution of ownership. Our Exit Facility and the indenture governing our 2024 PIK Notes contain certain covenants that limit, or which may have the effect of limiting, among other things, acquisitions, capital expenditures, the sale of assets and the incurrence of additional indebtedness.\n#27#\nLosses and liabilities from uninsured or underinsured drilling and operating activities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations.\nWe maintain several types of insurance to cover our operations, including worker's compensation, maritime employer's liability and comprehensive general liability. Amounts over base coverages are provided by primary and excess umbrella liability policies. We also maintain operator's extra expense coverage, which covers the control of drilling or producing wells as well as redrilling expenses and pollution coverage for wells out of control.\nWe may not be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable, or we could experience losses that are not insured or that exceed the maximum limits under our insurance policies. If a significant event that is not fully insured or indemnified occurs, it could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nLower oil and natural gas prices may cause us to record ceiling test write-downs, which could negatively impact our results of operations.\nWe use the full cost method of accounting to account for our oil and natural gas operations. Accordingly, we capitalize the cost to acquire, explore for and develop oil and natural gas properties. Under full cost accounting rules, the net capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties may not exceed a \u201cfull cost ceiling\u201d which is based upon the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves, including the effect of hedges in place, discounted at 10%, plus the lower of cost or fair market value of unproved properties. If at the end of any fiscal period we determine that the net capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties exceed the full cost ceiling, we must charge the amount of the excess to earnings in the period then ended. This is called a \u201cceiling test write-down.\u201d This charge does not impact cash flow from operating activities, but does reduce our net income and stockholders' equity. Once incurred, a write-down of oil and natural gas properties is not reversible at a later date.\nWe review the net capitalized costs of our properties quarterly, using a single price based on the twelve-month, first day of month, average price of oil and natural gas for the prior 12 months. We also assess investments in unevaluated properties periodically to determine whether impairment has occurred. The risk that we will be required to recognize further write downs of the carrying value of our oil and gas properties increases when oil and natural gas prices are low or volatile. In addition, write-downs may occur if we experience substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves or our unevaluated property values, or if estimated future development costs increase. We did not incur a ceiling test write-down during the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017. See the risk factor \"The carrying value of our oil and natural gas assets is expected to be restated under fresh start accounting upon our emergence from bankruptcy. The restated amount could exceed the full cost ceiling limit at March 31, 2019, which would result in a ceiling test write-down\" above for a discussion regarding the possible effect fresh start accounting could have on our potential to record a ceiling-test writedown in the first quarter of 2019.\nFactors beyond our control affect our ability to market oil and natural gas.\nThe availability of markets and the volatility of product prices are beyond our control and represent a significant risk. The marketability of our production depends upon the availability and capacity of natural gas gathering systems, pipelines and processing facilities. The unavailability or lack of capacity of these systems and facilities could result in the shut-in of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of development plans for properties. Our ability to market oil and natural gas also depends on other factors beyond our control. These factors include:\n\u2022\nthe level of domestic production and imports of oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nthe proximity of natural gas production to natural gas pipelines;\n\u2022\nthe availability of pipeline capacity;\n\u2022\nthe demand for oil and natural gas by utilities and other end users;\n\u2022\nthe availability of alternate energy sources;\n\u2022\nthe effect of inclement weather, such as hurricanes;\n\u2022\nstate and federal regulation of oil and natural gas marketing; and\n\u2022\nfederal regulation of natural gas sold or transported in interstate commerce.\nIf these factors were to change dramatically, our ability to market oil and natural gas or obtain favorable prices for our oil and natural gas could be adversely affected.\n#28#\nFederal and state legislation and regulatory initiatives relating to oil and natural gas development and hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays.\nHydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into rock formations to enhance oil and natural gas production. Hydraulic fracturing using fluids other than diesel is currently exempt from regulation under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act, but opponents of hydraulic fracturing have called for further study of the technique's environmental effects and, in some cases, further regulation of the technique under various federal and state authorities. A number of states, including Louisiana and Texas, have required operators or service companies to disclose chemical components in fluids used for hydraulic fracturing and some states have imposed bans or moratoria on new natural gas development or the use of hydraulic fracturing. Further regulation may include, among other things, additional permitting requirements, enhanced reporting obligations, and stricter standards for discharges and emissions associated with gas production, storage and transport. The future of such regulation is controversial and uncertain. Such requirements, if imposed, would be expected to increase the cost of natural gas production.\nRecent seismic events have been observed in some areas (including Texas) where hydraulic fracturing has taken place. Some scientists believe the increased seismic activity may result from deep well fluid injection associated with use of hydraulic fracturing. Additional regulatory measures designed to minimize or avoid damage to geologic formations have been imposed in states, including Texas, to address such concerns.\nConcerns regarding climate change have led the Congress, various states and environmental agencies to consider a number of initiatives to restrict or regulate emissions of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane. Stricter regulations of greenhouse gases could require us to incur costs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases associated with our operations, or could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas we produce. In addition, climate change that results in physical effects such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods and other climatic events, could disrupt our exploration and production operations and cause us to incur significant costs in preparing for and responding to those effects.\nAlthough it is not possible at this time to predict any additional federal, state or local legislation or regulation regarding hydraulic fracturing, management of drilling fluids, stricter emission standards, well integrity requirements or climate change, federal or state restrictions imposed on oil and gas exploration and production activities in areas in which we conduct business could significantly increase our operating, capital and compliance costs as well as delay our ability to develop oil and natural gas reserves. In addition to increased regulation of our business, we may also experience an increase in litigation seeking damages as a result of heightened public concerns related to air quality, water quality, and other environmental impacts.\nThe adoption of derivatives legislation by Congress, and implementation of that legislation by federal agencies, could have an adverse impact on our ability to mitigate risks associated with our business.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d), which was passed by the U.S. Congress and signed into law in July 2010, provides for statutory and regulatory requirements for derivative transactions, including crude oil and natural gas derivative transactions. Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act provides for the creation of position limits for certain derivatives transactions, as well as requiring certain transactions to be cleared on exchanges for which cash collateral will be required. The Dodd-Frank Act requires Commodities Futures and Trading Commission, (the \u201cCFTC\u201d), and the SEC and other regulators to promulgate rules and regulations implementing the Dodd-Frank Act. The CFTC has re-proposed rules that would place limits on positions in certain core futures and equivalent swaps contracts for or linked to certain physical commodities, subject to exceptions for certain bona fide hedging transactions. As these new position limit rules are not yet final, the impact of those provisions on us is uncertain at this time.\nIt is not possible at this time to predict with certainty the full effect of the Dodd-Frank Act and CFTC rules on us and the timing of such effects. The Dodd-Frank Act may require us to comply with margin requirements and with certain clearing and trade-execution requirements if we do not satisfy certain specific exceptions. Although we expect to qualify for the end-user exception to the clearing, trade execution and margin requirements for swaps entered to hedge our commodity risks, the application of the requirements to other market participants, such as swap dealers, may change the cost and availability of our derivatives. Depending on the rules adopted by the CFTC or similar rules that may be adopted by other regulatory bodies, we might in the future be required to provide cash collateral for our commodities derivative transactions under circumstances in which we do not currently post cash collateral. Posting of such additional cash collateral could therefore reduce our ability to execute transactions to reduce commodity price risk and thus protect cash flows.\nThe full impact of the Dodd-Frank Act and related regulatory requirements upon our business will not be known until all of the regulations are implemented. If we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and regulations, our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act was intended, in part, to reduce the volatility of crude oil and natural gas prices, which some legislators attributed to speculative trading\n#29#\nin derivatives and commodity instruments related to crude oil and natural gas. Our revenues could therefore be adversely affected if a consequence of the Dodd-Frank Act and regulations is to lower commodity prices.\nIn addition, the European Union and other non-U.S. jurisdictions are implementing regulations with respect to the derivatives market. To the extent we transact with counterparties in foreign jurisdictions, we may become subject to such regulations. At this time, the impact of such regulations is not clear.\nCertain federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and development may be eliminated as a result of future legislation.\nIn past years, legislation has been proposed that would, if enacted into law, make significant changes to U.S. tax laws, including to certain key U.S. federal income tax provisions currently available to oil and gas companies. Although none of these changes were included in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, future adverse changes could include, but are not limited to, (i) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and gas properties, (ii) the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs, and (iii) an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. Congress could consider, and could include, some or all of these proposals as part of future tax reform legislation. The passage of any legislation as a result of these proposals or any similar changes in U.S. federal income tax laws could eliminate or postpone certain tax deductions that currently are available with respect to oil and gas development, or increase costs, and any such changes could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe face strong competition from larger oil and natural gas companies that may negatively affect our ability to carry on operations.\nWe operate in the highly competitive areas of oil and natural gas exploration, development and production. Factors that affect our ability to compete successfully in the marketplace include:\n\u2022\nthe availability of funds and information relating to a property;\n\u2022\nthe standards established by us for the minimum projected return on investment; and\n\u2022\nthe transportation of natural gas.\nOur competitors include major integrated oil companies, substantial independent energy companies, affiliates of major interstate and intrastate pipelines and national and local natural gas gatherers, many of which possess greater financial and other resources than we do. If we are unable to successfully compete against our competitors, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nOperating hazards may adversely affect our ability to conduct business.\nOur operations are subject to risks inherent in the oil and natural gas industry, such as:\n\u2022\nunexpected drilling conditions including blowouts, cratering and explosions;\n\u2022\nuncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas or well fluids;\n\u2022\nequipment failures, fires or accidents;\n\u2022\npollution and other environmental risks; and\n\u2022\nshortages in experienced labor or shortages or delays in the delivery of equipment.\nThese risks could result in substantial losses to us from injury and loss of life, damage to and destruction of property and equipment, pollution and other environmental damage and suspension of operations. Our Gulf Coast Basin operations are also subject to a variety of operating risks peculiar to the marine environment, such as hurricanes or other adverse weather conditions and more extensive governmental regulation.\nEnvironmental compliance costs and environmental liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations.\nOur operations are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. These laws and regulations may:\n\u2022\nrequire the acquisition of permits before drilling commences;\n\u2022\nrestrict the types, quantities and concentration of various substances that can be released into the environment from drilling and production activities;\n#30#\n\u2022\nlimit or prohibit drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas;\n\u2022\nrequire remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former operations, such as plugging abandoned wells; and\n\u2022\nimpose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations.\nStricter requirements and standards may be imposed in future environmental legislation and regulation. Our drilling plans may be affected as a result of new or modified environmental requirements. The enactment of stricter legislation or the adoption of stricter regulations could have a significant impact on our operating costs, as well as on the oil and natural gas industry in general.\nOur operations could result in liability for personal injuries, property damage, oil spills, discharge of hazardous materials, remediation and clean-up costs and other environmental damages. We could also be liable for environmental damages caused by previous property owners. As a result, substantial liabilities to third parties or governmental entities may be incurred which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We maintain insurance coverage for our operations, including limited coverage for sudden and accidental environmental damages, but this insurance may not extend to the full potential liability that could be caused by sudden and accidental environmental damages nor continue to be available in the future, and if available, may not cover environmental damages that occur over time. Accordingly, we may be subject to liability or may lose the ability to continue exploration or production activities upon substantial portions of our properties if certain environmental damages occur.\nOur business could be negatively affected by security threats, including cybersecurity threats, destructive forms of protest and opposition by activists and other disruptions.\nAs an oil and natural gas producer, we face various security threats, including cybersecurity threats to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information, to misappropriate financial assets or to render data or systems unusable; threats to the security of our facilities and infrastructure or third party facilities and infrastructure, such as processing plants and pipelines; and threats from terrorist acts. The potential for such security threats has subjected our operations to increased risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business. In particular, our implementation of various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate security threats and to increase security for our information, facilities and infrastructure may result in increased capital and operating costs. Moreover, there can be no assurance that such procedures and controls will be sufficient to prevent security breaches from occurring. If any of these security breaches were to occur, they could lead to losses of financial assets, sensitive information, critical infrastructure or capabilities essential to our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Cybersecurity attacks in particular are becoming more sophisticated and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and systems, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information, and corruption of data. These events could lead to financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability. In addition, destructive forms of protest and opposition by activists and other disruptions, including acts of sabotage or eco-terrorism, against oil and gas production and activities could potentially result in damage or injury to people, property or the environment or lead to extended interruptions of our operations, adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operations.\nLoss of our information and computer systems could adversely affect our business.\nWe are heavily dependent on our information systems and computer based programs, including our well operations information, seismic data, electronic data processing and accounting data. If any of such programs or systems were to fail or create erroneous information in our hardware or software network infrastructure, possible consequences include our loss of communication links, inability to find, produce, process and sell oil and natural gas and inability to automatically process commercial transactions or engage in similar automated or computerized business activities. Any such consequence could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nA terrorist attack or armed conflict could harm our business.\nTerrorist activities, anti-terrorist efforts and other armed conflicts involving the United States or other countries may adversely affect the United States and global economies and could prevent us from meeting our financial and other obligations. If any of these events occur, the resulting political instability and societal disruption could reduce overall demand for oil and natural gas, potentially putting downward pressure on demand for our production and causing a reduction in our revenues. Oil and natural gas related facilities could be direct targets of terrorist attacks, and our operations could be adversely impacted if infrastructure integral to our customers' operations is destroyed or damaged. Costs for insurance and other security may increase as a result of these threats, and some insurance coverage may become more difficult to obtain, if available at all.\n#31#\nWe are and may in the future be involved in legal proceedings that could result in substantial liabilities.\nLike many oil and gas companies, we are from time to time involved in various legal and other proceedings, such as title, royalty or contractual disputes, regulatory compliance matters and personal injury or property damage matters, in the ordinary course of our business. Such legal proceedings are inherently uncertain and their results cannot be predicted. Regardless of the outcome, such proceedings could have an adverse impact on us because of legal costs, diversion of management and other personnel and other factors. In addition, it is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings could result in liability, penalties or sanctions, as well as judgments, consent decrees or orders requiring a change in our business practices, which could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Accruals for such liability, penalties or sanctions may be insufficient. Judgments and estimates to determine accruals or range of losses related to legal and other proceedings could change from one period to the next, and such changes could be material.\nRisks Relating to Our Outstanding Common Stock\nThere may be circumstances in which the interests of two groups of our stockholders could be in conflict with the interests of our other stockholders.\nTwo groups of our stockholders advised by two investment management firms currently hold approximately 44% and 28%, respectively, of our post-reorganization Class A Common Stock. Circumstances may arise in which these groups of stockholders may have an interest in pursuing or preventing acquisitions, divestitures or other transactions, including the issuance of additional shares or debt, that, in their judgment, could enhance their investment in us or another company in which they invest. Such transactions might adversely affect us or other holders of our Class A Common Stock. Furthermore, pursuant to the Successor\u2019s amended and restated certificate of incorporation, each of these two groups of stockholders has the right to elect two directors to our Board of Directors for so long as each such group holds at least 20% of the then-outstanding Class A Common Stock or one director to our Board of Directors for so long as each such group holds at least 10% but less than 20% of the then-outstanding Class A Common Stock. As a result such directors will control decisions made by our Board of Directors, including whether to enter into the transactions described above.\nIn addition, our significant concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our Class A Common Stock because investors may perceive disadvantages in owning shares in companies with significant stockholders.\nThere is no meaningful trading market for our Class A Common Stock and the market price of our Class A Common Stock is subject to volatility, which could make it difficult for you to sell your Class A Common Stock.\nUpon our emergence from bankruptcy, the Predecessor\u2019s common stock was canceled and the Successor issued new Class A Common Stock. The Class A Common Stock is not currently traded on a national securities exchange and no broker dealer is making an active market in the Class A Common Stock. Although our Class A Common Stock is eligible to trade in the \"Grey Market\" under the symbol \"QWST\", as of the date hereof, no trades have been reported on the www.otcmarkets.com website since the Effective Date. According to the www.otcmarkets.com website, \"Grey Market\" describes securities that are not currently traded on the OTCQX, OTCQB or Pink markets and broker-dealers are not willing or able to publicly quote these securities because of a lack of investor interest, company information availability or regulatory compliance. Accordingly, even if a trading market develops for our Class A Common Stock, the market price of our Class A Common Stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to, and the level of trading that develops with our Class A Common Stock may be affected by, numerous factors beyond our control such as our limited trading history subsequent to our emergence from bankruptcy, our limited trading volume, the concentration of holdings of our Class A Common Stock, the lack of comparable historical financial information due to our expected adoption of fresh start accounting, actual or anticipated variations in our operating results and cash flow, business conditions in our markets and the general state of the securities markets and the market for energy-related stocks, as well as general economic and market conditions and other factors that may affect our future results, including those described in this Form 10-K. No assurance can be given that an active market will develop for our Class A Common Stock or as to the liquidity of the trading market for our Class A Common Stock. Our Class A Common Stock may be traded only infrequently, and reliable market quotations may not be available. Holders of our Class A Common Stock may experience difficulty in reselling, or an inability to sell, their shares. In addition, if an active trading market does not develop or is not maintained, significant sales of our Class A Common Stock, or the expectation of these sales, could materially and adversely affect the market price of our Class A Common Stock. For so long as our Class A Common Stock is not listed on a national securities exchange, our ability to access equity markets, obtain financing and provide equity incentives could be negatively impaired.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could delay or prevent a change in control of our company, even if that change would be beneficial to our stockholders.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may delay, discourage, prevent or render more difficult an attempt to obtain control of our company, whether through a tender offer, business combination, proxy contest or otherwise. These provisions include, among other things, those that:\n#32#\n\u2022\npermit two groups of our stockholders to elect up to four members of our board of directors and limit the removal of such directors;\n\u2022\nauthorize our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms, including preferences and voting rights, of those shares without stockholder approval;\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice procedures for nominating directors or presenting matters at stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\nprohibit cumulative voting; and\n\u2022\nrestrict certain transfers (including acquisitions and dispositions) of the Company\u2019s securities to assist in the preservation of the Company\u2019s ability to utilize its current and future tax benefits.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock and our ability to pay dividends on our common stock is restricted.\nWe have not paid dividends on our common stock, in cash or otherwise, and intend to retain our cash flow from operations for the future operation and development of our business. We are currently restricted from paying dividends on our common stock by our Exit Facility and the indenture governing the 2024 PIK Notes. Any future dividends also may be restricted by our then-existing debt agreements.", "PERMNO": 78186, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "PQUEQ"}
