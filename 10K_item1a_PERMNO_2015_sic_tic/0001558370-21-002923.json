Risk Factors\nRISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Before making your decision to invest in shares of our common stock, you should carefully consider the risks described below, together with the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that affect us. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected. The market price of our common stock would likely decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nRISKS RELATED TO THE MERGER\nThe conditions under the Merger Agreement may not be satisfied or waived and there can be no assurance that the Merger will be consummated.\nOn January 19, 2021, we entered into the Merger Agreement with ReShape Lifesciences Inc. and Optimus Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, pursuant to which, Merger Sub will merge with and into ReShape, with ReShape becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Obalon. Consummation of the proposed Merger requires that a number of conditions must be satisfied or waived (to the extent permitted by applicable law). Those conditions include, among others:\n\u25cf approval of the contemplated transactions by Obalon stockholders and ReShape stockholders\n\u25cf the absence of any adverse law or order promulgated, entered, enforced, enacted, or issued by any government entity that prohibits, restrains, or makes illegal the consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement;\n\u25cf the effectiveness of a registration statement on Form S-4, which shall include this joint proxy statement/prospectus, under the Securities Act and the absence of any stop order issued by the SEC suspending the use of such registration statement;\n\u25cf Nasdaq\u2019s approval of the continued listing of our common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market;\n\u25cf subject to certain materiality exceptions, the accuracy of certain representations and warranties of each of us and ReShape contained in the Merger Agreement and the compliance by each party with the covenants contained in the Merger Agreement; and\n\u25cf the absence of a material adverse effect with respect to us and ReShape.\nThese conditions to the consummation of the Merger may not be satisfied or waived (to the extent permitted by applicable law) and, as a result, the Merger may not be consummated at the time expected, or at all. In addition, ReShape or Obalon may elect to terminate the Merger Agreement in certain other circumstances, specifically in the event that the required Nasdaq approvals are not obtained.\nAlthough an application will be filed for the continued listing of our common stock on The Nasdaq Capital Market in connection with the Merger, there can be no assurance that our common stock will be so listed or, if listed, that the Combined Company following the Merger will be able to comply with the continued listing standards.\nAn application to list our common stock on The Nasdaq Capital Market upon consummation of the Merger has been filed as required by The Nasdaq Capital Market. As part of the listing process, the Combined Company will be required to evidence that it meets the initial listing requirements rather than the continued listing requirements because the Merger will result in a change of control of the Company. In certain respects, the initial listing requirements are more onerous than the continued listing requirements, such as the minimum bid price of the common stock of $4.00 per share for initial listing compared to $1.00 per share for continued listing. There can be no assurance that the Combined Company will be able to meet the initial listing standards of The Nasdaq Capital Market or any other exchange or, if its stock is listed, that the Combined Company will be able to maintain our listing.\nNasdaq\u2019s approval of the listing application is a condition to the closing of the Merger and while we and ReShape can each terminate the Merger Agreement if the condition is not satisfied (in which case, a $1 million termination fee may be payable to us by ReShape), we and ReShape can also each choose to waive the condition and consummate the Merger without Nasdaq\u2019s approval of the listing application. In the event we and ReShape waive that condition and consummate the Merger without Nasdaq\u2019s approval of the listing application, the Combined Company would not be listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market.\nIn addition, if after listing, The Nasdaq Capital Market delists our common stock from trading on its exchange for failure to meet the continued listing standards, the Combined Company and its stockholders, which will include our current stockholders, could face significant material adverse consequences including:\n\u25cf a limited availability of market quotations for its securities;\n\u25cf a determination that its common stock is a \u201cpenny stock\u201d which will require brokers trading in its common stock to adhere to more stringent rules, possibly resulting in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for its common stock;\n\u25cf a limited amount of analyst coverage; and\n\u25cf a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nThe pendency of the Merger could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe announcement and pendency of the Merger could disrupt our business, in any of the following ways, among others:\n\u25cf the attention of our management may be directed toward completion of the Merger, integration planning and transaction-related considerations and may be diverted from our day-to-day business operations and, following the completion of the Merger, the attention of the Combined Company\u2019s management may also be diverted to such matters;\n\u25cf vendors, suppliers, business partners or others may seek to modify or terminate their business relationship with us or the Combined Company following completion of the Merger;\n\u25cf We, or the Combined Company following completion of the Merger, and our respective directors could become subject to lawsuits relating to the Merger; and\n\u25cf We may experience negative reactions from their stockholders and the medical community, among others.\nThese disruptions could be exacerbated by a delay in the completion of the Merger or termination of the Merger Agreement. Additionally, if the Merger is not consummated, each company will have incurred significant costs and diverted the time and attention of management. A failure to consummate the Merger may also result in negative publicity, reputational harm, litigation against us or our directors and officers, and a negative impression of us in the financial markets. The occurrence of any of these events individually or in combination could have a material adverse effect on either or both companies\u2019 financial statements and stock price.\nFailure to consummate the Merger could negatively impact our future stock price, operations and financial results.\nIf the Merger is not consummated for any reason, we may be subjected to a number of material risks, including the following:\n\u25cf a decline in the market prices of our common stock to the extent that their current market prices reflect a market assumption that the Merger will be consummated and will be beneficial to the value of our business after the Closing Date;\n\u25cf having to pay certain costs related to the proposed Merger, such as legal, accounting, financial advisory, printing and mailing fees, which must be paid regardless of whether the Merger is consummated;\n\u25cf addressing the consequences of operational decisions made since the signing of the Merger Agreement, including because of restrictions on our operations imposed by the terms of the Merger Agreement and decisions to delay or defer capital expenditures;\n\u25cf returning the focus of management and personnel to operating the Company, as applicable, on a standalone basis, without any of the benefits expected to have been provided by the consummation of the Merger; and\n\u25cf negative reactions from their respective stockholders, suppliers, employees, patients enrolled in our studies and the medical community.\nIf the Merger is consummated, the composition of the board of directors and management of the Combined Company will be comprised of the current board of directors and management of ReShape and our current stockholders will not have a majority ownership and voting interest in the Combined Company, which may affect the strategy and operations of the Combined Company.\nPursuant to the Merger Agreement, following the consummation of the Merger, the board of directors of the Combined Company will consist of the five current members of the board of directors of ReShape: Dan W. Gladney, Barton P. Bandy, Arda M. Minocherhomjee, Ph.D., Lori C. McDougal and Gary D. Blackford. Mr. Gladney will serve as the chair and Mr. Blackford will serve as lead director of the board of directors.\nNone of our current directors, officers or employees are expected to continue with the Combined Company.\nThis composition of the Combined Board may affect the Combined Company\u2019s business strategy and operating decisions following the consummation of the Merger, as compared to our board of directors prior to the Merger. If the Combined Company reestablishes commercial operations for the Obalon Balloon System, it will not be able to rely on the experience of our current board of directors, management or employees.\nIn addition, immediately following completion of the Merger and the issuance of our common stock to the ReShape stockholders at the Effective Time, our current stockholders in the aggregate will not have a majority ownership and voting interest in the Combined Company, which may result in our stockholders having less influence on the Combined Company\u2019s management and policies. Immediately following completion of the Merger, our stockholders and ReShape\u2019s stockholders are expected to own 49% and 51%, respectively, of the Combined Company\u2019s outstanding shares. As a result, our current stockholders may have less influence on the Combined Company\u2019s management and policies than they currently have.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS\nWe have suspended or terminated essentially all of our commercial efforts, shut down our manufacturing operations and terminated nearly all of our employees, and we cannot assure you when, if ever, these efforts will recommence.\nOur commercial operations expose us to risks associated with public health crises and outbreaks of epidemic, pandemic, or contagious diseases, such as the current outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19). To date, COVID-19 has had, and is expected to continue to have, an adverse impact on our operations, including our product sales, manufacturing, supply chains, and our expenses, including as a result of preventive and precautionary measures that we, other businesses, and governments are taking. Largely as a result of the COVID-19 crisis, we have permanently closed our two Obalon-branded or managed retail weight loss centers, suspended future expansion plans for new retail centers, stopped shipping product to all U.S. customers, terminated our agreement with our only international distributor, and terminated our sales and marketing organizations. We have also shut down our manufacturing operations, including terminating all manufacturing and related support personnel. During fiscal year 2020, we terminated all but two essential employees. These terminations included key long-time senior executives and other functional personnel with deep knowledge and expertise important to our business that has been acquired and developed over many years. We do not expect to restart any of our operations unless we are able to complete the Merger with ReShape. We cannot assure you when, if ever, we will achieve any of these objectives and we do not expect to generate any revenue unless and until we can restart.\nThere are many uncertainties regarding COVID-19, including governmental and public health responses and the unknown duration and extent of economic disruption. Due to the uncertainty surrounding COVID-19, we do not currently plan to re-open our retail treatment centers, re-initiate our retail treatment center expansion plans, restart manufacturing operations or to ship orders to U.S. customers or our former international distributor. Despite our efforts to manage and remedy these impacts on us, their ultimate impact also depends on factors beyond our knowledge or control, including the duration and severity of the COVID-19 outbreak as well as third-party actions taken to contain its spread and mitigate its public health effects. However, based on the current state of the pandemic in the United States and abroad, the disease has already disrupted our operations and had a material adverse effect on our business, results of\noperations, financial condition, cash flows and stock price, as well heightened many of the risks described elsewhere in the \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIf we are unable to complete the Merger with ReShape and in the alternative unable to secure additional financing on favorable terms, or at all, we could be forced to liquidate all or some of our assets or seek bankruptcy protection to protect stakeholder value.\nGiven the changes during fiscal year 2020 to drastically reduce our organizational structure and eliminate our commercial operations, we anticipate that our cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2020 are sufficient to fund our operations beyond March 2022. If we are not able to raise capital to meet our needs, we will not be able to support any ongoing operations and may not be able to settle all of our liabilities. We have actively reviewed financial and strategic alternatives, including debt and equity financing, whole or partial sale of the company and a reverse merger in order to meet our capital needs and financial obligations, and increase stockholder value. If the Merger with ReShape is not completed, we may not be able to identify a viable alternative for capital raising and adequate funding to operate our business as a standalone company may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.\nIn February 2020, we implemented a new purchase agreement with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC, or Lincoln Park. Pursuant to the new purchase agreement with Lincoln Park, or the Lincoln Park Purchase Agreement, Lincoln Park has committed to purchase up to $15.0 million of our common stock from time to time over a 36-month period. The number of shares we may sell to Lincoln Park on any single business day in a Regular Purchase is 150,000, but that amount may be increased to up to 250,000 shares of our common stock, depending on the market price of our common stock at the time of sale and subject to a maximum limit of $1,000,000 per Regular Purchase. Depending on the prevailing market price of our common stock, we may not be able to sell shares to Lincoln Park for the maximum $15.0 million over the term of the Lincoln Park Purchase Agreement. In addition, under the rules of the Nasdaq Capital Market, in no event may we issue more than 19.99% of our shares outstanding under the Lincoln Park Purchase Agreement unless we obtain stockholder approval or an exception pursuant to the rules of the Nasdaq Capital Market is obtained to issue more than 19.99%. This limitation will not apply in certain limited circumstances as set out in the Lincoln Park Purchase Agreement. We have not sold any shares to Lincoln Park in fiscal year 2020 under the current Purchase Agreement. We are not required or permitted to issue any shares of common stock under the Purchase Agreement if such issuance would breach our obligations under the rules or regulations of the Nasdaq Capital Market. In addition, Lincoln Park will not be required to purchase any shares of our common stock if such sale would result in Lincoln Park\u2019s beneficial ownership exceeding 9.99% of the then outstanding shares of our common stock. Given the limitations under this arrangement, we do not believe it is adequate to provide sufficient funds for us to continue as a standalone company.\nEven if we are able to raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our stockholders is likely to be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect existing stockholders\u2019 rights. Moreover, debt and equity financings, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as redeeming our shares, making investments, incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures, declaring dividends or placing limitations on our ability to acquire, sell or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could negatively impact our ability to conduct our business.\nIf we do not complete the Merger with ReShape and are unable to obtain sufficient funds on acceptable terms or in a timely manner we will be forced to take additional actions, including attempting to sell all or portions of our business, liquidating all or some of our assets or seeking bankruptcy protection.\nWe have ceased our efforts to seek third-party reimbursement and are focused primarily on the successful close of the Merger with ReShape. If the Merger does not close and we are able to continue to operate as a standalone Company, our strategy to attain coverage and reimbursement by third-party payors may not be successful and will subject us to new risks, some of which we may not yet have identified.\nDuring fiscal year 2020, we transitioned our business to develop a strategy to obtain coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors, which we believe could address one of the largest barriers to patient and physician adoption of the Obalon Balloon System. Historically, we utilized both a direct to physician model and a Company-managed Obalon-\nbranded retail treatment center strategy. Both of these commercial strategies utilized a patient cash-pay model, with varying degrees of success. Since entering into the Merger Agreement with ReShape, we have suspended our efforts to obtain coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors. The Merger is subject to a number of closing conditions and, if one of more of those conditions are not satisfied or waived, the Merger may not close and we would have to continue as a standalone company. As a standalone Company, we may not be able to restart commercial operations, renew our efforts to seek third-party reimbursement or determine and launch a different commercial strategy. Further, if we renew these efforts in the future, we cannot assure you that this new strategy will be successful nor which delivery model to the patient will be utilized in the future should we be able to obtain coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors.\nPayors may refuse to provide coverage and reimbursement or change their coverage and reimbursement policies for intragastric balloon products as a category and/or for other obesity treatments and procedures, and these changes could negatively impact our business. No uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for products exists among third-party payors and coverage and reimbursement levels for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time consuming and costly process that may require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance.\nCompletion of clinical trials necessary to support coverage and reimbursement could take several years or more. We cannot provide any assurance that we will successfully, or in a timely manner, enroll clinical trials, that our clinical trials will meet their primary endpoints or that such trials or their results will be accepted by third-party payors as sufficient to support coverage and reimbursement. Successful results of predecessor clinical trial results may not be replicated in subsequent clinical trials. Additionally, one or more third-party payors may disagree with our analyses and interpretation of the data from any clinical trial we undertake, or may find the clinical trial design, conduct, monitoring, or results unreliable or inadequate to support coverage and reimbursement. If we are unable to develop the clinical support needed to establish coverage and reimbursement, we may be unable to sell our products.\nTo contain costs of new technologies, governmental healthcare programs and third-party payors are increasingly scrutinizing new and existing treatments by requiring extensive evidence of favorable clinical outcomes. Even if we are successful in obtaining coverage from third-party payors for the Obalon Balloon System or procedures using the product, physicians may not purchase the Obalon Balloon System if they do not receive sufficient reimbursement from these payors for the cost of the product or procedures using our product. If government and other third-party payors do not provide coverage or adequate reimbursement levels for the Obalon Balloon System or procedures using the product, the demand for the Obalon Balloon System will not increase and/or create additional pricing pressure for us, either of which could adversely impact our business and financial condition.\nIf we are unable to reestablish commercial operations, including sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution capabilities, whether after the completion of the Merger with ReShape, on our own or in collaboration with third parties, we may not be successful in commercializing our products.\nWe terminated all of our commercial personnel and no longer have a functioning infrastructure for the sales, marketing, or distribution of any product, and the cost of reestablishing and maintaining such an organization may exceed the cost-effectiveness of doing so. In order to market our product, we must build our sales, distribution, marketing, managerial and other nontechnical capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services.\nIf the Merger with ReShape, is consummated, and the Combined Company reestablishes commercial operations for the Obalon Balloon System, it will not be able to rely on the experience of our current board of directors or management since all of the members of our board of directors and management will resign in connection with closing of the Merger.\nThere are significant expenses and risks involved with establishing our own sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, including our ability to hire, retain and appropriately incentivize qualified individuals, generate sufficient sales leads, provide adequate training to sales and marketing personnel, and effectively manage geographically dispersed sales and marketing teams.\nFactors that may inhibit our efforts to commercialize our products on our own include:\n\u25cf our inability to recruit, train and retain adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel;\n\u25cf our inability to regain customer confidence or recover market share that may have been ceded to competitors or other intragastric balloon technology;\n\u25cf the inability of sales personnel to obtain access to physicians or attain adequate numbers of physicians to prescribe any drugs;\n\u25cf the inability to negotiate with payors regarding reimbursement for our products; and\n\u25cf unforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating an independent sales and marketing organization.\nIf we choose to enter into and maintain collaborative relationships for such sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, we would be highly dependent upon the collaborator\u2019s strategic interest in our products, and that collaborator\u2019s ability to successfully market and sell the product. To the extent that we depend on third parties for marketing and distribution, any revenue we receive will depend upon the efforts of such third parties, and there can be no assurance that such efforts will be successful.\nIf we are unable to establish adequate sales, marketing, and distribution capabilities, either on our own or in collaboration with third parties, we will not be successful in commercializing our products and may not become profitable. We may be competing with many companies that have extensive and well-funded marketing and sales operations. Without an internal team or the support of a third party to perform marketing and sales functions, we may be unable to compete successfully against these companies.\nWe have received funding under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act\nOn April 22, 2020, we executed a promissory note in favor of Silicon Valley Bank evidencing an unsecured loan in the aggregate principal amount of $430,047, which was made pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program, or the PPP. The PPP was established under the CARES Act, which was enacted on March 27, 2020, and is administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration, or the SBA. All the funds under the loan were disbursed to us on April 23, 2020. The Company has used all proceeds from the loan to retain employees, maintain payroll and make lease and utility payments.\nThe promissory note provides for a fixed interest rate of one percent per year with a maturity date of April 22, 2022. Monthly principal and interest payments due on the loan are deferred for a six-month period beginning from the date of disbursement. The loan may be prepaid by the Company at any time prior to April 22, 2022 with no prepayment penalties or premiums.\nUnder the terms of the CARES Act, loan recipients can apply for and be granted forgiveness for all or a portion of the loans granted under the PPP. Such forgiveness will be subject to approval by the SBA and the lender and determined, subject to limitations, based on factors set forth in the CARES Act, including verification of the use of loan proceeds for payment of payroll costs and payments of mortgage interest, rent and utilities. In the event the loan, or any portion thereof, is forgiven, the amount forgiven is applied to outstanding principal. The terms of any forgiveness may also be subject to further regulations and guidelines that the SBA may adopt. If the loan is not forgiven, we will be required to repay the outstanding principal, along with accrued interest. We will carefully monitor all qualifying expenses and other requirements necessary to attain loan forgiveness; however, no assurance is provided that we will ultimately apply for or obtain forgiveness of the PPP loan in whole or in part.\nThe PPP loan application required us to certify, among other things, that the current economic uncertainty made the PPP loan request necessary to support our ongoing operations. On April 23, 2020, the SBA, in consultation with the Department of Treasury, issued new guidance stating that it is unlikely that a public company with substantial market value and access to capital markets will be able to make the required certification in good faith. We made the certification in good faith after analyzing our financial situation and access to capital and believe that we have satisfied all eligibility criteria for the PPP loan, but the SBA guidance and criteria is subject to interpretation and if we are found to be ineligible, we could be subject to significant penalties and required to repay the loan. If we become subject to\npenalties or are not able to attain loan forgiveness, it could result in harm to our business, results of operation and financial condition. If, prior to the consummation of the Merger, we do not obtain a waiver from Silicon Valley Bank, the full amount of principal and interest outstanding under the PPP loan could become due and payable upon the consummation of the Merger.\nWe have limited operating experience and a history of net losses, and we recently discontinued all of our commercial operations.\nWe have a limited operating history upon which you can evaluate our business and we recently discontinued all of our commercial operations while we explore our ability to secure coverage and reimbursement for our products and other strategic alternatives. Prior to discontinuing our commercial operations, we had marketed our products only since January 2017 and our commercial sales experience has been limited. We have incurred significant losses in each period since our inception in 2008, with net losses of $12.3 million and $23.7 million during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $184.8 million and had cash and cash equivalents of $3.9 million. These losses and our accumulated deficit reflect the substantial investments we have made to develop, seek and obtain regulatory approval for our current and future generation Obalon Balloon System and sell our Obalon Balloon System in international and U.S. markets, and commercialize our Obalon Balloon System in the United States. Our consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 have been prepared on the basis that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. Pending the result of the Merger, if we are not able to raise additional capital in a timely manner, we will not be able to support or restart our commercial operations.\nOur costs and expenses may increase significantly if we determine to pursue additional clinical trials that may be needed to secure reimbursement. If we secure reimbursement and return to commercial operations, we would expect our costs and expenses to increase substantially as we rebuild our sales and marketing and manufacturing capabilities. As a public company, we will continue to incur significant insurance, legal, accounting, compliance and other expenses, and we expect our losses to continue for the foreseeable future. Unless and until we return to commercial operations, we do not expect to generate any revenue. We cannot assure you when, if ever, we will generate revenue and, if we do, whether we will ever achieve profitability.\nOur business is entirely dependent on sales of the Obalon Balloon System, which we are currently not manufacturing, marketing or selling.\nAll of our revenue to date was attributable to sales of our Obalon Balloon System including its component parts and accessories. In 2020, largely due to the COVID-19 crisis, we discontinued all of our commercial operations while we explore our ability to secure coverage and reimbursement for our products and other strategic alternatives. Even if we are able to secure reimbursement for the Obalon Balloon System and restart commercial operations, there are a number of factors that may contribute to our financial results, including:\n\u25cf patient interest in and demand for our Obalon Balloon System;\n\u25cf our ability to obtain adequate coverage and reimbursement for the Obalon Balloon System;\n\u25cf positive or negative media coverage, or public, patient and/or physician perception, of our Obalon Balloon System, the procedures or products of our competitors, or our industry;\n\u25cf any safety or efficacy concerns that arise through physician and patient experience with our Obalon Balloon System;\n\u25cf any safety or efficacy concerns for the category of intragastric balloons, including liquid-filled balloons, as the FDA has issued four Letters to Health Care Providers warning them about the use of liquid-filled intragastric balloons citing potential risks, including death;\n\u25cf our ability to service and maintain equipment such as the Obalon Navigation System;\n\u25cf delays in, or failure of, product and component deliveries by our third-party suppliers and single-source suppliers;\n\u25cf willingness of physicians to purchase the capital equipment required to place balloons using the Obalon Navigation System;\n\u25cf difficulties in producing a sufficient quantity of our product to meet commercial demand due to shortages of component parts or due to issues in the manufacturing process;\n\u25cf introduction of new procedures or products for treating patients who are obese or overweight that compete with our product;\n\u25cf adverse changes in the economy that reduce patient demand for elective procedures; and\n\u25cf favorable or unfavorable positions developed on intragastric balloons, or the Obalon Balloon System by professional medical associations, such as the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery (ASMBS), the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE), or other organizations with influence on physicians.\nIt is therefore difficult to predict our future financial performance and growth, and such forecasts are inherently limited and subject to a number of uncertainties. If our assumptions regarding the risks and uncertainties we face, which we use to plan our business, are incorrect or change due to circumstances in our business or our markets, or if we do not address these risks successfully, our operating and financial results could differ materially from our expectations and our business could suffer.\nBecause we devote substantially all of our resources to our Obalon Balloon System and rely on our Obalon Balloon System as our sole source of revenue, any factors that negatively impact our product, or result in decreasing product sales, would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have historically maintained a high level of inventory, which could consume a significant amount of our resources, reduce our cash flows and lead to inventory impairment charges especially if we restart commercial operations and manufacturing in the future.\nWe are a vertically integrated manufacturer and insufficient demand for our products subjects us to risks. As a result of the need to maintain substantial levels of inventory due to single third-party sourcing and long lead-times to develop alternate third-party sources, we historically carried a high level of inventory for strategic materials. Due to the suspension of our business operations, we have ceased shipping product to U.S. and international customers, closed our Obalon-branded retail treatment centers and halted expansion of our retail treatment center model. We performed an impairment analysis and recognized $1.3 million in asset impairment charges during the second quarter of 2020.\nPhysicians have been slow to adopt and use intragastric balloons, and adverse events or other negative developments involving other companies\u2019 intragastric balloons or other obesity treatments may further slow patient adoption, which have negatively impacted our financial performance and strategic options and this could continue into the future.\nIntragastric balloons represent a relatively new category of treatment for obese and overweight patients that is small, immature and not currently covered or reimbursed by third-party payors. We are currently aware of only one other intragastric balloon available for commercial sale in the United States, which was first commercially available in 2015. As a result, patient and physician awareness of intragastric balloons as a treatment option for obesity and weight management, and experience with intragastric balloons, is minimal. Prior to discontinuing our commercial operations, we experienced limited penetration of this market, and any future success will depend in large part on our ability to obtain coverage and reimbursement, to further develop the currently small and immature intragastric balloon market, educate physicians and patients, and to successfully demonstrate the safety, tolerability, ease of use, efficacy, cost effectiveness and other merits of our Obalon Balloon System.\nAdditionally, because the market for intragastric balloons is new and developing and contains a limited number of market participants, our products could be negatively impacted by unfavorable market reactions to these other devices. If the use of these or future intragastric balloons results in serious adverse device events, or SADEs, or such products are subject to malfunctions or misuse, patients may attribute such negative events to intragastric balloons generally, which may adversely affect market adoption of our Obalon Balloon System. Since February 2017, the FDA has issued four separate letters to health care providers warning of serious adverse events, including deaths, which are specific to liquid-filled intragastric balloons. We are aware of the filing of additional reports of serious adverse events, including deaths, associated with liquid-filled balloons since the issuance of the FDA safety alert letters. While the alerts were specific to liquid-filled intragastric balloons, not gas-filled intragastric balloons, these alerts could create negative perceptions of the entire category and slow down the acceptance of the Obalon Balloon System. Medical professional associations, such as ASMBS, have or may publish positions to their memberships which may be favorable or unfavorable toward the use of intragastric balloons, or the Obalon Balloon specifically. Additionally, if patients undergoing treatment with our Obalon Balloon System perceive the weight loss inadequate or adverse events too numerous or severe as compared with the treatment rates of alternative balloons or procedures, it will be difficult to demonstrate the value of our Obalon Balloon System to patients and physicians. As a result, demand for our Obalon Balloon System may decline or may not increase at the pace or to the levels we expect.\nThe efficacy of our Obalon Balloon System depends on patient compliance with a moderate intensity diet and behavior modification program. If patients are unwilling to make dietary and behavioral changes, patient outcomes may suffer which could negatively impact perception of our product in the marketplace both in the past and in the future.\nOur Obalon Balloon System is approved as an adjunct to a moderate intensity diet and behavior modification program. As a result, in addition to undergoing the Obalon balloon procedure, patients will also need to modify their existing diet and level of physical activity in order to achieve their desired weight loss. If patients are unwilling to implement the appropriate dietary and behavioral changes, the amount of weight loss may be less than desired, leading to a negative perception of our product in the marketplace.\nIf patients are unable to successfully swallow the capsule or our balloon cannot otherwise be successfully deployed, patients may seek a refund or monetary damages in connection with the treatment.\nPatients may be unable to successfully swallow the capsule that contains the Obalon balloon, potentially creating an economic disincentive for physicians to prescribe the Obalon Balloon System. In our SMART pivotal trial, 7.6% of the combined treatment and control group patients failed to swallow a capsule with the microcatheter attached despite success swallowing a placebo that did not have a catheter attached. We are experiencing similar rates in U.S. commercial usage. There have also been instances where balloon deployment was negatively impacted due to a leak in the microcatheter caused by the patient biting the catheter during placement and requiring endoscopic removal. There may be other reasons for unsuccessful placements of which we are not yet aware. If the balloon is not successfully placed for any reason, the patient may attempt to seek a refund or monetary damages for the treatment. Either scenario could cause a negative financial impact for us and could also create ill will with patients and physicians.\nAdditionally, patients may seek a refund or monetary damages from us due to Company-branded treatment center closures, inability to complete treatment, persistent side-effects resulting in early removal, and general discontent with outcomes.\nPatients may experience serious injury related to the device or procedures as the result of the misuse or malfunction of, or design flaws in, our products, that could expose us to expensive litigation, divert management\u2019s attention and harm our reputation and business.\nOur business is subject to significant risks associated with manufacture, distribution and use of medical devices that are placed inside the human body, including the risk that patients may be severely injured by or even die from the misuse or malfunction of our products caused by design flaws or manufacturing defects. In addition, our business may suffer adverse consequences even in circumstances where a patient injury is caused by the actions of others, such as where a patient is injured due to the improper or negligent use of our products by a physician.\nFor instance, if the Obalon capsule does not reach a patient\u2019s stomach and there is a hardware or software malfunction such that it is inflated in the esophagus, the patient could experience a serious injury. A patient who experiences an esophageal inflation of the balloon would most likely require surgical intervention, and could die as a result of an esophageal inflation or as a result of complications from the subsequent intervention. Physicians may use the Obalon Navigation System to track the location of the balloon prior to inflation. Failure of the sensor to function or the Obalon Navigation System to dynamically track the capsule could result in serious injury if the Obalon balloon is inflated in another portion of the body, such as the esophagus. Perforation of the esophagus at any time, including during removal, is also possible. Esophageal perforation leading to sepsis and death associated with the sepsis has been reported with use of our product. Serious injury could also occur if one or more of the balloons deflates and migrates into the lower intestine causing an obstruction. This can also lead to surgical removal of the device and associated complications including death. Failure of the Obalon Touch Inflation Dispenser to function could result in need for immediate endoscopic removal or patient injury. Balloon deflation and migration into the lower intestine requiring surgical removal has also been reported with use of our product. Perforation of the stomach is also possible and can lead to surgical removal of the device and associated complications including death. Perforation of the stomach requiring surgical repair has also been reported with use of our product. One or more balloons may get lodged in the pyloric channel which could lead to severe dehydration and be life threatening and/or require surgical procedures to remove. Failure to transit has been reported with use of our product and unscheduled endoscopy has been performed to remove the uninflated balloon. Aspiration during placement or removal is also a risk with intragastric balloons which could lead to pneumonia or other serious injury. Acute pancreatitis has been reported that may or may not be associated with the use of our product. While we have designed our products, and established instructions and protocols for physicians, to attempt to mitigate such risks, we cannot guarantee that adverse events will not occur again in the future. For example, physicians and/or patients have in the past failed, and may again in the future fail, to follow our instructions and protocols, and the safety systems we design into our products may not prevent all possible adverse events and injuries and/or our products may fail to function properly.\nOur quality assurance testing programs may not be adequate to detect all defects, which may result in patient adverse events, interfere with customer satisfaction, reduce sales opportunities, harm our marketplace reputation, increase warranty repairs and/or harm our revenue and results of operations. Our inability to remedy a product defect could result in a product recall, temporary or permanent withdrawal of a product from a market, product liability suits, damage to our reputation or our brand, inventory replacement costs or product reengineering expenses, any of which could have a material impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn the past we have employed, and in the future we may employ social media and call center activities as part of our marketing strategy, which could give rise to regulatory violations, liability, breaches of data security or reputational damage.\nDespite our efforts to monitor evolving social media communication guidelines and comply with applicable laws and regulations, there is risk that the use of social media by us, our employees or our customers to communicate about our products or business may cause us to be found in violation of applicable requirements, including requirements of regulatory bodies such as the FDA, CMS and Federal Trade Commission. For example, adverse events, product\ncomplaints, off-label usage by physicians, unapproved marketing or other unintended messages could require an active response from us, which may not be completed in a timely manner and could result in regulatory action by a governing body. In addition, our employees may knowingly or inadvertently make use of social media in ways that may not comply with our social media policy or other legal or contractual requirements, which may give rise to liability, lead to the loss of trade secrets or other intellectual property, or result in public exposure of personal information of our employees, clinical trial patients, customers and others. Furthermore, negative posts or comments about us or our products in social media could seriously damage our reputation, brand image and goodwill.\nWe have limited experience manufacturing our Obalon Balloon System and Obalon Navigation System in commercial quantities and, if we restart manufacturing, we may experience production delays or issues in our manufacturing organization and be unable to meet current or future demand.\nPrior to 2017, the majority of our product sales had been to a single international distributor in the Middle East. We first sold our products to physicians and institutions in the United States in 2017, and we anticipate the United States to be our primary market focus going forward. We have limited experience in manufacturing the current Obalon Balloon System and all its related components in commercial quantities. Moreover, we recently terminated our existing manufacturing capabilities, and if we determine to restart commercial operations, we will need to reestablish those capabilities, and likely improve them, in order to satisfy expected demand. We may find that we are unable to successfully manufacture our products in sufficient quantities, on a timely basis and with the expected quality. Any failure to meet the quality, quantity and timeliness expectations of our customers could negatively impact our results of operations.\nWe have had and may in the future continue to encounter production delays or shortfalls caused by many factors, including the following:\n\u25cf the termination of our manufacturing organization and related support functions and/or ability to successfully rehire the necessary talent and capabilities;\n\u25cf the timing and process needed to assimilate the changes necessary to enable our production processes to accommodate anticipated demand;\n\u25cf shortages that we may experience in any of the key components or sub-assemblies that we obtain from third-party suppliers, especially as we have not placed any future orders from those supplies;\n\u25cf production delays or stoppages caused by receiving components or supplies which do not meet our quality specifications;\n\u25cf delays that we may experience in completing validation and verification testing for new controlled-environment rooms at our manufacturing facilities;\n\u25cf delays that we may experience in seeking FDA review and approval of PMA supplements required for certain changes in manufacturing facilities, methods or quality control procedures;\n\u25cf our limited experience in complying with the FDA\u2019s Quality System Regulation, or the QSR, which sets forth good manufacturing practice requirements for medical devices and applies to the manufacture of the components of our Obalon Balloon System;\n\u25cf our ability to attract, train, and retain qualified employees, who are in short supply, in order to increase our manufacturing output;\n\u25cf our ability to design and validate processes to allow us to manufacture future generations of the Obalon Balloon System that meets or exceeds our quality specifications in an efficient, cost-effective manner;\n\u25cf our ability to produce commercial product that meets or exceeds our manufacturing specifications and release criteria;\n\u25cf production delays or stoppages caused by malfunction of production equipment and/or malfunction of the electrical, plumbing, ventilation, or cooling systems supporting our manufacturing facility; and\n\u25cf production stoppages and/or product scrap caused by positive tests for objectionable organisms on our products.\nWe depend on third-party suppliers, including single source suppliers, to manufacture some of our components and sub-assemblies, which could make us vulnerable to supply shortages, interruptions in production and price fluctuations that could harm our business. We have not ordered from those suppliers in approximately one year and they may be unwilling or unable to reinitiate supply of key materials and components.\nHistorically, we manufactured our Obalon Balloon System and some of its components and sub-assemblies at our Carlsbad facility, and we relied on third-party suppliers for other components and sub-assemblies used in production. In some cases, these suppliers were single source suppliers. For example, we relied on single suppliers for the extruded film, swallowable capsule, molded silicone valve used to manufacture our Obalon balloons and the hydrophilic coating for our catheters. We also relied on additional single source suppliers for components of our Obalon Navigation balloons and console, including sensors. These components are critical to our current and future products and there are relatively few alternative sources of supply. We do not carry a significant inventory of these components and obtaining additional components may require significant lead-time. We have experienced and may continue to experience production challenges due to shortages of key components from suppliers.\nMoreover, we have not placed any future orders with our suppliers and they could refuse to fill future orders in the event we restart manufacturing, they may lose the capabilities to produce for us or they may refuse to do business with us at all in the future. Identifying and qualifying additional or replacement suppliers for any of the components or sub-assemblies used in our products could involve significant time and cost and could delay our ability to restart production and, going forward, could adversely affect our ability to fill product orders, service and maintain equipment with customers. For example, given that our Obalon Balloon System is a PMA approved product, any replacement supplier will have to be assessed by us through audits and other verification and assessment tools and found capable of producing quality components that meet our approved specifications, and we may be required to notify or obtain approval from the FDA for a change in a supplier prior to our ability to use the components it provides. If we were unable to find a replacement supplier, it could result in significant delays as we would be unable to produce additional product until such replacement supplier had been identified and qualified. If an existing or replacement supplier proposes to change any component specifications or quality requirements, the change may require FDA approval of a PMA supplement. If a supplier changes a component without notifying us, that change could result in an undetected change being incorporated into the finished product. Once detected and investigated, if the change is found to potentially affect the safety or effectiveness of the product, we would have to take corrective and preventive action, including possibly recalling the product, which could be time-consuming and expensive, and could impair our ability to meet the demand of our customers and harm our business and reputation.\nIn addition, our reliance on third-party suppliers for current and future products subjects us to a number of risks that could impact our ability to manufacture our products, service and maintain equipment with customers and harm our business, including:\n\u25cf inability to obtain adequate supply in a timely manner or on commercially reasonable terms;\n\u25cf change in payment terms, requiring upfront payment;\n\u25cf concern regarding our current financial position or delay in our payments to suppliers; especially our key suppliers for the Obalon Navigation System console and balloon components, could negatively impact suppliers' perception of the Company and result in delayed or canceled delivery of components;\n\u25cf difficulty identifying and qualifying alternative suppliers for components in a timely manner;\n\u25cf interruption of supply resulting from modifications to, or discontinuation of, a supplier\u2019s operations;\n\u25cf damage to suppliers' facilities could interrupt supply;\n\u25cf delays in product shipments resulting from uncorrected defects, reliability issues or a supplier\u2019s failure to produce components that consistently meet our quality specifications;\n\u25cf price fluctuations due to a lack of long-term supply arrangements with our suppliers for key components;\n\u25cf inability of suppliers to comply with applicable provisions of the QSR or other applicable laws or regulations enforced by the FDA and state regulatory authorities;\n\u25cf inability to ensure the quality of products manufactured by third parties;\n\u25cf production delays related to the evaluation and testing of products from alternative suppliers and corresponding regulatory qualifications;\n\u25cf delays in delivery by our suppliers due to changes in demand from us or their other customers;\n\u25cf our suppliers could attempt to manufacture products for our competitors using our intellectual property; and\n\u25cf decisions by suppliers to exit the medical device business or discontinue supplying us.\nAlthough we require our third-party suppliers to supply us with components that meet our specifications and comply with applicable provisions of the QSR and other applicable legal and regulatory requirements in our agreements and contracts, and we perform incoming inspection, testing or other acceptance activities to assure the components meet our requirements, there is a risk that our suppliers will not always act consistent with our best interests, and may not always supply components that meet our requirements, or supply components in a timely manner. Any significant delay or interruption in the supply of components or sub-assemblies, or our inability to obtain substitute components, sub-assemblies or materials from alternate sources at acceptable prices in a timely manner, could impair our ability to meet the demand of our customers and harm our business and financial results.\nHistorically, all of our international revenue was derived from sales to a single distributor that accounted for a significant amount of our revenue.\nAl Danah Medical Company W.L.L, or Al Danah, was the sole distributor of our Obalon Balloon System in the Middle East and our sole international customer. International sales to Al Danah represented 15.1% and 48.4% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Bader Sultan & Bros. Co. W.L.L., or Bader, was previously the sole distributor of our prior generation Obalon balloon system in the Middle East and our sole international customer. The agreement with Bader was terminated in December 2019. In May 2020 we terminated the agreement with Al Danah and will not ship them product in the future. The significant reduction in international revenue in 2020 has had a significant impact on our financial performance. Currently, we do not have regulatory approval for our Obalon Navigation System and Obalon Touch Inflation Dispenser in the Middle East. However, there are certain countries in the Middle East that allow importation of medical device products with United States FDA approval or clearance to meet local regulatory standards, including Qatar.\nIf we were to restart commercial operations as a standalone company, we would not intend to devote significant additional resources in the near-term to market our Obalon Balloon System internationally, which will limit our potential revenue from our product.\nMarketing our Obalon Balloon System outside of the United States would require substantial additional sales and marketing, regulatory and personnel expenses. As part of our longer-term product development and regulatory strategy, we may expand into other select international markets, but we do not currently intend to devote significant additional\nresources to market our Obalon Balloon System internationally. Our decision to market our product primarily in the United States in the near-term will limit our ability to reach all of our potential markets and will limit our potential sources of revenue. In addition, our competitors will have an opportunity to further penetrate and achieve market share outside of the United States until such time, if ever, that we devote significant additional resources to market our product internationally. We have not submitted to the Competent Authority for CE-marking of the Obalon Navigation System or Obalon Touch Inflation Dispenser. Furthermore, given recent changes to the CE-mark process, which requires additional filings, the CE Mark for the prior version of the Obalon balloon system will not be renewed in May 2020.\nThe medical device industry, and the market for weight loss and obesity in particular, is highly competitive. If our competitors are able to develop and market products that are safer, more effective, easier to use or more readily adopted by patients and physicians, our commercial opportunities will be reduced or eliminated.\nThe medical device industry generally, and the market for weight loss and obesity specifically, are highly competitive, subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new product introductions, results of clinical research, corporate combinations, actions by regulatory bodies, changes by public and private payers and other factors. Because of the market opportunity and the high growth potential of the non-surgical device market for weight loss and obesity, competitors and potential competitors have historically dedicated, and will continue to dedicate, significant resources to aggressively develop and commercialize their products.\nIn the United States, our product competes with a variety of pharmaceuticals, surgical procedures and devices for the treatment of obese and overweight people. Large competitors in the surgical segment for weight loss and obesity include Ethicon Inc. (subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson), Medtronic plc (formerly Covidien Ltd.), Apollo EndoSurgery, Inc., and ReShape LifeSciences (which acquired the LAP-BAND from Apollo Endosurgery, Inc. and currently sells that device worldwide). We are aware of only one FDA approved, commercially marketed liquid-filled balloon device for treating overweight people, the ORBERA Balloon by Apollo EndoSurgery. Outside of the United States, Allurion Technologies, Inc. has developed a swallowable, passable liquid-filled intragastric for which they are seeking U.S. regulatory approval. Spatz Medical has also developed a liquid-filled intragastric balloon that has been approved for sale in Latin America and Europe and is seeking regulatory approval in the U.S. Additionally, we are aware of numerous companies around the world working to develop less invasive and less costly alternatives for the treatment of obesity, any of which, if approved, could compete with us in the future.\nAt any time, these or other competitors may introduce new or alternative products that compete directly or indirectly with our products and services. They may also develop and patent products and processes earlier than we can or obtain regulatory clearance or approvals faster than us, which could impair our ability to develop and commercialize similar products or services. If clinical outcomes of procedures performed with our competitors\u2019 products are, or are perceived to be, superior to treatments performed with our products, sales of our products could be negatively affected and our business, results of operations and financial condition could suffer.\nMany of our competitors have significantly greater financial and other resources than we do, as well as:\n\u25cf well-established reputations and name recognition with key opinion leaders and physician networks;\n\u25cf an established base of long-time customers with strong brand loyalty;\n\u25cf products supported by long-term data;\n\u25cf longer operating histories;\n\u25cf significantly larger installed bases of equipment;\n\u25cf greater existing market share in the obesity and weight management market;\n\u25cf broader product offerings and established distribution channels;\n\u25cf greater ability to cross-sell products;\n\u25cf additional lines of products, and the ability to offer rebates or bundle products to offer higher discounts or incentives; and\n\u25cf more experience in conducting research and development, manufacturing, performing clinical trials and obtaining regulatory approvals or clearances.\nCompetition with these companies could result in significant price-cutting, reduced profit margins and loss of market share, any of which would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, competitors with greater financial resources than ours could acquire other companies to gain enhanced name recognition and market share, as well as new technologies or products that could effectively compete with our existing and future products, which may cause our revenues to decline and harm our business.\nWe have dramatically reduced our senior management team to only two full time employees and we cannot assure you that we have or would be able to recruit sufficient resources to manage our current operations or restart commercialization in the future.\nOur success as a standalone company largely depends upon the services of our executive management team, which has been reduced to two employees: Andy Rasdal, our President and CEO, and Nooshin Hussainy, our Chief Financial Officer. Our former President and CEO, William Plovanic resigned on June 19, 2020. Mr. Plovanic continues to serve as a member of the Board of Directors. Mark Brister, our Chief Technology Officer, and Amy VandenBerg, our Chief Clinical, Regulatory and Quality Officer, resigned on July 3, 2020 but continue to provide limited services on a consulting basis. Bob MacDonald, our Chief Retail Officer, resigned on March 13, 2020. We cannot assure you that the remaining executives will be sufficient to implement our current business plan. Additionally, we do not currently maintain key personnel life insurance policies on any of our employees. Moreover, if we are successful in securing reimbursement for our products, we will need to attract and retain additional executive officers and numerous highly qualified personnel. Competition for executive officers and skilled personnel is intense. We have, from time to time, experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining employees with appropriate qualifications. If we are unable to attract and retain additional executive officers or other key employees it could impede the achievement of our research, development and commercialization objectives and seriously harm our ability to successfully implement our business strategy.\nMany of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have. If we hire employees from competitors or other companies, their former employers may attempt to assert that these employees or we have breached legal obligations, resulting in a diversion of our time and resources and, potentially, damages. In addition, job candidates and existing employees, particularly in the San Diego area, are particularly focused on the value of the stock awards they receive in connection with their employment. As a result, the current market price of our common stock, in particular as it relates to exercise prices of our outstanding options, limits our ability to retain existing employees and makes it difficult to attract additional highly skilled employees. In addition, we invest significant time and expense in training our employees, which increases their value to competitors who may seek to recruit them. If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects would be harmed.\nFrom time to time, we engage outside parties to perform services related to certain of our clinical studies and trials, and any failure of those parties to fulfill their obligations could increase costs and cause delays.\nFrom time to time, we engage consultants to help design, monitor and analyze the results of certain of our clinical studies and trials. The consultants we engage interact with clinical investigators to enroll patients in our clinical trials. We depend on these consultants and clinical investigators to help facilitate the clinical studies and trials and monitor and analyze data from these studies and trials under the investigational plan and protocol for the study or trial and to comply with applicable regulations and standards, commonly referred to as good clinical practices, or GCP, requirements for conducting, monitoring, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials, in order to ensure that the data and results are scientifically credible and accurate and that the trial subjects are adequately informed of the potential risks of participating in clinical trials. We rely on medical institutions, clinical investigators, contract laboratories and other third parties, such as CROs, to conduct GLP-compliant preclinical studies and GCP-compliant clinical trials on our product properly and on time. While we will have agreements governing their activities, we control only certain aspects of their activities and have limited influence over their actual performance. We may face delays in our regulatory approval process if these parties do not perform their obligations in a timely, compliant or competent manner. If these third parties\ndo not successfully carry out their duties or meet expected deadlines, or if the quality, completeness or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical trial protocols or for other reasons, our clinical studies or trials may be extended, delayed or terminated or may otherwise prove to be unsuccessful to support product approval of a commercially viable product, or at all, and we may have to conduct additional studies, which would significantly increase our costs, in order to obtain the regulatory clearances or approvals that we need to commercialize our products and delay commercialization.\nRISKS RELATED TO REGULATORY MATTERS\nIn the future, our Obalon Balloon System may be subject to product recalls that could harm our reputation and business.\nThe FDA and similar governmental authorities in other countries have the authority to require the recall of commercialized products in the event of material regulatory deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture. A government-mandated or voluntary recall by us could occur as a result of component failures, manufacturing errors, design or labeling defects with the Obalon Balloon System and the Obalon Navigation System or deficiencies of other products in the intragastric balloon category. Recalls of our Obalon Balloon System would divert managerial attention, be expensive, harm our reputation with customers and harm our financial condition and results of operations.\nDepending on the corrective action we take to redress a device product\u2019s deficiencies or defects, the FDA may require us, or we may decide to, obtain new approvals, clearances, or other marketing authorizations for the device before we may market or distribute the corrected device. Seeking such authorizations may delay our ability to replace the recalled devices in a timely manner. Moreover, if we do not adequately address problems associated with our devices, we may face additional regulatory enforcement action, including FDA warning letters, Form 483s, product seizure, injunctions, administrative penalties, or civil or criminal fines.\nCompanies are required to maintain certain records of recalls and corrections, even if they are not reportable to the FDA. We may initiate voluntary recalls or corrections for our products in the future that we determine do not require notification of the FDA. If the FDA disagrees with our determinations, they could require us to report those actions as recalls and we may be subject to enforcement action. A future recall announcement could harm our reputation with customers, potentially lead to product liability claims against us and negatively affect our stock price.\nIf patients using our products experience adverse events or other undesirable side effects, regulatory authorities could withdraw or modify our commercial approvals, which would adversely affect our reputation and commercial prospects and/or result in other significant negative consequences.\nUndesirable side effects caused by our Obalon Balloon System could cause us, the FDA or other regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials, and could result in more restrictive labeling than originally required, cause the FDA or other regulatory authorities to subsequently withdraw or modify our PMA or other commercial approvals, or result in the delay or denial of regulatory approval by other notified bodies. For example, in the 1980s and early 1990s, the FDA required additional post-market safety and efficacy data collection and analysis on an earlier version of an intragastric balloon after patients suffered severe side effects and complications with the device, which ultimately resulted in the withdrawal of the PMA approval.\nSince February 2017, the FDA has issued four separate letters (known as Safety Alerts) to health care providers warning of serious adverse events, including deaths, which are specific to liquid-filled intragastric balloons. While the Safety Alerts were specific to liquid-filled intragastric balloons and not gas-filled intragastric balloons, these adverse events could result in the FDA taking action against the entire intragastric balloon category which may cause negative consequences for us including requiring additional warnings, precautions and/or contraindications in the labeling than originally required, delaying or denying approval of our future products, or possible review or withdrawal of our current approval.\nIf we are unable to demonstrate that any adverse events are not related to our product, the FDA or other regulatory authorities could order us to cease further development of, require more restrictive indications for use and/or additional\nwarnings, precautions and/or contraindications in the labeling than originally required, or delay or deny approval of any of our future products. Even if we are able to do so, such event could affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled patients to complete a clinical trial. Moreover, if we elect, or are required, to not initiate, delay, suspend or terminate any future clinical trial of any of our products, the commercial prospects of such product may be harmed and our ability to generate product revenues from our product may be delayed or eliminated. Any of these occurrences may harm our ability to develop other products, and may harm our business, financial condition and prospects significantly.\nIn addition, we or others may later identify undesirable side effects caused by the product (or any other similar product), resulting in potentially significant consequences, including:\n\u25cf the FDA or European notified bodies may withdraw or limit their approval of the product;\n\u25cf the FDA or European notified bodies may require the addition of labeling statements, such as a contraindication;\n\u25cf we may be required to change the way the product is distributed or administered, conduct additional clinical trials or change the labeling of the product;\n\u25cf we may be required to correct or remove the products from the marketplace or decide to conduct a voluntary recall;\n\u25cf we may decide to alert physicians through customer notifications;\n\u25cf the FDA may use publicity such as a press release to alert our customers and the public of the issue;\n\u25cf physicians and patients may be dissatisfied, seek refunds and refuse to use our products;\n\u25cf we could be sued and held liable for injury caused to individuals using our product; and\n\u25cf our reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of our Obalon Balloon System and could substantially increase the costs of commercializing our product and significantly impact our ability to successfully commercialize our product and generate product sales.\nEven though we have received FDA approval of our PMA application to commercially market the Obalon balloon system in the United States, we will continue to be subject to extensive FDA regulatory oversight.\nOur Obalon Balloon System, Obalon Navigation System, and Obalon Touch Inflation Dispenser are medical devices that are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA in the United States and by regulatory agencies in other countries where we do business. We will be required to timely file various reports with the FDA, including reports required by the\nmedical device reporting regulations, or MDRs, that require that we report to the regulatory authorities if our devices may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur. If these reports are not filed timely, regulators may impose sanctions and sales of our products may suffer, and we may be subject to product liability or regulatory enforcement actions, all of which could harm our business.\nWe rely on our U.S. physician customers and international distributors for timely reporting of any adverse events or product malfunctions that occur, which may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur. Notification by our U.S. physician customers and our international distributor on a timely basis or at all of such events could result in product liability or regulatory enforcement actions, both of which could harm our business.\nIn addition, as a condition of approving a PMA application, the FDA may also require some form of post-approval study or post-market surveillance, whereby the applicant conducts a follow-up study or follows certain patient groups for a number of years and makes periodic reports to the FDA on the clinical status of those patients when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device. For example, as part of our PMA\napproval, we are required to conduct a post-approval study at up to 16 sites in the United States to evaluate the safety and efficacy of our Obalon Balloon System in approximately 200 subjects over a twelve-month period, consisting of six months of treatment with the Obalon Balloon System followed by six months of observation after balloon removal. We began patient enrollment in the post approval study in the second quarter of 2018 and in April 2019 we notified the FDA that we had temporarily paused active new patient enrollment to conserve cash resources and ensure we could meet future financial obligations to physicians and patients. We have subsequently notified the FDA in July 2019 that we restarted enrollment and as of March 31, 2020 we enrolled approximately 200 patients, which we believe represents full enrollment, and we would expect to complete follow-up on these patients in 2021. As part of our PMA-S approval of the Obalon Navigation System, we are required to conduct a post-approval study at up to 40 sites in the United States to evaluate the safety and efficacy of our Obalon Navigation System for approximately 4,000 balloon placements, as it relates to the safety and efficacy of acute balloon placement including deployment, but not long-term results such as weight loss. We began enrollment of the Obalon Navigation System post-approval study in December 2019. In the first quarter of 2020, we enrolled 32 patients with 81 balloon administrations in the Obalon Navigation System post-approval study. We have notified the FDA that we have temporarily paused active new patient enrollment as a result of ceasing to ship new product to commercial customers and the closure of the Obalon-branded retail treatment centers. We intend to keep this study paused until we secure a pathway to a product reimbursement trial where we will evaluate how to collect the data required to support this study in conjunction with the data required of a third-party payor or other wise begin commercializing again. This study will have to be resumed in connection with the resumption of manufacturing and distributing the Obalon Balloon System. The product labeling for any product subject to a post-approval study must be updated and submitted in a PMA supplement as results, including any adverse event data, from the post-approval study data become available. Failure to conduct post-approval studies in compliance with applicable regulations or to timely complete required post-approval studies or comply with other post-approval requirements could result in withdrawal of approval of the PMA, which would materially harm our business. Moreover, if post-approval studies of our products reveal unanticipated adverse effects, increases in the incidence of anticipated adverse effects, or device failures, and we are required to modify the approved labeling for our products to include such adverse findings, such labeling modifications could have a materially adverse effect on our ability to market and sell the affected products.\nIf we initiate a correction or removal for one of our devices, issue a safety alert, or undertake a field action or recall to reduce a risk to health posed by the device, we would be required to submit a publicly available Correction and Removal report to the FDA and in many cases, similar reports to other regulatory agencies. This report could be classified by the FDA as a device recall, which could lead to increased scrutiny by the FDA, other international regulatory agencies and our customers regarding the quality and safety of our devices and to negative publicity, including FDA alerts, press releases, or administrative or judicial enforcement actions. Furthermore, the submission of these reports has been and could be used by competitors against us in competitive situations and cause customers to delay purchase decisions or cancel orders and would harm our reputation.\nSince February 2017, the FDA has issued four separate letters to health care providers warning of serious adverse events, including deaths, which are specific to liquid-filled intragastric balloons. The letters were specific to liquid-filled intragastric balloons and not gas-filled intragastric balloons. However, these adverse events associated with liquid-filled intragastric balloons could result in the FDA taking action against the entire gastric balloon category, which may cause negative consequences for us including requiring additional warnings, precautions and/or contraindications in the labeling than originally required, delaying or denying approval of our future products, or possible review or withdrawal of our current approval.\nThe FDA and the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, also regulate the advertising and promotion of our products to ensure that the claims we make are consistent with our regulatory clearances and approvals, that there are adequate and reasonable data to substantiate the claims and that our promotional labeling and advertising is neither false nor misleading in any respect. If the FDA or FTC determines that any of our advertising or promotional claims are false, misleading, not substantiated or not permissible, we may be subject to enforcement actions, including Warning Letters, and we may be required to revise our promotional claims and make other corrections or restitutions.\nAdditionally, the medical device industry\u2019s relationship with physicians is under increasing scrutiny by the Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General, or OIG, the Department of Justice, or DOJ, state attorneys general, and other foreign and domestic government agencies. Our failure to comply with laws, rules and regulations governing our\nrelationships with physicians, or an investigation into our compliance by the OIG, DOJ, state attorneys general and other government agencies, could significantly harm our business.\nThe FDA and state authorities have broad enforcement powers. Our failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in enforcement action by the FDA or state agencies, which may include any of the following sanctions:\n\u25cf adverse publicity, warning letters, untitled letters, Form 483s, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;\n\u25cf repair, replacement, refunds, recalls, termination of distribution, administrative detention or seizures of our products;\n\u25cf operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production;\n\u25cf customer notifications or repair, replacement or refunds;\n\u25cf refusing our requests for 510(k) clearance or PMA approvals or foreign regulatory approvals of new products, new intended uses or modifications to existing products;\n\u25cf withdrawals of current 510(k) clearances or PMAs or foreign regulatory approvals, resulting in prohibitions on sales of our products;\n\u25cf FDA refusal to issue certificates to foreign governments needed to export products for sale in other countries; and\n\u25cf criminal prosecution.\nAny of these sanctions could also result in higher than anticipated costs or lower than anticipated sales and have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, the FDA\u2019s and other regulatory authorities\u2019 policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability, which would adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe also cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative or executive action, either in the United States or abroad. For example, certain policies of the current administration may impact our business and industry. The current administration has taken several executive actions, including the issuance of a number of Executive Orders, that could impose significant burdens on, or otherwise materially delay, FDA\u2019s ability to engage in routine regulatory and oversight activities such as implementing statutes through rulemaking, issuance of guidance, and review and approval of marketing applications. It is difficult to predict how these executive actions, including the Executive Orders, will be implemented, and the extent to which they will affect the FDA\u2019s ability to exercise its regulatory authority. If these executive actions impose constraints on FDA\u2019s ability to engage in oversight and implementation activities in the normal course, our business may be negatively impacted.\nMaterial modifications to our Obalon Balloon System and Obalon Navigation System may require new premarket approvals and may require us to recall or cease marketing our Obalon Balloon System until approvals are obtained.\nOnce a medical device is approved, a manufacturer must notify the FDA of any modifications to the device. Any modification to a device that has received FDA approval that affects its safety or effectiveness requires approval from the FDA pursuant to a PMA supplement. An applicant may make a change in a device approved through a PMA without\nsubmitting a PMA supplement if the change does not affect the safety and effectiveness of the device and the change is reported to FDA in a post-approval periodic report required as a condition of approval. We may not be able to obtain additional premarket approvals for new products or obtain approval of PMA supplements for modifications to, or additional indications for, our Obalon Balloon System in a timely fashion, or at all. Delays in obtaining required future approvals would harm our ability to introduce new or enhanced products in a timely manner, which in turn would harm our future growth. If we make additional modifications in the future that we believe do not or will not require additional approvals and the FDA disagrees and requires new approvals for the modifications, we may be required to recall and to stop selling or marketing our Obalon Balloon System as modified, which could harm our operating results and require us to redesign our Obalon Balloon System and Obalon Navigation System. In these circumstances, we may be subject to significant enforcement actions.\nIf we or our suppliers fail to comply with the FDA and international quality system requirements, our manufacturing operations could be delayed or shut down and sales of our Obalon Balloon System could suffer.\nOur manufacturing processes and those of our third-party suppliers are required to comply with the FDA\u2019s QSR, which covers the procedures and documentation of the design, testing, production, control, quality assurance, inspection, complaint handling, record keeping, management review, labeling, packaging, sterilization, storage and shipping of our Obalon Balloon System. We are also subject to similar state requirements and licenses. In addition, we must engage in extensive record keeping and reporting and must make available our manufacturing facilities and records for periodic unannounced inspections by governmental agencies, including the FDA, state authorities and comparable agencies in other countries. If we are found to not be in compliance at the conclusion of an FDA QSR inspection, our operations could be disrupted and our manufacturing interrupted. Failure to take adequate corrective action in response to an adverse QSR inspection could result in, among other things, issuance of a Warning Letter, a shut-down of our manufacturing operations, significant fines, suspension of marketing clearances and approvals, seizures or recalls of our device, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which would cause our business to suffer. Furthermore, our key component suppliers may not currently be or may not continue to be in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements, which may result in manufacturing delays for our product and cause our revenues to decline.\nWe have registered with the FDA as a medical device manufacturer and have obtained a manufacturing license from the California Department of Public Health, or CDPH. The FDA has broad post-market and regulatory enforcement powers. We are subject to unannounced inspections by the FDA and the Food and Drug Branch of CDPH to determine our compliance with the QSR and other regulations, and these inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of our suppliers. Our current facility has been inspected by the FDA numerous times, the most recent of which occurred in November 2017, which resulted in no observations. Although we believe our manufacturing facilities and those of our critical component suppliers are in compliance with the QSR requirements, we can provide no assurance that we will continue to remain in compliance with the QSR. If our manufacturing facilities or those of any of our component suppliers are found to be in violation of applicable laws and regulations, or we or our suppliers have significant noncompliance issues or fail to timely and adequately respond to any adverse inspectional observations or product safety issues, or if any corrective action plan that we or our suppliers propose in response to observed deficiencies is not sufficient, the FDA could take enforcement action, including any of the following sanctions:\n\u25cf untitled letters, warning letters, and Form 483s;\n\u25cf fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;\n\u25cf customer notifications or repair, replacement, refunds, recall, detention or seizure of our products;\n\u25cf operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;\n\u25cf refusing or delaying our requests for clearance or approval of new products or modified products;\n\u25cf withdrawing clearances or approvals that have already been granted;\n\u25cf refusal to grant export approval for our products; or\n\u25cf criminal prosecution.\nTaking corrective action may be expensive, time consuming and a distraction for management and if we experience a shutdown or delay at our manufacturing facility, we may be unable to produce our Obalon Balloon System, which would materially harm our business.\nOutside the United States, our products and operations are also often required to comply with standards set by industrial standards bodies, such as the International Organization for Standardization. Foreign regulatory bodies may evaluate our products or the testing that our products undergo against these standards. The specific standards, types of evaluation and scope of review differ among foreign regulatory bodies. If we fail to adequately comply with any of these standards, a foreign regulatory body may take adverse actions similar to those within the power of the FDA. Any such action may harm our reputation and could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe also have an ISO 13485:2003 Quality System Certificate through British Standards Institution, or BSI, that is required to support our CE mark. We have been audited at least annually and are subject to unannounced audits by BSI which could result in major nonconformances. Major nonconformances could result in the suspension or revocation of our ISO Certificate, which would disrupt distribution in the European Union and other countries that require certificated Quality Systems.\nOur success depends on our ability to obtain FDA approval or other regulatory approvals for our future products and product improvements.\nThe successful commercialization of the Obalon Balloon System is dependent on the successful development and commercialization of future devices intended to improve the safety, efficacy, ease-of-use or cost of the Obalon Balloon System. A product we have under development includes a longer-term duration balloon, intended to remain in the stomach for up to twelve months.\nWe cannot assure you that this or other devices or improvements we develop will receive regulatory approval in the United States or in other regulatory jurisdictions outside the United States, including the Middle East or CE-Mark. A number of companies in the medical device field have suffered significant setbacks during evaluation due to lack of efficacy or unacceptable safety issues, notwithstanding promising preliminary results. Our failure to receive regulatory approval in jurisdictions outside the United States, in a timely manner or at all, could harm our financial results and ability to become profitable. Even if we obtain regulatory approval for one or more of these new products, the terms of such regulatory approval may limit our ability to successfully market the approved product.\nThe FDA and other regulatory agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations governing the development, approval and commercialization of medical devices. If we are found to have failed to comply with these laws and regulations, we may become subject to significant liability.\nThe Obalon Balloon System is classified by the FDA as a Class III medical device. As a result, we are subject to extensive government regulation in the United States by the FDA and state regulatory authorities. We are also subject to foreign regulatory authorities in the countries in which we currently and intend to conduct business. These regulations relate to, among other things, research and development, design, pre-clinical testing, clinical trials, manufacturing, packaging, storage, premarket approval, environmental controls, safety and efficacy, labeling, advertising, promotion, pricing, recordkeeping, reporting, import and export, post-approval studies and the sale and distribution of the Obalon Balloon System.\nFurther, the FDA and European regulatory authorities strictly regulate the indications for use and associated promotional safety and effectiveness claims, including comparative and superiority claims vis a vis competitors\u2019 products, that may be made about products, such as the Obalon Balloon System. In particular, a medical device may not be promoted for uses or indications that are not approved by the FDA or other regulatory agencies as reflected in the product\u2019s approved labeling. For example, we will not be able to promote or make claims for the Obalon Balloon System for the treatment of patients outside of the BMI ranges specifically approved by the FDA or other regulatory authorities. In the United States, we received FDA approval of the Obalon Balloon System for temporary use to facilitate weight loss in adults with obesity (BMI of 30 to 40) who have failed to lose weight through diet and exercise. The Obalon Balloon System is intended to be used as an adjunct to a moderate intensity diet and behavior modification program. All balloons must be\nremoved six months after the first balloon is placed. Our pivotal trial inclusion and exclusion criteria included patients with a BMI of 30 to 40; thus, our approved labeling is limited to the same BMI range. We also will not be able to make comparative or superiority claims for the Obalon Balloon System versus other products without scientific data supporting or establishing those claims, including possibly data from head-to-head clinical trials if appropriate. Our CE mark label includes patients with a BMI of 27 or greater. As a part of our PMA approval, we are required to conduct a post-approval study at up to 16 sites in the United States to evaluate the safety and efficacy of our Obalon Balloon System over a twelve-month period, consisting of six months of treatment with the Obalon Balloon System followed by six months of observation after balloon removal. We began patient enrollment in the post-approval study in the second quarter of 2018 and in April 2019 we notified the FDA that we had temporarily paused active new patient enrollment to conserve cash resources and ensure we could meet future financial obligations to physicians and patients. We have subsequently notified the FDA in July 2019 that we restarted enrollment and as of December 31, 2020 we have completed enrollment and would expect to complete follow up on these patients in 2021. Failure to conduct post-approval studies in compliance with applicable regulations or to timely complete required post-approval studies or comply with other post-approval requirements could result in withdrawal of approval of the PMA, which would materially harm our business. As part of our PMA-S approval of the Obalon Navigation System, we are required to conduct a post-approval study of up to 40 sites in the United States to evaluate the safety and efficacy of our Obalon Navigation System as it relates to acute balloon placement including deployment. We began enrollment of the Obalon Navigation System post approval study in December 2019. We have notified the FDA that we have temporarily paused active new patient enrollment as a result of ceasing to ship new product to commercial customers and the closure of the Obalon-branded retail treatment centers. We intend to keep this study paused until we secure a pathway to a product reimbursement trial where we will evaluate how to collect the data required to support this study in conjunction with the data required of a third-party payor or otherwise begin commercializing again. This study will have to be resumed in connection with the resumption of manufacturing and distributing the Obalon Balloon System. The product labeling for any product subject to a post-approval study must be updated and submitted in a PMA supplement as results, including any adverse event data, from the post-approval study data become available. Failure to conduct the post-approval study in compliance with applicable regulations or to timely complete required post-approval studies, obtaining results different than our pivotal trial results or failure to comply with other post-approval requirements could result in withdrawal of approval of the PMA, which would harm our business.\nPhysicians may choose to prescribe such products to their patients in a manner that is inconsistent with the approved label, as the FDA does not restrict or regulate a physician\u2019s choice of treatment within the practice of medicine. However, if the FDA determines that our promotional materials or physician training, including our paid consultants\u2019 educational materials, constitutes promotion of an off-label use, it could request that we modify our training or promotional materials or subject us to enforcement action, including warning letters, untitled letters, fines, penalties, or seizures. If we are found to have promoted such off-label uses, we may become subject to significant liability. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines and/or other penalties against companies for alleged improper promotion and has investigated, prosecuted, and/or enjoined several companies from engaging in off-label promotion. The FDA has also requested that companies enter into consent decrees of permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed, curtailed or prohibited. If we cannot successfully manage the promotion of and training for our Obalon Balloon System, we could become subject to significant liability, which would materially adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nDisruptions at the FDA and other government agencies caused by funding shortages or global health concerns could hinder their ability to hire, retain or deploy key leadership and other personnel, or otherwise prevent new or modified products from being developed, cleared or approved or commercialized in a timely manner or at all, which could negatively impact our business.\nThe ability of the FDA to review and clear or approve new products can be affected by a variety of factors, including government budget and funding levels, statutory, regulatory, and policy changes, the FDA\u2019s ability to hire and retain key personnel and accept the payment of user fees, and other events that may otherwise affect the FDA\u2019s ability to perform routine functions. Average review times at the agency have fluctuated in recent years as a result. In addition, government funding of other government agencies that fund research and development activities is subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable. Disruptions at the FDA and other agencies may also slow the time necessary for new medical devices or modifications to cleared or approved medical devices to be reviewed and/or approved by\nnecessary government agencies, which would adversely affect our business. For example, over the last several years, including for 35 days beginning on December 22, 2018, the U.S. government has shut down several times and certain regulatory agencies, such as the FDA, have had to furlough critical FDA employees and stop critical activities.\nSeparately, in response to the global COVID-19 pandemic, on March 10, 2020 the FDA announced its intention to postpone most foreign inspections of manufacturing facilities, and regulatory authorities outside the United States may adopt similar restrictions or other policy measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. If a prolonged government shutdown occurs, or if global health concerns continue to prevent the FDA or other regulatory authorities from conducting their regular inspections, reviews, or other regulatory activities, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA or other regulatory authorities to timely review and process our regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf we fail to obtain and maintain regulatory approval in foreign jurisdictions, our market opportunities will be limited.\nIn order to market our products in the European Union, the Middle East or other foreign jurisdictions, we must obtain and maintain separate regulatory approvals and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements. The approval procedure varies from country to country and can involve additional testing. The time required to obtain approval abroad may be longer than the time required to obtain FDA clearance or approval. Foreign regulatory approval processes include many of the risks associated with obtaining FDA clearance or approval and we may not obtain foreign regulatory approvals on a timely basis, if at all. FDA clearance or approval does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries, and approval by one foreign regulatory authority does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other foreign countries. However, the failure to obtain clearance or approval in one jurisdiction may have a negative impact on our ability to obtain clearance or approval elsewhere. If we do not obtain or maintain necessary approvals to commercialize our products in markets outside the United States, it would negatively affect our overall market penetration. We currently do not have any approvals for the Obalon Navigation System and Obalon Touch Inflation Dispenser outside the U.S., including the Middle East and CE-Mark. Furthermore, given recent changes to the CE-mark process which requires additional filings, the CE Mark for the prior version of the Obalon Balloon System were not renewed in May 2020 and we have not renewed our agreement with our notified body. However, there are certain countries in the Middle East that allow importation of medical device products with United States FDA approval or clearance to meet local regulatory standards, including Qatar.\nIf we fail to comply with healthcare regulations and fraud and abuse laws, we could face substantial penalties and our business, operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nAlthough intragastric balloon products similar to our Obalon Balloon System are not currently reimbursed by U.S. federal healthcare programs (such as Medicare or Medicaid) or other third-party payors, any future reimbursement by third-party payors could expose our business to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that would regulate the business, including laws that would regulate financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute the Obalon Balloon System. Additionally, as a device manufacturer, we are still subject to certain healthcare fraud and abuse regulation, including those laws that apply to self-pay products, and enforcement by the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business.\nApplicable and potentially applicable U.S. federal and state healthcare laws and regulations and their foreign equivalents, include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nAnti-Kickback Laws. The federal healthcare program Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, any person from knowingly and willfully offering, soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, unless the arrangement fits within one of several statutory exceptions or regulatory \u201csafe harbors.\u201d Courts have interpreted the term \u201cremuneration\u201d broadly under the Anti-Kickback Statute to include anything of value, such as, for example, gifts, discounts, payments of cash and waivers of payments. Violations can result in significant penalties, imprisonment and exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare\nprograms. Exclusion of a manufacturer would preclude any federal healthcare program from paying for the manufacturer\u2019s products. A person does not need to have actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, kickback arrangements can provide the basis for an action under the False Claims Act, which is discussed in more detail below.\nGovernment officials have recently increased enforcement efforts with respect to sales and marketing activities of pharmaceutical, medical device, and other healthcare companies, and they have brought cases against individuals and entities that allegedly offered unlawful inducements to potential or existing customers in an attempt to procure business. Settlements of these government cases have involved significant fines and penalties and, in some instances, criminal pleas.\nIn addition to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, many states have their own anti-kickback laws. Often, these laws closely follow the language of the federal law, although they do not always have the same exceptions or safe harbors. In some states, the restrictions imposed by anti-kickback laws are not limited to items and services paid for by government programs but, instead, apply with respect to all payors for healthcare items and services, including commercial health insurance companies.\n\u2022\nFalse Claims Laws. The federal False Claims Act prohibits any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to get a false claim paid. A manufacturer can be held liable under false claims laws, even if it does not submit claims to the government, if it is found to have caused submission of false claims. For example, these laws may apply to a manufacturer that provides information regarding coverage, coding or reimbursement of its products to persons who bill third-party payers. In addition, a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute is deemed to be a violation of the federal False Claims Act.\nThe federal False Claims Act also includes whistleblower provisions that allow private citizens to bring suit against an entity or individual on behalf of the United States and to recover a portion of any monetary recovery. Many of the recent, highly publicized settlements in the healthcare industry relating to sales and marketing practices have related to cases brought under the federal False Claims Act.\nThe majority of states also have adopted statutes or regulations similar to the federal laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs. Sanctions under these federal and state laws may include civil monetary penalties, exclusion of a manufacturer\u2019s products from reimbursement under government programs, criminal fines and imprisonment.\n\u2022\nOther Healthcare Fraud Laws. HIPAA includes criminal health care fraud provisions and related rules that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing a scheme or artifice to defraud any healthcare benefit program or falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any material false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items, or services. Similar to the Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.\n\u2022\nTransparency Laws. There has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments and transfers of value provided to healthcare professionals and entities. For example, the Physician Payment Sunshine Act, imposes annual reporting requirements on certain manufacturers of drugs, medical devices, biologics and medical supplies with respect to payments and other transfers of value provided by them, directly or indirectly, to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), certain other health care professionals beginning in 2022, and teaching hospitals, as well as with respect to certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their family members. A manufacturer\u2019s failure to submit timely, accurately and completely the required information regarding all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests may result in civil monetary penalties. Certain states also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs, impose restrictions on medical device manufacturers\u2019 marketing practices, require reporting of marketing\nand pricing information, and require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to healthcare professionals and entities under certain circumstances.\nEfforts to ensure that our business arrangements will comply with applicable healthcare laws may involve substantial costs. In addition, the dynamic healthcare regulatory compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust systems to comply with different reporting and other legal requirements in multiple jurisdictions, increase the possibility that a healthcare company may fail to comply fully with one or more of these laws or regulations. It is possible that governmental and enforcement authorities will conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations, agency guidance or case law interpreting applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, defending against any such actions can be costly, time-consuming and may require significant financial and personnel resources. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the healthcare regulatory laws to which the business is subject, or any other laws that apply to the business, we may be subject to penalties, including potentially significant criminal and civil and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, additional compliance and reporting requirements, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.\nIn addition, the clearance or approval and commercialization of any of our products outside the United States will also likely subject us to foreign equivalents of the healthcare laws mentioned above, among other foreign laws.\nIf retail arrangements with physicians or customers are found to violate state laws prohibiting the corporate practice of medicine or fee splitting, our business, financial condition and our ability to operate in those states could be adversely impacted.\nThe practice of medicine is highly regulated, and any future operation of retail treatment centers, arrangements with physicians and interactions with retail customers will be subject to federal, state or local laws, rules and regulations, any of which may change from time to time. Regulatory oversight includes, but is not limited to, the corporate practice of medicine, fee-splitting, regulation and registration of medical practices, clinics and facilities and management companies by state and local licensing boards or other agencies, licensure and scope of practice limitation for physicians and other healthcare professionals, advertising and consumer protection laws. Certain states have laws, rules and regulations which require that medical practices be owned by licensed physicians and that business entities which are not owned by licensed physicians refrain from providing, or holding themselves out as providers of, medical care. These laws generally prohibit the practice of medicine by lay entities or persons and are intended to prevent unlicensed persons or entities from interfering with or inappropriately influencing the physician\u2019s professional judgment. The specific restrictions with respect to enforcement of the corporate practice of medicine and fee-splitting laws varies from state to state. Such laws may make it difficult for us to establish or expand our operations into a state, as interpretive legal precedent and regulatory guidance varies by jurisdiction and is often sparse and not fully developed. A determination that we are in violation of applicable restrictions on the practice of medicine or fee-splitting in any jurisdiction in which we operate, could have a material adverse effect on us, particularly if we are unable to restructure our operations and arrangements to comply with the requirements of that jurisdiction, if we are required to restructure our operations and arrangements at a significant cost, or if we are subject to penalties or other adverse action.\nIf we or our affiliated physicians fail to comply with licensing and accreditation requirements applicable to our business, various governmental agencies may impose fines or preclude us from operating in certain states.\nFederal, state, and local laws and policies impose various registration, accreditation, permit and/or licensing requirements on healthcare facilities and subject healthcare facilities to regulations ranging from the adequacy of medical care, to compliance with building codes and environmental protection laws. Additionally, physicians at our retail treatment centers, once operational, will also be subject to various state and federal regulations, including utilization of diagnostic tests and regarding prescribing medication and controlled substances. Delays or failures to obtain or maintain any required registrations, accreditations, permits and other licenses could adversely impact our ability to establish and operate our retail treatment centers.\nMoreover, each state defines the scope of practice of physicians and other healthcare professionals through legislation and through their respective boards of medicine and we will need to comply with laws related to the physician supervision of services and scope of practice requirements. Activities that qualify as professional misconduct under state law may subject our personnel to sanctions, or may even result in loss of their license and could, possibly, subject us to sanctions as well. Some state boards of medicine impose reciprocal discipline, that is, if a physician is disciplined for having committed professional misconduct in one state where he or she is licensed, another state where he or she is also licensed may impose the same discipline even though the conduct occurred in another state. Our ability to operate profitably will depend, in part, upon our ability and the ability of our affiliated physicians and retail treatment centers to obtain and maintain all necessary licenses and other approvals and operate in compliance with applicable healthcare and other laws and regulations that evolve rapidly.\nWe are subject to data privacy and security laws and regulations governing our collection, use, disclosure, or storage of personally identifiable information, including personal health information, which may impose restrictions on us and our operations and subject us to penalties if we are unable to fully comply with such laws.\nIn order to provide our services and solutions, we routinely receive, process, transmit and store personally identifiable information, or PII, including personal health information, of individuals, as well as other financial, confidential and proprietary information belonging to our patients and third parties from which we obtain information. The receipt, maintenance, protection, use, transmission, disclosure and disposal of this information is regulated at the federal and state levels and we also have obligations with respect to this information pursuant to our contractual requirements with customers. These laws, rules and requirements are subject to frequent change. Compliance with new privacy and security laws, regulations and requirements may result in increased operating costs and may constrain or require us to alter our business model or operations.\nHIPAA requires certain entities, referred to as \u201ccovered entities\u201d (including most healthcare providers and health plans), to comply with established standards, including standards regarding the privacy and security of PHI. HIPAA further requires that covered entities enter into agreements meeting certain regulatory requirements with their \u201cbusiness associates,\u201d as such term is defined by HIPAA, which, among other things, obligate business associates to safeguard the covered entity\u2019s PHI against improper use and disclosure. In addition, a business associate may face significant statutory and contractual liability if the business associate breaches the agreement or causes the covered entity to fail to comply with HIPAA. We believe that our Company-owned or managed treatment centers were required to be HIPAA compliant; we do not believe our corporate offices are required to be HIPAA compliant, but are nevertheless committed to maintaining the security and privacy of patients\u2019 health information. Violation of HIPAA could result in the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nNumerous other federal, state and foreign laws may apply that restrict the use and protect the privacy and security of PII, including health information. These include state medical privacy laws, state social security number protection laws, state breach notification laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws. These various laws in many cases are not preempted by HIPAA and may be subject to varying interpretations by the courts and government agencies. For instance, In Europe, the GDPR, went into effect in May 2018 and imposes stringent data protection requirements for controllers and processors of personal data of persons within the EU. The GDPR applies to any company established in the EU as well as to those outside the EU if they collect and use personal data in connection with the offering of goods or services to individuals in the EU or the monitoring of their behavior. Companies that must comply with the GDPR face increased compliance obligations and risk, including more robust regulatory enforcement of data protection requirements and potential fines for noncompliance of up to \u20ac20 million or 4% of the annual global revenues of the noncompliant company, whichever is greater. In addition, the United Kingdom leaving the EU could also lead to further legislative and regulatory changes. It remains unclear how the United Kingdom data protection laws or regulations will develop in the medium to longer term and how data transfer to the United Kingdom from the EU will be regulated, especially following the United Kingdom's departure from the EU on January 31, 2020 without a deal. However, the United Kingdom has transposed the GDPR into domestic law with the Data Protection Act 2018, which remains in force following the United Kingdom's departure from the EU.\nNoncompliance or findings of noncompliance with applicable laws, regulations or requirements, or the occurrence of any privacy or security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of sensitive personal\ninformation, whether by us or by one of our third party service providers, could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business, including, among other consequences, mandatory disclosure to the media, loss of existing or new patients, significant increases in the cost of managing and remediating privacy or security incidents and material fines, penalties and litigation awards, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nFurther, as regulatory focus on privacy issues continues to increase and laws and regulations concerning the protection of personal information expand and become more complex, these potential risks to our business could intensify. We expect that there will continue to be new proposed laws, regulations and industry standards concerning privacy, data protection and information security in the United States, including the California Consumer Privacy Act, which went into effect January 1, 2020. The CCPA creates individual privacy rights for California consumers and increases the privacy and security obligations of entities handling certain personal data. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation. The CCPA may increase our compliance costs and potential liability, and many similar laws have been proposed at the federal level and in other states. We cannot yet determine the impact such future laws, regulations and standards may have on our business. Changes in laws or regulations associated with the enhanced protection of certain types of sensitive data, including health data, along with increased patient demands for enhanced data security infrastructure, could greatly increase our cost of providing our services, decrease demand for our services, reduce our revenue and/or subject us to additional liabilities.\nCompliance with environmental laws and regulations could be expensive. Failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations could subject us to significant liability.\nWhen operational, our research and development and manufacturing operations involve the use of hazardous substances and a greenhouse gas, and are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations relating to the storage, use, discharge, disposal, remediation of, and human exposure to, hazardous substances and the sale, labeling, collection, recycling, treatment and disposal of products containing hazardous substances as well as the control and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, such operations produce biological waste materials, such as human and animal tissue, and waste solvents, such as isopropyl alcohol. These operations are permitted by regulatory authorities, and, when operational, we disposed of the resultant waste materials in material compliance with environmental laws and regulations.\nLiability under environmental laws and regulations can be joint and several and without regard to fault or negligence. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations may be expensive and non-compliance could result in substantial liabilities, fines and penalties, personal injury and third part property damage claims and substantial investigation and remediation costs. Environmental laws and regulations could become more stringent over time, imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with violations. We cannot assure you that violations of these laws and regulations will not occur in the future or have not occurred in the past as a result of human error, accidents, equipment failure or other causes. The expense associated with environmental regulation and remediation could harm our financial condition and results of operations.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nIf we are unable to adequately protect our proprietary technology or maintain issued patents that are sufficient to protect our Obalon Balloon System or our other products, others could compete against us more directly, which would have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nOur commercial success will depend in part on our ability to protect our proprietary rights to the technologies and inventions used in, or embodied by, our products. We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secret laws and confidentiality and invention assignment agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. If we do not adequately protect our intellectual property rights and proprietary technology, competitors may be able to use our technologies and erode or negate any competitive advantage that we may have, which could harm our business and ability to achieve profitability.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we held 29 issued U.S. patents and had 17 pending U.S. patent applications, as well as 22 international patents issued in regions including Europe, Mexico, Australia, Canada, Asia, and China and 59 pending international patent applications in regions including Australia, Canada, Europe, Asia, the Middle East and South America. Our issued patents expire between the years 2023 and 2038, and are directed to various features and combinations of features of the Obalon Balloon System technology, including the apparatus for connecting the balloon to an inflation catheter, the structure and composition of the balloon wall, and the composition of the initial fill gas.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we held two registered U.S. trademarks and 34 registered marks in Europe, the Middle East, Asia and Mexico. We have four pending U.S. trademark applications and no pending marks outside the United States.\nAlthough an issued patent is presumed valid and enforceable, its issuance is not conclusive as to its validity or its enforceability, and it may not provide us with adequate proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar products. Competitors may also be able to design around our patents. Other parties may develop and obtain patent protection for more effective technologies, designs or methods.\nThe degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain, and we cannot ensure that:\n\u25cf any of our patents, or any of our pending patent applications, if issued, will include claims having a scope sufficient to protect the Obalon Balloon System or any other products;\n\u25cf any of our pending patent applications will issue as patents;\n\u25cf we will be able to successfully commercialize our Obalon Balloon System before our relevant patents expire;\n\u25cf we were the first to make the inventions shown in each of our patents and pending patent applications;\n\u25cf we were the first to file patent applications for these inventions;\n\u25cf others will not develop similar or alternative technologies that do not infringe our patents;\n\u25cf any of our patents will be found to ultimately be valid and enforceable;\n\u25cf any patents issued to us will provide a basis for an exclusive market for our commercially viable products, will provide us with any competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties;\n\u25cf we will develop additional proprietary technologies or products that are separately patentable;\n\u25cf our commercial activities or products will not infringe the patents of others; or\n\u25cf we will be in the financial position to defend our trademarks and patents.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information and know-how, the value of our technology and products could be adversely affected.\nIn addition to patent protection, we also rely on other proprietary rights, including protection of unpatented trade secrets, unpatented know-how and confidential and proprietary information, which we seek to protect, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our employees and our collaborators and consultants. We also have agreements with our employees and selected consultants that obligate them to assign their inventions to us and have non-compete agreements with some, but not all, of our consultants. It is possible that technology relevant to our business will become known or be independently developed by a person that is not a party to such an agreement, including our competitors. We may not be able to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of our technical knowledge or trade secrets by consultants, vendors, former employees and current employees. If the employees and consultants who are parties to these agreements breach or violate the terms of these agreements, we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach or violation, and we could lose our trade secrets through such breaches or violations.\nWe may be subject to claims challenging the inventorship or ownership of our patents and other intellectual property.\nWe may also be subject to claims that former employees, collaborators or other third parties have an ownership interest in our patents or other intellectual property. For example, each of our patents and patent applications names one or more inventors having past or present affiliations with other institutions, and any of these institutions may assert an ownership claim. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these and other claims challenging inventorship or ownership. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights, such as ownership of, or right to use, valuable intellectual property. Such an outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees.\nWe may infringe or be alleged to infringe the intellectual property rights of others, which may result in costly and time-consuming litigation, delay our product development efforts or prevent us from commercializing the Obalon Balloon System.\nOur success will depend in part on our ability to operate without infringing the intellectual property and proprietary rights of third parties. The medical device industry is characterized by rapid technological change and extensive litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. Our competitors and other industry participants, many of which have substantially greater resources and have made substantial investments in patent portfolios and competing technologies, may have applied for or obtained, or may in the future apply for and obtain, patents that will prevent, limit or otherwise interfere with our ability to make, use and sell our products. In addition, numerous third-party patents exist in the fields relating to our products. We cannot assure you that our business, products and methods do not or will not infringe the patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties.\nFrom time to time, third parties, including our competitors as well as other industry participants and/or non-practicing entities, may allege that the Obalon Balloon System or the use of our technologies infringes patent claims or other intellectual property rights held by them or that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization. For example, during 2017, we settled intellectual property infringement claims made by two separate third parties. We believed the claims in both instances were meritless but settled the matters for a nominal cash payment and aggregate stock issuances of 17,500 shares, in exchange for which we received a general release of all claims. Additionally, we have received and may from time to time in the ordinary course of business continue to receive, letters from third parties advising us of third-party patents that may relate to our business. The letters typically do not explicitly seek any particular action or relief from us. Although these letters do not threaten legal action, these letters may be deemed to put us on notice that continued operation of our business might infringe the patent rights of such third parties. If we decide not to seek a license or do not otherwise obtain a license to such third-party patents, there can be no assurance that we will not become subject to infringement claims or will not be forced to initiate legal proceedings in order to dispose of such actual or potential infringement claims or to seek to invalidate the claims of such third-party patents.\nPatent and other types of intellectual property litigation can involve complex factual and legal questions, and can have an uncertain outcome. Any claim relating to intellectual property infringement that is successfully asserted against us may require us to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorney fees if we are found to be willfully infringing another party\u2019s patents, for past use of the asserted intellectual property and royalties and other consideration going forward if we determine it necessary or are required to take a license. In addition, if any such claim were successfully asserted against us and we could not obtain such a license, an injunction may force us to stop or delay developing, manufacturing, selling or otherwise commercializing the Obalon Balloon System or our other products.\nIntellectual property claims or litigation, regardless of merit, may be expensive and time-consuming to resolve, result in negative publicity, and divert our management\u2019s attention from our core business. In addition, if we are subject to intellectual property claims or litigation, we may:\n\u25cf be subject to a protected period of uncertainty while the claims or litigation remain unresolved, which could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital and otherwise adversely affect our business;\n\u25cf lose the opportunity to license our technology to others or to collect royalty payments based upon successful protection and assertion of our intellectual property rights against others; and\n\u25cf be required to redesign those products that contain the allegedly infringing intellectual property, which could be costly, disruptive and/or infeasible.\nFurthermore, we also rely on our trademarks as one means to distinguish our products from the products of our competitors, and have registered or applied to register many of these trademarks. However, our trademark applications may not be approved. Third parties may oppose our trademark applications, or otherwise challenge our use of the trademarks. In the event that our trademarks are successfully challenged, we could be forced to rebrand our products, which could result in loss of brand recognition and could require us to devote resources to advertising and marketing new brands. Our competitors may infringe our trademarks and we may not have adequate resources to enforce our trademarks.\nIf any of the risks described above come to fruition, our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects could be harmed.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nThe U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or US PTO, and various international, foreign governmental and foreign regional patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other provisions during the patent application process. In addition, periodic maintenance fees on issued patents often must be paid to the US PTO and foreign patent agencies over the lifetime of the patent. There are situations in which noncompliance with these requirements can result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, competitors might be able to enter the market earlier than would otherwise have been the case. Our recent reduction in personnel to two full time employees may heighten this risk.\nWe may be involved in legal proceedings to protect or enforce our intellectual property, which could be expensive, time-consuming, and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe our patents, trademarks or other intellectual property rights. Our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights depends on our ability to identify infringement. It may be difficult to identify infringers who do not advertise the components of their products. Moreover, it may be difficult or impossible to obtain evidence of infringement in a competitor\u2019s or potential competitor\u2019s product.\nTo counter infringement of our intellectual property rights, we have in the past been, and may in the future be, required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming. Even if successful, litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly and time-consuming and would divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations. Moreover, we may not have sufficient resources to bring these actions to a successful conclusion. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded if we were to prevail may not be commercially meaningful. In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours is not infringed and may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question.\nInterference proceedings instituted by third parties or brought by us may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to our patents or patent applications. An unfavorable outcome could require us to cease using the related technology or to attempt to obtain a license under such rights from the prevailing party. Our business could be harmed if the prevailing party does not offer us a license on commercially reasonable terms or offer us a license at all. Our defense of interference proceedings may fail and, even if successful, may result in substantial costs and distract our management and other employees.\nFurthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. There could also be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nIssued patents covering our products could be found invalid or unenforceable if challenged in court or before administrative bodies.\nIf we initiated legal proceedings against a third party to enforce one of our patents, the defendant could counterclaim that the patent is invalid and/or unenforceable. Even if legal proceedings were not initiated, if we threatened a third party with a patent infringement lawsuit, the third party preemptively may sue us in a declaratory judgment action and seek to have our patent declared invalid or not infringed. In patent litigation in the United States, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity and/or unenforceability are commonplace. Grounds for a validity challenge include alleged failures to meet any of several statutory requirements, including lack of novelty, obviousness or non-enablement. Grounds for unenforceability assertions include allegations that someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant information from the U.S. PTO, or made a misleading statement during prosecution. Third parties may also raise similar claims before administrative bodies in the United States or abroad, even outside the context of litigation. Such mechanisms include reexamination, post-grant review and equivalent proceedings in foreign jurisdictions, e.g., opposition proceedings. Such proceedings could result in revocation or amendment of our patents in such a way that they no longer cover our products or competitive products. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable. With respect to validity, for example, we cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art of which we and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. If a third party were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity and/or unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection on our products. Such a loss of patent protection would have a material adverse impact on our business. An adverse result in any legal proceeding could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated, found unenforceable or interpreted narrowly and could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing.\nWe do not seek to protect our intellectual property rights in all jurisdictions throughout the world and we may not be able to adequately enforce our intellectual property rights even in the jurisdictions where we seek protection.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending intellectual property rights related to our products in all countries and jurisdictions throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States could be less extensive than those in the United States. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States, or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with our products, and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.\nIn addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and we may encounter significant problems in protecting our proprietary rights in these countries. If these problems were to occur, they could have a material adverse effect on our sales. Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to medical devices, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly, could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be\ncommercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep any competitive advantage.\nChanges in U.S. patent law could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our products.\nThe United States has enacted and is implementing the America Invents Act of 2011, a wide-ranging patent reform legislation. Further, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled on several patent cases in recent years, either narrowing the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances or weakening the rights of patent owners in certain situations. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain future patents, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents, once obtained. Depending on decisions by the U.S. Congress, the federal courts and the US PTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents or future patents.\nWe may be subject to damages resulting from claims that we, our employees, consultants or third parties we engage to manufacture our products have wrongfully used, or disclosed, alleged trade secrets of our competitors or are in breach of non-competition or non-solicitation agreements with our competitors.\nMany of our current and former employees were previously employed at pharmaceutical companies and other medical device companies, including our potential competitors, in some cases until recently. We may be subject to claims that we, our current and former employees, consultants or third parties have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed alleged trade secrets or proprietary information of these former employers or competitors. In addition, we may be subject to claims that we caused a current or former employee to breach the terms of his or her non-competition or non-solicitation agreement. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and could be a distraction for our management. If our defense to those claims fails, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Any litigation or the threat thereof may adversely affect our ability to hire employees or contract with third parties. A loss of key personnel or their work product could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRISKS RELATED TO OWNERSHIP OF OUR COMMON STOCK\nThe sale or issuance of our common stock to Lincoln Park may cause dilution and the sale of the shares of common stock acquired by Lincoln Park, or the perception that such sales may occur, could cause the price of our common stock to fall.\nOn February 5, 2020, we entered into the Purchase Agreement with Lincoln Park, pursuant to which Lincoln Park has committed to purchase up to $15,000,000 of our common stock. The shares of our common stock that may be issued under the Purchase Agreement may be sold by us to Lincoln Park at our discretion from time to time over a 36-month period commencing after the satisfaction of certain conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement, including that the SEC has declared effective the registration statement filed with the SEC on February 7, 2020. The purchase price for the shares that we may sell to Lincoln Park under the Purchase Agreement will fluctuate based on the price of our common stock. Depending on market liquidity at the time, sales of such shares may cause the trading price of our common stock to fall.\nWe generally have the right to control the timing and amount of any sales of our shares to Lincoln Park under the Purchase Agreement. Sales of our common stock, if any, to Lincoln Park under the Purchase Agreement will depend upon market conditions and other factors to be determined by us. We may ultimately decide to sell to Lincoln Park all, some or none of the shares of our common stock that may be available for us to sell pursuant to the Purchase Agreement. If and when we do sell shares to Lincoln Park, after Lincoln Park has acquired the shares, Lincoln Park may resell all, some or none of those shares at any time or from time to time in its discretion. Therefore, sales to Lincoln Park by us could result in substantial dilution to the interests of other holders of our common stock. Additionally, the sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock to Lincoln Park, or the anticipation of such sales, could make it more\ndifficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and at a price that we might otherwise wish to effect sales.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we have not sold any shares of our stock under the Purchase Agreement with Lincoln Park.\nOur stock price may be volatile, and you may not be able to resell shares of our common stock at or above the price you paid.\nThe public trading price for our common stock can be affected by a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf a slowdown in the medical device industry, the aesthetics industry or the general economy;\n\u25cf whether we obtain coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors;\n\u25cf quarterly variations in our or our competitors' results of operations;\n\u25cf the results of our clinical trials;\n\u25cf unanticipated or serious safety concerns related to the use of any of our products or competitive liquid-filled intragastric balloon products;\n\u25cf adverse regulatory decisions, including failure to receive regulatory approval for any of our products;\n\u25cf regulatory or legal developments in the United States and other countries;\n\u25cf changes in analysts\u2019 estimates, investors\u2019 perceptions, recommendations by securities analysts or our failure to achieve analysts\u2019 estimates;\n\u25cf the financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections or our failure to meet these projections;\n\u25cf changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of other technology companies generally, or those in the medical device industry in particular;\n\u25cf performance of third parties on whom we rely, including for the manufacture of the components for our product, including their ability to comply with regulatory requirements;\n\u25cf inability to obtain adequate supply of the components for any of our products, or inability to do so at acceptable prices;\n\u25cf the loss of key personnel, including changes in our board of directors and management;\n\u25cf legislation or regulation of our business;\n\u25cf changes in the structure of healthcare payment systems;\n\u25cf our commencement of, or involvement in, litigation;\n\u25cf the announcement of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf competition from existing technologies and products or new technologies and products that may emerge;\n\u25cf negative publicity, such as whistleblower complaints, about us or our products;\n\u25cf developments, announcements or disputes related to patents or other proprietary rights issued to us or our competitors and to litigation;\n\u25cf ability to meet Nasdaq minimum listing requirements; and\n\u25cf developments in our industry.\nIn recent years, the stock markets generally and the stock prices of many companies in the medical device industry have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. Broad market and industry factors may significantly affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. As a result of this volatility, you may not be able to sell your common stock at or above the price at which you purchased it and you may lose some or all of your investment.\nIf we fail to meet all applicable Nasdaq Capital Market requirements, Nasdaq could delist our common stock, which could adversely affect the market liquidity of our common stock and the market price of our common stock could decrease.\nNasdaq monitors our ongoing compliance with its minimum listing requirements and if we fail to meet those requirements and cannot cure such failure in the prescribed period of time, our common stock could be subject to delisting from the Nasdaq market.\nOn August 6, 2020, we received two written notifications from the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Staff that we were not in compliance with the Nasdaq Global Market\u2019s minimum bid price or market capitalization requirements for continued listing. Subsequently, we applied to transfer the listing of our common stock from the Nasdaq Global Market to the Nasdaq Capital Market. On December 10, 2020, Nasdaq notified us that our application transfer had been approved and the listing of our common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market would be effective December 17, 2020. On December 16, 2020, we received a letter from Nasdaq indicating that we had regained compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s minimum bid price requirement. Upon the effective transfer of our common stock to the Nasdaq Capital Market on December 17, 2020, we regained compliance with the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq. We may not continue to be in compliance with the continued listing standards of Nasdaq and the Combined Company may not satisfy the initial listing standards of the Nasdaq Capital Market, as described in more detail above.\nIn the event that our common stock is delisted from the Nasdaq Global Market and is not eligible for quotation or listing on another market or exchange, trading of our common stock could be conducted only in the over-the-counter market or on an electronic bulletin board established for unlisted securities such as the Pink Sheets or the OTC Bulletin Board. In such event, it could become more difficult to dispose of, or obtain accurate price quotations for, our common stock, and there would likely also be a reduction in our coverage by securities analysts and the news media, which could cause the price of our common stock to decline further. Also, it may be difficult for us to raise additional capital if we are not listed on a major exchange.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, publish negative reports about our business, or publish financial projections that we are unable to achieve, our share price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business, our market and our competitors, and their projections of our financial results. We do not have any control over these analysts and currently are not covered by any analysts. If analysts do cover us and downgrade our shares, change their opinion of our shares, change their financial projections, publish negative information about us or if we are unable to achieve their financial projections for us, our share price would likely decline. Several analysts that previously provided coverage of us have ceased to do so or have failed to regularly publish reports on us. If analysts fail to regularly publish reports on us, our visibility in the financial markets could decline even further, which could cause our share price or trading volume to decline. In addition, analysts may publish negative opinions concerning our company, business strategy or accounting policies, which could negatively impact our share price.\nWe are an emerging growth company, and intend to take advantage of reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, which could make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an emerging growth company, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenue of $1.07 billion or more; (ii) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the completion of our IPO; (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous three years; or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the SEC, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter. For so long as we remain an emerging growth company, we are permitted and intend to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. These exemptions include:\n\u25cf not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;\n\u25cf not being required to comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor\u2019s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements;\n\u25cf reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation; and\n\u25cf exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\nWe may choose to take advantage of some, but not all, of the available exemptions described above. We cannot predict whether investors will find our common stock less attractive if we rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nIn addition, the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This allows an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, we are subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.\nOur executive officers, directors, principal stockholders and their affiliates have significant influence over our company, which will limit your ability to influence corporate matters and could delay or prevent a change in corporate control.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our executive officers, directors, holders of 5% or more of our capital stock and their respective affiliates beneficially owned approximately 21% of our outstanding capital stock. These stockholders may be able to influence the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval. For example, these stockholders may be able to influence elections of directors, amendments of our organizational documents or approval of any merger, sale of assets or other major corporate transaction. This may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our common stock that you may feel are in your best interest as one of our stockholders. The interests of this group of stockholders may not always coincide with your interests or the interests of other stockholders and they may act in a manner that advances their best interests and not necessarily those of other stockholders, including seeking a premium value for their common stock, and might affect the prevailing market price for our common stock.\nWe are subject to securities class action litigation.\nOn February 14 and 22, 2018, plaintiff stockholders filed class action lawsuits against us and certain of our executive officers in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California (Hustig v. Obalon Therapeutics, Inc., et al., Case No. 3:18-cv-00352-AJB-WVG, and Cook v. Obalon Therapeutics, Inc. et al., Case No. 3:18-cv-00407-CAB-RBB). On July 24, 2018, the court consolidated the lawsuits and appointed Inter-Local Pension Fund GCC/IBT as lead plaintiff. On October 5, 2018, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint. The amended complaint alleges that we and certain of our executive officers made false and misleading statements and failed to disclose material adverse facts about our business, operations, and prospects in violation of Sections 10(b) (and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. The amended complaint also alleges violations of Section 11 of the Exchange Act arising out of the Company\u2019s initial public offering. The plaintiffs seek damages, interest, costs, attorneys' fees, and other unspecified equitable relief. The underwriters from our initial public offering have also been named as defendants in this case and we have certain obligations under the underwriting agreement to indemnify them for their costs and expenses incurred in connection with this litigation.\nOn September 25, 2019, the court granted in part and denied in part the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss. The court dismissed the Section 11 claims entirely, without leave to amend, and accordingly dismissed the underwriters and certain directors from the case. The Court also dismissed certain statements from the Section 10 claims.\nOn August 17, 2020, the parties submitted a final settlement agreement of the securities class action for court approval. A hearing on final settlement approval is scheduled for April 22, 2021. The settlement provides for a payment of $3.15 million to the plaintiffs, and provides that the defendants continue to deny the allegations and claims asserted by the plaintiffs, and are entering into the settlement solely to eliminate the burden and expense of further litigation. The Company expects that any amounts due as part of the settlement will be covered by the Company\u2019s insurance policies.\nSuch litigation could subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our business and harm our business, results of operations, financial condition, reputation and cash flows. These factors may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nBecause we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future, capital appreciation, if any, will be your sole source of gain.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not currently intend to do so for the foreseeable future. We currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development, operation and expansion of our business. Any return to stockholders will be limited to the appreciation of stock. Therefore, the success of an investment in shares of our common stock will depend upon any future appreciation in the value of the stock. We cannot guarantee you that shares of our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which our stockholders have purchased their shares.\nGENERAL RISK FACTORS\nWe may face product liability claims that could result in costly litigation and significant liabilities.\nOur business exposes us to the risk of product liability claims that are inherent in the manufacturing, marketing and selling of medical devices, including those which may arise from the misuse or malfunction of, or design flaws in, our products. Claims may be made by patients, healthcare providers or others selling our products. We may be subject to product liability claims if our products cause, or merely appear to have caused, an injury. In addition, we may be subject to claims against us even if the apparent injury is due to the actions of others or the pre-existing health of the patient.\nWe also may be subject to claims against us due to actions of others. We rely on physicians in connection with the placement and subsequent removal at the end of the six-month treatment period of our Obalon balloon. If these\nphysicians are not properly trained, are negligent, or willfully decide not to follow the instructions for use, the capabilities of our products may be diminished or the patient may suffer critical injury. We may face negative consequences from misconduct of physicians despite our best efforts to remediate situations arising from negligence of the physicians and may also face negative consequences from nonconformity of patient therapy. We may also be subject to claims that are caused by the activities of our suppliers, such as those who provide us with components and raw materials. This risk exists even if a device or product is cleared or approved for commercial sale by the FDA or other foreign regulators and manufactured in facilities registered with and regulated by the FDA or an applicable foreign regulatory authority.\nAlthough we have, and intend to maintain, product liability and clinical trial liability insurance that we believe is appropriate, this insurance is subject to deductibles and coverage limitations. Our current product liability insurance may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all, and, if available, the coverages may not be adequate to protect us against any future product liability claims. In addition, we may seek additional insurance coverage; however, if we are unable to obtain insurance at an acceptable cost or on acceptable terms with adequate coverage or otherwise protect against potential product liability claims, we will be exposed to significant liabilities, which may harm our business. A product liability claim, recall or other claim with respect to uninsured liabilities or for amounts in excess of insured liabilities could result in significant costs and significant harm to our business.\nFor instance, patients could be harmed by the Obalon balloon if it is improperly inflated, inflated in the body other than in the stomach, not removed at the end of the six-month treatment period resulting in deflation, or if it deflates prematurely while in the body. Additionally, we do not sell our product sterilized, and it may be contaminated with forms of microorganisms prior to use. Any failure to follow the physician\u2019s directions for use or the patient information guide, or any other defects, misuse or abuse associated with our product, could result in patient injury or death. The medical device industry has historically been subject to extensive litigation over product liability claims, and we cannot assure you that we will not face product liability suits.\nIn addition, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in:\n\u25cf impairment of our brand and business reputation;\n\u25cf costly litigation;\n\u25cf distraction of management\u2019s attention from our primary business;\n\u25cf loss of revenue;\n\u25cf the inability to commercialize our product;\n\u25cf decreased demand for our product;\n\u25cf product recall or withdrawal from the market;\n\u25cf withdrawal of clinical trial participants; and\n\u25cf substantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants.\nWhile we may attempt to manage our product liability exposure by proactively recalling or withdrawing from the market any defective products, or by refusing to sell to any physician not following the physicians' directions for use, any recall or market withdrawal of, or refusal to sell, our products may delay the supply of those products to our customers and may impact our reputation. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in initiating appropriate recall or market withdrawal efforts that may be required in the future or that these efforts will have the intended effect of preventing product malfunctions and the accompanying product liability that may result. Any such recalls and market withdrawals may also be used by our competitors to harm our reputation for safety or be perceived by patients as a safety risk when considering the use of our products, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nSince we began selling in the United States in January 2017, we have reported adverse events relating to patient injuries associated with use of the Obalon balloon in the FDA's MAUDE database. To-date, none of these adverse events have resulted in product liability claims against us.\nIf there are significant disruptions in our information technology systems including a cybersecurity breach, our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.\nThe efficient operation of our business depends on our information technology systems. We rely on our information technology systems to effectively manage sales and marketing data, accounting and financial functions, inventory, product development tasks, quality assurance, clinical data, and customer service and technical support functions. Our information technology systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, fires, floods and other natural disasters, terrorist attacks, computer viruses, ransomware or other malware, attacks by computer hackers, failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases or components thereof, power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication failures, user errors or other catastrophic events. Attacks upon information technology systems are increasing in their frequency, levels of persistence, sophistication and intensity, and are being conducted by sophisticated and organized groups and individuals with a wide range of motives and expertise. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we may face increased cybersecurity risks due to our reliance on internet technology and the number of our employees who are working remotely, which may create additional opportunities for cybercriminals to exploit vulnerabilities. In addition, a variety of our software systems are cloud-based data management applications hosted by third-party service providers whose security and information technology systems are subject to similar risks. Numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats pose potential risks to the security of our information technology systems, networks and products, as well as the confidentiality and integrity of our data. A security breach could impact the use of such products and the security of information stored therein.\nThe failure of our service providers\u2019 information technology could disrupt our entire operation or result in decreased sales, increased overhead costs and product shortages. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed or ongoing clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. A number of proposed and enacted federal, state and international laws and regulations obligate companies to notify individuals of security breaches involving personally identifiable information, which could result from breaches experienced by us or by third parties, including collaborators, vendors or contractors. In addition, a cybersecurity attack could result in other negative consequences, including disruption of our internal operations, increased cybersecurity protection costs, lost revenue, regulatory actions or litigations. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of or damage to our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could also incur liability. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur costs could substantially increase if we experience a significant number of warranty claims.\nWe provide limited product warranties against manufacturing defects of our products. Our product warranty requires us to repair defects arising from product design and production processes, and, if necessary, replace defective components. The future costs associated with our warranty claims are uncertain due to our limited commercialization experience with our current generation Obalon Balloon System and lack of commercial experience with our Obalon Navigation System and Obalon Touch Inflation Dispenser. Thus far, we have not accrued a significant liability contingency for potential warranty claims.\nWe have instituted a swallow guarantee which may provide replacement of product for physicians and institutions when patients are unable to swallow a capsule. To qualify for a replacement of product, the physician must adhere by our policies and procedures. The swallow guarantee is limited to a certain number of swallow attempts per balloon placement, as well as other procedural and technical requirements. As a result of this program, our financial results or gross profit may be impacted.\nIf we experience warranty claims, including manufacturing defects as well as our swallow guarantee, in excess of our expectations, or if our repair and replacement costs associated with warranty claims increase significantly, we will incur liabilities for potential warranty claims that may be greater than we expect. An increase in the frequency of warranty claims or amount of warranty costs may harm our reputation and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we are unable to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in the future, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock may decrease.\nAs a public company, we are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal controls. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, requires that we evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and provide a management report on our internal control over financial reporting, however, while we remain an emerging growth company we will not be required to include the attestation report issued by our independent registered public accounting firm.\nThe process of designing and implementing our internal control over financial reporting, has been time consuming, costly and complicated. If we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, are unable to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective or, once required, if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to attest that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock could decrease. We could also become subject to stockholder or other third-party litigation as well as investigations by the stock exchange on which our securities are listed, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources and could result in fines, trading suspensions or other remedies.\nFluctuations in insurance cost and availability could adversely affect our profitability or our risk management profile.\nWe hold a number of insurance policies, including directors' and officers' liability insurance, product liability insurance, business interruption insurance, medical malpractice, property insurance and workers' compensation insurance. The cost of maintaining directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance and product liability insurance on implantable medical devices has increased substantially over the past few years and could continue to increase, due to general market trends, as part of an evaluation of our specific loss history and other factors. If the costs of maintaining adequate insurance coverage should increase significantly in the future, our operating results could be materially adversely affected. Likewise, if any of our current insurance coverage should become economically impractical or become unavailable to us due to exhaustion of the coverage or any other reason, we would be required to operate our business without indemnity from commercial insurance providers.\nOur ability to utilize our net operating loss carryovers may be limited.\nAt December 31, 2020, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs, of approximately $157.4 million and $126.0 million, respectively. The federal and state tax loss carryforwards will begin expiring in 2028, unless previously utilized. The federal net operating loss carryover includes $69.2 million of net operating losses generated after 2017. Federal net operating losses generated in 2018 and beyond carryover indefinitely and may be generally be used to offset up to 80% of future taxable income. We also had federal and California research and development tax credit carryforwards totaling $3.4 million and $2.7 million respectively. The federal research and development tax credit carryforward will begin to expire in 2028 unless previously utilized. The California research tax credits do not expire.\nIn general, under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or IRC, a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change NOLs and certain other tax assets to offset future taxable income, and an ownership change is generally defined as a cumulative change of 50%\nor more in the ownership positions of certain stockholders during a rolling three-year period. We have not completed a formal study to determine if any ownership changes within the meaning of IRC Section 382 have occurred.\nIf ownership changes within the meaning of IRC Section 382 have occurred, it could restrict our ability to use NOL carryforwards and research and development tax credits generated since inception. Limitations on our ability to use NOL carryforwards and research and development tax credits to offset future taxable income could require us to pay U.S. federal income taxes earlier than would be required if such limitations were not in effect. Similar rules and limitations may apply for state income tax purposes.\nFuture sales and issuances of our common stock or other securities may result in significant dilution and could cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nTo raise capital, we may sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner we determine from time to time, including pursuant to the Purchase Agreement with Lincoln Park. These sales, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock. These sales may also result in material dilution to our existing stockholders, and new investors could gain rights superior to our existing stockholders.\nWe cannot predict what effect, if any, sales of our shares in the public market or the availability of shares for sale will have on the market price of our common stock. However, future sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, including shares issued upon exercise of outstanding options, or the perception that such sales may occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nProvisions in our corporate charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current board directors or management.\nProvisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and our restated bylaws discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control of our company that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, thereby depressing the market price of our common stock. In addition, because our board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors. Among other things, these provisions:\n\u25cf establish a classified board of directors so that not all members of our board are elected at one time;\n\u25cf permit only the board of directors to establish the number of directors and fill vacancies on the board;\n\u25cf provide that directors may only be removed \u201cfor cause\u201d and only with the approval of two-thirds of our stockholders;\n\u25cf require super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws;\n\u25cf authorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that our board could use to implement a stockholder rights plan, also known as a \u201cpoison pill\u201d;\n\u25cf eliminate the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u25cf prohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;\n\u25cf prohibit cumulative voting; and\n\u25cf establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings.\nMoreover, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or the DGCL, which prohibits a person who owns in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner. Any of these provisions of our charter documents or Delaware law could, under certain circumstances, depress the market price of our common stock.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, employees or agents to us or our stockholders, any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, our restated certificate of incorporation or our restated bylaws or any action asserting a claim that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this provision will not apply to any claims arising under the\nSecurities Act or the Exchange Act, or any claim in which exclusive jurisdiction is vested in a court or forum other than the Court of Chancery or for which the Court of Chancery does not have subject matter jurisdiction. Any person purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to this provision of our restated certificate of incorporation. This choice of forum provision may limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, employees and agents even though an action, if successful, might benefit our stockholders. Stockholders who do bring a claim in the Court of Chancery could face additional litigation costs in pursuing any such claim, particularly if they do not reside in or near Delaware. The Court of Chancery may also reach different judgments or results than would other courts, including courts where a stockholder considering an action may be located or would otherwise choose to bring the action, and such judgments or results may be more favorable to us than to our stockholders. Alternatively, if a court were to find this provision of our restated certificate of incorporation inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.", "PERMNO": 16393, "SIC": 3841, "TIC": "OBLN"}
