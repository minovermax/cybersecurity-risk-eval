RISK FACTORS\nWe operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks, some of which are beyond our control. This discussion highlights some of the risks which may affect future operating results. These are the risks and uncertainties we believe are most important for you to consider. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, which we currently deem immaterial or which are similar to those faced by other companies in our industry or business in general, may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks or uncertainties actually occurs, our business, financial condition and operating results would likely suffer.\nRisks Related to our Business and Industry\nWe face intense competition from other providers of robots, including diversified technology providers, as well as competition from providers offering alternative products, which could negatively impact our results of operations and cause our market share to decline.\nA number of companies have developed or are developing robots that will compete directly with our product offerings. Our competition includes established, well-known sellers of floor cleaning robots such as Ecovacs, SharkNinja, Samsung, Roborock, as well as new market entrants. Many current and potential competitors are larger in size and more broadly diversified with substantially greater financial, marketing, research and manufacturing resources than we possess, and there can be no assurance that our current and future competitors will not be more successful than us. We also face competition from manufacturers of lower-cost devices, which has, and may continue to, further drive down the average selling price in the marketplace for floor cleaning products. Moreover, while we believe many of our customers purchase our floor vacuuming robots as a supplement to, rather than a replacement for, their traditional vacuum cleaners, we also compete with providers of traditional vacuum cleaners.\nThe global market for robots is highly competitive, rapidly evolving and subject to changing technologies, shifting customer needs and expectations and the likely increased introduction of new products. Our ability to remain competitive will depend to a great extent upon our ongoing performance in the areas of product development, operating efficiency and customer support.\nWe expect that competition will continue to intensify as additional competitors enter the market and current competitors expand their product lines. Companies competing with us have, and may continue to, introduce products that are competitively priced, have increased performance or functionality, or incorporate technological advances that we have not yet developed or implemented. Increased competitive pressure has resulted and will continue to result in a loss of sales or market share or cause us to lower prices for our products, any of which would harm our business and operating results.\nMany of our competitors have demonstrated an ability to rapidly replicate new features and innovations that we have introduced into the market, and therefore are able to offer a comparable suite of product offerings at lower prices. In addition, some of our competitors aggressively discount their products and services in order to gain market share, which has resulted in pricing pressures, reduced profit margins and lost market share. In addition, new products may have lower selling prices or higher costs than legacy products, which could negatively impact our gross margins and operating results.\nWe cannot assure you that our products will continue to compete favorably or that we will be successful in the face of increasing competition from new products and enhancements introduced by existing competitors or new companies entering the markets in which we provide products. Our failure to compete successfully could cause our revenue and market share to decline, which would negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe operate in an emerging market, which makes it difficult to evaluate our business and future prospects.\nRobots represent a new and emerging market. Accordingly, our business and future prospects are difficult to evaluate. We cannot accurately predict the extent to which demand for floor cleaning robots will increase, if at all. You should consider the challenges, risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies using new and unproven business models in rapidly evolving markets. These challenges include our ability to:\n\u2022generate sufficient revenue and gross margin to maintain profitability;\n\u2022maintain market share in our consumer market;\n\u2022attract and retain customers of our robots;\n\u2022attract and retain engineers and other highly-qualified personnel; and\n\u2022expand our product offerings beyond our existing robots.\nIf we fail to successfully address these and other challenges, risks and uncertainties, our business, results of operations and financial condition would be materially harmed.\nDesigning new robotic products is complex and requires significant resources, and our ability to remain competitive requires significant continued investment in tools, processes and talent.\nTo remain competitive, we must increase investment in developing tools and processes to improve the speed at which we are able to develop competitive products, including significant investment in developing a reusable software architecture across multiple product platforms. The development of a reusable software architecture requires the expenditure of significant resources that may not result in the designed efficiencies. Our inability to reduce the cost to develop new products or product variants may substantially impact our ability to offer products that compete favorably.\nWe depend on the experience and expertise of our senior management team and key technical employees, and the loss of any key employee may impair our ability to operate effectively.\nOur success depends upon the continued services of our senior management team and key technical employees. Each of our executive officers, key technical personnel and other employees could terminate his or her relationship with us at any time. The loss of any member of our senior management team might significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives and could materially harm our business and customer relationships. In addition, because of the highly technical nature of our robots, the loss of any significant number of our existing engineering and project management personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. In addition, increased turnover, particularly on the senior management team, with insufficient development of leadership talent and succession plans, could diminish employee confidence and increase risks for retaining key employees.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain additional skilled personnel, we may be unable to grow our business.\nTo execute our growth plan, we must attract and retain additional, highly-qualified personnel. Competition for hiring these employees is intense, especially with regard to engineers with high levels of experience in designing, developing and integrating robots and engineers with expertise in artificial intelligence, machine learning, data science and cloud applications. Many of the companies with which we compete for hiring experienced employees have greater resources than we have. If we fail to attract new technical personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current employees, our business and future growth prospects could be severely harmed.\nIn addition, we have experienced increased employee turnover as a result of general market conditions and the on-going \"great resignation\" occurring throughout the U.S. economy, and we expect to continue to experience increased employee turnover in the future. New hires require significant training and, in most cases, take significant time before they achieve full productivity. New employees may not become as productive as we expect, and we may be unable to hire or retain significant numbers of qualified individuals. Moreover, we may be forced to adjust salaries or other compensation in order to retain key talent. If our retention efforts are not successful or our team member turnover rate continues to increase in the future, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur business has been, and will continue to be, adversely affected by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.\nThe outbreak of the novel coronavirus has evolved into a global pandemic. The coronavirus has already directly and indirectly impacted our business and operating results but the full extent of its impact will depend on future developments that are uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning the coronavirus, including any variants such as the Omicron variant, and the actions to contain the coronavirus or treat its impact, among others. The ultimate impact of the current pandemic, or any other health epidemic, is highly uncertain and subject to change not only with the spread of the disease, but also with the scope and timing of governmental, regulatory, fiscal, monetary and public health responses.\nAs the coronavirus continues to spread, our business operations could be further disrupted or delayed. The pandemic has already resulted in, and may continue to result in, work stoppages, slowdowns and delays, travel restrictions, event cancellation, and other factors that cause an increase in costs or order cancellations, reductions or delays. For example, our manufacturing supply chain has been and may continue to be adversely affected with production delays or limited manufacturing volumes associated with factory shutdowns or reduced numbers of workers or working hours in the factories, limits on component supplies and diminished capability to implement engineering and design changes in a timely manner. Specifically, travel restrictions have prevented, and may continue to prevent, significant progress in supply chain diversification efforts in Malaysia, which may have a material impact on our ability to mitigate the impact of certain tariffs. In addition, quarantines, stay at home orders and other travel limitations (whether voluntary or required) impede our employees\u2019 ability to efficiently conduct research and development activities or oversee manufacturing activities, which has, and may continue to, slow innovation, lead to higher costs or both. For example, we have already experienced an increase in freight costs and a delay in our supply chain\ndiversification efforts. Further, if the spread of the coronavirus pandemic continues and our operations continue to be adversely impacted, we risk a delay, default, violation and/or non-compliance under existing agreements.\nThe spread of the coronavirus, which has caused a broad impact globally, including restrictions on travel and quarantine policies put into place by businesses and governments, has had and may continue to have a material economic effect on our business. For example, the pandemic and related measures taken to limit the spread of disease has resulted in higher unemployment and greater economic uncertainty, which may adversely affect consumer purchasing behavior. Further, retail store closures, whether temporary or permanent, as well as limited operating hours and restrictions on foot traffic and maximum capacities in stores may continue to adversely affect sales of our products. Certain retailers, who we rely on for a significant portion of our revenue, have begun, and may continue, to unilaterally stretch payables to us that may increase our accounts receivable, strain our liquidity, and increase the likelihood of our failure to collect on product previously sold.\nWhile the potential economic impact and the duration of the pandemic may be difficult to assess or predict, it has already caused, and is likely to result in further, significant disruption of global financial markets. In addition, a recession, depression or other sustained adverse market event resulting from the spread of the coronavirus could materially and adversely affect our business, our access to needed capital and liquidity, and the value of our common stock. We do not yet know the full extent of potential delays or impacts on our business, our industry or the global economy as a whole. Additionally, while significant efforts are underway to slow the spread of the disease, increase testing and develop and distribute vaccines and therapeutics, it is unclear when or whether progress in any of those areas will translate into an economic recovery that will restore consumer confidence and minimize disruptions to our operations. Accordingly, given that the potential of these effects of the current pandemic on our operations has been and will likely continue to be material, we will continue to monitor the situation closely.\nSurges in demand impacting the cost and availability of transportation have had, and we expect will continue to have, an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSurges in demand related to COVID-19, as well as other factors, have continued to strain the global supply chain network, which has resulted in carrier-imposed capacity restrictions, carrier delays, and longer lead times. Demand for Chinese imports has caused shipment receiving and unloading backlogs at many U.S. ports that have been unable to keep pace with unprecedented inbound container volume. The situation has been further exacerbated by COVID-19 illness and protocols at many port locations. Due to the backlog and increasing trade imbalance with China, many shipping containers are not being sent back to China, or are being sent to China empty. With continued increases in demand for containers, limited supply and freight vendors bearing the cost of shipping empty containers, the market cost of inbound freight has increased by several multiples compared to historical averages. To the extent that transportation costs and interruptions continue, we may face increased pressure on gross margins, product delivery delays and an inability to fulfill orders for our products.\nIf we are not successful in expanding our direct-to-consumer sales channel by driving consumer traffic and consumer purchases through our website, our business and results of operations could be harmed.\nWe are currently investing in our direct-to-consumer sales channel, primarily through our website and mobile app, and our future growth relies in part on our ability to attract consumers to this channel, which requires significant expenditures in marketing, software development and infrastructure. If we are unable to drive traffic to, and increase sales through, our website and mobile app, our business and results of operations could be harmed. The success of direct-to-consumer sales is subject to risks associated with e-commerce, many of which are outside of our control. Our inability to adequately respond to these risks and uncertainties or to successfully maintain and expand our direct-to-consumer business via our website may have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nOur success depends nearly entirely on our consumer robots, and our sales growth and operating results would be negatively impacted if we are unable to enhance our current consumer robots or develop new consumer robots at competitive prices or in a timely manner, or if the consumer robot market does not achieve broad market acceptance.\nWe primarily derive our revenue from consumer robot sales. For the foreseeable future, we expect that our revenue will be derived nearly entirely from sales of home floor care products. Accordingly, our future success depends upon our ability to further penetrate the consumer home care market, to enhance our current consumer products and to develop and introduce new consumer products offering enhanced performance and functionality at competitive prices. The development and application of new technologies involves time, substantial costs and risks. Our inability to achieve significant sales of our newly introduced robots, or to enhance, develop and introduce other products in a timely manner, or at all, would materially harm our sales growth and operating results.\nEven if consumer robots gain wide market acceptance, our robots may not adequately address market requirements and may not continue to gain market acceptance. If robots generally, or our robots specifically, do not gain wide market acceptance, we may not be able to achieve our anticipated level of growth, and our revenue and results of operations would suffer.\nAny efforts to expand our product offerings beyond our current markets or to develop new products may not succeed, which could negatively impact our operating results.\nEfforts to expand our product offerings beyond our current markets are limited and those efforts may not succeed and may divert management resources from existing operations and require us to commit significant financial resources to an unproven business, either of which could significantly impair our operating results. Any new product that we develop may not be introduced in a timely or cost-effective manner, may contain defects, or may not achieve the market acceptance necessary to generate sufficient revenue. Moreover, efforts to expand beyond our existing markets may never result in new products that achieve market acceptance, create additional revenue or become profitable.\nOn November 15, 2021, we acquired Aeris Cleantec AG, a fast-growing provider of premium air purifiers. This acquisition represents our first major expansion of product offerings beyond consumer robotics. Air purifiers represent a new market segment for us and is subject to intense competition.\nOur success in the air purifier market will depend on a number of factors including our ability to develop innovative solutions, integrate those solutions into our home ecosystem, and market and sell those solutions to our existing and new customers. Establishing a new market segment will require significant investment in R&D and sales & marketing in the near term. These investments may not be successful, and our revenue and profitability may suffer.\nIf the air purifier business - or any other business we acquire - does not perform as expected or we are unable to effectively integrate the acquired business into our operations or achieve the expected synergies of the acquisition, our operating results could be harmed. Expansion into new market segments involve risks and uncertainties, including, among other things, potential distraction of management from our core robotic floorcare business, greater than expected liabilities and expenses, inadequate return on capital, and unidentified issues not discovered in our investigations and evaluations of those acquisitions.\nWe spend significant amounts on advertising and other marketing campaigns, which may not be successful or cost effective.\nWe spend significant amounts on advertising and other marketing campaigns, such as television, print advertising, and social media, as well as increased promotional activities, to acquire new customers, and we expect our marketing expenses to increase in the future as we continue to spend significant amounts to increase awareness of our consumer robot products. For the years ended January 1, 2022, January 2, 2021 and December 28, 2019, sales and marketing expenses were $289.8 million, $265.5 million and $231.5 million, respectively, representing approximately 18.5%, 18.6%, and 19.1% of our revenue, respectively. While we seek to structure our advertising campaigns in the manner that we believe is most likely to encourage people to purchase our products, we may fail to identify advertising opportunities that satisfy our anticipated return on advertising spend as we scale our investments in marketing or to fully understand or estimate the conditions and behaviors that drive customer behavior. If any of our advertising campaigns prove less successful than anticipated in attracting customers, we may not be able to recover our advertising spend, and our revenue may fail to meet market expectations, either of which could have an adverse effect on our business. There can be no assurance that our advertising and other marketing efforts will result in increased sales of our products.\nIf we fail to enhance our brand, our ability to expand our customer base will be impaired and our operating results may suffer.\nWe believe that developing and maintaining awareness of the iRobot brand is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our existing and future products and is an important element in attracting new customers. Furthermore, we expect the importance of global brand recognition to increase as competition increases. If customers do not perceive our products to be of high quality, our brand and reputation could be harmed, which could adversely impact our financial results. In addition, brand promotion efforts may not yield significant revenue or increased revenue sufficient to offset the additional expenses incurred in building our brand. Maintaining, protecting, and enhancing our brand may require us to make substantial investments, and these investments may not be successful. If we fail to successfully maintain, promote, and position our brand and protect our reputation, or if we incur significant expenses in this effort, our business, financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to our Dependence on Third Parties and Distribution Channels\nWe depend on a limited number of manufacturers, and our reputation and results of operations would be harmed if these manufacturers fail to meet our requirements.\nWe depend on a limited number of manufacturers, employing a dual-source strategy to mitigate potential manufacturing disruptions, and we have safety stock strategies for low-volume products that are not dual sourced. The majority of our contract manufacturing locations for our robots are currently located in China and we added additional manufacturing capacity in Malaysia in late 2019, and we have continued to expand production in Malaysia. Our efforts to diversify manufacturing outside of China has been, and may continue to be, materially impacted as a result of COVID-19 and related travel restrictions. These manufacturers manage the supply chain for all of the raw materials and provide all facilities and labor required to manufacture our products. If these companies were to terminate their arrangements with us or fail to provide the required capacity and quality on a timely basis, there would be a disruption in manufacturing our products until replacement contract manufacturing services could be obtained or volume transferred to an alternative manufacturing partner, each of which is a costly and time-consuming process. We cannot assure you that we would be able to establish alternative manufacturing arrangements on acceptable terms or in a timely manner.\nWe are dependent on a limited number of suppliers for various components used in our products, and we may from time to time have sole source suppliers. The cost, quality and availability of these components are essential to the successful production and sale of our products. We are subject to the risk of, and have already experienced, industry-wide shortages, price fluctuations and long lead times in the supply of these components and other materials, which risk may be increased as a result of COVID-19. If the supply of these components were to be delayed or constrained, or if one or more of our main suppliers were to go out of business, alternative sources or suppliers may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. In the event that any of our suppliers were to discontinue production of our key product components, developing alternate sources of supply for these components would be time consuming, difficult and costly. In the event we are unable to obtain components in sufficient quantities on a timely basis and on commercially reasonable terms, our ability to sell our products in order to meet market demand would be affected and could materially and adversely affect our brand, image, business prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nOur reliance on these contract manufacturers involves certain risks, including the following:\n\u2022lack of direct control over production capacity and delivery schedules;\n\u2022lack of direct control over quality assurance, manufacturing yields and production costs;\n\u2022lack of enforceable contractual provisions over the production and costs of consumer products;\n\u2022risk of loss of inventory while in transit;\n\u2022risks associated with international commerce, including unexpected changes in legal and regulatory requirements, changes in tariffs and trade policies, risks associated with the protection of intellectual property and political and economic instability; and\n\u2022risks that our attempts to add additional manufacturing resources may be significantly delayed and thereby create disruptions in production of our products.\nAny interruption in the manufacture of our products would be likely to result in delays in shipment, lost sales and revenue and damage to our reputation in the market, all of which would harm our business and results of operations. In addition, because our purchase contracts with suppliers are typically denominated in U.S. dollars, changes in currency exchange rates may impact our suppliers who operate in local currency, which may cause our suppliers to seek price concessions on future orders.\nIf critical components of our products that we currently purchase from a small number of suppliers become unavailable, we may incur delays in shipment, which could damage our business.\nWe and our outsourced manufacturers obtain hardware components, various subsystems, raw materials and batteries from a limited group of suppliers, some of which are sole suppliers. We do not have long-term agreements with these suppliers obligating them to continue to sell components or products to us. If we or our outsourced manufacturers are unable to obtain components from third-party suppliers in the quantities and of the quality that we require, on a timely basis and at acceptable prices, we may not be able to deliver our products on a timely or cost-effective basis to our customers, which could cause customers to terminate their contracts with us, reduce our gross margin and seriously harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, if any of our suppliers become financially unstable, we may have to find new suppliers. It may take several months to locate alternative suppliers, if required, or to re-tool our products to accommodate components from\ndifferent suppliers. We may experience significant delays in manufacturing and shipping our products to customers and incur additional development, manufacturing and other costs to establish alternative sources of supply if we lose any of these sources. We cannot predict if we will be able to obtain replacement components within the time frames that we require at an affordable cost, or at all.\nConflicts with our channel and distribution partners could harm our business and operating results.\nThe expansion of our direct-to-consumer channel could alienate some of our channel partners and cause a reduction in product sales from these partners. Channel partners may perceive themselves to be at a disadvantage based on the direct-to-consumer sales offered through our website. Due to these and other factors, conflicts in our sales channels could arise and cause channel partners to divert resources away from the promotion and sale of our products. Any of these situations could adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nIf we fail to maintain or increase consumer robot sales through our distribution channels, our operating results would be negatively impacted.\nWe do not have long-term contracts regarding purchase volumes with any of our retail partners. As a result, purchases generally occur on an order-by-order basis, and the relationships, as well as particular orders, can generally be terminated or otherwise materially changed at any time prior to delivery, by our retail partners. A decision by a major retail partner, whether motivated by competitive considerations, financial difficulties, economic conditions or otherwise, to decrease its purchases from us, to reduce the shelf space for our products or to change its manner of doing business with us could significantly damage our consumer product sales and negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, during recent years, various retailers, including some of our partners, have experienced significant changes and difficulties, including consolidation of ownership, increased centralization of purchasing decisions, restructuring, bankruptcies and liquidations. These and other financial problems of some of our retailers increase the risk of extending credit to these retailers. A significant adverse change in a retail partner relationship with us or in a retail partner\u2019s financial position could cause us to limit or discontinue business with that partner, require us to assume more credit risk relating to that partner\u2019s receivables or limit our ability to collect amounts related to previous purchases by that partner, all of which could harm our business and financial condition. Disruption of the iRobot on-line store could also decrease our consumer robot sales.\nRisks Related to our Legal and Regulatory Environment\nSignificant developments in U.S. trade policies have had, and we expect will continue to have, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe U.S. government has indicated its intent to alter its approach to international trade policy and in some cases to renegotiate, or potentially terminate, certain existing bilateral or multi-lateral trade agreements and treaties with foreign countries. Effective September 24, 2018, the U.S. government implemented a 10% tariff on certain goods imported from China, which include the majority of those imported by the Company. These tariffs were increased to 25% on May 10, 2019 and were slated to further increase to 30% in October 2019 until a last-minute interim deal was reached between the United States and China. Although the United States and China signed a new trade agreement in January 2020, most of the previously-implemented tariffs on goods imported from China remain in place (including the tariffs described above), and uncertainty remains as to the short-term and long-term future of economic relations between the United States and China.\nFrom September 2018 until April 2020, our Roomba products were subject to Section 301 tariffs. On April 24, 2020, we were granted a temporary exclusion from Section 301 List 3 tariffs by the United States Trade Representative (\"USTR\"). This exclusion, as extended in August 2020, eliminated the 25% tariff on Roomba products until December 31, 2020 and entitled us to a refund of $57.0 million in tariffs paid since the date the Section 301 List 3 tariffs were imposed.\nEffective as of January 1, 2021, the 25% Section 301 tariff again applies to our Roomba products imported from China. Although we have begun relocating a meaningful portion of our supply chain from China to Malaysia, we again face compression on our margin on products sold and pricing pressures on our products. The already-implemented, and any additional or increased, tariffs have caused, and may in the future cause, us to further increase prices to our customers which we believe has reduced, and in the future may reduce, demand for our products.\nOn October 4, 2021, the USTR announced its decision to establish a new process for importers to apply for exclusions from Section 301 tariffs in 549 product categories, including robotic vacuum cleaners. Beginning October 12, 2021, the USTR started accepting comments on whether or not reinstating certain tariff exclusions will impact or result in severe economic harm to companies or other interests of the United States. On October 21, 2021, we submitted comments related to the continued application of tariffs on robotic vacuum cleaning products. We cannot say definitively when, or even if, iRobot will be granted additional tariff relief on our products still manufactured in China, nor can we guarantee the terms upon which any tariff relief ultimately may be granted. In addition, our new air purification products are also subject to 25% Section 301 tariffs. We did not submit comments related to the continued application of tariffs on certain air purification products; however, a number of\nimporters did submit such comments, and we believe any grant of tariff relief would also likely extend to our importation of air purification products.\nThese tariffs, and other governmental action relating to international trade agreements or policies, have directly or indirectly adversely impacted demand for our products, our costs, customers, suppliers, distributors, resellers and/or the U.S. economy or certain sectors thereof and, as a result, have adversely impacted, and we expect will continue to adversely impact, our business, financial condition and results of operations. It remains unclear what the U.S. or foreign governments will or will not do with respect to tariffs, international trade agreements and policies on a short-term or long-term basis. We cannot predict future trade policy, whether exclusions will be reinstated, or the terms of any renegotiated trade agreements and their impacts on our business. The adoption and expansion of trade restrictions, the occurrence of a trade war, or other governmental action related to tariffs or trade agreements or policies has the potential to further adversely impact demand for our products, our costs, our customers, our suppliers, and the U.S. economy, which in turn could further adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn response to international trade policy, as well as other risks associated with concentrated manufacturing in China, we have begun relocating a meaningful portion of our supply chain from China to Malaysia. Such relocation activities increase costs and risks associated with establishing new manufacturing facilities.\nGlobal economic conditions and any associated impact on consumer spending could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nContinued economic uncertainty and reductions in consumer spending, particularly in certain international markets such as the European Union, China and Japan, may result in reductions in sales of our consumer robots. Additionally, disruptions in credit markets may materially limit consumer credit availability and restrict credit availability of our retail customers, which would also impact purchases of our consumer robots. Any reduction in sales of our consumer robots, resulting from reductions in consumer spending or continued disruption in the availability of credit to retailers or consumers, could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nBecause we are an increasingly global business that in the years ended January 1, 2022, January 2, 2021 and December 28, 2019 generated approximately 51.8%, 47.9% and 50.3%, respectively, of our total revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States, we are subject to a number of additional risks including foreign currency fluctuations. These foreign currency fluctuations may make our products more expensive to our distributors and end customers, which in turn may impact sales directly or the ability or willingness of our partners to invest in growing product demand.\nOur primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non-U.S. dollar denominated sales and operating expenses worldwide. Weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar could adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of our foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings, and lead us to raise international pricing, which may reduce demand for our products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, we may decide not to raise local prices to fully offset the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, or for any other reason, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of our foreign currency denominated sales and earnings. Conversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to our foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings, could cause us to reduce international pricing, incur losses on our foreign currency derivative instruments, and incur increased operating expenses, thereby limiting any benefit. Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may also increase our cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins.\nWe use derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not offset any, or only a portion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place. In addition, our counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreements. We seek to mitigate this risk by limiting counterparties to major financial institutions and by spreading the risk across several major financial institutions.\nWe are subject to a variety of U.S. and foreign laws and regulations that are central to our business; our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could harm our business or our operating results.\nWe are or may become subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad that involve matters central to our business, including laws and regulations regarding consumer protection, advertising, electronic commerce, intellectual property, manufacturing, anti-bribery and anti-corruption, and economic or other trade prohibitions or sanctions.\nThe increasingly global nature of our business operations subjects us to domestic and foreign laws and regulations such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, and similar anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws in other jurisdictions. Our products are also subject to U.S. export controls, including the United States Department of Commerce\u2019s Export Administration Regulations and various economic and trade sanctions regulations established by the Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Controls. In addition, our recently acquired air purifier business subjects us to additional laws and regulations, such as the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FD&C Act, the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and\nRodenticide Act, the U.S. Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976, U.S. Department of Energy Efficiency regulations, and various similar state and foreign country laws and regulations related to health and safety and other applicable laws required to manufacture, commercialize, sell or distribute air purification products. In the U.S., certain air purifiers intended for medical use are regulated as medical devices and are subject to regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, under the FD&C Act and its implementing regulations. The FDA regulates, among other things, premarket clearance, establishment registration and device listing, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, servicing, recordkeeping, advertising, promotion, distribution, recalls and field actions, post-marketing monitoring and reporting. In order to commercially distribute certain air purifiers, we will be required to submit a premarket notification, or 510(k), to the FDA and obtain 510(k) clearance.\nWe are also subject to a variety of laws and regulations regarding information security and privacy. For example, the European Union's (\"EU\") General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\") and the California Consumer Privacy Act, or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations, impose significant requirements on how we collect, process and transfer personal data, as well as significant fines for non-compliance. These current and future data privacy laws and regulations may impede our initiatives designed to deliver targeting marketing.\nGiven the increasing number of foreign laws to which we are subject and the high level of complexity of these laws, there is a risk that some provisions may be inadvertently breached by us or by our subsidiaries, for example through fraudulent or negligent behavior of individual employees, our failure to comply with certain formal documentation requirements, or otherwise. If we incur liability for noncompliance under these laws or regulations, we may be forced to implement new measures to reduce our exposure to this liability. This may require us to expend substantial resources or to discontinue certain products or services, which would negatively affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. In addition, any negative publicity directed to us as a result of lawsuits, regulatory proceedings, and legislative proposals could harm our brand or otherwise impact the growth of our business. Any costs incurred as a result of compliance efforts or other liabilities under these laws or regulations could harm our business and operating results.\nOur income tax provision and other tax liabilities may be insufficient if taxing authorities are successful in asserting tax positions that are contrary to our position. Additionally, there is no guarantee that we will realize our deferred tax assets.\nFrom time to time, we are audited by various federal, state, local and foreign authorities regarding income tax matters. Significant judgment is required to determine our provision for income taxes and our liabilities for federal, state, local and foreign taxes. Although we believe our approach to determine the appropriate tax treatment is supportable and in accordance with relevant authoritative guidance, it is possible that a tax authority will take a final tax position that is materially different than that which is reflected in our income tax provision. Such differences could have a material adverse effect on our income tax provision or benefit, in the reporting period in which such determination is made and, consequently, on our results of operations, financial position and/or cash flows for such period.\nThe realization of our deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient income in either the carryback or carryforward periods under the tax law. Due to significant estimates utilized in establishing a valuation allowance and the potential for changes in facts and circumstances, it is possible that we will be required to record a valuation allowance in future reporting periods. Our results of operations would be impacted negatively if we determine that a deferred tax asset valuation allowance is required in a future reporting period.\nWe may incur costs in complying with changing tax laws in the United States and abroad, which could adversely impact our cash flow, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are a U.S.-based company subject to taxes in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. Our profits, cash flow and effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the tax rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business, unanticipated changes in statutory tax rates and changes to our global mix of earnings.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations and unforeseen costs could negatively impact our future earnings.\nThe manufacture and sale of our products in certain states and countries may subject us to environmental and other regulations. We also face increasing complexity in our product design as we adjust to legal and regulatory requirements relating to our products. There is no assurance that such existing laws or future laws will not impair future earnings or results of operations.\nBusiness disruptions resulting from international uncertainties could negatively impact our profitability.\nWe derive, and expect to continue to derive, a significant portion of our revenue from international sales in various European and Asian markets, and Canada. For the fiscal years ended January 1, 2022, January 2, 2021 and December 28, 2019, sales to non-U.S. customers accounted for 51.8%, 47.9% and 50.3% of total revenue, respectively. We expect that international revenues will continue to account for a significant percentage of our revenues for the foreseeable future. Our international revenue and operations are subject to a number of material risks, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022difficulties in staffing, managing and supporting operations in multiple countries;\n\u2022difficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems and other relevant legal issues;\n\u2022fewer legal protections for intellectual property;\n\u2022foreign and U.S. taxation issues, tariffs, and international trade barriers;\n\u2022difficulties in obtaining any necessary governmental authorizations for the export of our products to certain foreign jurisdictions;\n\u2022potential fluctuations in foreign economies;\n\u2022government currency control and restrictions on repatriation of earnings;\n\u2022fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates;\n\u2022general economic and political conditions in the markets in which we operate;\n\u2022domestic and international economic or political changes, hostilities and other disruptions in regions where we currently operate or may operate in the future;\n\u2022changes in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022different and changing legal and regulatory requirements in the jurisdictions in which we currently operate or may operate in the future; and\n\u2022our relationships with international distributors, some of whom may be operating without written contracts.\nNegative developments in any of these areas in one or more countries could result in a reduction in demand for our products, the cancellation or delay of orders already placed, threats to our intellectual property, difficulty in collecting receivables, and a higher cost of doing business, any of which could negatively impact our business, financial condition or results of operations. Moreover, our sales to customers outside the United States are primarily denominated in Euro and Japanese Yen and fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may make our products more expensive than other products, which could harm our business.\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the EU, commonly referred to as \"Brexit,\" has caused significant political and economic uncertainty in the United Kingdom, EU, and elsewhere. The impact of Brexit and the resulting turmoil on the political and economic future of the United Kingdom and the EU is uncertain, and we may be adversely affected in ways we cannot currently anticipate. The United Kingdom and the EU have signed a EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement (the \"TCA\"), which became provisionally applicable on January 1, 2021 and will become formally applicable once ratified by both the United Kingdom and the EU. The ultimate effects of Brexit will depend, in part, on how the terms of the TCA take effect in practice and on any other agreements the United Kingdom may make with the EU. Brexit also may result in significant changes in the British regulatory environment, now that legislation can diverge from EU legislation in many areas, which could increase our compliance costs. We may find it more difficult to conduct business in the United Kingdom and the EU, as Brexit will result in increased regulatory complexity and increased restrictions on the movement of capital, goods and personnel. Any of these effects of Brexit, and other similar referenda that we cannot anticipate, could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our operating results.\nIf we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem, we may not be able to recover successfully, which could cause material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm, or legal liability.\nIf we experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity problem, such as an earthquake, terrorist attack, pandemic or other natural or man-made disaster, our continued success will depend, in part, on the availability of our personnel, our office facilities, and the proper functioning of our computer, telecommunication and other related systems and operations. As we grow our operations in new geographic regions, the potential for particular types of natural or man-made disasters, political, economic or infrastructure instabilities, or other country- or region-specific business continuity risks increases. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted and will continue to disrupt our supply chain and manufacturers, resulting in a disruption in manufacturing our products as further discussed in the risk factors entitled \"We depend on a limited number of manufacturers, and our reputation and results of operations would be harmed if these manufacturers fail to meet our requirements\" below and \"Our business has been, and will continue to be, adversely affected by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic\" above.\nThe effects of regulations relating to conflict minerals may adversely affect our business.\nOn August 22, 2012, under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, the SEC adopted new requirements for companies that use certain minerals and metals, known as conflict minerals, in their products, whether or not these products are manufactured by third parties. These requirements require companies to research, disclose and report whether or not such minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries. The implementation of these requirements could adversely affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of such minerals if they are found to be used in the manufacture of our products. In addition, we continue to incur additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements, including costs related to determining the source of any of the relevant minerals and metals used in our products. Since our supply chain is complex, we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins for these minerals and metals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement, which may harm our reputation. In such event, we may also face difficulties in satisfying customers who require that all of the components of our products are certified as conflict mineral free.\nRisks related to our Intellectual Property and Technology\nIf we fail to protect, or incur significant costs in defending, our intellectual property and other proprietary rights, our business and results of operations could be materially harmed.\nOur success depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights. We rely primarily on patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and unfair competition laws, as well as license agreements and other contractual provisions, to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights. Significant technology used in our products, however, is not the subject of any patent protection, and we may be unable to obtain patent protection on such technology in the future. Moreover, existing U.S. legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights offer only limited protection, may not provide us with any competitive advantages, and may be challenged by third parties. In addition, the laws of countries other than the United States in which we market our products may afford little or no effective protection of our intellectual property. Patents which may be granted to us in certain foreign countries may be subject to opposition proceedings brought by third parties or result in suits by us, which may be costly and result in adverse consequences for us. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may be unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property or otherwise gaining access to our technology. Unauthorized third parties may try to copy or reverse engineer our products or portions of our products or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property. If we fail to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially harmed.\nIn addition, defending our intellectual property rights may entail significant expense. We believe that certain products in the marketplace may infringe our existing intellectual property rights. We have, from time to time, resorted to legal proceedings to protect our intellectual property and may continue to do so in the future. For example, on October 15, 2019, we initiated a patent infringement lawsuit in federal district court in Massachusetts against SharkNinja Operating LLC and its related entities (\"SharkNinja\") for infringement of five patents for technology related to robotic vacuum cleaners. In addition, we sought a preliminary injunction against SharkNinja for infringement of three U.S. patents. SharkNinja has in parallel sought declarations of non-infringement of thirteen U.S. patents owned by iRobot. On November 26, 2019, the federal district court in Massachusetts denied iRobot's motion for a preliminary injunction. On January 28, 2021, we initiated litigation against SharkNinja at the U.S. International Trade Commission (\"ITC\") as well as in federal district court in Massachusetts based on claims of patent infringement of five additional U.S. patents, and on January 5-12, 2022 the ITC held a trial on four of those patents and a final determination has not been made.\nThere is no guarantee that we will prevail on other patent infringement claims against third parties. We may be required to expend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights. In addition, any of our intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative processes or litigation. If we resort to legal proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the intellectual property or other proprietary rights of others, the proceedings could result in significant expense to us and divert the attention and efforts of our management and technical employees, even if we were to prevail.\nIn addition, in the United States certain of our patents have been, and may continue to be, challenged by inter parte review or opposition proceedings. If our patents are subjected to inter parte review or opposition proceedings, we may incur significant costs to defend them. Further, our failure to prevail in any such proceedings could limit the patent protection available for our innovations.\nWe may be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights, which could be costly, time-consuming and limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future.\nIn the past we have faced multiple lawsuits based on claims of patent infringement. If the size of our markets increases, we would be more likely to be subject to claims that our technologies infringe upon the intellectual property or other proprietary rights of third parties. In addition, the vendors from which we license technology used in our products could become subject to\nsimilar infringement claims. Our vendors, or we, may not be able to withstand third-party infringement claims. Any claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming and expensive, and could divert our management\u2019s attention away from the execution of our business plan. Moreover, any settlement or adverse judgment resulting from the claim could require us to pay substantial amounts or obtain a license to continue to use the technology that is the subject of the claim, or otherwise restrict or prohibit our use of the technology. There can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain a license from the third party asserting the claim on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, that we would be able to develop alternative technology on a timely basis, if at all, or that we would be able to obtain a license to use a suitable alternative technology to permit us to continue offering, and our customers to continue using, our affected product. In addition, we may be required to indemnify our retail and distribution partners for third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling in such a claim. An adverse determination could also prevent us from offering our products to others. Infringement claims asserted against us or our vendors may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nIn addition, we incorporate open source software into our products, and we may continue to incorporate open source software into our products in the future. Open source software is generally licensed by its authors or other third parties under open source licenses. Some of these licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the open source software, and that we license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of a particular open source license or other license granting third parties certain rights of further use. If an author or other third party that distributes open source software that we use or license were to allege that we had not complied with the conditions of the applicable license, we could be required to incur significant legal expenses defending against those allegations and could be subject to significant damages, enjoined from offering or selling our products that contained the open source software and required to comply with the foregoing conditions. Any of the foregoing could disrupt and harm our business and financial condition.\nCybersecurity risks could adversely affect our business and disrupt our operations.\nThe threats to network and data security are increasingly diverse and sophisticated. Despite our efforts and processes to prevent breaches, our devices, as well as our servers, computer systems, and those of third parties that we use in our operations are vulnerable to cybersecurity risks, including cyber attacks such as viruses and worms, phishing attacks, distributed denial-of-service attacks, ransomware, and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our servers and computer systems or those of third parties that we use in our operations, which could lead to interruptions, delays, loss of critical data, and loss of consumer confidence. In addition, we may be the target of email scams that attempt to acquire sensitive information or company assets. Despite our efforts to create security barriers to such threats, we may not be able to entirely mitigate these risks. These threats may be increased due to the work-from-home policies implemented by us and our customers, suppliers and distributors as a result of mitigation measures related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Any cyber attack that attempts to obtain our data and assets, disrupt our service, or otherwise access our systems, or those of third parties we use, if successful, could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition, be expensive to remedy, and damage our reputation. Our cyber insurance may not protect against all of the costs and liabilities arising from a cyber attack.\nIf we suffer data breaches involving the designs, schematics or source code for our products, our brand, business and financial results could be adversely affected.\nWe attempt to securely store our designs, schematics and source code for our products as they are created. A breach, whether physical, electronic or otherwise, of the systems on which this sensitive data is stored could lead to damage or piracy of our products. If we or our partners are subject to data security breaches, we may have a loss in sales or increased costs arising from the restoration or implementation of additional security measures, either of which could materially and adversely affect our brand, business and financial results.\nWe operate our business in jurisdictions where intellectual property theft or compromise is common.\nCurrently, we maintain significant operations in China, where a majority of our products are manufactured. Subject to contractual confidentiality obligations, we are required to share significant product design materials with third-parties necessary for the design and manufacture of our products. We cannot be sure that our data or intellectual property will not be compromised through cyber-intrusion, theft or other means, particularly when the data or intellectual property is held by partners in foreign jurisdictions. Should our intellectual property be compromised, it may be difficult to enforce our rights in China and other foreign jurisdictions in which we operate.\nWe collect, store, process, and use customer data, including certain personal and robot-specific information, which subjects us to governmental regulation and other legal obligations related to privacy, information security, and data protection, and any security breaches or our actual or perceived failure to comply with such legal obligations could harm our business.\nOur latest floor cleaning robots, as well as additional products in development, collect, store, process, and use certain customer data, which subjects us to governmental regulation and other legal obligations related to privacy, information security, and data protection, and any security breaches or our actual or perceived failure to comply with such legal obligations could harm our business. We collect, store, process, and use personal information and other user data, and we rely on third parties that are not directly under our control to do so as well. If our security measures, some of which are managed by third parties, are breached or fail, unauthorized persons may be able to obtain access to or acquire sensitive user data, which may expose us to a risk of loss, litigation, or regulatory proceedings. Depending on the nature of the information compromised, in the event of a data breach or other unauthorized access to or acquisition of our user data, we may also have obligations to notify users about the incident, and we may need to provide some form of remedy, such as a subscription to a credit monitoring service, for the individuals affected by the incident. In addition, the regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with frequent imposition of new and changing requirements. For example, the European Union's (\"EU\") General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\") and the California Consumer Privacy Act impose significant requirements on how we collect, process and transfer personal data, as well as significant fines for non-compliance. Compliance with changes in privacy and information security laws and standards may result in significant expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes. Moreover, a growing number of legislative and regulatory bodies have adopted consumer notification requirements in the event of unauthorized access to or acquisition of certain types of personal data. Such breach notification laws continue to evolve and may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another. Complying with these obligations could cause us to incur substantial costs and could increase negative publicity surrounding any incident that compromises user data.\nFurther, we may be or become subject to data localization laws mandating that data collected in a foreign country be processed and stored only within that country. Russia adopted such a law in 2014, and a similar law became effective in China in November 2021. If other countries in which we have customers were to adopt a data localization law, we could be required to expand our data storage facilities there or build new ones in order to comply. The expenditure this would require, as well as costs of compliance generally, could harm our financial condition.\nOur products are complex and could have unknown defects or errors, which may give rise to claims against us, diminish our brand or divert our resources from other purposes.\nOur robots rely on the interplay among behavior-based artificially intelligent systems, real-world dynamic sensors, user-friendly interfaces and tightly-integrated, electromechanical designs to accomplish their missions. Despite testing, our new or existing products have contained defects and errors and may in the future contain defects, errors or performance problems when first introduced, when new versions or enhancements are released, or even after these products have been used by our customers for a period of time. These problems have and may continue to result in expensive and time-consuming design modifications or warranty charges, delays in the introduction of new products or enhancements, significant increases in our service and maintenance costs, exposure to liability for damages, mandatory or voluntary recall or product upgrades, damaged customer relationships and harm to our reputation, any of which could materially harm our results of operations and ability to achieve market acceptance. Our quality control procedures relating to the raw materials and components that it receives from third-party suppliers as well as our quality control procedures relating to its products after those products are designed, manufactured and packaged may not be sufficient. In addition, increased development and warranty costs, including the costs of any mandatory or voluntary recall, could be substantial and could reduce our operating margins. The existence of any defects, errors, or failures in our products could also lead to product liability claims or lawsuits against us. A successful product liability claim could result in substantial cost, diminish our brand and divert management\u2019s attention and resources, which could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly.\nThe market price of our common stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility as a result of variations between our actual and anticipated financial results, announcements by us and our competitors, projections or speculation about our business or that of our competitors by the media or investment analysts or uncertainty about current global economic conditions. The stock market, as a whole, also has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of the common stock of many technology companies in ways that may have been unrelated to such companies\u2019 operating performance. In addition, the market price of our common stock may be, and we believe recently has been, significantly impacted by investors covering large short positions in our common stock. Furthermore, we believe the market\nprice of our common stock should reflect future growth and profitability expectations. If we fail to meet these expectations, the market price of our common stock may significantly decline.\nIn addition, there are many other factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate, including:\n\u2022actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results, including fluctuations resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates or acquisitions by us, or the quarterly financial results of companies perceived to be similar to us;\n\u2022deterioration and decline in general economic, industry and/or market conditions;\n\u2022announcements of technological innovations or new products or services by us or our competitors;\n\u2022changes in estimates of our financial results or recommendations by market analysts;\n\u2022announcements by us or our competitors of significant projects, contracts, acquisitions, strategic alliances or joint ventures; and\n\u2022changes in our capital structure, such as future issuances of securities or the incurrence of additional debt.\nOur financial results often vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter due to a number of factors, which may lead to volatility in our stock price.\nOur quarterly revenue and other operating results have varied in the past and are likely to continue to vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter in the future. These fluctuations may be due to numerous factors including:\n\u2022the size, timing and mix of orders from retail stores and distributors for our consumer robots;\n\u2022the mix of products that we sell in the period;\n\u2022disruption of supply of our products from our manufacturers;\n\u2022disruptions to our supply chain due to inclement weather, pandemics, labor disruptions or other factors beyond our control, including COVID-19;\n\u2022seasonality in the sales of our products;\n\u2022the timing of new product introductions;\n\u2022unanticipated costs incurred in the introduction of new products;\n\u2022costs and availability of labor and raw materials;\n\u2022costs of freight and tariffs;\n\u2022changes in our rate of returns for our consumer products;\n\u2022our ability to introduce new products and enhancements to our existing products on a timely basis; and\n\u2022warranty costs associated with our consumer products.\nWe cannot be certain that our revenues will grow at rates that will allow us to maintain profitability during every fiscal quarter, or even every fiscal year. We base our current and future expense levels on our internal operating plans and sales forecasts, including forecasts of holiday sales for our consumer products. A significant portion of our operating expenses, such as research and development expenses, certain marketing and promotional expenses and employee wages and salaries, do not vary directly with sales and are difficult to adjust in the short term. As a result, if sales for a quarter are below our expectations, we might not be able to reduce operating expenses for that quarter. Accordingly, a sales shortfall during a fiscal quarter, and in particular the fourth quarter of a fiscal year, could have a disproportionate effect on our operating results for that quarter or that year. Because of quarterly fluctuations, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful. Moreover, our operating results may not meet expectations of equity research analysts or investors. If this occurs, the trading price of our common stock could fall substantially either suddenly or over time.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and by-laws or Delaware law might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the trading price of our common stock.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation and by-laws and Delaware law may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares of our common stock. These provisions may also prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our management. These provisions include:\n\u2022limitations on the removal of directors;\n\u2022a classified board of directors so that not all members of our board are elected at one time;\n\u2022advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations;\n\u2022the inability of stockholders to act by written consent or to call special meetings;\n\u2022the ability of our board of directors to make, alter or repeal our by-laws; and\n\u2022the ability of our board of directors to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred stock without stockholder approval.\nThe affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75% of our shares of capital stock entitled to vote is necessary to amend or repeal the above provisions of our certificate of incorporation. In addition, absent approval of our board of directors, our by-laws may only be amended or repealed by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75% of our shares of capital stock entitled to vote.\nIn addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law prohibits a publicly-held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder, generally a person which together with its affiliates owns, or within the last three years has owned, 15% of our voting stock, for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner.\nThe existence of the foregoing provisions and anti-takeover measures could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. They could also deter potential acquirers of our company, thereby reducing the likelihood that you could receive a premium for your common stock in an acquisition.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nWe may not be able to obtain capital when desired on favorable terms, if at all, or without dilution to our stockholders.\nWe anticipate that our current cash, cash equivalents, cash provided by operating activities and funds available through our credit facility, will be sufficient to meet our current and anticipated needs for general corporate purposes. We operate in an emerging technology market, however, which makes our prospects difficult to evaluate. It is possible that we may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or otherwise have the capital resources to meet our future capital needs. In such cases we may need additional financing to execute on our current or future business strategies. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, the percentage ownership of our stockholders could be significantly diluted, and these newly-issued securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing stockholders. We cannot assure you that additional financing will be available on terms favorable to us, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, if and when needed, our ability to fund our operations, take advantage of unanticipated opportunities, develop or enhance our products, or otherwise respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited. In addition, our access to credit through our credit facility may be limited by the restrictive financial covenants contained in the agreement, which require us to maintain profitability.", "PERMNO": 90971, "SIC": 3990, "TIC": "IRBT"}
