{"cik": "921547", "company": "HERITAGE OAKS BANCORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-03", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIn the course of conducting its business operations, the Company is exposed to a variety of risks, some of which are inherent in the financial services industry and others of which are more specific to its own business. The following discussion addresses the most significant risks that could affect the Company's business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, and capital position and stock price. The risks identified below are not intended to be a comprehensive list of all risks faced by the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties that the Company is not aware of or that the Company currently deems immaterial may also impair our business.\nRenewed weakness in economic conditions could have a material and adverse effect on our business.\nOur performance could be materially and adversely affected to the extent there is deterioration in business and economic conditions that have a direct or indirect adverse effect on us, our customers and our counterparties. These conditions could result in one of the following: (i) a decrease in the demand for loans and other products and services offered by us, (ii) a decrease in customer savings generally and a corresponding decrease in the demand for savings and investment products offered by us, and (iii) an increase in the number of customers and counterparties that become delinquent, file for protection under the bankruptcy laws and/or default on their loans and other obligations to us. An increase in the number of delinquencies, bankruptcies or defaults could result in a higher level of non-performing assets, provisioning for credit losses, and valuation adjustments on loans held-for-sale.\nWe are highly dependent on the real estate market on the Central Coast of California and a renewed downturn in the real estate market may have a material and adverse effect on our business.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is collateralized by real estate. Although we have seen what we believe are the signs of stabilization in the local economies in which we operate, a renewed decline in economic conditions, the local housing market or rising interest rates could have an adverse effect on the demand for new loans, the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, the value of real estate and other collateral securing loans or the value of real estate owned by us, any combination of which could materially and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, a large portion of the loan portfolio is collateralized by real estate that is subject to risks related to acts of nature, including drought, earthquakes, floods, landslides and fires. To the extent that these events occur, they may cause uninsured damage and other loss of value to real estate that secures these loans, which may also materially and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur results of operations and financial condition can be impacted by the effect of the drought in California on our agricultural and related business.\nThe Company provides financing to agricultural businesses and other industries dependent on agriculture in the Central Coast of California. We recognize the cyclical nature of the industry, often caused by fluctuating commodity prices and changing climatic conditions. The Company remains committed to providing credit to agricultural customers and will always have a material exposure to this industry. In addition, the State of California has been experiencing drought conditions since 2013. The lack of rain will have an adverse impact on our agricultural customers' operating costs, crop yields and crop quality, which could impact such customers' ability to repay their loans to us consistent with the terms of such loans. The longer the drought continues, the more significant this impact will become. As a result, the Company's results of operations, financial condition, cash-flows and stock price can be negatively influenced by the impact of the drought on the banking needs of our agricultural customers.\nWe have a concentration in commercial real estate loans.\nWe have a high concentration in commercial real estate (\"CRE\") loans. CRE loans are defined as construction, land development, other land loans such as farmland, loans secured by multi-family (5 or more units) residential properties and loans secured by non-farm, non-residential properties. Following this definition, approximately 64.9% of our gross loans can be classified as CRE lending as of December 31, 2016. CRE loans generally involve a higher degree of credit risk than certain other types of lending due to, among other things, the generally large amounts loaned to individual borrowers. Losses incurred on loans to a small number of these borrowers could have a material and adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition. In addition, commercial real estate loans generally depend on the cash flow from the property to service the debt. Cash flow may be adversely affected by general economic conditions, which may result in non-performance by certain borrowers.\nThe cost and other effects of the full implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act remain unknown and may have a material and adverse effect on our business.\nThe federal banking agencies continue to implement the remaining requirements in the Dodd-Frank Act as well as promulgating other regulations and guidelines intended to assure the financial strength and safety and soundness of banks and the stability of the U.S. banking system. The full compliance burden and impact of the Dodd Frank Act on the Company's and the Bank's business, financial condition, and results of operations and profitability remain uncertain.\nFurther significant changes in banking laws or regulations, the interpretation of those rules and regulations, and changes in federal monetary policy could materially affect our business.\nIn addition to the Dodd-Frank Act discussed above, the banking industry is subject to extensive federal and state regulation. The implementation of new laws or changes in existing laws, including changes in the interpretations of such laws and related rules and regulations by regulators, courts or others, could have a negative impact on our business. Federal and state regulatory agencies also frequently adopt changes to their regulations or change the manner in which existing regulations are applied. Significant changes in these laws and regulations and/or the interpretation and enforcement thereof could materially and adversely affect our business. We cannot predict the substance or impact of any change in regulation, whether by regulators or as a result of legislation, or in the way such statutory or regulatory requirements are interpreted or enforced. Compliance with such current and potential regulation may significantly increase our costs, impede the efficiency of our business practices, require us to increase our regulatory capital and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities in an efficient manner.\nOur business is also impacted by federal monetary policy, particularly as implemented through the Federal Reserve Board. Federal monetary policy significantly affects our credit conditions, primarily through open market operations in United States government securities, the discount rate for member bank borrowing, and bank reserve requirements. Changes in trade and monetary and fiscal policies and laws, including the interest rate policies of the Federal Reserve Board could have a material and adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nImplementation of new Basel III capital rules adopted by the federal bank regulatory agencies require increased capital levels that we may not be able to satisfy and could impede our growth and profitability.\nThe new Basel III Capital Rules became effective January 1, 2015. The new rules increase minimum capital ratios, add a new minimum common equity ratio, add a new capital conservation buffer, and change the risk-weightings of certain assets. These changes will be phased in through 2019. As the rules are phased in they could have a material and adverse effect on our liquidity, capital resources and financial condition. See also Item 1. Business - Capital Adequacy Requirements, for a further discussion of Basel III Capital Rules.\nOur business is subject to credit exposure and our allowance for loan and lease losses may not be sufficient to cover actual loan losses.\nWe make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the probability of such borrowers making payments, as well as the value of real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans when considering the adequacy of the Company's allowance. If our assumptions are incorrect, our allowance for loan and lease losses may be insufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio, which may adversely impact our operating results. Our regulators, as an integral part of their regular examination process, periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase it by recognizing additional provisions for loan losses or to decrease our allowance for loan losses by recognizing loan charge-offs. Any additional provisions for loan losses or charge-offs, as required by these regulatory agencies, could have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company's business is subject to interest rate risk and variations in interest rates may negatively affect its financial performance.\nA substantial portion of the Company's income is derived from the differential or \"spread\" between the interest earned on loans, securities and other interest earning assets, and the interest paid on deposits, borrowings and other interest bearing liabilities. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond the Company's control, including general economic conditions and the policies of various governmental and regulatory authorities. As interest rates change, net interest income is affected. With fixed rate assets (such as fixed rate loans and investment securities) and liabilities (such as certificates of deposit), the effect on net interest income depends on the cash flows associated with the maturity of the asset or liability. Asset/liability management policy may not be successfully implemented and from time to time the Company's risk position may not be balanced. An unanticipated rapid decrease or increase in interest rates could have a material and adverse effect on the spreads between the interest rates earned on assets and the rates of interest paid on liabilities, and therefore on the level of net interest income. For instance, any rapid increase in interest rates in the future could result in interest expense increasing faster than interest income because of fixed rate loans and longer term investments. Further, substantially higher interest rates could reduce loan demand and may result in slower loan growth than previously experienced. Any one of these occurrences would have a material and adverse effect on the Company's results of operation and financial condition. Conversely, lower interest rates could lead to lower net interest margin due to maturing loans being financed at a lower rate as well as increased refinancing activity to lock in lower rates.\nCompetition from within and outside the financial services industry may materially and adversely affect our business.\nThe financial services business in our market area is highly competitive. It is becoming increasingly competitive due to changes in regulation, technological advances and the accelerating pace of consolidation among financial services providers. We face competition in attracting and retaining core business relationships. Increasing levels of competition in the banking and financial services business may reduce our market share, decrease loan demand, cause the prices we charge for our services to fall, resulting in a decline in the rates we charge on loans and/or cause higher rates to be paid on deposits. Therefore, our results may differ in future periods depending upon the nature and level of competition.\nAdditionally, technology and other changes are allowing parties to complete financial transactions, which historically have involved banks, through alternative methods. For example, consumers can now maintain funds, which would have historically been held as bank deposits in brokerage accounts or mutual funds. Consumers can also complete transactions such as paying bills and/or transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks. The process of eliminating banks as intermediaries, known as \"disintermediation,\" could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits. The loss of these revenue streams and the lower cost deposits as a source of funds could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nLiquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations and negatively impact our financial condition.\nLiquidity is essential to our business. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of loans and other sources could have a material and adverse effect on our liquidity. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry in general. Factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity due to a market downturn or adverse regulatory action against us.\nDeclines in the market value of our investment portfolio may adversely affect our financial performance, liquidity and capital.\nWe maintain an investment portfolio that includes, but is not limited to, mortgage-backed securities, municipal securities and asset backed securities. The market value of investments in our portfolio has become increasingly volatile over the last few years, largely due to disruptions in the capital markets and fluctuations in long term interest rates. The market value of investments may be affected by factors other than the underlying performance of the servicer of the securities, or the mortgages underlying the securities, such as changes in interest rates, credit ratings downgrades, adverse changes in the business climate, and a lack of liquidity in the secondary market for certain investment securities. Furthermore, problems at the federal and state government levels may trickle down to municipalities and adversely impact our investment in municipal bonds.\nOn a quarterly basis, we evaluate investments and other assets for impairment. We may be required to record impairment charges if our investments suffer a decline in value that is considered other-than-temporary. If we determine that a significant impairment has occurred, we would be required to charge the credit-related portion of the other-than-temporary impairment against earnings, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the periods in which the charges occur.\nLoss of customer deposits could increase the Company's funding costs.\nThe Company relies on bank deposits to be a low cost and stable source of funding. The Company competes with banks and other financial services companies for deposits. If the Company's competitors raise the rates they pay on deposits, the Company's funding costs may increase, either because the Company raises its rates to avoid losing deposits or because the Company loses deposits and must rely on more expensive sources of funding. Higher funding costs reduce the Company's net interest margin and net interest income. Checking and savings account balances and other forms of customer deposits may decrease when customers perceive alternative investments, such as the stock market, as providing a better risk/return tradeoff. When customers move money out of bank deposits and into other investments, the Company may lose a relatively low cost source of funds, increasing the Company's funding costs and reducing the Company's net interest income.\nFailure to successfully execute our strategic plan may adversely affect our performance.\nOur financial performance and profitability depend on our ability to execute our corporate strategies. Each year, our board of directors approves our long-term strategic plan and annual operating budget. Our near-term business strategy includes pursuing organic growth within our geographic footprint within the markets we currently serve. Our failure to achieve organic loan and deposit growth in our current market area may adversely impact our near-term financial performance goals. Other factors that may adversely affect our ability to attain our long-term financial performance goals include an inability to control non-interest expense, including, but not limited to, rising employee compensation, regulatory compliance and healthcare costs, limitations imposed on us through regulatory actions, and our inability to increase net interest income due to a continued low interest rate environment as well as competitive pressures within our primary market area.\nWe may not be able to attract and retain skilled people.\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract and retain key people. Competition for the best people can be intense and we may not be able to hire people or to retain them without offering very high compensation. The unexpected loss of the services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material and adverse impact on our business because of the loss of their skills, knowledge of our market and years of industry experience and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel.\nThe bank regulatory agencies have published guidance and regulations which limit the manner and amount of compensation that banking organizations provide to employees. These regulations and guidance may materially and adversely affect our ability to retain key personnel. Due to these restrictions, we may not be able to successfully compete with other larger financial institutions to attract, retain and appropriately incentivize high performing employees. If we were to suffer such adverse effects with respect to our employees, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe Company faces operational risks that may result in unexpected losses.\nWe are subject to certain operational risks, including, but not limited to, data processing system failures and errors, customer or employee fraud and catastrophic failures resulting from terrorist acts or natural disasters. We maintain a system of internal controls to mitigate against such occurrences and maintain insurance coverage for such risks that are insurable, but should such an event occur that is not prevented or detected by our internal controls, or is uninsured or in excess of applicable insurance limits, it could have a material and adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur controls and procedures could fail or be circumvented.\nManagement regularly reviews and updates our internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, but not absolute, assurances of the effectiveness of these systems and controls, and that the objectives of these controls have been met. Any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures, and any failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe occurrence of fraudulent activity, breaches of our information security or cybersecurity-related incidents could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nInformation technology systems are critical to our business. We use various technology systems to manage our customer relationships, general ledger, securities, deposits, and loans. As a financial institution, we are susceptible to fraudulent activity, information security breaches and cybersecurity-related incidents that may be committed against us or our clients, which may result in financial losses or increased costs to us or our clients, disclosure or misuse of our information or our clients' information, misappropriation of assets, privacy breaches against our clients, litigation, or damage to our reputation. These risks may increase in the future as we continue to increase our mobile-payment and other internet-based product offerings and expand our internal usage of web-based products and applications.\nSuch fraudulent activity may take many forms, including check fraud, electronic fraud, wire fraud, phishing, computer viruses, social engineering and other dishonest acts. Information security breaches and cybersecurity-related incidents may include fraudulent or unauthorized access to systems used by us or our clients, denial or degradation of service attacks, and malware or other cyberattacks. In recent periods, there continues to be a rise in electronic fraudulent activity, security breaches and cyber-attacks within the financial services industry, especially in the commercial banking sector due to cyber criminals targeting commercial bank accounts. Consistent with industry trends, we have also experienced an increase in attempted electronic fraudulent activity, security breaches and cybersecurity-related incidents in recent periods. Moreover, in the past year, several large corporations, including retail companies, have suffered major data breaches, where in some cases, exposing sensitive financial and other personal information of their clients and subjecting them to potential fraudulent activity. Some of our clients may have been affected by these breaches, which increase their risks of identity theft, credit card fraud and other fraudulent activity that could involve their accounts with the Bank.\nInformation pertaining to us and our clients is maintained, and transactions are executed, on our networks and systems, those of our clients and certain of our third party partners, such as our online banking or reporting systems. The secure maintenance and transmission of confidential information, as well as execution of transactions over these systems, are essential to protect us and our clients against fraud and security breaches and to maintain our clients' confidence. Increases in criminal activity levels and sophistication, advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries, vulnerabilities in third-party technologies (including browsers and operating systems) or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of the technology, processes and controls that we use to prevent fraudulent transactions and to protect data about us, our clients and underlying transactions, as well as the technology used by our clients to access our systems. Although we have developed, and continue to invest in, systems and processes that are designed to detect and prevent security breaches and cyber-attacks and periodically test our security, the inability to anticipate, or failure to adequately mitigate, breaches of security could result in: losses to us or our clients; our loss of business and/or clients; damage to our reputation; the incurrence of additional expenses; disruption to our business, and/or our ability to grow our online services or other businesses; additional regulatory scrutiny or penalties; or exposure to civil litigation or possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nTo date, we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyber-attacks or other information security breaches, but there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such attacks or attempted breaches, or incur such losses in the future. Our risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because of, among other things, the evolving nature and growth of these threats, our plans to continue to implement and increase Internet and mobile banking to meet customer demand, and the current economic and political environment. As cyber and other data security threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify and enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any security vulnerabilities.\nThe potential for fraud when regularly dealing with credit cards, debit cards, prepaid cards, and ACH transactions is significant.\nIssuers of credit, debit and prepaid cards and other industry participants, as well as depository institutions participating in the ACH network have suffered significant losses in recent years with respect to the theft of personal, financial and confidential data that has been illegally exploited for personal gain. In addition, we operate a number of electronic, check and other payment connections that are vulnerable to individuals engaging in fraudulent activities that seek to compromise payments and related financial systems illegally. The theft of such information is regularly reported and affects not only individuals but businesses as well. In recent years, losses from such fraud have been substantial. Although fraud has not had a material impact on the profitability of the Bank, it is possible that such activity could adversely impact it in the future.\nFurther, the Company may be affected by data breaches at retailers and other third parties who participate in data interchanges with us and our customers that involve the theft of customer credit and debit card data, which may include the theft of the Company's debit card PIN numbers and commercial card information used to make purchases at such retailers and other third parties. Such data breaches could result in us incurring significant expenses to reissue debit cards and cover losses, which could result in a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations or financial condition.\nThe Company is subject to significant financial and reputational risks from potential legal liability and regulatory action.\nWe face significant legal risks in our business, and the volume of claims and amount of damages and penalties claimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings against other financial institutions remain high. Increased litigation costs, substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against us could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations or cause significant reputational harm to the Company, which in turn could adversely impact its business prospects.\nImpairment of goodwill or intangible assets would result in a charge to earnings.\nGoodwill and intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually or when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable. We may be required to record a charge to earnings during the period in which any impairment of goodwill or intangibles is determined.\nNecessary changes in technology could be costly.\nThe financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements.\nWe may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material and adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company relies on third party service providers for key systems, placing us and our customers at risk if the vendor has service outages, work stoppages or is subjected to attacks on their IT systems that expose information relating to us and our customers.\nThe Company uses a third party software service provider to perform all of its transaction data processing. The Company also outsources other customer service applications, such as on-line banking, ACH and wire transfers, to third party vendors. If these service providers were to experience technical difficulties or incur any extended outages in services, it could have a material and adverse impact on the Company and its customers. Because such service providers service us and other banks, their systems could be affected by denial of service attacks directed at their other bank customers. In addition, third parties may seek to penetrate our vendors' IT systems, obtain information about us or our customers or access our customers' accounts, and exploit that information to wrongfully withdraw or transfer our customers' funds, which could have material and adverse impacts on our customers and the Company. Further, if the Company was required to switch service providers due to deterioration in service quality or other factors, there is no guarantee that it could obtain comparable services at a comparable price.\nOur operations face severe weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other external risks.\nSevere weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on our ability to conduct business. Such events could affect the stability of our deposit base; impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in loss of revenue and/or cause us to incur additional expenses. The Central Coast of California is subject to earthquakes, droughts, fires, floods and landslides. Operations in our market could be disrupted by both the evacuation of large portions of the population as well as damage and or lack of access to our banking and operation facilities. The local market that the Company serves is also currently facing drought conditions which could not only impact the largest industry in our market footprint, agriculture, but could have rippling effects on other industries, including hospitality. The occurrence of any such event could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMaintaining our reputation as a community bank is critical to our success and the failure to do so may materially and adversely affect our performance.\nWe are a community bank and our reputation is one of the most valuable components of our business. As such, we strive to conduct our business in a manner that enhances our reputation. If our reputation is negatively affected by the actions of our employees, or otherwise, our business, operating results and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may enter into new lines of business or offer new products and services which expose us to additional risk or which are not successful.\nWe may enter into new lines of business or offer new products or services as new opportunities arise or as our business strategy changes. New lines of business or new products or services may involve significant business, reputational or regulatory risk, including increased regulatory scrutiny. The success of these efforts depends on many factors, including the competitive landscape, market adoption and successful implementation. We may experience significant losses to the extent that we invest significant time and resources to a new line of business, product or service and it is not successful. There can be no assurance that we can successfully manage these risks and failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nChanges in accounting standards or tax legislation could have a negative impact on our business.\nOur accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. From time to time the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the SEC change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements or elected representatives approve changes to tax laws that could affect our corporate taxes. These changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on cash dividends from the Bank to meet our cash obligations.\nAs a holding company, dividends from our subsidiary bank provide a substantial portion of our cash flow used to service the interest payments on our trust preferred securities and any cash dividends to our shareholders. Various statutory provisions restrict the amount of dividends the Bank can pay to us without regulatory approval. If the Bank is unable to generate the profits necessary to service the interest payments, or we are unable to obtain regulatory approval to make dividends from the Bank to the Company, our business, operating results and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected.\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.\nFinancial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty and other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the financial instrument exposure due us. Any such losses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause the market price of PPBI common stock will fluctuate, the Company's shareholders cannot be sure of the exact value of the consideration they will receive in the Corporate Merger.\nUpon the effective time of the Corporate Merger, each share of Company common stock will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the merger consideration, consisting of shares of PPBI common stock pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement. The value of the merger consideration to be received by Company shareholders will be based on an exchange ratio, which is fixed at 0.3471 shares of PPBI common stock for each share of Company common stock. Because the price of PPBI common stock could fluctuate during the period of time between the Company special meeting and the time the Company's shareholders actually receive their shares of PPBI common stock as merger consideration, the Company's shareholders will be subject to the risk of a decline in the price of PPBI common stock during this period. The Company does not have the right to terminate the Merger Agreement or to re-solicit the vote of its shareholders solely because of changes in the market prices of PPBI common stock. Stock price changes may result from a variety of factors, including general market and economic conditions, changes in the values and perceptions of financial services stocks generally and PPBI in particular, changes in PPBI's business, operations and prospects and regulatory considerations. Many of these factors are beyond PPBI's control. Accordingly, at the time of the Company special meeting, the Company's shareholders will not know or be able to calculate the exact value of the shares of PPBI common stock they will receive upon completion of the Corporate Merger.\nDirectors and officers of the Company have some interests in the Announced Transaction that are in addition to or different than the interests of the Company's shareholders.\nThe Company's directors and officers have interests in the Announced Transaction as individuals that are in addition to, or different from, their interests as shareholders of the Company, which are:\n\u2022 The Company's directors and officers will receive, upon consummation of the Announced Transaction, options to acquire PPBI common stock in substitution of their Company options; in addition, directors and officers of the Company or its subsidiaries who will be retained by PPBI or its subsidiaries following the consummation of the Announced Transaction, will receive, upon consummation of the Announced Transaction, restricted shares of PPBI common stock in substitution of their Company restricted stock, and restricted stock units of PPBI in substitution of their Company restricted stock units; directors and officers of the Company and its subsidiaries who will not be retained by PPBI or its subsidiaries following the consummation of the Announced Transaction will have the vesting of their Company stock options, Company restricted stock and Company restricted stock units accelerated and (i) the Company restricted stock shall be converted into the right to receive the merger consideration and (ii) the cash-settled Company restricted stock units shall be converted into the right to receive cash; officers of the Company, whether or not retained, holding performance-based Company restricted stock units will receive cash for such awards;\n\u2022 The agreement of PPBI to honor indemnification obligations of the Company for a period of six (6) years, as well as to purchase liability insurance for the Company's directors and officers for six (6) years following the merger, subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement;\n\u2022 Cash payments to certain officers of the Company in the aggregate amount of approximately $4.75 million, on a pre-tax basis, pursuant to the terms of their respective employment-related agreements with the Company;\n\u2022 The appointment of Simone Lagomarsino, the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company and Heritage Oaks Bank, Michael Morris, the Chairman of the Board of the Company and Heritage Oaks Bank, and Michael Pfau, the Vice Chairman of the Board of the Company and Heritage Oaks Bank, to serve on the boards of directors of PPBI and Pacific Premier Bank effective upon completion of the merger;\n\u2022 Robert Osterbauer, Executive Vice President and commercial banking division Manager, North and Agribusiness Lending, with Heritage Oaks Bank, and Brooks Wise, Executive Vice President and commercial banking division Manager, South, with Heritage Oaks Bank, have entered into employment agreements with Pacific Premier Bank, which will each be effective upon the closing of the Corporate Merger, which provide compensation to those individuals for continued provision of services to, or employment with, Pacific Premier Bank following the Bank Merger; and\n\u2022 Effective as of the closing of the Corporate Merger, PPBI will establish a Community Advisory Board for the Central Coast Region, which shall be comprised of all members of the Company's board of directors as of the closing of the Corporate Merger who are willing to so serve and no additional compensation will paid for service on the Community Advisory Board.\nThe Company and PPBI boards of directors were aware of these interests and considered them, among other things, in their approval of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.\nThe termination fee and the restrictions on solicitation contained in the Merger Agreement may discourage other companies from trying to acquire the Company.\nUntil the completion of the Corporate Merger, with some limited exceptions, the Company is prohibited from soliciting, initiating, encouraging or participating in any discussion of or otherwise considering any inquiries or proposals that may lead to an acquisition proposal, such as a merger or other business combination transaction, with any person other than PPBI. In addition, the Company has agreed to pay a termination fee to PPBI in specified circumstances. These provisions could discourage other companies from trying to acquire the Company even though those other companies might be willing to offer greater value to the Company's shareholders than PPBI has offered in the Announced Transaction. The payment of the termination fee could also have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition.\nPPBI may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the Announced Transaction.\nThe success of the Announced Transaction will depend on, among other things, PPBI's ability to realize the anticipated revenue enhancements and efficiencies and to combine the businesses of PPBI and the Company in a manner that does not materially disrupt the existing customer relationships of the Company or result in decreased revenues resulting from any loss of customers and that permits growth opportunities to occur. If PPBI is not able to successfully achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected.\nPPBI and the Company have operated and, until the completion of the Announced Transaction, will continue to operate, independently. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of each company's ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect PPBI's ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers, depositors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the Announced Transaction. Integration efforts between the two companies could also divert management attention and resources. These integration matters could have an adverse effect on each of PPBI and the Company during the transition period and on the combined company following completion of the merger.\nThe market price of PPBI common stock after the Announced Transaction may be affected by factors different from those affecting the shares of the Company or PPBI currently.\nUpon completion of the Corporate Merger, holders of Company common stock will become holders of PPBI common stock. PPBI's business differs from that of the Company, and, accordingly, the financial condition and results of operations of the combined company and the market price of PPBI common stock after the completion of the Announced Transaction may be affected by factors different from those currently affecting the financial condition and results of operations of the Company or PPBI on a standalone basis.\nThe fairness opinion received by PPBI's board of directors from its financial advisor, D.A. Davidson, and the fairness opinion received by the Company's board of directors from the Company's financial advisor, Sandler O'Neill, will not be updated to reflect any changes since the date of such opinions.\nChanges in the operations and prospects of PPBI or the Company, general market and economic conditions and other factors that may be beyond the control of PPBI and/or the Company may alter the value of PPBI or the Company or the market price for shares of PPBI common stock or Company common stock by the time the Announced Transaction is completed. Neither the fairness opinion delivered by D.A. Davidson to the PPBI board of directors nor the fairness opinion delivered by Sandler O'Neill to the Company board of directors speaks as of any date other than the date of such opinion, which was December 12, 2016 in the case of D.A. Davidson's opinion, and December 11, 2016 in the case of Sandler O'Neill's opinion. The Merger Agreement does not require that either D.A. Davidson's or Sandler O'Neill's fairness opinion be updated as a condition to the completion of the Announced Transaction, and neither PPBI nor the Company intends to request that the respective fairness opinions be updated.\nThe Announced Transaction is subject to the receipt of approvals or waivers from regulatory authorities that may impose conditions that could have an adverse effect on PPBI.\nBefore the Announced Transaction can be completed, various approvals or waivers must be obtained from bank regulatory authorities. Regulatory approval or waivers are not guaranteed and even if granted, the bank regulatory authorities may impose conditions on the completion of the Announced Transaction or require changes to the terms of the Merger Agreement. Although PPBI and the Company do not currently expect that any such conditions or changes will be imposed, there can be no assurance that they will not be, and such conditions or changes could have the effect of delaying completion of the merger, imposing additional costs on, or limiting the revenues of PPBI following the merger or causing the Announced Transaction between PPBI and HEOP to terminate.\nThe Announced Transaction cannot be completed unless the PPBI shareholders approve the issuance of PPBI common stock in the merger and the Company's shareholders approve the Merger Agreement.\nIn order for the Announced Transaction to be completed, the PPBI shareholders must approve the issuance of PPBI common stock in the Announced Transaction and the Company shareholders must approve the Merger Agreement and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. While a vote of PPBI's shareholders is not required to approve the Announced Transaction, the approval of PPBI's shareholders is required under applicable NASDAQ rules in order for PPBI to be authorized to issue the shares of PPBI common stock to the Company's shareholders as the merger consideration. Approval of the issuance of PPBI common stock to the Company stockholders under NASDAQ rules requires approval of at least a majority of the total votes cast at the PPBI special meeting. The approval of the Merger Agreement by the Company's shareholders requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Company common stock. If either or both of these required votes is not obtained from the shareholders of each of the respective companies, the merger may not be consummated.\nThe Announced Transaction is subject to certain closing conditions that, if not satisfied or waived, will result in the Announced Transaction not being completed, which may cause the prices of PPBI common stock and the Company's common stock to decline.\nConsummation of the Announced Transaction is subject to customary conditions to closing in addition to the receipt of the required regulatory approvals and approval of the Company's shareholders of the Merger Agreement and the approval of PPBI's shareholders of the issuance of PPBI common stock in connection with the Announced Transaction. If any condition to the Announced Transaction is not satisfied or waived, to the extent permitted by law, the Announced Transaction will not be completed. In addition, PPBI and the Company may terminate the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances even if the Merger Agreement is approved by the Company's shareholders and the issuance of PPBI common stock in connection with the Announced Transaction is approved by PPBI's shareholders, including if the merger has not been completed on or before August 30, 2017. If the merger is not completed, the respective trading prices of PPBI common stock and Company common stock on the NASDAQ Global Stock Market may decline to the extent that the current prices reflect a market assumption that the Announced Transaction will be completed. In addition, neither company would realize any of the expected benefits of having completed the Announced Transaction.\nThe unaudited condensed pro forma combined financial data included in the joint proxy statement/prospectus are presented for illustrative purposes only and may not be an indication of the combined company's financial condition or results of operations following the Announced Transaction.\nThe unaudited condensed pro forma combined financial data contained in the joint proxy statement/prospectus are presented for illustrative purposes only, are based on various adjustments, assumptions and preliminary estimates and may not be an indication of the combined company's financial condition or results of operations following the Announced Transaction for several reasons. The actual financial condition and results of operations of the combined company following the Merger may not be consistent with, or evident from, these unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial data. In addition, the assumptions used in preparing the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial data may not prove to be accurate, and other factors may affect the combined company's financial condition or results of operations following the merger. Any potential decline in the combined company's financial condition or results of operations may cause significant variations in the stock price of the combined company.\nThe shares of PPBI common stock to be received by Company shareholders as a result of the Announced Transaction will have different rights than shares of the Company's common stock.\nUpon completion of the Announced Transaction, the Company's shareholders will become PPBI shareholders and their rights as shareholders will be governed by the PPBI amended and restated certificate of incorporation, the PPBI amended and restated bylaws and Delaware General Corporation Law. The rights associated with Company common stock are different from the rights associated with PPBI common stock.\nWe will be subject to contractual restrictions and business uncertainties while the merger with PPBI is pending.\nAlthough there is no assurance as to the exact timing, the merger currently is expected to close at the end of the first quarter of 2017 or early in the second quarter of 2017. The Merger Agreement requires us to operate in the ordinary course of business pending the Merger's completion, but restricts us from certain activities, including making acquisitions or opening of new branches, divestitures, issuance of securities and other customary restrictions without PPBI's consent. These restrictions may limit or prevent us from pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the merger, and which we might pursue absent the Merger Agreement.\nUncertainty about the effects of the merger, including branch consolidation and any divestitures that may be required, on our employees and customers may have an adverse effect on us. Certain employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles. These uncertainties may make it more difficult for us to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the merger is completed, and could cause our customers and others that deal with us to consider changing existing business relationships with us. It is not unusual for competitors to use mergers as an opportunity to seek the merging parties' customers and to hire certain of their staffs. If key employees depart the Corporation or the Bank in light of uncertainty over the merger or our integration efforts with PPBI, our business could be adversely affected.\nTermination of the Merger Agreement could negatively affect us.\nIf, for any reason, the Merger Agreement is terminated, our business may be adversely affected as a result of not pursuing other beneficial opportunities prior to such termination and our management focus on completing the merger. If the Merger Agreement is terminated and our board of directors seeks another merger or business combination, we may not be able to find a party willing to offer equivalent or more attractive consideration than the consideration PPBI has agreed to provide in the merger, especially if the termination fee of $15.0 million becomes payable as a result.
