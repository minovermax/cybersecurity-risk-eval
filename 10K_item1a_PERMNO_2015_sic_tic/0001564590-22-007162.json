Risk Factors.\nOur operating and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties. You should carefully consider the risks described below, as well as all of the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the section titled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and our financial statements and related notes, before investing in our common stock. While we believe that the risks and uncertainties described below are the material risks currently facing us, additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently think are immaterial may also arise and materially affect our business.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS\nThe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures implemented to contain the spread of the virus have adversely impacted and are expected to continue to adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nThe global COVID-19 pandemic presents significant risks to us, not all of which we are able to fully evaluate or even to foresee at the current time. The COVID-19 pandemic and related containment measures adversely affected our financial results and business operations during the year ended December 31, 2021 and are expected to continue to adversely impact our financial results and business operations. The extent to which the pandemic will continue to materially adversely affect our business and results of operations will depend on numerous evolving factors and future developments that we are not able to predict, including the duration, spread and severity of the outbreak, the availability and effectiveness of vaccines against COVID-19, continued mutations of the virus and the impact on such mutations on transmission rates and vaccine efficacy, the nature, extent and effectiveness of containment measures, the extent and duration of the effect on the economy, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. The COVID-19 pandemic and containment measures have contributed to, among other things:\n\u2022\nadverse impacts on our daily business operations and our colleagues\u2019 ability to perform necessary business functions, including as a result of illness or restrictions on movement;\n\u2022\nincreased challenges in managing clinical trials and product development;\n\u2022\ndecreased sales of our products as our hospital customers allocate resources to care of patients with COVID-19 and defer treatment of procedures utilizing our products;\n\u2022\ndecreased utilization of our products as patients elect to defer treatment for procedures utilizing our products due to real or perceived concerns about the potential spread of COVID-19 in hospital settings;\n\u2022\nincreased challenges in growing our customer base due to limitations on travel and in-person meetings due to shelter-in-place measures and demands on hospital customers in managing COVID-19 concerns;\n\u2022\ndiversion of time among our executive team on planning efforts to (i) manage the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our employees, including changes health and safety protocols at our manufacturing facilities, and efforts to better manage telecommuting among employees able to do so, (ii) avoid or minimize supply-chain disruptions, and (iii) preserve liquidity, which could impact a variety of business operations;\n\u2022\nincreased spending on our business continuity efforts for our headquarters and manufacturing operations, our supply chain, and readiness efforts for returning to our offices, which may in turn require that we further cut or defer costs and investments in other areas;\n\u2022\nincreased risk of an information or cyber-security incident, fraud, a failure to maintain the uninterrupted operation of our information systems due to, among other things, an increase in remote work;\n\u2022\nmaterial disruption of our supply of product components or ability to distribute our products, despite our efforts to manage potential supply-chain disruption;\n\u2022\nincreased prices for components and materials used in the production of our products due to inflation and supply-chain issues;\n\u2022\nmaterial business and manufacturing disruption caused by an outbreak at our headquarters and manufacturing facility for a sustained period of time; and\n\u2022\ndelays and disruptions of our research and development and product approval processes.\nAll of these factors may have far reaching impacts on our business, operations, and financial results and condition, including without limitation impacts on the health of our management and employees, manufacturing, distribution, marketing and sales operations, customer and patient behaviors, and economic and social conditions generally. The scope and nature of these impacts, most of which are beyond our control, continue to evolve and the outcomes are uncertain, and such impacts could exist for an extended period of time even after any cessation of the pandemic.\nWe have limited commercial experience.\nWe were incorporated in 2009 and began commercializing our Shockwave M5 intravascular lithotripsy (\u201cIVL\u201d) catheter (\u201cM5 catheter\u201d) for treating peripheral artery disease (\u201cPAD\u201d) in the United States and Europe in 2018 and our Shockwave C2 IVL catheter (\u201cC2 catheter\u201d) for treating coronary artery disease (\u201cCAD\u201d) in Europe in 2018. We initiated a limited launch of our Shockwave S4 IVL catheter (\u201cS4 catheter\u201d) in the first half of 2019 and commenced a full commercial launch in select approved geographies in the second half of 2019. We submitted our application for U.S. pre-market approval (\u201cPMA\u201d) with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the \u201cFDA\u201d) relating to our C2 catheters in August of 2020 and we received FDA approval for our C2 catheters in February 2021. We are currently initiating a limited market release in the United States and select international locations of our Shockwave M5+ IVL catheter (\u201cM5+ catheters\u201d), which was CE-Marked in November 2020 and cleared by the FDA in April 2021. Our limited commercialization experience and limited number of approved or cleared products make it difficult to evaluate our current business and predict our future prospects.\nThese factors also make it difficult for us to forecast our future financial performance and growth, and such forecasts are subject to a number of uncertainties, including our ability to: (i) successfully complete on-going clinical trials and other clinical trials we may undertake in the future, (ii) continue to successfully commercialize and expand usage of our products in the U.S. and international markets, and (iii) obtain regulatory approvals and successfully commercialize future planned products in the United States or in key international markets. If our assumptions regarding the risks and uncertainties we face, which we use to plan our business, are incorrect or change due to circumstances in our business or our markets, or if we do not address these risks successfully, our operating and financial results could differ materially from our expectations and our business could suffer.\nWe have a history of net losses, and we may continue to incur losses. We may not be able to sustain profitability.\nWe have incurred net losses since our inception and although we were profitable in the third and fourth quarters of 2021, we incurred a net loss for all of 2021 and we may continue to incur net losses in the future. For the years ended\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2020, we had net losses of $9.1 million and $65.7 million, respectively. As a result of these losses, as of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $252.8 million. We expect to continue to incur significant sales and marketing, research and development, regulatory and other expenses as we expand our marketing efforts to increase adoption of our products, expand existing relationships with our customers, obtain regulatory clearances or approvals for our planned or future products, conduct clinical trials on our existing and planned or future products and develop new products or add new features to our existing products. In addition, we expect to continue to incur expenses due to the compliance and governance requirements associated with being a public company. We may continue to incur losses in the future, which may fluctuate significantly from period to period. Although we achieved profitability for the third and fourth quarters of 2021, we cannot be sure that we will remain profitable for any substantial period of time. If our revenue declines or fails to grow at a rate faster than increases in our operating expenses, we will not be able to achieve and maintain profitability in future periods. As a result, we may continue to generate losses. We cannot ensure that we will achieve profitability in the future or that, if we do become profitable, we will be able to sustain profitability.\nOur results of operations may fluctuate significantly, which makes our future results of operations difficult to predict and could cause our results of operations to fall below expectations or any guidance we may provide.\nOur quarterly and annual results of operations, including our revenue, net income (loss) and cash flow, may fluctuate significantly, which makes it difficult for us to predict our future results of operations. These fluctuations may occur due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe level of demand for our products and any approved products, which may vary significantly;\n\u2022\nexpenditures that we may incur to acquire, develop, or commercialize additional products and technologies;\n\u2022\nthe timing and cost of obtaining regulatory approvals or clearances for planned or future products or indications;\n\u2022\nthe rate at which we grow our sales force and the speed at which newly hired salespeople become effective, and the cost and level of investment therein;\n\u2022\nthe degree of competition in our industry and any change in the competitive landscape of our industry, including consolidation among our competitors or our current or future partners;\n\u2022\npositive or negative media coverage of our products or the procedures or products of our competitors or our industry;\n\u2022\ncoverage and reimbursement policies with respect to our products, if approved, and potential future products that compete with our products;\n\u2022\nthe timing and success or failure of preclinical studies or clinical trials for our products or any future products we develop or competing products;\n\u2022\nour ability to attract new customers and improve our business with existing customers;\n\u2022\nthe timing of customer orders or medical procedures using our products and the number of available selling days in any quarterly period, which can be impacted by holidays, the mix of products sold and the geographic mix of where products are sold;\n\u2022\nseasonality, including the seasonal slowing of demand for our products we have experienced in the fourth quarter and summer months based on the elective nature of procedures performed using our products, and which we expect may become more pronounced in the future as our business grows;\n\u2022\nthe timing and cost of, and level of investment in, research, development, licenses, regulatory approval, commercialization activities relating to our products, acquisitions and other strategic transactions, or other significant events relating to our products, which may change from time to time;\n\u2022\nthe cost of manufacturing our products, which may vary depending on the quantity of production and the terms of our agreements with third-party suppliers and manufacturers;\n\u2022\ninterruption in the manufacturing or distribution of our products;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our suppliers to timely provide us with an adequate supply of components that meet our requirements for product quality and reliability;\n\u2022\nfuture accounting pronouncements or changes in our accounting policies; and\n\u2022\nthe continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations and financial results.\nThe cumulative effects of these factors could result in large fluctuations and unpredictability in our quarterly and annual results of operations. As a result, comparing our results of operations on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. Investors should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance.\nThis variability and unpredictability could also result in our failing to meet the expectations of industry or financial analysts or investors for any period. If our revenue or results of operations fall below the expectations of analysts or investors or below any forecasts we may provide to the market, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results or operations.\nOur ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carryforwards of approximately $351.0 million for federal income tax purposes, and $54.0 million for California and $160.6 million for other state income tax purposes. These federal NOLs (generated prior to 2018) begin expiring in 2030, the California NOLs begin expiring in 2031 and other state NOL carryforwards begin expiring in 2029. Utilization of these NOLs depends on many factors, including our future income, which cannot be assured. Some of these NOLs could expire unused and be unavailable to offset our future income tax liabilities. To the extent available, we intend to use these NOL and credit carryforwards to offset future taxable income and/or income tax liabilities associated with our operations. There can be no assurance that we will generate sufficient taxable income in the carryforward period to utilize the remaining tax attributes before they expire. As well, there are a variety of federal rules and regulations that may impact our ability to use our NOLs, including:\n\u2022\nSection 382. Under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and corresponding provisions of state law, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d which is generally defined as a greater than 50% change, by value, in its equity ownership by 5% stockholders over a three-year period, the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change NOLs and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income may be limited. We have not determined if we have experienced Section 382 ownership changes in the past and if a portion of our NOLs is subject to an annual limitation under Section 382. In addition, we may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent changes in our stock ownership, some of which may be outside of our control. If we determine that an ownership change has occurred and our ability to use our historical NOLs is materially limited, it could harm our future results of operations by effectively increasing our future tax obligations.\n\u2022\nThe TCJA. Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, enacted on December 22, 2017 (\u201cTCJA\u201d), federal NOLs incurred in 2018 and in future years may be carried forward indefinitely but generally may not be carried back and the deductibility of such NOLs is limited to 80% of taxable income.\n\u2022\nThe CARES Act. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the \u201cCARES Act\u201d) was enacted on March 27, 2020, to provide aid and economic stimulus to the economy. Among other provisions, the CARES Act eliminates the 80% NOL limitation for tax years 2018, 2019, and 2020, and allows NOLs generated in those years to be carried back for five years. We believe that any impact of the CARES Act provisions is not significant to our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nChanges in tax laws or regulations may have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, financial condition, or results of operations.\nFuture changes in tax laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, financial condition, or results of operations. For example, the TCJA enacted many significant changes to the U.S. tax laws, including changes in corporate tax rates, the realization of net deferred tax assets relating to our U.S. operations, the taxation of foreign earnings and the deductibility of expenses. In addition, it is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the TCJA or any newly enacted federal tax legislation. Although we are still awaiting guidance from the Internal Revenue Service on how some of the TCJA changes will impact us, beginning in 2022, the TCJA eliminates the option to immediately deduct research and development expenditures and requires taxpayers to amortize domestic expenditures over five years and foreign expenditures over 15 years. While it is possible that Congress may defer, modify, or repeal this provision, we have no assurance that this provision will be deferred, modified or repealed and even if Congress makes any such decision, it may not be retroactive to January 1, 2022, and could still therefore result in an impact on cash from operating activities and on the balance of our deferred taxes.\nThese and other changes resulting from the TCJA or future tax reform legislation could have a material impact on the value of our deferred tax assets, could result in significant one-time charges in the current or future taxable years, and could increase our future U.S. tax expense.\nWe may require additional capital to finance our planned operations, and may not be able to raise capital when needed, which could force us to delay, limit, reduce or eliminate our product development programs, commercialization efforts or other operations.\nSince our inception, we have incurred significant net losses and, although we had net income in the third and fourth quarters of 2021, we may incur net losses in the future. To date, our operations have been financed primarily by net proceeds from the sale of our equity securities and our product revenue. As of December 31, 2021, we had $201.0 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, and an accumulated deficit of $252.8 million. Based on our current planned operations, we expect that our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments will enable us to fund our cash requirements, including capital expenditures and working capital, for at least the next 12 months. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our capital resources sooner than we currently expect.\nWe have a number of ongoing clinical trials and expect to continue to make substantial investments in these trials and in additional clinical trials that are designed to provide clinical evidence of the safety and efficacy of our products. We have made and we plan to continue to make significant investments in our sales and marketing organization by increasing the number of U.S. sales representatives and expanding our international marketing programs to help facilitate further adoption among existing hospital accounts as well as broaden awareness of our products to new hospitals. We also expect to continue to make investments in research and development, regulatory affairs, and clinical studies to develop future generations of our products, support regulatory submissions and demonstrate the clinical efficacy of our products. Moreover, we expect to continue to incur expenses associated with operating as a public company, including legal, accounting, insurance, exchange listing and SEC compliance, investor relations and other expenses. Because of these and other factors, we may continue to incur net losses and negative cash flows from operations in the foreseeable future. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe cost, timing and results of our clinical trials and regulatory reviews;\n\u2022\nthe cost and timing of establishing sales, marketing, and distribution capabilities;\n\u2022\nthe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business;\n\u2022\nthe terms and timing of any other collaborative, licensing, and other arrangements that we may establish;\n\u2022\nthe timing, receipt and amount of sales from our current and potential products;\n\u2022\nthe degree of success we experience in commercializing our products;\n\u2022\nthe emergence of competing or complementary technologies;\n\u2022\nthe cost of preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights; and\n\u2022\nthe extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses, products, or technologies, although we currently have no commitments or agreements relating to any of these types of transactions.\nAs a result, we may require additional financing to fund working capital and pay our obligations. We may seek to raise any necessary additional capital through a combination of public or private equity offerings and/or debt financings. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in acquiring additional funding at levels sufficient to fund our operations or on terms favorable to us. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms when needed, we may be required to significantly reduce operating expenses, which may have a material adverse effect on our business and/or results of operations and financial condition. If we do raise additional capital through public or private equity or convertible debt offerings, the ownership interest of our existing stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect our stockholders\u2019 rights. If we raise additional capital through debt financing, we may be subject to covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures, or declaring dividends. Additional capital may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all.\nWe incur significant costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management is required to devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives.\nAs a public company, we have incurred and will continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses. We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), which requires, among other things, that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d), annual, quarterly, and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d), as well as rules subsequently adopted by the SEC and the Nasdaq Global Select Market (\u201cNasdaq\u201d) to implement provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, impose significant requirements on public companies, including requiring that we evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Further, in July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d), was enacted. There are significant corporate governance and executive compensation related provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act that require the SEC to adopt additional rules and regulations in these areas such as \u201csay on pay\u201d and proxy access. Stockholder activism, the current political environment and the current high level of government intervention and regulatory reform may lead to substantial new regulations and disclosure obligations, which may lead to additional compliance costs and impact the manner in which we operate our business in ways we cannot currently anticipate.\nCompliance with the rules and regulations applicable to public companies can be time-consuming and costly. If these requirements divert the attention of our management and personnel from other business concerns, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. For example, we expect these rules and regulations to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to incur substantial costs to maintain the same or similar coverage. We cannot predict or estimate the amount or timing of additional costs we may incur to respond to these requirements. The impact of these requirements could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, our board committees or as executive officers.\nIf we have material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we may not detect errors on a timely basis and our consolidated financial statements may be materially misstated. Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we are required to furnish a report by our management on, among other things, our internal control over financial reporting. To achieve compliance with Section 404, we engage in a process to document and evaluate our internal control over financial reporting, which process is both costly and challenging. Effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and, together with adequate disclosure controls and procedures, are designed to prevent fraud. Moreover, because we are no longer an emerging growth company, Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires our independent registered public accounting firm to annually attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, which has, and will continue to, require increased costs, expenses, and management resources. An independent assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls could detect problems that our management\u2019s assessment might not. Undetected material weaknesses in our internal controls could lead to financial statement restatements and require us to incur the expense of remediation. We are required to disclose changes made in our internal controls and procedures on a quarterly basis.\nAny failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. If we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to attest that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock could decrease. We could also become subject to stockholder or other third-party litigation, as well as investigations by Nasdaq, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources and could result in fines, trading suspensions or other remedies.\nWe are highly dependent on our senior management team and key personnel, and our business could be harmed if we are unable to attract and retain personnel necessary for our success.\nWe are highly dependent on our senior management and other key personnel. Our success will depend on our ability to retain senior management and to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future, including sales and marketing professionals, scientists, clinical specialists, engineers, and other highly skilled personnel and to integrate current and additional personnel in all departments. If we are not successful in attracting and retaining highly qualified personnel, including members of our senior management, it would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nCompetition for skilled personnel in our market is intense, especially in the San Francisco Bay Area where our headquarters are located, and may limit our ability to hire and retain highly qualified personnel on acceptable terms, or at all. Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have. Our competitors also may be successful in recruiting and hiring members of our management team or other key employees, and it may be difficult for us to find suitable replacements on a timely basis, on competitive terms, or at all. We have in the past, and may in the future, be subject to allegations that employees we hire have been improperly solicited, or that they have divulged proprietary or other confidential information or that their former employers own such employees\u2019 inventions or other work product, or that they have been hired in violation of non-compete provisions or non-solicitation provisions.\nTo induce valuable employees to remain at our company, in addition to salary and cash incentives, we have issued stock awards that vest over time. The value to employees of stock awards that vest over time may be significantly affected by movements in our stock price that are beyond our control and may at any time be insufficient to counteract more lucrative offers from other companies. Hiring and retention may also be impacted by the continuing COVID-19 pandemic. Despite our efforts to retain valuable employees, members of our management, scientific and development teams may terminate their employment with us on short notice. Our employment arrangements with our employees provide for at-will employment, which means that any of our employees could leave our employment at any time, with or without notice, cause or good reason. The loss of services of these personnel could prevent or delay our growth plans and the implementation and completion of our strategic objectives or divert management\u2019s attention to seeking qualified replacements. We also do not maintain \u201ckey man\u201d insurance policies on the lives of these individuals or the lives of any of our other employees.\nWe have increased the size of our organization and expect to further increase it in the future, and we may experience difficulties in managing this growth. If we are unable to manage the anticipated growth of our business, our future revenue and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had 657 full-time employees worldwide, compared to 449 full-time employees as of December 31, 2020. In response to growth in our business, including our product portfolio, customer base, and research and development programs, we have significantly expanded our employee headcount and existing operations, and established new operations in other countries. In order to manage this growth, we have needed, and expect to continue to need, additional managerial, operational, sales, marketing, financial and other personnel. Future growth would impose significant added responsibilities on members of management, including, among others:\n\u2022\nidentifying, recruiting, integrating, maintaining, and motivating additional employees;\n\u2022\nmanaging our internal development efforts effectively, while complying with our contractual obligations to contractors and other third parties; and\n\u2022\nimproving our operational, financial and management controls, reporting systems, and procedures.\nThe growth we may experience in the future may provide challenges to our organization, requiring us to also rapidly expand other aspects of our business, including our manufacturing operations. Rapid expansion in personnel may result in less experienced people producing and selling our products, which could result in unanticipated costs and disruptions to our operations. If we are not able to effectively expand our organization by hiring new employees and expanding our groups of consultants and contractors, we may not be able to further develop and commercialize our products and, accordingly, may not achieve our research and sales and marketing goals, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may acquire other businesses which could require significant management attention, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value, and adversely affect our results of operations.\nAs part of our business strategy, we may in the future make acquisitions or investments in companies, products or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our business model, enhance our technical capabilities, or otherwise offer growth opportunities and ways to further address the needs of our customers and potential customers. We cannot predict the number, timing or size of future acquisitions or investments, or the effect that any such transactions might have on our operating results, and this strategy poses a number of risks and uncertainties, including:\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates, or if we do, we may not be able to complete such acquisitions on favorable terms;\n\u2022\nthe pursuit of potential acquisitions may divert the attention of management and cause us to incur additional expenses in identifying, investigating, and pursuing suitable acquisitions, whether or not they are consummated;\n\u2022\nour existing Loan and Security Agreement with Silicon Valley Bank (the \u201cLoan and Security Agreement\u201d) restricts our ability to pursue certain mergers, acquisitions, amalgamations, or consolidations and this would need to be addressed, if possible, in order to enter into any such transactions;\n\u2022\nif we do complete acquisitions, we may not ultimately strengthen our competitive position or achieve our goals, including increases in revenue, and any acquisitions we complete could be viewed negatively by our customers, investors, and industry analysts;\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to integrate other companies, products, or technologies in a successful manner;\n\u2022\nwe may have to use our existing cash to pay for acquisitions, which may reduce our cash available for operations and other uses and could result in amortization expense related to identifiable assets acquired;\n\u2022\nwe may have to incur debt to pay for any such acquisition, which would result in fixed obligations and could also include covenants or other restrictions that could impede our ability to manage our operations and which could adversely affect our financial condition or the value of our common stock;\n\u2022\nacquisitions may require large, one-time charges and could result in increased debt or contingent liabilities, adverse tax consequences, additional stock-based compensation expenses and the recording and subsequent amortization of amounts related to certain purchased intangible assets, any of which could negatively affect our future results of operations; and\n\u2022\nacquisitions and investments may fail to meet our expectations and negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and we may also incur goodwill impairment charges in the future if we do not realize the expected value of any such acquisitions.\nWe may enter into collaborations, in-licensing arrangements, joint ventures, strategic alliances or partnerships with third-parties that may not result in the development of commercially viable products or product improvements or the generation of significant future revenue.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we may enter into or modify collaborations, in-licensing arrangements, joint ventures, strategic alliances, partnerships, or other arrangements (each, a \u201cCollaboration\u201d) to develop new products or product improvements and to pursue new markets. Any such Collaboration may subject us to business risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations, including the following:\n\u2022\nwe may be delayed or not successful in our efforts to identify or consummate any Collaboration;\n\u2022\nwe face significant competition in seeking appropriate strategic partners, including from other companies with substantially greater financial, marketing, sales, technology, or other business resources;\n\u2022\nthe negotiation process for any Collaboration may be time-consuming and complex and may distract senior management;\n\u2022\nwe may be delayed, or not be successful, in integrating such Collaboration with our existing operations and/or in achieving the revenue or specific net income or other targets that we anticipated as a result of such Collaboration;\n\u2022\nprovisions contained in the operative documents for any Collaboration may limited our rights, control, or decision-making authority in a manner that is not in our best interest;\n\u2022\nany delay or termination of a Collaboration related to our products could delay the development and commercialization of our products and reduce their competitiveness if they reach the market;\n\u2022\ncounterparties in any Collaboration may have economic or business interests or goals that are, or that may become, inconsistent with our business interests or goals;\n\u2022\nconflicts may arise with our collaborators and other business partners, such as conflicts concerning the achievement of performance milestones, or the interpretation of significant terms under any agreement, such as those related to financial obligations, termination rights or the ownership or control or other licenses of intellectual property rights, which may result in litigation or arbitration which would increase our expenses and divert the attention of our management; and\n\u2022\nwe may be required to incur non-recurring and other charges, increase our near and long-term expenditures, or issue securities that dilute our existing stockholders and disrupt our management and business.\nFor example, in March 2021, we entered into a joint venture with Genesis MedTech International Private Limited (\u201cGenesis\u201d) to establish a long-term strategic partnership to develop, manufacture and commercialize certain of our interventional products in the People\u2019s Republic of China, excluding the Special Administrative Regions of Hong Kong and Macau (\u201cChina\u201d). Under the joint venture agreement, Genesis Shockwave Private Ltd. was formed under the laws of Singapore to serve as a joint venture between us and Genesis for the purpose of establishing and managing such a strategic partnership. The termination of our joint venture with Genesis would disrupt our ability to commercialize our products in China.\nWe have a limited operating history in China and we face risks with respect to conducting business in connection with our joint venture in China due to certain legal, political, economic and social uncertainties relating to China. Our ability to monetize our joint venture in China may be limited.\nOur participation in the joint venture with Genesis in China is subject to general, as well as industry-specific, economic, political and legal developments and risks in China. The Chinese government exercises significant control over the Chinese economy, including but not limited to controlling capital investments, allocating resources, setting monetary policy, controlling and monitoring foreign exchange rates, implementing and overseeing tax regulations, providing preferential treatment to certain industry segments or companies and issuing necessary licenses to conduct business. In addition, we could face additional risks resulting from changes in China\u2019s data privacy and cybersecurity requirements. Accordingly, any adverse change in the Chinese economy, the Chinese legal system or Chinese governmental, economic or other policies could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations in China and our prospects generally.\nWe face additional risks in China due to China\u2019s historically limited recognition and enforcement of contractual and intellectual property rights. We may experience difficulty enforcing our intellectual property rights in China. Unauthorized use of our technologies and intellectual property rights by China partners or competitors may dilute or undermine the strength of our brands. If we cannot adequately monitor the use of our technologies and products, or enforce our intellectual property rights in China or contractual restrictions relating to use of our intellectual property by Chinese companies, our revenue could be adversely affected.\nOur joint venture with Genesis is subject to laws and regulations applicable to foreign investment in China. There are uncertainties regarding the interpretation and enforcement of laws, rules and policies in China. Because many laws and regulations are relatively new, the interpretations of many laws, regulations and rules are not always uniform. Moreover, the interpretation of statutes and regulations may be subject to government policies reflecting domestic political agendas. Enforcement of existing laws or contracts based on existing law may be uncertain and sporadic. As a result of the foregoing, it may be difficult for us to obtain swift or equitable enforcement of laws ostensibly designed to protect companies like ours, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Our ability to monetize our joint venture in China may also be limited.\nThe terms of the Loan and Security Agreement require us to meet certain operating and financial covenants and place restrictions on our operating and financial flexibility. If we raise additional capital through debt financing, the terms of any new debt could further restrict our ability to operate our business.\nOur Loan and Security Agreement initially provided for a $2.0 million revolving line of credit and a $15.0 million term loan.\nOn February 11, 2020, we entered into the First Amendment to the Loan and Security Agreement with Silicon Valley Bank (the \u201cAmended Credit Facility\u201d), to refinance our existing term loan. The Amended Credit Facility provided us with a supplemental term loan in the amount of $16.5 million. After repayment of the outstanding amount of the term loan, we received net proceeds of $3.3 million, which reflected an additional $4.3 million in principal as of the date of the modification less the final balloon payment fee of $1.0 million. In addition, the Amended Credit Facility terminated our revolving line of credit.\nThe supplemental term loan is secured by all of our assets, excluding intellectual property and certain other assets. Subject to the terms of the Amended Credit Facility, the supplemental term loan can be repaid at any time, subject to certain penalty payments, prior to the December 1, 2023 maturity date, at which time all amounts borrowed will be due and payable. The supplemental term loan is not subject to any financial covenants but is subject to customary affirmative and restrictive covenants, including with respect to our ability to enter into fundamental transactions, incur additional indebtedness, grant liens, pay any dividend or make any distributions to our holders, make investments, merge or consolidate with any other person or engage in transactions with our affiliates. If we fail to comply with the covenants or payments in connection with\nthe supplemental term loan, Silicon Valley Bank could declare an event of default, which would give it the right to terminate its commitment to provide additional loans and declare all borrowings outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable. In addition, Silicon Valley Bank would have the right to proceed against the assets we provided as collateral pursuant to the loan. The foregoing may restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to certain changes in our business or industry or take future actions.\nIf we experience significant disruptions in, or breaches of, our information technology systems, our business may be adversely affected.\nWe depend on using increasingly complex information technology systems both with our own systems and those of our cloud and third-party service providers, for the efficient functioning of our business, including the manufacture, distribution, and maintenance of our products, management of clinical trial data and employee data, as well as for accounting, data storage, compliance, purchasing and inventory management. Our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources designed to maintain, protect, and enhance our existing systems, however, a number of issues could impact the integrity of our systems including:\n\u2022\nTechnology risks (\u201cTechnology Risks\u201d), including failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases, or components thereof, power outages, damage or interruption from fires or other natural disasters, hardware failures, telecommunication failures, and user errors.\n\u2022\nData- and cyber-security threats (\u201cCyber Risks\u201d), including computer viruses, ransomware or other malware, crypto-jacking, cloud vulnerabilities, phishing attacks, social engineering, and attacks by computer hackers or wrongdoing from our own employees or others granted access to our information technology systems.\nAs we become more dependent on information technologies to conduct our operations, Technology Risks may become more widespread and Cyber Risks may increase in frequency and sophistication. As well, because of the nature Cyber Risks and the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable, or degrade service or sabotage systems that change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we and our service providers may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement timely adequate preventative measures. In addition, a greater number of our employees working remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic has exposed us, and may continue to expose us, to increased Cyber Risks. Although we have expended, and will likely continue to need to expend, significant resources and make significant capital investment in efforts designed to protect against security breaches or to mitigate the impact of any such breaches, we realize that Cyber Risks are a threat, and there can be no assurance of our efforts will prevent information security breaches that would result in business, legal, financial, or reputational harm to us, or would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWhile we have not experienced any such material Technology Risk or Cyber Risk to date, if a Technology Risk or Cyber Risk results in an actual system disruption or a security incident that results in an unauthorized access to personal information or other confidential information, such disruption or security incident could, among other things:\n\u2022\nslow or delay our operations, including our ability to timely ship and track product orders, project inventory requirements, manage our supply chain and otherwise adequately service our customers or disrupt our customers\u2019 ability use our products for treatments;\n\u2022\nresult in the disclosure or misuse of confidential, personal, or proprietary information, including sensitive customer, vendor, employee, or financial information;\n\u2022\ncompromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data stored on these systems;\n\u2022\ndamage our computers and information technology systems;\n\u2022\ndamage our ability to attract and retain new customers and work with existing customers;\n\u2022\ndamage our reputation and business, including with respect to both our customers and patients undergoing procedures utilizing our products;\n\u2022\nresult in litigation and governmental investigations; and\n\u2022\nresult in significant recovery or remediation costs.\nCurrently, we carry business interruption coverage to mitigate certain potential losses, but this insurance is limited in amount and may not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to Technology Risks and Cyber Risks and related business and system disruptions. We cannot be certain that such potential losses will not exceed our policy limits,\ninsurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all, or any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. In addition, we may be subject to changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements.\nAccordingly, such events may disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our entire operation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential, personal, or proprietary information, we could incur liability and the further development and commercialization of our products could be delayed or disrupted. With the ever-changing threat landscape, and while we have implemented security measures to protect our information technology systems and infrastructure, there can be no assurance that such measures will prevent service interruptions or security breaches that could adversely affect our business.\nWe face risks related to our collection and use of data, which could result in investigations, inquiries, litigation, fines, legislative and regulatory action and negative press about our privacy and data protection practices.\nIn connection with various facets of our business, we collect and use personal data, such as name, mailing address, email addresses, mobile phone number, medical and location information, the collection and use of which is regulated by a variety of privacy and security laws, rules and regulations. We also receive personal data from third parties for similar purposes and subject to legal obligations. Any violations of these rules by us could lead to civil and criminal penalties as well as adverse publicity that could harm our ability to initiate and complete clinical trials. In addition, when conducting clinical trials, we must collect and manage all clinical trial data in a manner consistent with applicable laws and regulations, including the Common Rule, Good Clinical Practice (\u201cGCP\u201d) guidelines, and FDA human subject protection regulations. We also face risks inherent (i) in the collection, use, and selective disclosure of large volumes of personal and non-personal proprietary data and (ii) in the protecting of personal and sensitive data from the Cyber and Technology Risks discussed above with appropriate security measures. Privacy and data protection laws, rules and regulations evolve frequently, and their scope may continually change through new legislation, amendments to existing legislation, and changes in enforcement, and may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another.\nAny failure by us or any of our third-party service providers to follow such laws, regardless of fault, could result in significant liability under various state, federal and international privacy, data protection and other laws, including, the laws listed below. In addition to the liability related to failing to comply with data security obligations, we may also face liability under state, federal, and internal privacy laws if we handle individual personal information in violation of such applicable laws. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve, and there has been an increasing focus on privacy and data protection issues that may affect our business, including recently enacted laws in all jurisdictions where we operate:\n\u2022\nThe Federal Trade Commission (the \u201cFTC\u201d) also sets expectations for failing to take appropriate steps to keep consumers\u2019 personal information secure, or failing to provide a level of security commensurate to promises made to individual about the security of their personal information (such as in a privacy notice) may constitute unfair or deceptive acts or practices in violation of Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act (the \u201cFTC Act\u201d). The FTC expects a company\u2019s data security measures to be reasonable and appropriate in light of the sensitivity and volume of consumer information it holds, the size and complexity of its business, and the cost of available tools to improve security and reduce vulnerabilities. Individually identifiable health information is considered sensitive data that merits stronger safeguards. With respect to privacy, the FTC also sets expectations that companies honor the privacy promises made to individuals about how the company handles consumers\u2019 personal information; any failure to honor promises, such as the statements made in a privacy policy or on a website, may also constitute unfair or deceptive acts or practices in violation of the FTC Act. While we do not intend to engage in unfair or deceptive acts or practices, the FTC has the power to enforce promises as it interprets them, and events that we cannot fully control, such as data breaches, may be result in FTC enforcement. Enforcement by the FTC under the FTC Act can result in civil penalties or enforcement actions.\n\u2022\nCalifornia\u2019s recently adopted California Consumer Privacy Act (the \u201cCCPA\u201d) and will be modified by the successful 2020 ballot initiative titled the California Privacy Rights Act (the \u201cCPRA\u201d), coming into effect in January 2023 (with a look back to January 2022). The CCPA establishes certain requirements for data use and sharing transparency and creates new data privacy rights for California consumers (as defined by the law). In November 2020, California voters approved the CPRA ballot initiative which introduced significant amendments to the CCPA and established and funded a dedicated California privacy regulator, the California Privacy Protection Agency (the \u201cCPPA\u201d). New implementing regulations are expected to be introduced by the CPPA. Failure to comply with the CCPA may result in, among other things, significant civil penalties and injunctive\nrelief, or statutory or actual damages. In addition, California residents have the right to bring a private right of action in connection with certain types of incidents. These claims may result in significant liability and damages. The uncertainty, ambiguity, complexity and potential inconsistency surrounding the implementation and interpretation of the CCPA and other enacted or potential laws in other states exemplify the vulnerability of our business to the evolving regulatory environment related to the privacy, security and confidentiality of personal information. Other states have followed California\u2019s lead, such as Virginia and Colorado, each of whom have passed similar legislation that will go into effect in 2023. As of January 2022, fourteen states have pending consumer privacy legislation under review, which if enacted would add additional costs and expense of resources to maintain compliance.\n\u2022\nThe European Union (the \u201cEU\u201d) General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) which applies extraterritorially and imposes several strict requirements for controllers and processors of personal data, including, for example, higher standards for obtaining consent from individuals to process their personal data, more robust disclosures to individuals regarding the processing of their personal data and a strengthened individual data rights regime, shortened timelines for data breach notifications, limitations on retention and use of information, increased requirements pertaining to the processing of special categories of personal data and pseudonymized (i.e., key-coded) data, additional obligations regarding the sharing of personal data with third parties, and security breach notification obligations, including reporting of personal data breaches to the supervisory authority without undue delay. The GDPR, as well as law in the United Kingdom (the \u201cUK\u201d) and Switzerland, also prohibits the international transfer of personal data from the EEA/UK/Switzerland to countries outside of those jurisdictions unless made to a country deemed to have adequate data privacy laws by the European Commission or where a data transfer mechanism has been put in place. On June 4, 2021, the European Commission adopted new SCCs to apply to international transfers to such countries, like the United States, who have not been deemed to have adequate privacy laws. We will have until December 27, 2022 to update any existing agreements, or any new agreements executed before September 27, 2021, that rely on the former SCCs. If we are otherwise unable to transfer personal data between and among countries and regions in which we operate, it could affect the manner in which we conduct our operations, and we may find it necessary to establish systems in the EEA, Switzerland, and the UK to maintain personal data originating from the EEA and the UK, which may involve substantial expense and distraction from other aspects of our business. Further, the GDPR provides that countries in the EEA may establish their own laws and regulations further restricting the processing of certain personal data, including genetic data, biometric data, and health data. Companies that must comply with the GDPR face increased compliance obligations and risk, including more robust regulatory enforcement of data protection requirements and potential fines for noncompliance of up to \u20ac20 million (approximately $22.6 million) or 4 percent of the annual global revenues of the noncompliant company, whichever is greater. The departure of the UK from the EU as of January 31, 2020 has added increased compliance efforts specifically relating to the UK and these UK-specific compliance efforts may become greater as time passes requiring more attention to the collection, use, disclosure, transfer, and protection of personal information; failure to adhere to the UK\u2019s incorporation of GDPR into UK national law provides for comparable penalties, such as the ability to separately fine up to the greater of \u00a317.5 million (approximately $23.7 million) or 4 percent of global turnover.\n\u2022\nIn Japan, The Act on the Protection of Personal Information (the \u201cAPPI\u201d), in effect since 2003 and amended several times, with the most recent amendments coming into effect in April 2022, provides a comprehensive data privacy and protection regime comparable to the GDPR. (Japan also has additional sectorial laws governing the medical sector and the handling of personal information.) The APPI applies to every Personal Information Controller (\u201cPIC\u201d) in Japan that is either a person or an entity that handles personal information in the course of their or its business; some extra-territorial provisions exist for offshore PICs in certain situations. PICs are subject to disclosure requirements governing their collection, use, and disclosure of personal information, as well as restrictions on the transfer of data outside of Japan comparable to the GDPR\u2019s approach to countries not deemed to have adequate data protection measures. Data subjects also have the right to access, rectify, correct, amend, or delete their personal data, and to request the cessation of use of their personal data if it is used for a purpose other than the one originally stated, or if it was acquired by fraudulent or other unlawful means. PICs have legal obligations to secure personal information and report losses to the Japanese government. These rights are enforced by the Personal Information Protection Commission, which has the power to issue orders for \u201cimprovement\u201d in response to violations of privacy law by PICs. Beginning on April 1, 2022, new amendments taking effect will provide that a PIC\u2019s noncompliance with an order for improvement would be grounds for harsher penalties than were previously in place, including criminal imprisonment for up to one year or a criminal\nfine of up to JPY 1 million (approximately $8,700) for an individual who is the PIC or who is the director or employee of the PIC entity responsible for the breach, and a criminal fine of up to JPY 100 million (approximately $870,000) for the PIC as an entity.\nWe cannot provide assurance that current or future legislation will not prevent us from generating or maintaining personal data or that patients will consent to the use of their personal data (as necessary); either of these circumstances may prevent us from undertaking or publishing essential research and development, manufacturing, and commercialization, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nFederal, state, and foreign government requirements include obligations of companies to notify regulators and/or individuals of security breaches involving personally identifiable information resulting from Technology or Cyber Risks experienced by us, or our vendors, contractors, or organizations with whom we had specific contractual obligations to protect our data. Further, the improper access to, use of, or disclosure of our data or a third-party\u2019s personal data could subject us to individual or consumer class action litigation and governmental investigations and proceedings by federal, state and local regulatory entities in the United States and by international regulatory entities. Compliance with these and any other applicable privacy and data security laws and regulations is a rigorous and time-intensive process, and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance with the new data protection rules and possible government oversight.\nIn addition to government regulation, privacy advocates and industry groups have and may in the future propose self-regulatory standards from time to time. These and other industry standards may legally or contractually apply to us, or we may elect to comply with such standards. It is possible that if our practices are not consistent or viewed as not consistent with legal and regulatory requirements, including changes in laws, regulations and standards or new interpretations or applications of existing laws, regulations and standards, we may become subject to audits, inquiries, whistleblower complaints, adverse media coverage, investigations, loss of export privileges, or severe criminal or civil sanctions, all of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, reputation, and financial condition.\nAny such liability, litigation, investigations and proceedings may or may not be covered by our liability insurance. and may subject us to significant penalties and negative publicity, require us to change our business practices, increase our costs, severely disrupt our business, and may result in significant reputational harm producing a material adverse effect on our client base, patient base and revenue.\nLitigation and other legal proceedings may adversely affect our business.\nFrom time to time, we may become involved in legal proceedings relating to patent and other intellectual property matters, product liability claims, employee claims, tort or contract claims, federal regulatory investigations, securities class action and other legal proceedings or investigations, which could have an adverse impact on our reputation, business and financial condition and divert the attention of our management from the operation of our business. Litigation is inherently unpredictable and can result in excessive or unanticipated verdicts and/or injunctive relief that may affect how we operate our business. We could incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims for monetary damages or for agreements to change the way we operate our business, or both. There may be an increase in the scope of these matters or there may be additional lawsuits, claims, proceedings, or investigations in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against us could damage our reputation and brand, undermine our customers\u2019 confidence, and reduce long-term demand for our products, even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operations.\nOur employees, independent contractors, consultants, commercial partners, distributors, and vendors may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements.\nWe are exposed to the risk that our employees, independent contractors, consultants, commercial partners, distributors, and vendors may engage in fraudulent or illegal activity. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional, reckless and/or negligent conduct or disclosure of unauthorized activities to us that violates: (i) the laws of the FDA and other domestic and foreign regulatory bodies, including those laws requiring the reporting of true, complete and accurate information to such regulators; (ii) manufacturing standards; (iii) healthcare fraud and abuse laws in the United States and similar foreign fraudulent misconduct laws; (iv) data privacy laws and other similar non-U.S. law; or (v) laws that require the true, complete and accurate reporting of financial information or data. These laws may impact, among other things, future sales, marketing, and education programs. In particular, the promotion, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry, including the sale of medical devices, are subject to extensive laws and regulations designed to prevent fraud, misconduct, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, structuring and commissions, certain customer incentive\nprograms and other business arrangements generally. Activities subject to these laws also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of patient recruitment for clinical trials, creating fraudulent data in preclinical studies or clinical trials or illegal misappropriation of product, which could result in regulatory sanctions and cause serious harm to our reputation.\nWe have adopted a code of business conduct and ethics and a global anti-corruption policy, but it is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct by our employees and other third parties, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent these activities may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. In addition, we are subject to the risk that a person or government could allege such fraud or other misconduct, even if none occurred. If any such actions are instituted against us and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could result in the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions, including the imposition of civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, additional integrity reporting and oversight obligations, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings and curtailment of operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. Whether or not we are successful in defending against any such actions or investigations, we could incur substantial costs, including legal fees, and divert the attention of management in defending ourselves against any of these claims or investigations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nUnfavorable global economic conditions could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nOur results of operations could be adversely affected by general conditions in the global economy and financial markets. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused extreme volatility and disruptions in the global capital and credit markets. A severe or prolonged economic downturn, could result in a variety of risks to our business, including driving hospitals to tighten budgets and curtail spending, which would negatively impact our sales and business. A significant change in the liquidity or financial condition of our customers could cause unfavorable trends in their purchases and also in our receivable collections, and additional allowances may be required, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Adverse worldwide economic conditions may also adversely impact our suppliers\u2019 ability to provide us with materials and components, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nDisasters and other business disruptions could seriously harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses.\nWe operate our business in regions subject to earthquakes, fires, medical epidemics, and pandemics, power shortages, telecommunications failures, water shortages, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, shifting climate patterns, extreme weather conditions, and other natural or man-made disasters or business interruptions, for which we are predominantly self-insured. Additionally, we rely on third-party manufacturers to produce various components that are integrated into our products, third-party distributors to distribute our products and hospitals to purchase our products, each of which is also vulnerable to such natural or man-made disasters or business interruptions. Our ability to obtain supplies of components and to distribute and sell our finished products could be disrupted if the operations of these suppliers, distributors, or hospitals were materially affected by any such natural or man-made disaster or other business interruption.\nIn addition, our corporate headquarters and manufacturing facilities are located in Santa Clara, California, near major earthquake faults and fire zones. If a major earthquake, wildfire or other natural disaster were to damage our facilities or the facilities of suppliers and service providers, or impact the ability of our employees or the employees of our suppliers and service providers to continue business operations, we may experience potential impacts ranging from production and shipping delays to lost revenues and increased costs. The occurrence of any of these natural or man-made disasters or other business disruptions could seriously harm our operations and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR PRODUCTS\nWe currently manufacture and sell products that are used in a limited number of procedures and for only certain specified indications, which could negatively affect our operations and financial condition.\nCurrently, our commercialized products consist primarily of our IVL system (\u201cIVL System\u201d) using M5 catheters and M5+ catheters for the treatment of above-the-knee PAD, S4 catheters for the treatment of below-the knee PAD, and C2\ncatheters for the treatment of CAD, each of which is available in the United States, Europe, and other international markets. We are therefore dependent on widespread market adoption of these products and we will continue to be dependent on the success of these products for the foreseeable future. There can be no assurance that our products will gain a substantial degree of market acceptance among specialty physicians, patients, or healthcare providers. Our failure to successfully increase sales of these products or any other event impeding our ability to sell these products would result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur long-term growth depends on our ability to enhance our products, expand our indications and develop and commercialize additional products in a timely manner. If we fail to identify, acquire, and develop other products, we may be unable to grow our business.\nAs a significant part of our growth strategy, we intend to develop and commercialize additional products through our research and development program or by licensing or acquiring additional products and technologies from third parties. The success of this strategy depends upon our ability to identify, select, and acquire the rights to products and technologies on terms that are acceptable to us. The success of any new product offering or product enhancements will depend on several factors, including our ability to:\n\u2022\nassemble sufficient resources to acquire or discover additional products;\n\u2022\nproperly identify and anticipate physician and patient needs;\n\u2022\ndevelop and introduce new products and product enhancements in a timely manner;\n\u2022\ndevelop intellectual property rights for our new products and continue to protect intellectual property rights for existing products;\n\u2022\navoid infringing upon the intellectual property rights of third-parties;\n\u2022\ndemonstrate, if required, the safety and efficacy of new products with data from preclinical studies and clinical trials;\n\u2022\nobtain the necessary regulatory clearances or approvals for expanded indications, new products or product modifications;\n\u2022\nbe fully FDA-compliant with marketing of new devices or modified products;\n\u2022\nproduce new products in commercial quantities at an acceptable cost;\n\u2022\nprovide adequate training to potential users of our products;\n\u2022\nreceive adequate coverage and reimbursement for procedures performed with our products; and\n\u2022\ndevelop an effective and dedicated sales and marketing team.\nProposing, negotiating, and implementing an economically viable product or technology acquisition or license is a lengthy and complex process. Other companies, including those with substantially greater financial, marketing and sales resources, may compete with us for the acquisition or license of approved or cleared products. We may not be able to acquire or license the rights to additional approved or cleared products on terms that we find acceptable, or at all.\nIf we are unable to develop suitable potential products through internal research programs or by obtaining rights from third parties, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our products are not approved for planned or new indications, our commercial opportunity will be limited.\nWe currently market and sell our M5 and M5+ catheters and S4 catheters for the treatment of calcified plaque in patients with PAD and our C2 catheters for the treatment of calcified plaque in patients with CAD in the United States, Europe and other international markets. However, our strategy includes pursuing additional vascular indications for our products. Conducting clinical studies to obtain data for new or additional indications may require substantial additional funding. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully obtain clearance or approval for any of these additional product indications. Even if we obtain clearance or approval to market our products for additional indications in the United States or internationally, we cannot assure you that any such indications will be successfully commercialized, widely accepted in the marketplace or more effective than other commercially available alternatives. If we are unable to successfully develop our\nproducts for new or additional indications, our commercial opportunity will be limited, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nProduct clearances and approvals can often be denied or significantly delayed and material modifications to our products may require new clearances or pre-market approvals or may require us to recall or cease marketing our products until clearances or approvals are obtained.\nUnder FDA regulations, unless exempt, a new medical device may only be commercially distributed after it has received 510(k) clearance, is authorized through the de novo classification process, or is the subject of an approved PMA. The FDA will clear marketing of a medical device through the 510(k) process if it is demonstrated that the new product is substantially equivalent to another legally marketed product not subject to a PMA. Sometimes, a 510(k) clearance must be supported by preclinical and clinical data. Our ability to enroll patients in clinical trials has been and may continue to be impacted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe PMA process typically is more costly, lengthy, and stringent than either the 510(k) process or the de novo classification process. Unlike a 510(k) review, which determines \u201csubstantial equivalence,\u201d a PMA requires that the applicant demonstrate reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective by producing valid scientific evidence, including data from preclinical studies and clinical trials. Therefore, to obtain regulatory clearance or approvals, we typically must, among other requirements, provide the FDA and similar foreign regulatory authorities with preclinical and clinical data that demonstrate to their satisfaction that our products satisfy the criteria for approval. Preclinical testing and clinical trials must comply with the regulations of the FDA and other government authorities in the United States and similar agencies in other countries.\nWe may be required to obtain PMAs, PMA supplements, de novo classification, or additional 510(k) pre-market clearances to market modifications to our existing products, such as changes to the intended use or technological characteristics of our products. Based on FDA published guidelines, the FDA requires device manufacturers to initially make and document a determination of whether a device modification requires new approval, supplemental approval or clearance; however, the FDA can review a manufacturer\u2019s decision. The FDA may not agree with our decisions not to seek approvals or clearances for particular device modifications. Any modification to an FDA-cleared device that could significantly affect its safety or efficacy or that would constitute a major change in its intended use would require a new 510(k) clearance or possibly a PMA. For Class III devices, changes that affect safety and effectiveness will require the submission and approval of a PMA supplement. We have made modifications to our products in the past and expect to make additional modifications in the future that we believe do not or will not require additional clearances or approvals. If the FDA requires us to obtain PMAs, PMA supplements or pre-market clearances for any modification to a previously cleared or approved device, we may be required to cease manufacturing and marketing of the modified device and perhaps also to recall such modified device until we obtain FDA clearance or approval. We may also be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties.\nThe FDA may not approve our current or future PMA applications or supplements or clear our 510(k) applications for new products or modifications to, or additional indications for, our products on a timely basis or at all. Delays in obtaining required future clearances or approvals would adversely affect our ability to introduce new or enhanced products in a timely manner, which in turn would harm our future growth.\nThe FDA may also change its clearance and approval policies, adopt additional regulations, or revise existing regulations, or take other actions which may prevent or delay approval or clearance of our products under development or impact our ability to modify our currently approved or cleared products on a timely basis. Any of these actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nInternational regulatory approval processes may take more or less time than the FDA clearance or approval process. If we fail to comply with applicable FDA and comparable non-U.S. regulatory requirements, we may not receive regulatory clearances or approvals or may be subject to FDA or comparable non-U.S. enforcement actions. We may be unable to obtain future regulatory clearance or approval in a timely manner, or at all, especially if existing regulations are changed or new regulations are adopted. For example, the FDA clearance or approval process can take longer than anticipated due to requests for additional clinical data and changes in regulatory requirements. A failure or delay in obtaining necessary regulatory clearances or approvals would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may expend our limited resources to pursue particular products, product candidates, indications or discover programs and fail to capitalize on products, product candidates, indications or discovery programs that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\nBecause we have limited financial and managerial resources, we focus on specific products, product candidates, indications, and discovery programs. As a result, we may forgo or delay pursuit of other opportunities that could have had\ngreater commercial potential. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities. Our spending on current and future research and development programs for specific indications may not yield any commercially viable products. Moreover, if we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular product or product candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product or product candidate through future collaborations, licenses, and other similar arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights to such product or product candidate.\nOur products are approved only for specific countries and uses. The use, misuse or off-label use of our products may also result in injuries that lead to product liability suits, which could be costly to our business.\nOur products are approved for use in a limited number of countries and for only the indications and uses specified in the applicable approval. This prohibits our ability to market or advertise our products for any other indication, which could limit our growth. Additionally, our products are contra-indicated for use in the carotid or cerebrovascular arteries. Our promotional materials and training methods must comply with FDA and other applicable laws and regulations, including the prohibition on the promotion of a medical device for a use that has not been cleared or approved by the FDA.\nUse of a device outside of its cleared or approved indication is known as \u201coff-label\u201d use. We cannot prevent a physician from using our products for off-label use, as the FDA does not restrict or regulate a physician\u2019s choice of treatment within the practice of medicine. However, we are not allowed to actively promote or advertise our products for off-label uses. In addition, we cannot make comparative claims regarding the use of our products against any alternative treatments without conducting head-to-head comparative clinical studies, which are expensive and time-consuming. For more information regarding our regulatory risks, including those related to off-label use, see the section titled \u201c-Risks Related to Government Regulation and Our Industry\u201d below.\nWe currently require limited training in the use of our products incorporating our IVL technology (\u201cIVL Technology\u201d) because we market primarily to physicians who are experienced in the interventional techniques required to use our devices. If demand for our products continues to grow, less experienced physicians will likely use our products, potentially leading to more injury and an increased risk of product liability claims. The use, misuse or off-label use of our products may in the future result in complications, including damage to the treated artery, infection, internal bleeding, and limb loss, potentially leading to product liability claims.\nIf our clinical trials are unsuccessful or significantly delayed, or if we do not complete our clinical trials, our business may be harmed.\nClinical development is a long, expensive, and uncertain process and is subject to delays and the risk that products may ultimately prove unsafe or ineffective in treating the indications for which they are designed. Completion of clinical trials may take several years or more. We may experience numerous unforeseen events in relation to a clinical trial process that could delay or prevent us from receiving regulatory clearance or approval for new products, modifications of existing products or new indications for existing products, including:\n\u2022\nrisks relating to clinical trial approvals, including:\n\u25aa\ndelays or failure in obtaining approval of our clinical trial protocols from the FDA or other regulatory authorities, including in relation to the design, protocol or implementation of our clinical trials; and\n\u25aa\ndelay or refusal of regulators or institutional review boards (\u201cIRBs\u201d) to authorize us to commence a clinical trial at a prospective trial site.\n\u2022\nrisks relating to clinical trial enrollment and trial management, including:\n\u25aa\ndelays or failure to reach agreement on acceptable terms with prospective clinical research organizations (\u201cCROs\u201d) and clinical trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;\n\u25aa\nslower enrollment in our clinical trials than anticipated, high screen failure rates in our clinical trials, or delays in patient enrollment and variability in the number and types of patients available for clinical trials;\n\u25aa\nlower than anticipated retention rates of patients and volunteers in clinical trials or difficulty in maintaining contact with patients after treatment, resulting in incomplete data;\n\u25aa\ndelays relating to adding new clinical trial sites or issues managing multiple clinical sites;\n\u25aa\nour CROs or clinical trial sites may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner, or at all, or deviate from the protocol or drop out of a trial;\n\u25aa\nwe, the applicable IRBs, the Data Safety Monitoring Board for such trial, or the FDA or other applicable regulatory authorities may require that we or our investigators suspend or terminate our clinical trials for various reasons, including, among others (i) failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements, including the FDA\u2019s current GCP, regulations, or our clinical protocols, (ii) inspection of the clinical trial operations or trial site by the FDA or other applicable regulatory authority resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold, (iii) unforeseen safety issues or adverse side effects, (iv) failure to demonstrate safety and effectiveness, (v) changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions, (vi) lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial, (vii) exposure of participating patients to unacceptable health risks, (viii) noncompliance with regulatory requirements, or (ix) other safety concerns; and\n\u25aa\nwe may exceed our budgeted costs due to difficulty in accurately predicting costs associated with clinical trials.\n\u2022\nrisks related to clinical trial results, including:\n\u25aa\nour clinical trials may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical trials and/or preclinical testing which may be expensive and time-consuming, or we may elect to abandon projects that we expected to be promising;\n\u25aa\nreports from preclinical or clinical testing of other similar therapies that raise safety or efficacy concerns;\n\u25aa\ntrial results may not meet the level of statistical significance required by the FDA or other regulatory authorities;\n\u25aa\nthe FDA or similar foreign regulatory authorities may find the product is not sufficiently safe for investigational use in humans; and\n\u25aa\nthe FDA or similar foreign regulatory authorities may interpret data from preclinical testing and clinical trials differently than we do.\n\u2022\nrisks related to investigation devices used in the clinical trial, including:\n\u25aa\nthe quality of the investigation devices may fall below acceptable standards;\n\u25aa\nwe may be unable to manufacture sufficient quantities of our products to commence or complete clinical trials; and\n\u25aa\nthe FDA or similar foreign regulatory authorities may find our or our suppliers\u2019 manufacturing processes or facilities unsatisfactory.\nIn addition, we may encounter delays if the FDA concludes that our financial relationships with investigators result in a perceived or actual conflict of interest that may have affected the interpretation of a study, the integrity of the data generated at the applicable clinical trial site or the utility of the clinical trial itself. Principal investigators for our clinical trials may serve as scientific advisors or consultants to us from time to time and receive cash compensation and/or and stock awards in connection with such services. If these relationships and any related compensation to or ownership interest by the clinical investigator carrying out the study result in perceived or actual conflicts of interest, or if the FDA concludes that the financial relationship may have affected interpretation of the study, the integrity of the data generated at the applicable clinical trial site may be questioned and the utility of the clinical trial itself may be jeopardized, which could result in the delay or rejection by the FDA. Any such delay or rejection could prevent us from commercializing any of our products currently in development.\nWe do not know whether any of our future preclinical studies or clinical trials will commence as planned, will need to be restructured or will be completed on schedule, or at all. Any delays in completing our clinical trials will increase our costs, slow down our product development and approval process and jeopardize our ability to commence sales and generate associated revenue with respect to the applicable product. Any of these occurrences may significantly harm our business, financial condition, and prospects. In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial, suspension, or revocation of expanded regulatory clearance or approval of our products. Significant preclinical study or clinical trial delays also could shorten any periods during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize our products or allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do and impair our ability to successfully commercialize our products.\nFrom time to time, we engage outside parties to perform services related to certain of our clinical studies and trials. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our products.\nFrom time to time, we engage consultants to help design, monitor and analyze the results of certain of our clinical studies and trials. The consultants we engage interact with clinical investigators to enroll patients in our clinical trials. We depend on these consultants and clinical investigators to conduct clinical studies and trials and monitor and analyze data from these studies and trials under the investigational plan and protocol for the study or trial and in compliance with applicable regulations and standards, including GCP guidelines, the Common Rule, and FDA human subject protection regulations. We rely on medical institutions, clinical investigators, contract laboratories and other third parties, such as CROs, to conduct GCP-compliant clinical trials on our products properly and on time. While we have agreements governing their activities, we control only certain aspects of their activities and have limited influence over their actual performance. We may face delays in our regulatory approval process if these parties do not perform their obligations in a timely, compliant, or competent manner. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their duties or meet expected deadlines, or if the quality, completeness or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical trial protocols or for other reasons, our clinical studies or trials may be extended, delayed or terminated or may otherwise prove to be unsuccessful, and we may have to conduct additional studies, which would significantly increase our costs, in order to obtain the regulatory clearances or approvals that we need to commercialize our products.\nThe continuing development of our products depends upon our maintaining strong working relationships with physicians.\nThe research, development, marketing and sale of our current products and potential new and improved products or future product indications for which we receive regulatory clearance or approval depend upon us maintaining strong working relationships with physicians. We rely on these professionals to provide us with considerable knowledge and experience regarding the development, marketing and sale of our products. Physicians assist us in clinical trials and in marketing, and as researchers, product consultants and public speakers. If we cannot maintain our strong working relationships with these professionals and continue to receive their advice and input, the development and marketing of our products could suffer, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. At the same time, the medical device industry\u2019s relationship with physicians is under increasing scrutiny by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General (the \u201cOIG\u201d), the U.S. Department of Justice (the \u201cDOJ\u201d), state attorney generals and other foreign and domestic government agencies. Our failure to comply with requirements governing the industry\u2019s relationships with physicians or an investigation into our compliance by the OIG, the DOJ, state attorney generals and other government agencies, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. For more information on risks relating to the laws impacting our relationships with physicians and other healthcare professionals, see the section titled \u201c-Risks Related to Government Regulation and Our Industry\u201d below.\nWe have limited commercial manufacturing experience and may experience development or manufacturing problems or delays in producing our products and planned or future products that could limit our potential revenue growth or increase our losses.\nWe are continuing to develop our expertise in commercially manufacturing our products and our ability to manufacture these products in the volume that we anticipate will be required if we achieve planned levels of commercial sales. The forecasts of demand we use to determine order quantities and lead times for components purchased from outside suppliers may be incorrect. Our failure to obtain required components or sub-assemblies when needed and at a reasonable cost would adversely affect our business. As a result, we may not be able to develop and implement efficient, low-cost manufacturing capabilities and processes that will enable us to manufacture our existing, planned, or future products in significant volumes, while meeting the legal, regulatory, quality, price, durability, engineering, design, and production standards required to market our products successfully.\nWe may encounter unforeseen situations in the manufacturing and assembly of our products that would result in delays or shortfalls in our production. For example, we may be required to change our production processes and assembly methods in order to accommodate any significant future expansion of our manufacturing capacity, which may increase our manufacturing costs, delay production of our products, reduce our product margin and adversely impact our business. Conversely, if demand for our products shifts such that a manufacturing facility is operated below its capacity for an extended period, we may adjust our manufacturing operations to reduce fixed costs, which could lead to uncertainty and delays in manufacturing times and quality during any transition period.\nWe produce a significant majority of our IVL catheters at our facility in Santa Clara, California, therefore any contamination of the controlled environment, equipment malfunction or failure to strictly follow procedures could significantly reduce our yield. A drop in yield could increase our cost to manufacture our products or, in more severe cases,\nrequire us to halt the manufacture of our products until the problem is resolved. Identifying and resolving the cause of a drop in yield could require substantial time and resources.\nIf our manufacturing activities are adversely impacted or if we are otherwise unable to keep up with demand for our products by successfully manufacturing, assembling, testing, and shipping our products in a timely manner, our revenue could be impaired, market acceptance for our products could be adversely affected and our customers might instead purchase our competitors\u2019 products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe depend upon third-party suppliers, including single source component suppliers, making us vulnerable to supply problems and price fluctuations.\nWe rely on third-party suppliers to provide us with a portion of our demand for one of our products as well as components used in the manufacturing of our products. Certain components of our products are provided by single source suppliers. In some cases, we purchase supplies through purchase orders and do not have long-term supply agreements with, or guaranteed commitments from, our component suppliers, including single source suppliers. Many of our suppliers and contract manufacturers are not obligated to perform services or supply products for any specific period, in any specific quantity or at any specific price, except as may be provided in a particular purchase order.\nWe depend on our suppliers to provide us with materials or products in a timely manner that meet our quality, quantity, and cost requirements. These suppliers may encounter problems during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, including as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, any of which could delay or impede their ability to meet our demand. These suppliers may cease producing the products or components we purchase from them or otherwise decide to cease doing business with us. Further, we maintain limited volumes of inventory from most of our suppliers and contract manufacturers. If we inaccurately forecast demand for finished goods, we may be unable to meet customer demand which could harm our competitive position and reputation.\nIn addition, if we fail to effectively manage our relationships with our suppliers and contract manufacturers, we may be required to change suppliers or contract manufacturers. While we believe alternate suppliers exist for all materials, components and services necessary to manufacture our products, establishing additional or replacement suppliers for any of these materials, components or services, if required, could be time-consuming, expensive and may result in interruptions in our operations and product delivery. Even if we are able to find replacement suppliers, we will be required to verify that the new supplier maintains facilities, procedures and operations that comply with our quality expectations and applicable regulatory requirements. Any of these events could require that we obtain a new regulatory authority approval before we implement the change, which could result in further delay or which may not be obtained at all. If our third-party suppliers fail to deliver the required commercial quantities of materials on a timely basis and at commercially reasonable prices, and we are unable to find one or more replacement suppliers capable of production at a substantially equivalent cost, volumes and quality on a timely basis, the continued commercialization of our products, the supply of our products to customers and the development of any future products will be delayed, limited or prevented, which could have material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFor example, the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the operations of certain of our third-party suppliers, resulting in increased lead-times for our purchases of some components and, in certain cases, requiring us to procure materials from alternate suppliers or incur higher logistics expenses. We have worked closely with our manufacturing partners and suppliers to enable us to source key components and maintain appropriate inventory levels to meet customer demand and have not experienced disruptions in our supply chain to date. However, there is no assurance that we will not experience more significant disruptions in our supply chain in the future, particularly if the operations of our contract manufacturing partners or any of our critical single source component providers are more severely impacted by the pandemic and associated containment measures. Any supply interruption from our suppliers or failure to obtain additional suppliers for products or any of the components used in our products would limit our ability to manufacture our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe and our suppliers may not meet regulatory quality standards applicable to our manufacturing processes, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAs a medical device manufacturer, we must register with the FDA and various non-U.S. regulatory agencies, and we are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA and foreign regulatory agencies, for compliance with certain Good Manufacturing Practices (\u201ccGMP\u201d), including design controls, product validation and verification, in process testing, quality control and documentation procedures. Compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review\nand is rigorously monitored through periodic inspections by the FDA and foreign regulatory agencies. Our product and component suppliers are also required to meet certain standards applicable to their manufacturing processes.\nWe cannot assure you that we or our products or component suppliers comply or will continue to comply with all regulatory requirements. The failure by us or one of our suppliers to achieve or maintain compliance with these requirements or quality standards may disrupt our ability to supply products sufficient to meet demand until compliance is achieved or, until a new supplier has been identified and evaluated. Our or any product or component supplier\u2019s failure to comply with applicable regulations could cause sanctions to be imposed on us, including warning letters, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, failure of regulatory authorities to grant marketing approval of our products, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals or clearances, license revocation, seizures or recalls of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, which could harm our business. We cannot assure you that if we need to engage new suppliers to satisfy our business requirements, we can locate new suppliers in compliance with regulatory requirements at a reasonable cost and in an acceptable timeframe. Our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn the EU, we must maintain certain International Organization for Standardization certifications to sell our products and must undergo periodic inspections by notified bodies, including the British Standards Institution (\u201cBSI\u201d), to obtain and maintain these certifications. If we fail these inspections or fail to meet these regulatory standards, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe depend on a third party to manufacture a portion of the demand for certain of our products and we may engage additional third-party manufacturers in the future. If any of these manufacturers fail to meet our requirements and strict regulatory standards, we may be unable to develop, commercialize or market our products.\nWe depend on one third-party to manufacture a certain portion of the demand for one of our products and we may in the future need to depend upon additional third parties to manufacture our products. Reliance on third-party manufacturers entails additional risks, including:\n\u2022\nreliance on the third party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance;\n\u2022\nthe possible breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party because of factors beyond our control; and\n\u2022\nthe possibility of termination or nonrenewal of the agreement by the third party because of our breach of the manufacturing agreement or based on its own business priorities.\nAny of these factors could cause delay or suspension of clinical trials, regulatory submissions, required approvals, commercialization or marketing of our products or cause us to incur higher costs. Furthermore, if our contract manufacturers fail to deliver the required commercial quantities of finished products on a timely basis and at commercially reasonable prices and we are unable to find one or more replacement manufacturers capable of production at a substantially equivalent cost, in substantially equivalent volumes and quality, and on a timely basis, we would likely be unable to meet demand for our products and we would lose potential revenue. Any difficulties in locating and hiring third-party manufacturers, or in the ability of third-party manufacturers to supply quantities of our products on the timeline and in the quantities required, could have a material adverse effect on our business. It may take a significant amount of time and resources, including costs, to establish an alternative source of supply for our products and to have any such new source approved by the FDA.\nOur success depends in large part on our IVL Technology. If we are unable to successfully market and sell products incorporating our IVL Technology, our business prospects will be significantly harmed, and we may be unable to achieve revenue growth.\nOur future financial success will depend substantially on our ability to effectively and profitably market and sell our products incorporating our IVL Technology. The commercial success of our products and any of our planned or future products will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe actual and perceived effectiveness and reliability of our products, especially relative to alternative products;\n\u2022\nthe prevalence and severity of any adverse patient events involving our products;\n\u2022\nthe results of clinical trials relating to the use of our products;\n\u2022\nour ability to sustain meaningful clinical benefits for our patients;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain regulatory approval to market our planned or future products for use in treating PAD, CAD and aortic stenosis (\u201cAS\u201d) in the United States;\n\u2022\nthe availability, relative cost and perceived advantages and disadvantages of alternative technologies or treatment methods for conditions treated by our products;\n\u2022\nthe degree to which treatments using our products are covered and receive adequate reimbursement from third-party payors, including governmental and private insurers;\n\u2022\nthe degree to which physicians adopt our products;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain, maintain, protect and enforce our intellectual property rights in and to our IVL Technology and our products that incorporate our IVL Technology;\n\u2022\nour ability to treat medial calcium and sustain a meaningful clinical benefit better than our competitors and alternative treatments or therapies;\n\u2022\nour ability to achieve and maintain compliance with all regulatory requirements applicable to our products;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which we are successful in educating physicians about PAD, CAD and AS in general, and the benefits of our products in treating such conditions;\n\u2022\nthe strength of our marketing and distribution infrastructure;\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of our and our distributors\u2019 marketing and sales efforts outside the United States and our own efforts to build and manage our internal sales team;\n\u2022\nthe level of education and awareness among physicians and hospitals concerning our products;\n\u2022\nour reputation among physicians and hospitals;\n\u2022\nour ability to continue to develop, validate and maintain a commercially viable manufacturing process that is compliant with current cGMP and the Quality System Regulation (\u201cQSR\u201d); and\n\u2022\nwhether the FDA or comparable non-U.S. regulatory authorities require us to conduct additional clinical trials for future or current indications.\nIf we fail to successfully market and sell our products, we will not be able to achieve profitability, which will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our ability to grow our revenue in future periods will depend on our ability to successfully penetrate our target markets and increase sales of our products and any new product or product indications that we introduce, which will, in turn, depend in part on our success in growing our customer base and driving increased use of our products. New products or product indications will also need to be approved or cleared by the FDA and comparable non-U.S. regulatory agencies to drive revenue growth. If we cannot achieve revenue growth, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are at an early stage in our growth and we must build effective sales and marketing capabilities for our products.\nWe are at an early stage in our growth and have only recently launched our products for commercial use. For example, we launched our M5 catheters for the treatment of PAD in the United States, Europe and select other countries in 2018, and we launched our C2 catheters for the treatment of CAD in Europe in 2018, and in the United States in February 2021. We initiated a limited launch of our S4 catheter in the first half of 2019 and commenced a full commercial launch in select approved geographies in the second half of 2019. We initiated a limited launch of our M5+ catheters in the United States and Europe in late 2021. We had revenue of $237.1 million and $67.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nOur ability to increase our customer base, achieve broader market acceptance of our products, and increase our global sales depends to a significant extent on our ability to expand our marketing operations. We have dedicated, and will continue to dedicate, significant financial and other resources to our marketing and sales programs, including the expansion of our international field presence through new distributors, the addition of sales and clinical personnel globally, and the addition of new sales territories in the U.S. and select global markets. However, there are a variety of factors that could adversely impact our ability to effectively market and sell our products, including:\n\u2022\nbuilding the requisite sales, marketing or distribution capabilities is expensive and time-consuming and requires significant attention from management;\n\u2022\nthe competition for talented individuals experienced in selling and marketing medical device products is intense, and we cannot assure you that we can assemble or maintain an effective team; and\n\u2022\ntraining qualified sales personnel on the use of our products, on applicable federal and state laws and regulations and on our internal policies and procedures, requires significant time, expense, and attention and it can take significant time before our sales representatives are fully trained and productive.\nAny failure or delay in the development of our sales, marketing, or distribution capabilities, to hire, train and retain our sales force, or of our sales force to meet required productivity levels within a reasonable period of time, may result in us failing to realize the expected benefits of our investments or increase our revenue, which in turn would adversely impact the commercialization of our products and harm our business.\nThe commercial success of our products will depend upon attaining significant brand awareness and market acceptance of our products among physicians, healthcare payors and the medical community.\nOur success will depend, in part, on the acceptance of our products as safe, useful and, with respect to providers, cost effective. To accomplish this, we need to continue to educate the medical community about the safety, efficacy, necessity, and efficiency of our products. This will require educating them not only about the benefits of our technology, but also about the impact of calcified plaque on treatment choices and treatment outcomes. We believe that focusing on calcified plaque is a paradigm shift in the treatment of these diseases because other interventions have not specifically focused on this source of atherosclerosis. Additionally, we will need to convince the medical community that the additional cost and time of integrating the IVL procedure, designed to prepare the vessel for the subsequent stenting or angioplasty procedure, is worth the increased efficacy of the overall procedure and improvement in patient outcomes.\nThe failure of our clinical, marketing, and executive teams to drive this shift in thinking among physicians, patients, practitioners, third-party payors, and regulators could adversely affect our ability to grow our business. We cannot predict how quickly, if at all, physicians will accept our products or, if accepted, how frequently they will be used. Our products and planned or future products we may develop, may never gain broad market acceptance among physicians and the medical community for some or all of our targeted indications. The degree of market acceptance of any of our products will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nwhether physicians and others in the medical community consider our products to be safe and cost-effective treatment methods;\n\u2022\nthe potential and perceived advantages of our products over alternative treatment methods;\n\u2022\nthe prevalence and severity of any side effects associated with using our products;\n\u2022\nproduct labeling or product insert requirements by the FDA or other regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\nlimitations or warnings contained in the labeling cleared or approved by the FDA or other authorities;\n\u2022\nthe cost of treatment in relation to alternative treatments methods;\n\u2022\nthe convenience and ease of use of our products relative to alternative treatment methods;\n\u2022\npricing pressure, including from group purchasing organizations (\u201cGPOs\u201d), seeking to obtain discounts on our products based on the collective buying power of the GPO members;\n\u2022\na substantial shift in the number of PAD procedures that are performed in office-based labs (\u201cOBLs\u201d) compared to those performed in a hospital as OBLs tend to have higher price sensitivity than hospitals;\n\u2022\nthe availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement for procedures using our products from third-party payors, including government authorities;\n\u2022\nthe willingness of patients to pay out-of-pocket in the absence of coverage and adequate reimbursement by third-party payors, including government authorities;\n\u2022\nour ability to provide incremental clinical and economic data that show the safety, clinical efficacy and cost effectiveness of, and patient benefits from, our products; and\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts for our products.\nFor example, in July 2018, we initiated and subsequently completed a voluntary recall of our S4 catheters after seeing a higher instance of leaks in the balloon, which prevented the balloon from staying inflated at four atmospheres (\u201catm\u201d) for the full course of lithotripsy application. Although there were no patient safety issues reported and no reports of adverse clinical events related to this issue, and the issue has been corrected, customer satisfaction problems early in a product\u2019s launch can have lasting negative impact on our ability to sell such product. We proceeded with a full commercial launch of our S4 catheter in select approved geographies in the second half of 2019. However, we cannot guarantee that issues with our S4 catheters will not resurface. Any future government or voluntary recalls of our S4 catheter could divert managerial and financial resources, harm our reputation, and adversely affect our business.\nIf we do not educate physicians about PAD and the existence of our products, our products may not gain market acceptance since many physicians do not routinely screen for PAD while screening for CAD. Additionally, even if our products achieve market acceptance, they may not maintain that market acceptance over time if competing products or technologies, which are more cost effective or received more favorably, are introduced. Failure to achieve or maintain market acceptance and/or market share would limit our ability to generate revenue and would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn addition, we believe that developing and maintaining awareness of our brand in a cost-effective manner is critical to achieving broad acceptance of our products and attracting new customers. Brand promotion activities may not generate customer awareness or increase revenue and, even if they do, any increase in revenue may not offset the costs and expenses we incur in building our brand. If we fail to successfully promote, maintain and protect our brand, we may fail to attract or retain the customers necessary to realize a sufficient return on our brand-building efforts, or to achieve the widespread brand awareness that is critical for broad customer adoption of our products.\nWe manufacture and sell products that are used in a limited number of procedures and there is a limited total addressable market for our products. The sizes of the markets for our current and future products have not been established with precision and may be smaller than we estimate.\nOur estimates of the annual total addressable markets for our current products and products under development are based on a number of internal and third-party estimates, including, without limitation, the number of patients with calcified cardiovascular disease and the assumed prices at which we can sell our products for markets that have not been established. While we believe our assumptions and the data underlying our estimates are reasonable, these assumptions and estimates may not be correct and the conditions supporting our assumptions or estimates may change at any time, thereby reducing the predictive accuracy of these underlying factors. In addition, our estimates of the sizes of the PAD and CAD patient populations include patients who are asymptomatic or in the early stages of disease; these patients might never progress to more advanced disease stages and, accordingly, might never be likely candidates for treatment with our products. As a result, our estimates of the annual total addressable market for our current or future products may prove to be incorrect. If the actual number of patients who would benefit from our products, the price at which we can sell future products, or the annual total addressable market for our products is smaller than we have estimated, it may impair our sales growth and negatively affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to compete successfully with larger companies in our highly competitive industry.\nThere are numerous approved products for treating vascular diseases in the indications in which we have received clearance or approval and those that we are pursuing or may pursue in the future. Many of these cleared or approved products are well-established and are widely accepted by physicians, patients, and third-party payors who may encourage the use of competitors\u2019 products. In addition, many companies are developing products, and we cannot predict what the standard of care will be in the future.\nThe medical device industry is intensely competitive, subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new product introductions and other market activities of industry participants. We compete or plan to compete with manufacturers and distributors of cardiovascular medical devices. The cardiovascular field is highly competitive and certain of our products may compete with products manufactured by other companies, including Boston Scientific Corporation, Cardiovascular Systems, Inc. (\u201cCSI\u201d), Medtronic plc and Philips N.V. Many of these competitors are large, well-capitalized companies with significantly greater market share and resources than we have. As a consequence, they are able to spend more on product development, marketing, sales and other product initiatives than we can. We also compete with smaller medical device companies that have single products or a limited range of products. Some of our competitors have:\n\u2022\nmore established reputations and significantly greater name recognition within the medical community;\n\u2022\ngreater ability to respond to competitive pressures, regulatory uncertainty, or challenges within the financial markets;\n\u2022\nbroader or deeper relations with healthcare professionals, customers, regulatory agencies and third-party payors;\n\u2022\nlarger and more established distribution networks;\n\u2022\nadditional lines of products and the ability to offer rebates or bundle products to offer greater discounts or other incentives to gain a competitive advantage;\n\u2022\ngreater experience in conducting research and development, manufacturing, clinical trials, marketing and obtaining regulatory clearance or approval for products; and\n\u2022\ngreater financial and human resources for product development, sales and marketing, clinical resources and patent litigation.\nWe believe that our proprietary IVL Technology, our focus on calcified cardiovascular disease, and our organizational culture and strategy, will be important factors in our future success. We compete primarily on the basis that our products treat patients with calcified cardiovascular disease safely and effectively, with improved outcomes and procedural cost savings.\nIn addition, competitors with greater financial resources than ours could acquire other companies to gain enhanced name recognition and market share, as well as new technologies or products that could effectively compete with our existing products, which may cause our revenue to decline and would harm our business.\nOur competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, management and commercial personnel, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our products. Because of the complex and technical nature of our products and the dynamic market in which we compete, any failure to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees could materially harm our ability to develop and commercialize our products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn the future our products may become obsolete, which would negatively affect operations and financial condition.\nThe medical device industry is characterized by extensive research and rapid and significant technological change. There can be no assurance that other companies will not succeed in developing or marketing devices and products that are more effective than our IVL System or that would render our IVL System obsolete or noncompetitive. Additionally, new surgical procedures, medications and other therapies could be developed that replace or reduce the importance of our products. Accordingly, our success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate technological advancements and competitive innovations and introduce new products to adapt to these advancements and innovations.\nThere can be no assurance that (i) our new product development efforts will result in any commercially successful products, (ii) we will be able to respond more quickly than our competitors, many of whom have greater financial, marketing, product development, and other resources, to new or emerging technologies or a changing clinical landscape, or (iii) we will be more successful in attracting potential customers and strategic partners than our competitors. Given these factors, we cannot assure you that we will be able to sustain or increase our level of success. Our failure to introduce new and innovative products in a timely manner, and our inability to maintain or grow the market acceptance of our existing products, could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nConsolidation in the medical device industry could have an adverse effect on our revenue and results of operations.\nMany medical device companies are consolidating to create new companies with greater market power. As the medical device industry consolidates, competition to provide products and services to industry participants will become more intense. These industry participants may try to use their market power to negotiate price concessions or reductions for our products. We expect that market demand, government regulation, third-party coverage and reimbursement policies and societal pressures will continue to change the worldwide healthcare industry, resulting in further business consolidations and alliances among our customers, which may reduce competition, exert further downward pressure on the prices of our products and may adversely impact our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nAdequate reimbursement may not be available for the procedures that utilize our products, which could diminish our sales or affect our ability to sell our products profitably.\nIn both U.S. and non-U.S. markets, our ability to successfully commercialize and achieve market acceptance of our products depends, in significant part, on the availability of adequate financial coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors, including governmental payors (such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs in the United States), managed care organizations and private health insurers. Third-party payors decide which treatments they will cover and establish reimbursement rates for those treatments. Third-party payors in the United States generally do not provide direct reimbursement for our products. Rather, we expect certain components of our IVL System to continue to be purchased by hospitals and other providers who will then seek reimbursement from third-party payors for the procedures performed using our products. While third-party payors generally cover and provide reimbursement for procedures using our currently cleared or approved products, we can give no assurance that these third-party payors will continue to provide coverage and adequate reimbursement for the procedures using our products, to permit hospitals and physicians to offer procedures using our products to patients requiring treatment, or that current reimbursement levels for procedures using our products will continue. Third-party payors are increasingly examining the cost effectiveness of products, in addition to their safety and efficacy, when making coverage and payment decisions. Furthermore, although we believe there is potential to improve on the current reimbursement profile for our devices in the future, the overall amount of reimbursement available for PAD and CAD procedures could remain at current levels or decrease in the future. Additionally, we cannot be sure that the PAD and CAD procedure reimbursement amounts will not reduce or otherwise negatively affect the demand for our marketed products. Failure by hospitals and other users of our products to obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement for the procedures using our products would cause our business to suffer.\nThird-party payors have also instituted initiatives to limit the growth of healthcare costs using, for example, price regulation or controls and competitive pricing programs. Some third-party payors also require demonstrated superiority, on the basis of randomized clinical trials, or pre-approval of coverage, for new or innovative devices or procedures before they will reimburse healthcare providers who use such devices or procedures. Additionally, no uniform policy for coverage and reimbursement exists in the United States, and coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates, but also have their own methods and approval process apart from Medicare determinations. It is uncertain whether our current products or any planned or future products will be viewed as sufficiently cost effective to warrant coverage and adequate reimbursement levels for procedures using such marketed products.\nWe have established safety and effectiveness data in specific patient populations in the treatment of PAD and CAD. Results of earlier studies may not be predictive of future clinical trial results, and planned studies may not establish an adequate safety or efficacy profile for such products and other planned or future products, which would affect market acceptance of these products.\nBecause our IVL Technology is relatively new in the treatment of CAD and PAD, we have performed clinical trials only with limited patient populations. The long-term, one-year results of coronary IVL has been studied within stable coronary disease. Short-term and long-term results in this patient population are not predictive for other coronary indications including acute coronary syndromes. Short-term results of peripheral IVL in the treatment of PAD have been studied across a variety of peripheral vessel beds and severity of PAD. The long-term effects of peripheral IVL in a large number of patients have not been released yet and the results of short-term clinical outcomes do not necessarily predict long-term clinical benefits or reveal long-term adverse effects.\nThe results of preclinical studies and clinical trials of our products conducted to date may not be predictive of the results of later clinical trials, and interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results. Our interpretation of data and results from our clinical trials do not ensure that we will achieve similar results in future clinical trials in other patient populations. In addition, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to various interpretations and analyses, and many companies that have believed their products performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and earlier, feasibility clinical trials have nonetheless failed to replicate results in later, pivotal clinical trials and subsequently failed to obtain marketing approval. Products in later, pivotal stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and effectiveness despite having progressed through nonclinical studies and earlier, feasibility clinical trials.\nIf product liability lawsuits are brought against us, we may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit or halt the marketing and sale of our products. The expense and potential unavailability of insurance coverage for liabilities resulting from our products could harm us and our ability to sell our products.\nThe medical device industry has historically been subject to extensive litigation over product liability claims. We face an inherent risk of product liability as a result of the marketing and sale of our products. For example, we may be sued if our products cause or are perceived to cause injury or are found to be otherwise unsuitable during manufacturing, marketing, or sale. Any such product liability claim may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product, negligence, strict liability, or a breach of warranties. In addition, we may be subject to claims against us even if the apparent injury is due to the actions of others or the pre-existing health of the patient. For example, we rely on physicians in connection with the use of our products on patients. If these physicians are not properly trained or are negligent, the capabilities of our products may be diminished, or the patient may suffer critical injury. We may also be subject to claims that are caused by the activities of our suppliers, such as those who provide us with components and sub-assemblies.\nIf we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit or halt commercialization of our products. Even successful defense would require significant financial and management resources. Regardless of the merits or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u2022\ndecreased demand for our products;\n\u2022\ninjury to our reputation;\n\u2022\ninitiation of investigations by regulators;\n\u2022\ncosts to defend the related litigation;\n\u2022\na diversion of management\u2019s time and our resources;\n\u2022\nsubstantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients;\n\u2022\nproduct recalls, withdrawals or labeling, marketing or promotional restrictions;\n\u2022\nloss of revenue;\n\u2022\nexhaustion of any available insurance and our capital resources; and\n\u2022\nthe inability to market and sell our products.\nWe believe we have adequate product liability insurance, but it may not prove to be adequate to cover all liabilities that we may incur. Insurance coverage is increasingly expensive. We may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance at a reasonable cost or in an amount adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise. Our insurance policy contains various exclusions, and we may be subject to a product liability claim for which we have no coverage. The potential inability to obtain sufficient product liability insurance at an acceptable cost to protect against product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the marketing and sale of products we develop. We may have to pay any amounts awarded by a court or negotiated in a settlement that exceed our coverage limitations or that are not covered by our insurance, and we may not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient capital to pay such amounts, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, any product liability claims brought against us, with or without merit, could increase our product liability insurance rates or prevent us from securing continuing coverage, harm our reputation in the industry, significantly increase our expenses and reduce product sales. Defending a product liability suit, regardless of its merit or eventual outcome, could be costly, could divert management\u2019s attention from our business and might result in adverse publicity, which could result in reduced acceptance of our products in the market, product recalls or market withdrawals. In addition, the occurrence of an adverse event relating to our products, a product recall or a product liability claim against us may cause our stock price to decline, which could result in securities class action litigation claims against us.\nSome of our customers and prospective customers may also have difficulty in procuring or maintaining liability insurance to cover their operations and use of our products. Medical malpractice carriers are withdrawing coverage in certain states or substantially increasing premiums. If this trend continues or worsens, our customers may discontinue using our products and potential customers may opt against purchasing our products due to the cost or inability to procure insurance coverage.\nWe intend to continue to expand sales of our products internationally, but we may experience difficulties in obtaining regulatory clearance or approval or in successfully marketing our products internationally even if approved. A variety of risks associated with marketing our products internationally could materially adversely affect our business.\nWhile the majority of our revenue has been in the United States, our current products are cleared in the EU and certain other international markets for the treatment of PAD and CAD, and international sales comprised 21% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021. Our future growth may depend, in part, on our ability to develop and commercialize our planned and future products in foreign markets. Sales of our products outside of the United States are and will be subject to foreign regulatory requirements governing clinical trials and marketing approval. To obtain separate regulatory approval in many other countries we must comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, commercial sales, pricing and distribution of our planned or future products. We will incur substantial expenses in connection with our international expansion. Additional risks related to operating in foreign countries include:\n\u2022\nreliance on distributors;\n\u2022\ndiffering regulatory requirements for approval of medical devices in foreign countries;\n\u2022\ndiffering reimbursement, pricing and insurance regimes in foreign countries;\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers, price and exchange controls and other regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\neconomic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets;\n\u2022\ncompliance with tax, employment, immigration, and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad;\n\u2022\nforeign taxes, including withholding of payroll taxes;\n\u2022\nforeign currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses, reduced revenue and other obligations incident to doing business in another country;\n\u2022\ndifficulties staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u2022\nworkforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the United States;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in penetrating markets in which our competitors\u2019 products or alternative procedures that do not use our products are more established;\n\u2022\npotential liability under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (the \u201cFCPA\u201d), the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, or comparable foreign regulations;\n\u2022\nthe impact of the UK\u2019s departure from the EU;\n\u2022\nthe existence of additional third-party patent rights of potential relevance to our business;\n\u2022\nchallenges enforcing our contractual and intellectual property rights, especially in those foreign countries that do not respect and protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the United States;\n\u2022\nproduct shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material or finished good supply or distribution or manufacturing capabilities abroad;\n\u2022\nevents resulting in negative impacts to, or uncertainty regarding, global trade, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and the reversal or renegotiation of international trade agreements and partnerships; and\n\u2022\nbusiness interruptions resulting from geopolitical actions, including war and terrorism, or natural disasters, including earthquakes, typhoons, floods and fires.\nThese and other risks associated with our international operations may materially adversely affect our ability to attain or maintain profitable operations, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, there can be no guarantee that we will receive approval to sell our products in every international market we target, nor can there be any guarantee that any sales would result even if such approval is received. Even if the FDA grants marketing approval for a product, comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries must also approve the manufacturing or marketing of the product in those countries. Approval in the United States, or in any other jurisdiction, does not ensure approval in other jurisdictions. Obtaining foreign approvals could result in significant delays, difficulties, and\ncosts for us and require additional trials and additional expenses. Regulatory requirements can vary widely from country to country and could delay the introduction of our products in those countries. Clinical trials conducted in one country may not be accepted by other countries, and regulatory approval in one country does not mean that regulatory approval will be obtained in any other country. If we fail to comply with these regulatory requirements or to obtain and maintain required approvals, our target market will be reduced and our ability to generate revenue will be diminished. Our inability to successfully enter all our desired international markets and manage business on a global scale could negatively affect our business, financial results, and results of operations.\nWe face additional credit and compliance risks related to our international sales using foreign distributors.\nWe partner with distributors for our products in select geographies outside of the United States. Specifically, as of December 31, 2021, we have contracted with distributors who are actively selling our products in over 50 countries in North and South America, Europe, the UK, the Middle East, Asia, Africa, and Australia/New Zealand. For the year ended December 31, 2021, approximately 21% of our sales were outside of the United States. We may not be able to collect all of the funds owed to us by our foreign distributors. Some foreign distributors may experience financial difficulties, including bankruptcy, which may hinder our collection of accounts receivable. Where we extend credit terms to distributors, we periodically review the collectability and creditworthiness when determining the payment terms for such distributors. If our uncollectible accounts exceed our expectations, this could adversely impact our results of operations. In addition, failure by our foreign distributors to comply with the FCPA or other applicable laws, rules and regulations, insurance requirements or other contract terms could have a negative impact on our business. Failure to manage the risks related to our foreign distributors would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nGovernmental export or import controls could limit our ability to compete in foreign markets and subject us to liability if we violate them.\nOur products may be subject to U.S. export controls. Governmental regulation of the import or export of our products, or our failure to obtain any required import or export authorization for our products, when applicable, could harm our international sales and adversely affect our revenue. Compliance with applicable regulatory requirements regarding the export of our products may create delays in the introduction of our products in international markets or, in some cases, prevent the export of our products to some countries altogether. Furthermore, U.S. export control laws and economic sanctions prohibit the shipment of certain products and services to countries, governments and persons targeted by U.S. sanctions. If we fail to comply with export and import regulations and such economic sanctions, we may be fined or other penalties could be imposed, including a denial of certain export privileges. Moreover, any new export or import restrictions, new legislation or shifting approaches in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations, or in the countries, persons or technologies targeted by such regulations, could result in decreased use of our products by, or in our decreased ability to export our products to existing or potential customers with international operations. Any decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability to export or sell access to our products would likely materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to numerous laws and regulations related to anti-bribery and anti-corruption, such as the FCPA and the U.K. Bribery Act and violations of these laws could result in substantial penalties and prosecution.\nFor our sales and operations outside the United States, we are subject to various heavily enforced anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, such as the FCPA, U.K. Bribery Act 2010, and similar laws around the world. These laws generally prohibit offering, promising, authorizing or making improper payments, directly or indirectly, for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or gaining any advantage. We face significant risks if we or our third-party business partners and intermediaries fail to comply with the FCPA or other anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws.\nWe leverage various third parties to conduct our business and sell our products abroad, including to government-owned universities and hospitals. We, our distributors, and our other third-party intermediaries may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities (such as in the context of obtaining government approvals, registrations or licenses or sales to government owned or controlled healthcare facilities, universities, institutes, clinics, etc.) and we may be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these third-party business partners and intermediaries, our employees, representatives, contractors, partners and agents, even if we do not explicitly authorize such activities. In many foreign countries, particularly in countries with developing economies, it may be a local custom that businesses engage in practices that are prohibited by the FCPA or other applicable laws and regulations. To that end, while we have adopted and implemented internal control policies and procedures and employee training and compliance programs to deter prohibited practices, such compliance measures ultimately may not be effective in prohibiting\nour employees, representatives, contractors, business partners, intermediaries, or agents from violating or circumventing our policies and/or the law.\nResponding to any enforcement action or related investigation may result in a materially significant diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources and significant defense costs and other professional fees. Any violation of the FCPA or other applicable anti-bribery, anti-corruption or anti-money laundering laws could result in whistleblower complaints, adverse media coverage, investigations, loss of export privileges, severe criminal or civil sanctions and, in the case of the FCPA, suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracts, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRISKS RELATED TO GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND OUR INDUSTRY\nIf we fail to comply with U.S. federal and state and international fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, including those relating to kickbacks and false claims for reimbursement, we could face substantial penalties and our business operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nHealthcare providers and third-party payors play a primary role in the distribution, recommendation, ordering and purchasing of any medical device for which we have obtained or may in the future obtain marketing clearance or approval. Through our arrangements with principal investigators, healthcare professionals, third-party payors, and customers, we are exposed to broadly applicable anti-fraud and abuse, anti-kickback, false claims and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain our business, our arrangements and relationships with customers, and how we market, sell and distribute our marketed medical devices. We have a compliance program, code of conduct and associated policies and procedures, but it is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct by our employees and other third parties, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent noncompliance may not be effective in protecting us from governmental investigations for failure to comply with applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations.\nIn the United States, we are subject to various state and federal anti-fraud and abuse laws, including, without limitation, the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute (the \u201cAnti-Kickback Statute\u201d) and the federal civil False Claims Act (the \u201cFalse Claims Act\u201d). Our relationships and our distributors\u2019 relationships with physicians, other health care professionals and hospitals are subject to scrutiny under various state and federal anti-kickback laws. There are similar laws in other countries.\nHealthcare fraud and abuse laws and related regulations are complex, and even minor irregularities can potentially give rise to claims that a statute or prohibition has been violated. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include the Anti-Kickback Statute, the False Claims Act, federal Civil Monetary Penalties Statute, the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (\u201cHIPAA\u201d), and the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, along with analogous state and foreign law equivalents, each as more fully described in in the sections titled \u201cBusiness-Government Regulation-United States\u201d and \u201cBusiness-Government Regulation-International.\u201d\nState and federal regulatory and enforcement agencies continue to actively investigate violations of healthcare laws and regulations, and the U.S. Congress continues to strengthen the arsenal of enforcement tools. Enforcement agencies also continue to pursue novel theories of liability under these laws. In particular, government agencies recently have increased regulatory scrutiny and enforcement activity with respect to manufacturer reimbursement support activities and patient support programs, including bringing criminal charges or civil enforcement actions under the Anti-Kickback Statute, False Claims Act and HIPAA\u2019s healthcare fraud and privacy provisions.\nBecause of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors, it is possible that some of our business activities, including certain sales and marketing practices of our marketed IVL System, and financial arrangements with physicians, other healthcare providers, and other customers, could be subject to challenge under one or more such laws. For example, in the United States and certain foreign countries, we may loan for free to customers both the reusable IVL generator and connector cable so long as the customer is purchasing our single-use catheters. Customers also have the option to purchase the IVL generator and connector cable either at the initiation of the relationship or following the consignment period. Additionally, we may consign catheters to our customers, free of charge, until a catheter is used at which time the customer is billed for the catheter. The Anti-Kickback Statute includes, among others, space and equipment rental safe harbors. These safe harbors require, among other things, that the aggregate payment between the parties is set in advance and consistent with fair market value. As the IVL generator and connector cable are provided for free, and no payment is made for storage of our catheters at customers\u2019 facilities, these arrangements may not satisfy these or other safe harbors or statutory exceptions. Therefore, if these arrangements were investigated, they would be subject to a facts and circumstances analysis to determine whether they include prohibited remuneration under the Anti-Kickback Statute. If an arrangement were deemed to violate the Anti-Kickback Statute, it may also subject us to violations\nunder other fraud and abuse laws such as the False Claims Act and civil monetary penalties laws. Moreover, such arrangements could be found to violate comparable state fraud and abuse laws.\nAchieving and sustaining compliance with applicable federal and state anti-fraud and abuse laws may prove costly. If we or our employees are found to have violated any of the above laws we may be subjected to substantial criminal, civil and administrative penalties, including imprisonment, exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and significant fines, monetary penalties, forfeiture, disgorgement and damages, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. Any action or investigation against us for the violation of these healthcare fraud and abuse laws, even if successfully defended, could result in significant legal expenses, and could divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business. Companies settling False Claims Act, Anti-Kickback Statute or civil monetary penalties law cases also may be required to enter into a corporate integrity agreement with the OIG in order to avoid exclusion from participation (i.e., loss of coverage for their products) in federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Corporate integrity agreements typically impose substantial costs on companies to ensure compliance. Defending against any such actions can be costly, time-consuming and may require significant personnel resources, and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRegulatory compliance is expensive, complex, and uncertain, and a failure to comply could lead to enforcement actions against us and other negative consequences for our business.\nThe FDA and similar foreign agencies regulate our products as medical devices. Complying with these regulations is costly, time-consuming, complex, and uncertain. For example, before a new medical device, or a new intended use for an existing device can be marketed in the United States, a company must first submit and receive either 510(k) clearance, De Novo authorization or approval of a PMA from the FDA, unless an exemption applies. FDA regulations and regulations of similar agencies specific to medical devices are wide-ranging and include, among other things, oversight of:\n\u2022\nproduct design, development, manufacturing (including suppliers) and testing;\n\u2022\nlaboratory, preclinical and clinical studies;\n\u2022\nproduct safety and effectiveness;\n\u2022\nproduct labeling;\n\u2022\nproduct storage and shipping;\n\u2022\nrecord keeping;\n\u2022\npre-market clearance or approval;\n\u2022\nmarketing, advertising and promotion;\n\u2022\nproduct sales and distribution;\n\u2022\nproduct changes;\n\u2022\nproduct recalls; and\n\u2022\npost-market surveillance and reporting of deaths or serious injuries and certain malfunctions.\nOur current products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and non-U.S. regulatory agencies. Further, all of our potential products and improvements of our current products will be subject to extensive regulation and will likely require permission from regulatory agencies and ethics boards to conduct clinical trials and clearance or approval from the FDA and non-U.S. regulatory agencies prior to commercial sale and distribution. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements regarding, for example, promoting, manufacturing, or labeling our products, may subject us to a variety of administrative or judicial actions and sanctions, such as Form 483 observations, warning letters, untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution. The FDA can also refuse to clear or approve pending applications.\nAny enforcement action by the FDA and other comparable non-U.S. regulatory agencies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in enforcement action by the FDA or state agencies, which may include any of the following actions:\n\u2022\nuntitled letters, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;\n\u2022\nunanticipated expenditures to address or defend such actions;\n\u2022\ncustomer notifications for repair, replacement, or refunds;\n\u2022\nrecall, detention, or seizure of our products;\n\u2022\noperating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;\n\u2022\nrefusing or delaying our requests for 510(k) clearance or PMA approval of new products or modified products;\n\u2022\noperating restrictions;\n\u2022\nwithdrawing 510(k) clearances or PMA approvals that have already been granted;\n\u2022\nrefusal to grant export approval for our products; or\n\u2022\ncriminal prosecution.\nIf any of these events were to occur, it would have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to obtain the necessary clearances or approvals or may be unduly delayed in doing so, which could harm our business. Furthermore, even if we are granted regulatory clearances or approvals, they may include significant limitations on the indicated uses for the product, which may limit the market for the product. Although we have obtained 510(k) clearance to market our M5, M5+, and S4 catheters and PMA approval for our C2 catheters, our clearances or approvals can be revoked if safety or efficacy problems develop.\nThe FDA also regulates the advertising and promotion of our products to ensure that the claims we make are consistent with our regulatory clearances and approvals, that there are adequate and reasonable data to substantiate the claims, and that our promotional labeling and advertising is neither false nor misleading in any respect. If the FDA determines that any of our advertising or promotional claims are misleading, not substantiated or not permissible, we may be subject to enforcement actions, including warning letters, and we may be required to revise our promotional claims and make other corrections or restitutions.\nOur medical device operations are subject to pervasive and continuing FDA regulatory requirements.\nMedical devices regulated by the FDA are subject to \u201cgeneral controls\u201d which include: registration with the FDA; listing commercially distributed products with the FDA; complying with cGMPs under QSR; filing reports with the FDA of and keeping records relative to certain types of adverse events associated with devices under the medical device reporting regulation; assuring that device labeling complies with device labeling requirements; reporting recalls and certain device field removals and corrections to the FDA; and obtaining pre-market notification 510(k) clearance for devices prior to marketing. Some devices known as \u201c510(k)-exempt\u201d devices can be marketed without prior marketing-clearance or approval from the FDA. In addition to the \u201cgeneral controls,\u201d some Class II medical devices are also subject to \u201cspecial controls,\u201d including adherence to a particular guidance document and compliance with the performance standard. Instead of obtaining 510(k) clearance, most Class III devices are subject to PMA. Our C2 catheter for the treatment of CAD is designated as a Class III product and will follow the PMA process. As a company, we do not have prior experience in obtaining PMA approval.\nThe medical device industry is now experiencing greater scrutiny and regulation by federal, state and foreign governmental authorities. Companies in our industry are subject to more frequent and more intensive reviews and investigations, often involving marketing, business practices and product quality management. Such reviews and investigations may result in civil and criminal proceedings; the imposition of substantial fines and penalties; the receipt of warning letters, untitled letters, demands for recalls or the seizure of products; the requirement to enter into corporate integrity agreements, stipulated judgments or other administrative remedies; and could result in substantial unanticipated costs and the diversion of key personnel and management\u2019s attention from their regular duties, any of which may have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and may result in greater and continuing governmental scrutiny of our business in the future.\nFailure to comply with these legal and regulatory requirements could impact our business, and we have had and will continue to spend substantial time and financial resources to develop and implement enhanced structures, policies, systems, and processes to comply with these legal and regulatory requirements.\nAlthough we have obtained regulatory clearance for our M5, M5+, and S4 catheters for the treatment of PAD and our C2 catheter for the treatment of CAD in the United States and in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions, they will remain subject to extensive regulatory scrutiny.\nAlthough our M5, M5+ and S4 catheters have obtained regulatory clearance in the United States and in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions for the treatment of PAD, and our C2 catheters have obtained regulatory clearance in the United States and certain non-U.S. jurisdictions for the treatment of CAD, they will be subject to ongoing regulatory requirements for manufacturing, labeling, packaging, storage, advertising, promotion, sampling, record-keeping, conduct of post-marketing studies and submission of safety, effectiveness and other post-market information, including both federal and state requirements in the United States and requirements of comparable non-U.S. regulatory authorities.\nOur manufacturing facility is required to comply with extensive requirements imposed by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities, including ensuring that quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to the QSR or similar regulations set by foreign regulatory authorities. As such, we will be subject to continual review and inspections to assess compliance with the QSR and adherence to commitments made in any 510(k) or PMA application. Accordingly, we continue to expend time, money, and effort in all areas of regulatory compliance, including manufacturing, production and quality control.\nAny regulatory clearances or approvals that we have received for our products will be subject to limitations on the cleared or approved indicated uses for which the product may be marketed and promoted, will be subject to the conditions of approval, or will contain requirements for potentially costly post-marketing testing. We are required to report certain adverse events and production problems, if any, to the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Any new legislation addressing product safety issues could result in increased costs to assure compliance. The FDA and other agencies, including the DOJ, closely regulate and monitor the post-clearance or approval marketing and promotion of products to ensure that they are marketed and distributed only for the cleared or approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the cleared or approved labeling. We have to comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotion for our products.\nPromotional communications with respect to devices are subject to a variety of legal and regulatory restrictions and must be consistent with the information in cleared or approved labeling for each product. As such, we may not promote our products for indications or uses for which they do not have clearance or approval. For certain changes, to a cleared or approved product, including certain changes to product labeling, the holder of a cleared 510(k) or approved PMA application may be required to submit a new application and obtain clearance or approval.\nIf a regulatory agency discovers previously unknown problems with our products, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with our facility where the product is manufactured or disagrees with the promotion, marketing or labeling of our products, such regulatory agency or enforcement authority may impose restrictions on that product or us, including requiring withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, a regulatory agency or enforcement authority may, among other things:\n\u2022\nsubject our facility to an adverse inspectional finding or Form 483, or other compliance or enforcement notice, communication or correspondence;\n\u2022\nissue warning or untitled letters that would result in adverse publicity or may require corrective advertising;\n\u2022\nimpose civil or criminal penalties;\n\u2022\nsuspend or withdraw regulatory clearances or approvals;\n\u2022\nrefuse to clear or approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications submitted by us;\n\u2022\nimpose restrictions on our operations, including closing our sub-assembly suppliers\u2019 facilities;\n\u2022\nseize or detain products; or\n\u2022\nrequire a product recall.\nIn addition, violations of the U.S. federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (\u201cFD&C Act\u201d), relating to the promotion of approved products may lead to investigations alleging violations of federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse and other laws, as well as state consumer protection laws.\nAny government investigation of alleged violations of law could require us to expend significant time and resources in response and could generate negative publicity. Any failure to comply with ongoing regulatory requirements may significantly and adversely affect our ability to commercialize and generate revenue from our products. If regulatory sanctions are applied or if regulatory clearance or approval is withdrawn, it would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may be liable if the FDA or another regulatory agency concludes that we have engaged in the off-label promotion of our products.\nOur promotional materials and training methods must comply with FDA and other applicable laws and regulations, including the prohibition of the promotion of the off-label use of our products. Healthcare providers may use our products, if approved, off-label, as the FDA does not restrict or regulate a physician\u2019s choice of treatment within the practice of medicine. However, if the FDA determines that our promotional, reimbursement, or training materials for sales representatives or physicians constitute promotion of an off-label use, the FDA could request that we modify our training, promotional or reimbursement materials and/or subject us to regulatory or enforcement actions, including the issuance of an untitled letter, a warning letter, injunction, seizure, disgorgement of profits, and significant penalties, including civil fines and criminal penalties. Other federal, state or foreign governmental authorities also might take action if they consider our promotion, reimbursement or training materials to constitute promotion of an off-label use, which could result in significant fines or penalties under other statutory authorities, such as laws prohibiting false claims for reimbursement. Although we train our sales force not to promote our products for off-label uses, and our instructions for use in all markets specify that our products are not intended for use outside of those indications cleared or approved for use, the FDA or another regulatory agency could conclude that we have engaged in off-label promotion. For example, the government may take the position that off-label promotion resulted in inappropriate reimbursement for an off-label use in violation of the False Claims Act for which it might impose significant civil fines and even pursue criminal action. If this were to occur, our reputation could be damaged, and adoption of the products by our customers would be impaired.\nOur products may be subject to recalls after receiving FDA or foreign approval or clearance or cause or contribute to a death or a serious injury or malfunction in certain ways prompting voluntary corrective actions or agency enforcement actions, which could divert managerial and financial resources, harm our reputation, and adversely affect our business.\nThe FDA and similar foreign governmental authorities have the authority to require the recall of our products because of any failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, or defects in design or manufacture, or if there is a reasonable likelihood our products might cause or contribute to a death or a serious injury or malfunction. A government mandated or voluntary product recall by us could occur because of, for example, component failures, device malfunctions or other adverse events, such as serious injuries or deaths, or quality-related issues, such as manufacturing errors or design or labeling defects. In July 2018, for example, we initiated and subsequently completed a voluntary recall of our S4 catheters after seeing a higher instance of leaks in the balloon, which prevented the balloon from staying inflated at four atm for the full course of lithotripsy application. While there were no patient safety issues reported and no reports of adverse clinical events related to this issue and the issue has been corrected, we believe it was prudent to suspend utilization of the device and recall the product while we determined the cause of the leak. Any future recalls of our products could divert managerial and financial resources, harm our reputation, and adversely affect our business.\nIf we initiate a future correction or removal for one of our devices to reduce a risk to health posed by the device, we would be required to submit a publicly available Correction and Removal report to the FDA and, in many cases, similar reports to other regulatory agencies. This report could be classified by the FDA as a device recall which could lead to increased scrutiny by the FDA, other international regulatory agencies and our customers regarding the quality and safety of our devices. Furthermore, the submission of these reports has been and could be used by competitors against us in competitive situations and cause customers to delay purchase decisions or cancel orders and would harm our reputation.\nIn addition, we are subject to medical device reporting regulations that require us to report to the FDA or similar foreign governmental authorities if one of our products may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or if we become aware that it has malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction recurred. We are also subject to the correction and removal reporting regulations, which require us to report to the FDA any field corrections and device recalls or removals that we undertake to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FD&C Act caused by the device which may present a risk to health. Failures to properly identify reportable events or to file timely reports, as well as failure to address each of the FDA\u2019s observations to the FDA\u2019s satisfaction, could subject us to sanctions and penalties, including warning letters and recalls. Physicians, hospitals, and other healthcare providers may make similar reports to regulatory authorities. Any such reports may trigger an investigation by the FDA or similar foreign regulatory bodies, which could divert managerial and financial resources, harm our reputation, and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any adverse event involving our products also could result in future voluntary corrective actions, such as recalls or customer notifications, or agency action, such as an inspection or enforcement action. Any corrective action, whether voluntary or involuntary, as well as defending ourselves in a lawsuit as a result of a corrective action, would require our time and capital, distract management from operating our business and may harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf we or our suppliers fail to comply with the FDA\u2019s QSR or any applicable state or country equivalent, our operations could be interrupted, and our potential product sales and results of operations could suffer.\nOur manufacturing processes and those of our third-party suppliers must comply with the FDA\u2019s QSR, which covers the design controls, document controls, purchasing controls, identification and traceability, production and process controls, acceptance activities, nonconforming product requirements, corrective and preventive action requirements, labeling and packaging controls, handling, storage, distribution and installation requirements, complaint handling, records requirements, servicing requirements and statistical techniques potentially applicable to the production of our medical devices. We and our suppliers are also subject to the regulations of foreign jurisdictions regarding the manufacturing process where we market products in non-U.S. jurisdictions. In addition, we must engage in extensive recordkeeping and reporting and must make available our manufacturing facilities and records for periodic announced and unannounced inspections by governmental agencies, including the FDA, state authorities and comparable agencies in other countries. If we experience an unsuccessful QSR inspection, our operations could be disrupted, and our manufacturing could be interrupted. Failure to take adequate corrective action in response to an adverse QSR inspection could result in, among other things, a shut-down of our manufacturing operations, significant fines, suspension of marketing clearances and approvals, seizures or recalls of our device, operating restrictions, and criminal prosecutions, any of which would cause our business to suffer. Furthermore, our key component suppliers may not currently be or may not continue to be in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements, which may result in manufacturing delays for our products and cause our revenue to decline.\nWe have registered with the FDA as a medical device manufacturer and have obtained a manufacturing license from the California Department of Health Services. The FDA has broad post-market and regulatory enforcement powers. We are subject to unannounced inspections by the FDA and the Food and Drug Branch of CDPH to determine our compliance with the QSR and other regulations, and these inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of our suppliers.\nWe produce a significant majority of our IVL catheters in-house at our facility in Santa Clara, California, which, together with our research and development, controlled environment room and office space, currently totals approximately 166,000 square feet. Our Santa Clara facility has been inspected by the FDA and audited by the BSI. We have also entered into a contract manufacturing agreement with a third-party contract manufacturer to produce a portion of our demand for our M5 catheters. We can provide no assurance that the FDA or other inspecting bodies will continue to find us or our suppliers to be in compliance with the QSR. If our or our contract manufacturer\u2019s facilities are found to be in noncompliance or if we fail to take satisfactory corrective action in response to adverse QSR inspectional findings, the FDA could take legal or regulatory enforcement actions against us and/or our products, including but not limited to the cessation of sales or the recall of distributed products, which could impair our ability to manufacture our products in a cost-effective and timely manner in order to meet our customers\u2019 demands. We may also be required to bear other costs or take other actions that may have a negative impact on our future sales and our ability to generate profits. Taking corrective action may be expensive, time-consuming and a distraction for management, and if we experience a shutdown or delay at our manufacturing facilities, we may be unable to manufacture our products, which would harm our business.\nCurrent regulations depend heavily on administrative interpretation. If the FDA does not believe that we are in compliance with applicable FDA regulations, the agency could take legal or regulatory enforcement actions against us and/or our products. We are also subject to periodic inspections by the FDA and other governmental regulatory agencies, as well as certain third-party regulatory groups. Future interpretations made by the FDA or other regulatory bodies made during the course of these inspections may vary from current interpretations and may adversely affect our business and prospects. The FDA\u2019s and other comparable non-U.S. regulatory agencies\u2019 statutes, regulations or policies may change, and additional government regulation or statutes may be enacted, which could increase post-approval regulatory requirements, or delay, suspend or prevent marketing of any cleared or approved products or necessitate the recall of distributed products. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse governmental regulation that might arise from future legislative or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad.\nThe medical device industry has been under heightened FDA scrutiny as the subject of government investigations and enforcement actions. If our operations and activities are found to be in violation of any FDA laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines and other legal and/or agency enforcement actions. Any penalties, damages, fines or curtailment or restructuring of our operations or activities could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. The risk of us being found in violation of FDA laws is increased by the fact that many of these laws are broad and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend ourselves against that action and its underlying allegations, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business. Where there is a dispute with a federal or state governmental agency that cannot be resolved to the mutual satisfaction of all relevant parties, we may determine that the costs, both real and contingent, are not justified by the commercial returns to us from maintaining the dispute or pursuing the operations and activities in question, including the continued manufacturing and sale of any impacted product.\nVarious claims, design features or performance characteristics of our medical devices that we may regard as permitted by the FDA without marketing clearance or approval, may be challenged by the FDA or state or foreign regulators. The FDA or state or foreign regulatory authorities may find that certain claims, design features or performance characteristics, in order to be made or included in our products, may have to be supported by further studies and marketing clearances or approvals, which could be lengthy, costly and possibly unobtainable.\nHealthcare reform initiatives and other administrative and legislative proposals may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in our key markets.\nThere have been and continue to be proposals by the federal government, state governments, regulators, and third-party payors to control or manage the increased costs of healthcare and, more generally, to reform the U.S. healthcare system. Certain of these proposals could limit the prices we are able to charge for our products or the coverage and reimbursement available for our products and could limit the acceptance and availability of our products. The adoption of proposals to control costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFor example, in the United States, in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended (the \u201cACA\u201d) was enacted. The ACA is a sweeping measure intended to expand healthcare coverage within the United States, primarily through the imposition of health insurance mandates on employers and individuals, (the latter of which since made non-enforceable), the provision of subsidies to eligible individuals enrolled in plans offered on the health insurance exchanges and the expansion of the Medicaid program. The ACA has impacted existing government healthcare programs and has resulted in the development of new programs.\nCertain provisions of the ACA have been subject to judicial challenges, as well as efforts to repeal or replace them or to alter their interpretation and implementation, and there may be additional challenges and amendments to the ACA in the future. For example, legislation affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the ACA have been signed into law, including the TCJA, which includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the \u201cindividual mandate.\u201d Further, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (\u201cBBA\u201d), among other things, amended the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the \u201cdonut hole.\u201d In December 2018, a United States District Court Judge for the Northern District of Texas ruled that (i) the \u201cindividual mandate\u201d was unconstitutional as a result of the associated tax penalty being repealed by Congress as part of the TCJA; and (ii) the individual mandate is not severable from the rest of the ACA, and as a result the entire ACA is invalid. On December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the district court\u2019s decision that the individual mandate is unconstitutional but remanded the case to the district court to reconsider the severability question. In March 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear the case and oral arguments before the U.S. Supreme Court took place on November 10, 2020. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the challenge to the ACA without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Thus, the ACA will remain in effect in its current form. Further, prior to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, President Biden issued an Executive Order to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021, through August 15, 2021, for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The Executive Order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. It is possible that the ACA will be subject to further judicial or Congressional challenges in the future. It is unclear how any such efforts to repeal, replace, amend or invalidate the ACA or its implementing regulations, or portions thereof, and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the ACA or our business.\nIn addition, other healthcare reform legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. On August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 was signed into law, which, among other things, includes reductions to Medicare payments to providers of, on average, 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, including the BBA, will remain in effect through 2030 (with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through May 31, 2022, due to the COVID-19 pandemic). The law provides for 1% Medicare sequestration in the second quarter of 2022 and allows the full 2% sequestration thereafter until 2030. To offset the temporary suspension during the COVID-19 pandemic, in 2030, the sequestration will be 2.25% for the first half of the year, and 3% in the second half of the year. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.\nWe cannot assure you that the ACA, as currently enacted or as amended in the future, will not harm our business and financial results, and we cannot predict how future federal or state legislative or administrative changes relating to healthcare reform will affect our business.\nThere likely will continue to be legislative and regulatory proposals at the federal and state levels, as well as internationally, directed at containing or lowering the cost of healthcare. We cannot predict the initiatives that may be adopted in the future or their full impact. The continuing efforts of the government, insurance companies, managed care organizations and other payors of healthcare services to contain or reduce costs of healthcare may harm:\n\u2022\nour ability to set a price that we believe is fair for our products;\n\u2022\nour ability to generate revenue and achieve or maintain profitability; and\n\u2022\nthe availability of capital.\nFurther, recently there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal legislation designed to bring transparency to product pricing and reduce the cost of products and services under government healthcare programs. Additionally, individual states in the United States have also increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures. Moreover, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what products to purchase and which suppliers will be included in their healthcare programs. Adoption of price controls and other cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures may prevent or limit our ability to generate revenue and attain profitability.\nVarious new healthcare reform proposals are emerging at the federal and state level. Any new federal and state healthcare initiatives that may be adopted could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLegislative or regulatory reforms may make it more difficult and costly for us to obtain regulatory clearance or approval of our planned or future products and to manufacture, market and distribute our products after clearance or approval is obtained.\nFrom time to time, legislation is drafted and introduced in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the regulatory approval, manufacture and marketing of regulated products or the reimbursement thereof. In the United States in recent years, new legislation has been proposed and adopted at the federal and state levels that is effecting major changes in the healthcare system. In addition, new regulations and interpretations of existing healthcare statutes and regulations are frequently adopted and we may not be able to comply with the changed laws, they could increase the cost of manufacturing, marketing, or selling our product, could make approvals of pipeline products more difficult or prevent us from selling our products at all. We expect there will continue to be a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the U.S. health care system that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the regulatory approval, manufacture and marketing of regulated products or the reimbursement thereof and may impose additional costs or lengthen regulatory review times of planned or future products.\nIf, as a result of legislative or regulatory healthcare reform, we cannot sell our products profitably, whether due to our own inability to comply with, or the inability of other economic operators in our supply chain to qualify under, any legislative reform, our business would be harmed. In addition, any change in the laws or regulations that govern the clearance and approval processes relating to our current, planned and future products could make it more difficult and costly to obtain clearance or approval for new products or to produce, market and distribute existing products. Significant delays in receiving clearance or approval or the failure to receive clearance or approval for our new products would have an adverse effect on our ability to expand our business.\nFor example, in April 2017, the EU adopted a new Medical Devices Regulation (Regulation 2017/745) (\u201cMDR\u201d), which became effective May 26, 2021 and replaced the EU\u2019s Medical Devices Directive (93/42/EEC) (\u201cMDD\u201d). Unlike directives, which must be implemented into the national laws of the EU member states, regulations are directly applicable in all EU member states and are intended to eliminate current differences in the regulation of medical devices among EU member states. The MDR is significantly more comprehensive and detailed than the MDD. Among other things, the MDR requires manufacturers to report on the composition of their products and verify the presence of any of 1,200 substances referenced in the MDR. Medical devices that have a valid CE Mark under MDD can continue to be sold until May 2024 or until the CE Mark expires, whichever comes first, provided there are no significant changes to the design or intended use of the device. Complying with the new requirements of MDR may cause regulatory authorization timelines for future medical\ndevice products to become extended and significantly increase the costs of obtaining and maintaining CE Marks for our products. Adjusting to MDR may be costly and disruptive to our business.\nBroader legislative changes may also impact our operations. The UK held a referendum on June 23, 2016, in which voters approved withdrawal from the EU (commonly referred to as Brexit). On January 31, 2020, the UK withdrew from the EU and the transition period ended on December 31, 2020. The UK and EU reached agreement regarding their future relationship on December 24, 2020. As a result of Brexit, there may be greater restrictions on imports and exports into and out of the UK and EU countries and regulatory complexities that could adversely impact our business.\nEnvironmental and health safety laws may result in liabilities, expenses, and restrictions on our operations. Failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations could subject us to significant liability.\nFederal, state, local and foreign laws regarding environmental protection, hazardous substances and human health and safety may adversely affect our business. Our research and development and manufacturing operations may involve the use of hazardous substances and are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations relating to the storage, use, discharge, disposal, remediation of, and human exposure to, hazardous substances and the sale, labeling, collection, recycling, treatment, and disposal of products containing hazardous substances. These operations are permitted by regulatory authorities, and the resultant waste materials are disposed of in material compliance with environmental laws and regulations. Using hazardous substances in our operations exposes us to the risk of accidental injury, contamination or other liability from the use, storage, importation, handling, or disposal of hazardous materials. If our or our suppliers\u2019 operations result in the contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances, we could be liable for damages and fines, and any liability could significantly exceed our insurance coverage and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Liability under environmental laws and regulations can be joint and several and without regard to fault or negligence. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations may be expensive, and non-compliance could result in substantial liabilities, fines and penalties, personal injury and third-party property damage claims and substantial investigation and remediation costs. Environmental laws and regulations could become more stringent over time, imposing greater compliance costs, and increasing risks and penalties associated with violations. We cannot assure you that violations of these laws and regulations will not occur in the future or have not occurred in the past as a result of human error, accidents, equipment failure or other causes. The expense associated with environmental regulation and remediation could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operation.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nIf we are unable to obtain and maintain patent or other intellectual property protection for our products, or if the scope of the patent and other intellectual property protection obtained is not sufficiently broad, our competitors could develop and commercialize products and technology similar or identical to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize any products we may develop, and our technology, may be adversely affected.\nAs with other medical device companies, our success depends in large part on our ability to maintain and solidify a proprietary position for our products, which will depend upon our success in obtaining and enforcing effective intellectual property (including patent claims) that cover the use, functionality and manufacture of such products. With respect to patents specifically, the process for filing, maintaining and enforcing rights in or obtaining licenses for patents is complex and subject to many risks and uncertainties, including the following:\n\u2022\nProtection of Confidential Information. Although we enter into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to confidential or patentable aspects of our research and development output, such as our employees, corporate collaborators, outside scientific collaborators, suppliers, consultants, advisors, and other third parties, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose such output before a patent application is filed, thereby jeopardizing our ability to seek patent protection.\n\u2022\nPatentability. Our ability to obtain and maintain valid and enforceable patents depends on whether the differences between our inventions and the prior art allow our inventions to be patentable over the prior art. We cannot be certain that we were the first to make or file the inventions claimed in any of our patents or pending patent applications. Moreover, in some circumstances, we may not have the right to control the preparation, filing and prosecution of patent applications, or to maintain the patents, covering technology that we license from or license to third parties and are therefore reliant on our licensors or licensees. Therefore, these and any of our patents and applications may not be prosecuted and enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business.\n\u2022\nPatent Prosecution Process. The patent prosecution process is expensive, time-consuming, and complex, and we may not be able to file, prosecute, maintain, enforce, or license all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development output in time to obtain patent protection.\n\u2022\nFiling Defects. Defects of form in the preparation or filing of our patents or patent applications may exist, or may arise in the future, for example, with respect to proper priority claims, inventorship and the like, although we are unaware of any such defects that we believe are of material importance.\n\u2022\nReduction in Scope of Patent. The coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued, and its scope can be reinterpreted after issuance. Even if patent applications we license or own, currently or in the future, issue as patents, they may not issue in a form that will provide us with any meaningful protection, prevent competitors or other third parties from competing with us, or otherwise provide us with any competitive advantage.\n\u2022\nPatent Maintenance Requirements. Periodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees and various other government fees on patents and applications will be due to be paid to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (the \u201cUSPTO\u201d) and various government patent agencies outside of the United States over the lifetime of our patents and applications. The USPTO and various non-U.S. government agencies require compliance with several procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. In some cases, an inadvertent lapse can be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules. However, there are situations in which non-compliance, including failure to respond to official actions within prescribed time limits, non-payment of fees or failure to properly legalize and submit formal documents, can result in the abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in a partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, potential competitors might be able to enter the market with similar or identical products or technology.\n\u2022\nPatent Lifespan. Patents have a limited lifespan. In the United States, the natural expiration of a utility patent is generally 20 years after its effective filing date and the natural expiration of a design patent is generally 14 years after its issue date, unless the filing date occurred on or after May 13, 2015, in which case the natural expiration of a design patent is generally 15 years after its issue date. While various extensions may be available, the life of a patent, and the protection it affords, is limited. Without patent protection for our products and services, we may be open to competition. Further, if we encounter delays in our development efforts, the period of time during which we could market our products and services under patent protection would be reduced and, given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of planned or future products, patents protecting such products might expire before or shortly after such products are commercialized. As a result, our patents may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours.\n\u2022\nInternational Patent Protection. Filing, prosecuting, and defending patents on our current and future products in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive. The requirements for patentability may differ in certain countries, particularly developing countries. The laws of some foreign countries may not protect our patent rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States, or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and, further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with our products, and our patents rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.\n\u2022\nThird-Party Claims. Even if patents do successfully issue from our patent applications, third parties may challenge the validity, enforceability, or scope of such patents, which may result in such patents being narrowed, invalidated, or held unenforceable. For more information on the risks relating to third party claims, see the section titled \u201c-Patents covering our products could be found invalid or unenforceable if challenged in court or before administrative bodies in the United States or abroad.\u201d\n\u2022\nThird-Party Rights. Some of our patents and patent applications may in the future be co-owned with third parties. If we are unable to obtain an exclusive license to any such third-party co-owners\u2019 interest in such patents\nor patent applications, such co-owners may be able to license their rights to other third parties, including our competitors, and our competitors could market competing products and technology. In addition, we may need the cooperation of any such co-owners of our patents in order to enforce such patents against third parties, and such cooperation may not be provided to us. We may not be successful in obtaining necessary rights to any products we may develop through acquisitions and in-licenses.\n\u2022\nPatent Licenses. Many medical device companies and academic institutions are competing with us and filing patent applications potentially relevant to our business. We may find it necessary or prudent to obtain licenses from such third-party intellectual property holders. However, we may be unable to secure such licenses or otherwise acquire or in-license any intellectual property rights from third parties that we identify as necessary for planned or future products, for a variety of reasons, including actions of competitors and interests of the potential licensor. We also may be unable to license or acquire third-party intellectual property rights on terms that would allow us to make an appropriate return on our investment or at all. Even if we are able to obtain a license, it may be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us. If we are unable to successfully obtain rights to required third-party intellectual property rights or maintain the existing intellectual property rights we have, we may have to abandon development of the relevant products.\n\u2022\nChanges in Patent Laws. Changes in either the patent laws or their interpretation in the United States and other countries may diminish our ability to protect our inventions, obtain, maintain, and enforce our intellectual property rights and, more generally, could affect the value of our intellectual property or narrow the scope of our issued patents. For more information on the risks relating to changes in patent laws, see the section titled \u201c-Changes in patent law could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our products.\u201d\nConsequently, we do not know whether our IVL products and technologies will be protectable or remain protected by valid and enforceable patents. Our competitors or other third parties may be able to circumvent our patents by developing similar or alternative technologies or products in a non-infringing manner which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. If we or any current or future licensors or licensees fail to establish, maintain, protect, or enforce such patents and other intellectual property rights, such rights may be reduced or eliminated. Any such outcome could impair our ability to prevent competition from third parties, which may have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nPatents covering our products could be found invalid or unenforceable if challenged in court or before administrative bodies in the United States or abroad.\nThe issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability, and our patents may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. We may be subject to a third-party preissuance submission of prior art to the USPTO, or become involved in opposition, derivation, revocation, reexamination, post-grant and inter partes review (\u201cIPR\u201d), or interference proceedings or other similar proceedings challenging our patent rights. An adverse determination in any such submission, proceeding or litigation could reduce the scope of, or invalidate or render unenforceable, our patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize our technology or products and compete directly with us, without payment to us, or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize products without infringing third-party patent rights. Moreover, we may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the USPTO to determine priority of invention or in post-grant challenge proceedings, such as oppositions in a foreign patent office, that challenge our priority of invention or other features of patentability with respect to our patents and patent applications. Such challenges may result in loss of patent rights, in loss of exclusivity or in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated, or held unenforceable, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our technology or products. Such proceedings also may result in substantial cost and require significant time from our scientists and management, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us.\nFor example, petitions for IPR of U.S. Pat. Nos. 9,642,673, 8,956,371 and 8,728,091, which are three of our issued U.S. patents that relate to our current IVL Technology, were filed in December 2018 at the USPTO\u2019s Patent Trial and Appeal Board (the \u201cPTAB\u201d) by Cardiovascular Systems, Inc., one of our competitors. The PTAB instituted IPR proceedings for all three patents. The PTAB held oral hearings on April 15-16, 2020. On July 8, 2020, the PTAB ruled that one claim (\u201cClaim 5\u201d) in U.S. Pat No. 8,956,371 (the \u201c\u2019371 patent\u201d) is valid and ruled that all other claims in the \u2019371 patent are invalid and that all claims of U.S. Pat No. 8,728,091 (the \u201c\u2019091 patent\u201d) are invalid. On July 20, 2020, the PTAB ruled that all claims of U.S. Pat. No. 9,642,673 (the \u201c\u2019673 patent\u201d) are invalid. On August 27, 2020, further briefing by the parties was requested by the PTAB judge in the \u2019371 patent proceeding to assess whether recent guidance from the USPTO relating to \u201capplicant admitted prior art\u201d impacted the PTAB decision in the \u2019371 patent proceeding. In addition, the PTAB judge reset the time for\ncommencement of an appeal in the \u2019371 patent proceeding pending the entry of a final decision after the requested briefing. On October 13, 2020, we submitted the last of the requested briefing, and the PTAB decision is pending. Subject to the final PTAB decision regarding the \u2019371 patent proceeding, we anticipate appealing this ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (the \u201cFederal Circuit\u201d).\nWe appealed the rulings in the IPR proceedings for the \u2019091 patent and the \u2019673 patent to the Federal Circuit. On January 18, 2022, the Federal Circuit issued two short opinions affirming the decisions of the PTAB, finding that the claims of the \u2019091 patent and the \u2019673 patent are unpatentable (the \u201cRulings\u201d). These Rulings conclude the IPR proceedings initiated by CSI for these two patents and resulted in the loss in scope of the \u2019091 patent and the \u2019673 patent, which may limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing products and technology similar or identical to ours.\nIPR proceedings relating to the \u2019371 patent remain pending before the PTAB on rehearing and have not yet been addressed by the Federal Circuit. Claim 5 of the \u2019371 patent was found to be valid and all other claims remain valid and enforceable until a final decision is obtained from the PTAB and any appeals have been exhausted. Upon the conclusion of such appeals, if we are unsuccessful in whole or in part, the \u2019371 patent proceedings could result in the loss or narrowing in scope of the \u2019371 patent, which could further limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing products and technology similar or identical to ours.\nIn addition, if we initiate legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent covering our products, the defendant could counterclaim that such patent is invalid or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the United States, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity or unenforceability are commonplace. Grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, including lack of novelty, obviousness, or non-enablement. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation that someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant information from the USPTO or made a misleading statement during prosecution. Third parties may also raise claims challenging the validity or enforceability of our patents before administrative bodies in the United States or abroad, even outside the context of litigation, including through re-examination, post-grant review, IPR, interference proceedings, derivation proceedings and equivalent proceedings in foreign jurisdictions (e.g., opposition proceedings). Such proceedings could result in the revocation of, cancellation of or amendment to our patents in such a way that they no longer cover our products. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable. With respect to the validity question, for example, we cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art, of which we and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. If a third party were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity or unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection on our products.\nAny loss or limitation of patent protection could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nChanges in patent law could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our products.\nChanges in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of patent applications and the enforcement or defense of issued patents. Assuming that other requirements for patentability are met, prior to March 2013, in the United States, the first to invent the claimed invention was entitled to the patent, while outside the United States, the first to file a patent application was entitled to the patent. After March 2013, under the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (the \u201cAmerica Invents Act\u201d), enacted in September 2011, the United States transitioned to a first inventor to file system in which, assuming that other requirements for patentability are met, the first inventor to file a patent application will be entitled to the patent on an invention regardless of whether a third party was the first to invent the claimed invention. A third party that files a patent application in the USPTO after March 2013, but before us could therefore be awarded a patent covering an invention of ours even if we had made the invention before it was made by such third party. This will require us to be cognizant of the time from invention to filing of a patent application. Since patent applications in the United States and most other countries are confidential for a period of time after filing or until issuance, we cannot be certain that we were the first to file any patent application related to our products or invent any of the inventions claimed in our patents or patent applications.\nThe America Invents Act also includes a number of significant changes that affect the way patent applications will be prosecuted and also may affect patent litigation. These include allowing third-party submission of prior art to the USPTO during patent prosecution and additional procedures to attack the validity of a patent by USPTO administered post-grant proceedings, including post-grant review, IPR and derivation proceedings. Because of a lower evidentiary standard in USPTO proceedings compared to the evidentiary standard in U.S. federal courts necessary to invalidate a patent claim, a third party could potentially provide evidence in a USPTO proceeding sufficient for the USPTO to hold a claim invalid even though the same evidence would be insufficient to invalidate the claim if first presented in a district court action. The number of IPR challenges filed is increasing, and in many cases, the USPTO is canceling or significantly narrowing issued patent\nclaims. Accordingly, a third party may attempt to use the USPTO procedures to invalidate our patent claims that would not have been invalidated if first challenged by the third party as a defendant in a district court action. Therefore, the America Invents Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents. In addition, future actions by the U.S. Congress, the federal courts and the USPTO could cause the laws and regulations governing patents to change in unpredictable ways. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn addition, patent reform legislation may pass in the future that could lead to additional uncertainties and increased costs surrounding the prosecution, enforcement and defense of our patents and applications. Furthermore, the U.S. Supreme Court and the Federal Circuit have made, and will likely continue to make, changes in how the patent laws of the United States are interpreted. Similarly, foreign courts have made, and will likely continue to make, changes in how the patent laws in their respective jurisdictions are interpreted. We cannot predict future changes in the interpretation of patent laws or changes to patent laws that might be enacted into law by U.S. and foreign legislative bodies. Those changes may materially affect our patents or patent applications and our ability to obtain additional patent protection in the future.\nWe may be subject to claims challenging the ownership or inventorship of our patents and other intellectual property and, if unsuccessful in any of these proceedings, we may be required to obtain licenses from third parties, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or to cease the development, manufacture, and commercialization of one or more of our products.\nWe may be subject to claims that current or former employees, collaborators or other third parties have an interest in our patents, trade secrets or other intellectual property as an inventor or co-inventor. For example, we may have inventorship disputes arise from conflicting obligations of employees, consultants or others who are involved in developing our products. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these and other claims challenging inventorship of our patents, trade secrets or other intellectual property. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights, such as exclusive ownership of, or right to use, intellectual property that is important to our products. If we were to lose exclusive ownership of such intellectual property, other owners may be able to license their rights to other third parties, including our competitors. We also may be required to obtain and maintain licenses from third parties, including parties involved in any such disputes. Such licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or may be non-exclusive. If we are unable to obtain and maintain such licenses, we may need to cease the development, manufacture and commercialization of one or more of our products. The loss of exclusivity or the narrowing of our patent claims could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWhile it is our policy to require our employees and contractors who may be involved in the conception or development of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who, in fact, conceives or develops intellectual property that we regard as our own. The assignment of intellectual property rights may not be self-executing, or the assignment agreements may be breached, and we may be forced to bring claims against third parties, or defend claims that they may bring against us, to determine the ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property. Such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThird-party claims of intellectual property infringement, misappropriation or other violation against us or our collaborators may prevent or delay the sale and marketing of our products.\nThe medical device industry is highly competitive and dynamic. Due to the focused research and development that is taking place by several companies, including us and our competitors, in this field, the intellectual property landscape is in flux, and it may remain uncertain in the future. As such, we could become subject to significant intellectual property-related litigation and proceedings relating to our or third-party intellectual property and proprietary rights.\nOur commercial success depends in part on our and any potential future collaborators\u2019 ability to develop, manufacture, market and sell any products that we may develop and use our proprietary technologies without infringing, misappropriating and otherwise violating the patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties. It is uncertain whether the issuance of any third-party patent would require us or any potential collaborators to alter our development or commercial strategies, obtain licenses or cease certain activities. The medical device industry is characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights, as well as administrative proceedings for challenging patents, including interference, inter partes or post-grant review, derivation, and reexamination proceedings before the USPTO or oppositions and other comparable proceedings in foreign jurisdictions.\nThird parties, including our competitors, may currently have patents or obtain patents in the future and claim that the manufacture, use or sale of our products infringes upon these patents. We have not conducted an extensive search of patents issued or assigned to other parties, including our competitors, and no assurance can be given that patents containing claims covering our products, parts of our products, technology or methods do not exist, have not been filed or could not be filed or issued. In addition, because patent applications can take many years to issue and because publication schedules for pending applications vary by jurisdiction, there may be applications now pending of which we are unaware, and which may result in issued patents which our current or future products infringe. Also, because the claims of published patent applications can change between publication and patent grant, there may be published patent applications that may ultimately issue with claims that we infringe. As the number of competitors in our market grows and the number of patents issued in this area increases, the possibility of patent infringement claims against us escalates. Moreover, we may face claims from non-practicing entities (\u201cNPEs\u201d), which have no relevant product revenue and against whom our own patent portfolio may have no deterrent effect. Third parties, including NPEs, have claimed, and may in the future claim, that our products infringe or violate their patents or other intellectual property rights.\nIn the event that any third-party claims that we infringe their patents or that we are otherwise employing their proprietary technology without authorization and initiates litigation against us, even if we believe such claims are without merit, there is no assurance that a court would find in our favor on questions of infringement, validity, enforceability or priority. A court of competent jurisdiction could hold that these third-party patents are valid, enforceable, and infringed by our products. In order to successfully challenge the validity of any such U.S. patent in federal court, we would need to overcome a presumption of validity. As this burden is a high one requiring us to present clear and convincing evidence as to the invalidity of any such U.S. patent claim, there is no assurance that a court of competent jurisdiction would invalidate the claims of any such U.S. patent. If we are found to infringe third-party patents, and we are unsuccessful in demonstrating that such patents are invalid or unenforceable, such third parties may be able to block our ability to commercialize the applicable products or technology unless we obtain a license under the applicable patents, or until such patents expire or are finally determined to be held invalid or unenforceable. Such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Even if we are able to obtain a license, the license would likely obligate us to pay significant license fees and/or royalties, and the rights granted to us might be non-exclusive, which could result in our competitors gaining access to the same technology. If we are unable to obtain a necessary license to a third-party patent on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, we may be unable to commercialize our products, or such commercialization efforts may be significantly delayed, which could in turn significantly harm our business.\nDefense of infringement claims, regardless of their merit or outcome, would involve substantial litigation expense and would be a substantial diversion of management and other employee resources from our business, and may impact our reputation. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us, we may be enjoined from further developing or commercializing the infringing products and/or have to pay substantial damages for use of the asserted intellectual property, including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees were we found to willfully infringe such intellectual property. We also might have to redesign our infringing products or technologies, which may be impossible or require substantial time and monetary expenditure.\nEngaging in litigation to defend against third-party infringement claims is very expensive, particularly for a company of our size, and time-consuming. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments, and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on our common stock price. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce the resources available for development activities or any future sales, marketing, or distribution activities. We may not have sufficient financial or other resources to conduct such litigation or proceedings adequately. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of litigation or administrative proceedings more effectively than we can because of greater financial resources and more mature and developed intellectual property portfolios. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings against us could impair our ability to compete in the marketplace. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents and other intellectual property rights, which could be expensive, time-consuming, and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe our patents, or we may be required to defend against claims of infringement. In addition, our patents also may become involved in inventorship, priority or validity disputes. To counter or defend against such claims can be expensive and time-consuming. In an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent owned by us is invalid or unenforceable or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover such technology. An adverse result in any litigation proceeding could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with\nintellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during litigation.\nEven if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause us to incur significant expenses and could distract our management and other personnel from their normal responsibilities. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments, and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on our common stock price. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce the resources available for development activities or any future sales, marketing, or distribution activities. We may not have sufficient financial or other resources to conduct such litigation or proceedings adequately. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their greater financial resources and more mature and developed intellectual property portfolios. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nOur reliance on third parties requires us to share our trade secrets, which increases the possibility that a competitor will discover them or that our trade secrets will be misappropriated or disclosed. If we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed.\nIn addition to seeking patent protection for our products, we also rely upon unpatented trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain a competitive position. We seek to protect such proprietary information, in part, through confidentiality agreements with our employees, collaborators, contractors, advisors, consultants and other third parties and invention assignment agreements with our employees. We also have agreements with some of our consultants that require them to assign to us any inventions created as a result of their working with us. These confidentiality and information assignment agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of agreements or clauses containing invention assignment, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with employees or third parties. We cannot guarantee that we have entered into such agreements with each party that has or may have had access to our trade secrets or proprietary information. We may not be able to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of our technical knowledge or other trade secrets by such third parties, despite the existence of confidentiality restrictions. Confidentiality agreements may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets, know-how, or other proprietary information in the event the unwanted use is outside the scope of the provisions of the agreements or in the event of any unauthorized use, misappropriation, or disclosure of such trade secrets, know-how, or other proprietary information. Additionally, despite these efforts, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches.\nEnforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive, and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor or other third party, we would have no right to prevent them from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to, or independently developed by, a competitor or other third party, our competitive position would be materially and adversely harmed. Furthermore, we expect these trade secrets, know-how and proprietary information to over time be disseminated within the industry through independent development, the publication of journal articles describing the methodology and the movement of personnel from academic to industry scientific positions.\nWe also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our propriety data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached and detecting the disclosure or misappropriation of confidential information and enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated confidential information is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. Further, we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known to, or be independently discovered by, competitors, and in such cases we could not assert any trade secret rights against such parties. To the extent that our employees, consultants, contractors or collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees, consultants, or advisors have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their current or former employers or claims asserting ownership of what we regard as our own intellectual property.\nMany of our employees, consultants and contractors are or were previously employed at other medical device companies, including those that are our direct competitors or could potentially become our direct competitors. In some cases, those employees joined our company recently. Some of these employees, consultants and contractors, may have executed proprietary rights, non-disclosure and non-competition agreements in connection with such previous employment. Although we try to ensure that our employees, consultants, and advisors do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may in the future become subject to claims that we or these individuals have, inadvertently or otherwise, used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of their current or former employer. In addition, we have been and may in the future be subject to allegations that we caused an employee to breach the terms of such employee\u2019s non-competition or non-solicitation agreement. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We cannot guarantee that this type of litigation will not occur in the future, which may adversely affect our ability to hire the most qualified personnel. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nIf our trademarks and trade names are not adequately protected, then we may not be able to build name recognition in our markets of interest and our business may be adversely affected.\nWe rely on our trademarks and trade names to distinguish our products from the products of our competitors and have registered or applied to register many of these trademarks. Our trademarks or trade names may be challenged, infringed, circumvented, declared generic or determined to be violating or infringing on other marks. We may not be able to protect our rights to these trademarks and trade names, which we need to build name recognition among potential partners and customers in our markets of interest. At times, competitors or other third parties may adopt trade names or trademarks similar to ours, thereby impeding our ability to build brand identity and possibly leading to market confusion. In addition, there could be potential trade name or trademark infringement, or dilution claims brought by owners of other trademarks. Over the long term, if we are unable to establish name recognition based on our trademarks and trade names, then we may not be able to compete effectively, and our business may be adversely affected. Our efforts to enforce or protect our proprietary rights related to trademarks (including domain names) and trade names may be ineffective, could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRISKS RELATED TO OWNERSHIP OF OUR COMMON STOCK\nThe market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in price in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control. From January 1, 2021 through December 31, 2021, the closing price of our common stock has ranged from $92.73 per share to $241.83 per share. Stock markets in general and the market for medical device companies in particular have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. Price declines in our common stock could result from general market and economic conditions, some of which are beyond our control, and a variety of other factors, including any of the risk factors described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or those that we have not anticipated. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe volume of sales of our products;\n\u2022\nthe failure by our customers to obtain coverage and adequate reimbursements or reimbursement levels that would be sufficient to support product sales to our customers;\n\u2022\nunanticipated serious safety concerns related to the use of our products;\n\u2022\nintroduction of new products or services offered by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nannouncements of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nannouncements of technological or medical innovations for the treatment of vascular disease;\n\u2022\nour ability to effectively manage our growth;\n\u2022\nthe size and growth of our target markets;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated quarterly variations in our or our competitors\u2019 results of operations;\n\u2022\nfailure to meet estimates or recommendations by securities analysts who cover our stock;\n\u2022\nfailure to meet our own financial estimates;\n\u2022\naccusations that we have violated a law or regulation;\n\u2022\nrecalls of our products;\n\u2022\ndisputes or other developments relating to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters and our ability to obtain, maintain, protect and enforce our patents and other intellectual property rights for our technologies and products;\n\u2022\nsignificant litigation, including stockholder litigation or litigation related to intellectual property;\n\u2022\nour cash position;\n\u2022\nany delay in any regulatory filings for our planned or future products and any adverse development or perceived adverse development with respect to the applicable regulatory authority\u2019s review of such products;\n\u2022\nadverse regulatory decisions, including failure to receive regulatory approval or clearance of our planned and future products or maintain regulatory approval or clearance for our existing products;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws or regulations applicable to our products;\n\u2022\nadverse developments concerning our suppliers or distributors;\n\u2022\nour inability to obtain adequate supplies and components for our products or inability to do so at acceptable prices;\n\u2022\nour inability to establish and maintain collaborations if needed;\n\u2022\nchanges in the market valuations of similar companies;\n\u2022\noverall performance of the equity markets;\n\u2022\nsales of large blocks of our common stock, including sales by our executive officers, directors, and significant stockholders;\n\u2022\ntrading volume of our common stock;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key scientific or management personnel;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting principles;\n\u2022\nineffectiveness of our internal controls;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated changes in healthcare policy and reimbursement levels;\n\u2022\ngeneral market conditions and other factors, including factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors; and\n\u2022\nother events or factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nIn addition, the trading prices for common stock of other medical device companies have been highly volatile, due in part to the COVID-19 pandemic, which continues to rapidly evolve. The extent to which the pandemic may impact our business will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence.\nAn active trading market for our common stock may not be sustained.\nOur common stock is currently listed and trades on the Nasdaq under the symbol \u201cSWAV.\u201d We cannot assure you that an active trading market for our common stock will be sustained. Accordingly, we cannot assure you of the liquidity of any trading market, your ability to sell your shares of our common stock when desired, or the prices that you may obtain for your shares.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock, so any returns will be limited to increases, if any, in our stock\u2019s value. Your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation, if any, in the price of our common stock.\nWe currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development, operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. Any future determination to declare dividends will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other factors, our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, general business conditions and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. Any return to stockholders will therefore be limited to the appreciation in the value of their stock, if any.\nOur principal stockholders and management own a significant percentage of our stock and will be able to exercise significant influence over matters subject to stockholder approval.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our executive officers, directors and 5% stockholders beneficially owned approximately 37% of the outstanding shares of capital stock. As of December 31, 2021, we had 35,444,472 shares of common stock outstanding. Accordingly, these stockholders have a material influence over the outcome of corporate actions requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, mergers, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets or any other significant corporate transaction. The interests of these stockholders may not be the same as or may even conflict with the interests of our other stockholders. For example, these stockholders could attempt to delay or prevent a change in control of the company, even if such a change in control would benefit our other stockholders, which could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of the company or our assets and might affect the prevailing price of our common stock. The significant concentration of stock ownership may negatively impact the price of our common stock due to investors\u2019 perception that conflicts of interest may exist or arise.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our executive officers and directors held options to purchase an aggregate of 906,047 shares of our common stock at a weighted-average exercise price of $4.82 per share and 218,491 shares of common stock underlying outstanding restricted stock units (\u201cRSUs\u201d). We have registered all of the shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of outstanding options, upon the vesting of outstanding RSUs and upon exercise or settlement of any other equity incentives we may grant in the future, for public resale under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d). Accordingly, these shares may be freely sold in the public market upon issuance, subject to applicable vesting requirements and compliance by affiliates with Rule 144 of the Securities Act. Furthermore, holders of our common stock have certain rights with respect to the registration of such shares under the Securities Act.\nWe are at risk of securities class action litigation.\nIn the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following a decline in the market price of its securities. In recent years, medical device companies have experienced significant stock price volatility. If we face such litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could harm our business.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nOur stock price and trading volume is heavily influenced by the way analysts and investors interpret our financial information and other disclosures. The trading market for our common stock depends, in part, on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. If the number of analysts that cover us declines, demand for our common stock could decrease and our common stock price and trading volume may decline. Even if our common stock is actively covered by analysts, we do not have any control over the analysts or the measures that analysts or investors may rely upon to forecast our future results. Over-reliance by analysts or investors on any particular metric to forecast our future results may result in forecasts that differ significantly from our own.\nRegardless of accuracy, unfavorable interpretations of our financial information and other public disclosures could have a negative impact on our stock price. If our financial performance fails to meet analyst estimates, for any of the reasons discussed above or otherwise, or one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our common stock or change their opinion of our common stock, our stock price would likely decline.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation, our amended and restated bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions that could discourage another company from acquiring us and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions of Delaware law (where we are incorporated), our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace or remove our board of directors. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nauthorizing the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock without any need for action by stockholders;\n\u2022\nrequiring supermajority stockholder voting to effect certain amendments to our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws;\n\u2022\neliminating the ability of stockholders to call and bring business before special meetings of stockholders;\n\u2022\nprohibiting stockholder action by written consent;\n\u2022\nestablishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\ndividing our board of directors into three classes so that only one third of our directors will be up for election in any given year; and\n\u2022\nproviding that our directors may be removed by our stockholders only for cause.\nIn addition, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may have an anti-takeover effect with respect to transactions not approved in advance by our board of directors, including discouraging takeover attempts that could have resulted in a premium over the market price for shares of our common stock.\nThese provisions apply even if a takeover offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our board of directors determines is not in our and our stockholders\u2019 best interests and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation provides, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for: any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty; any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, our restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws; or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This exclusive forum provision will not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction.\nSection 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all claims brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder and our restated certificate of incorporation provides that the federal district courts of the United States of America are the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act, or a Federal Forum Provision, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum. Our decision to adopt a Federal Forum Provision followed a decision by the Supreme Court of the State of Delaware holding that such provisions are facially valid under Delaware law. While there can be no assurance that federal or state courts will follow the holding of the Delaware Supreme Court or determine that the Federal Forum Provision should be enforced in a particular case, application of the Federal Forum Provision means that suits brought by our stockholders to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act must be brought in federal court and cannot be brought in state court.\nAny person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in any of our securities will be deemed to have notice of and consented to our exclusive forum provisions, including the Federal Forum Provision. These provisions may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. If a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 18456, "SIC": 3845, "TIC": "SWAV"}
