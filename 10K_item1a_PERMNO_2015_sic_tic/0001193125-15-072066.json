{"cik": "921847", "company": "HUDSON CITY BANCORP INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-02", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe Merger Agreement may be terminated in accordance with its terms and the Merger may not be completed.\nThe Merger Agreement is subject to a number of conditions which must be fulfilled in order to complete the Merger. Those conditions include: approval of the Merger Agreement by Hudson City Bancorp stockholders, approval of the issuance of M&T Common Stock in connection with the Merger by M&T shareholders, receipt of requisite regulatory approvals, absence of orders prohibiting completion of the Merger, approval of the shares of M&T Common Stock to be issued to Hudson City stockholders for listing on the NYSE, the continued accuracy of the representations and warranties by both parties and the performance by both parties of their covenants and agreements, and the receipt by both parties of legal opinions from their respective tax counsels. Hudson City Bancorp stockholders have approved the Merger Agreement and M&T\u2019s stockholders have approved the issuance of M&T Common Stock. However, if the remaining conditions to the closing of the Merger are not fulfilled, the Merger may not be completed.\nOn April 12, 2013, M&T and the Company announced that additional time would be required to obtain a regulatory determination on the applications necessary to complete the proposed Merger. On three occasions, Hudson City Bancorp and M&T have agreed to extend the date after which either party may elect to terminate the Merger Agreement, with the latest extension to April 30, 2015. Each extension was documented with an amendment to the Merger Agreement and the most recent amendment, Amendment No. 3, provides that the Company may terminate the Merger Agreement at any time if it reasonably determines that M&T is unlikely to be able to obtain the requisite regulatory approvals in time to permit the closing to occur on or prior to April 30, 2015. Amendment No. 3, and applicable provisions from the prior amendments, permit the Company to take certain interim actions without the prior approval of M&T, including with respect to our conduct of business, implementation of our strategic plan, retention incentives and certain other matters with respect to our personnel, prior to the completion of the Merger. There can be no assurances that the Merger will be completed by April 30, 2015 or that the Company will not exercise its right to terminate the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms.\nTermination of the Merger Agreement could negatively impact Hudson City.\nIf the Merger Agreement is terminated, Hudson City Bancorp\u2019s business may be adversely impacted by not having pursued other beneficial opportunities due to the focus of management on the Merger.\nAs of December 31, 2014, goodwill and other intangible assets amounted to $152.5 million. We performed our annual goodwill impairment analysis as of June 30, 2014 and concluded that the implied fair value of goodwill of the Company exceeded the carrying value of goodwill. If the Merger Agreement is terminated, the market price of Hudson City Bancorp common stock might decline to the extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that the Merger will be completed. In the event the market price of Hudson City Bancorp common stock does so decline, we may be required to recognize a goodwill impairment charge.\nIn addition, if the Merger Agreement is terminated and Hudson City Bancorp\u2019s board of directors seeks another merger or business combination, Hudson City Bancorp stockholders cannot be certain that Hudson City Bancorp will be able to find a party willing to offer equivalent or more attractive consideration than the consideration M&T has agreed to provide in the Merger.\nHudson City Bancorp stockholders who make elections to receive cash, stock or mixed consideration in the Merger will be unable to sell their shares in the market pending the Merger.\nHudson City Bancorp stockholders may elect to receive cash, stock or mixed consideration in the Merger by completing an election form that will be provided to stockholders. Elections will require that stockholders making the election turn in their Hudson City Bancorp stock certificates. This means that during the time between when the election is made and the date the Merger is completed, Hudson City Bancorp stockholders will be unable to sell their Hudson City Bancorp common stock. If the election forms are returned by Hudson City Bancorp stockholders and then the Merger is unexpectedly delayed, this period could extend for a significant period of time. Hudson City Bancorp stockholders can shorten the period during which they cannot sell their shares by delivering their election shortly before the election deadline. However, elections received after the election deadline will not be accepted or honored.\nHudson City will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the Merger is pending.\nUncertainty about the effect of the Merger on employees and customers may have an adverse effect on Hudson City. These uncertainties may impair Hudson City\u2019s ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the Merger is completed, and could cause customers and others that deal with Hudson City to seek to change existing business relationships with Hudson City. Retention of certain employees may be challenging during the pendency of the Merger, as certain employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles. If key employees depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with the business, Hudson City\u2019s business could be negatively impacted. In addition, the Merger Agreement still restricts Hudson City from making certain acquisitions and taking other specified actions until the Merger occurs without the consent of M&T. These restrictions may prevent Hudson City from pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the Merger.\nSuccessful implementation of our Strategic Plan may be difficult during the pendency of the Merger and we may not be able to fully execute on our new initiatives.\nHudson City has historically been a community and consumer oriented retail savings bank, offering traditional deposit products and focusing on one- to four-family residential mortgages. However, the recent economic downturn made it difficult for us to profitably grow our business in the same manner as in the past. Prior to the announcement of the Merger, we retained an outside consultant to assist management in developing the Strategic Plan. The operational core of the Strategic Plan is the expansion of our loan and deposit product offerings over time to create more balanced sources of revenue and funding and includes initiatives such as secondary mortgage market operations, commercial real estate lending, the introduction of small business banking products and developing a more robust suite of consumer banking products.\nIn the event the Merger is not completed, our future success will depend on our ability to effectively implement our Strategic Plan. There are risks and uncertainties associated with the implementation and execution of the Strategic Plan initiatives, including the investment of time and resources, the possibility that these initiatives will be unprofitable, and the risk of additional liabilities associated with these initiatives. In addition, our ability to successfully execute on these new initiatives will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain talented\nindividuals, which may be difficult during the pendency of the Merger, to help manage these new operations. In addition, successful execution of the initiatives will require satisfactory market conditions that will allow us to profitably grow these new businesses. While we expect to incur start up expenses for our prioritized initiatives throughout 2015, we do not expect to realize revenues from these efforts until 2016. Our revenues and operating results may be adversely affected if we experience further delays or we are unable to successfully implement the strategic initiatives set forth in the Strategic Plan.\nFuture balance sheet restructuring would adversely affect our net income for the period in which we complete the restructuring.\nAs part of our Strategic Plan, we are continuing to explore ways to reduce our interest rate risk while strengthening our balance sheet, which may include a further restructuring of our balance sheet during 2015. The Company previously completed a series of restructuring transactions in 2011 that reduced higher-cost structured borrowings on the Company\u2019s balance sheet. Management is currently considering a variety of different restructuring alternatives, including whether to restructure all or various portions of our borrowed funds and various alternatives for replacement funding. No decision has been made at this time regarding the timing, structure and scope of any restructuring transaction. Decisions regarding any restructuring transaction are dependent upon, among other things, market interest rates, overall economic conditions and the status of the Merger. In the event the Merger Agreement is terminated, we would expect to proceed soon thereafter to execute the restructuring transaction, if it has not been completed by that time. Similar to the 2011 restructuring transactions, we expect any restructuring to result in a decrease in the size of our balance sheet, a material charge to earnings and a decrease in our regulatory capital ratios, though we also expect an improvement in net interest margin and future earnings prospects.\nNew and future rulemaking and enforcement initiatives from the CFPB has had, and will continue to have, a material effect on our loan production and on our operations and operating costs.\nThe CFPB has the authority to implement and enforce a variety of existing consumer protection statutes and to issue new regulations and, with respect to institutions of our size, has exclusive examination and primary enforcement authority with respect to such laws and regulations and is authorized, individually or jointly with the Agencies, to conduct investigations to determine whether any person is, or has, engaged in conduct that violates such laws or regulations. In addition, in accordance with a memorandum of understanding entered into between the CFPB and DOJ, the two agencies have agreed to coordinate efforts related to enforcing the fair lending laws, which includes information sharing and conducting joint investigations.\nAs an independent bureau within the FRB, the CFPB may impose requirements more severe than the previous bank regulatory agencies. The CFPB has initiated enforcement actions against a variety of bank and non-bank market participants with respect to a number of consumer financial products and services that has resulted in those participants expending significant time, money and resources to adjust to the initiatives being pursued by the CFPB. These enforcement actions may serve as precedent for how the CFPB interprets and enforces consumer protection laws with respect to all supervised institutions, which may result in the imposition of higher standards of compliance with such laws.\nPursuant to the Reform Act, in January 2013, the CFPB issued a series of final rules related to mortgage loan origination and mortgage loan servicing. These final rules went into effect in January 2014 and prohibit creditors, such as Hudson City Savings Bank, from extending mortgage loans secured by a dwelling without regard for the consumer\u2019s ability to repay and establishes certain protections from liability for loans that meet the requirements of a \u201cqualified mortgage.\u201d In addition, these rules add restrictions and requirements to mortgage origination and servicing practices and restrict the application of prepayment penalties and compensation practices relating to mortgage loan underwriting. Compliance with these rules required us to change our underwriting practices and in January 2014 we discontinued our reduced documentation loan program in order to comply with the newly effective CFPB requirements to validate a borrower\u2019s ability to repay and the corresponding safe harbor for qualified mortgages. During 2013, 22% of our total loan production consisted of reduced documentation loans. As a result, these rules adversely affected the volume of mortgage loans that we originated in 2014 and will continue to do so in the future. In addition, these rules may subject the Bank to increased potential liability related to its residential loan origination activities.\nThe CFPB is authorized, individually or jointly with the Agencies, to conduct investigations to determine whether any person is, or has, engaged in conduct that violates such laws or regulations. In addition, in accordance with a memorandum of understanding entered into between the CFPB and DOJ, the two agencies have agreed to coordinate efforts related to enforcing the fair lending laws, which includes information sharing and conducting joint investigations. As an independent bureau within the FRB, the CFPB may impose requirements more severe than the previous bank regulatory agencies. The CFPB has initiated enforcement actions against a variety of bank and non-bank market participants with respect to a number of consumer financial products and services that has resulted in those participants expending significant time, money and resources to adjust to the initiatives being pursued by the CFPB. In the event we become the subject of CFPB examination criticism or the target of a CFPB enforcement action we may need to spend considerable time, money and resources revising our operations to conform to the requirements of the CFPB.\nMulti-family and commercial real estate lending may expose us to increased lending risks.\nAs part of our Strategic Plan, in 2014, we commenced the purchase of commercial real estate loans and interests in such loans. At December 31, 2014, our portfolio of multi-family and commercial real estate loans totaled $102.3 million. We intend to continue to build our commercial real estate lending portfolio, consistent with our Strategic Plan. Multi-family and commercial real estate mortgage loans generally involve a greater degree of credit risk than residential mortgage loans because they typically have larger balances than residential mortgage loans and other consumer loans and are more affected by adverse conditions in the economy. Additionally, such loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to one- to four- family residential mortgage loans. Because payments on loans secured by multi-family properties and commercial real estate often depend upon the successful operation and management of the properties and the businesses which operate from within them, repayment of such loans may be affected by factors outside the borrower\u2019s control, such as adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy or changes in government regulation. In light of the planned future growth of these portfolios, we have implemented enhanced risk management policies, procedures and controls. Our failure to adequately implement enhanced risk management policies, procedures and controls could result in an increased rate of delinquencies, increased losses from these portfolios and adversely affect our ability to increase our multi-family and commercial real estate loan portfolio going forward.\nTo the extent we originate multi-family and commercial real estate mortgage loans in areas other than the New York metropolitan area, we could be subject to additional risks with respect to multi-family and commercial real estate mortgage lending in those areas since we have less direct oversight of the local market and the borrowers\u2019 operations.\nNew lines of business or new products and services may subject us to additional risks. A failure to successfully manage these risks may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFrom time to time and in accordance with our Strategic Plan, we plan to implement new lines of business and offer new products and services within existing lines of business. There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts. In developing and marketing new lines of business and/or new products and services, we will invest significant time and resources. Initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business and/or new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible. External factors, such as compliance with regulations, competitive alternatives, and shifting market preferences, may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business or a new product or service. Furthermore, any new line of business and/or new product or service could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of our system of internal controls. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business or new products or services could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur net interest margin may contract further in the current interest rate environment and changes in interest rates could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe current protracted low interest rate environment has resulted in a continued trend of net interest margin compression. During this period of low market interest rates, elevated levels of prepayments and refinancings have resulted in a decrease in the yields earned on our interest-earning assets while our interest-bearing liabilities are repricing at a slower rate and include borrowings that are not expected to reprice in the near-term. In addition, we have maintained elevated levels of short-term liquid assets due primarily to the reinvestment of cash flows from repayments and sales of mortgage-related assets reflecting our low appetite for adding long term mortgage assets to our balance sheet in the current low interest rate environment. As a result, we experienced declines in net interest income in each quarter of 2014. We expect net interest income to continue to decline in the current environment.\nThe Federal Open Market Committee of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the \u201cFOMC\u201d) noted that economic activity has improved in recent months. The FOMC noted that labor market indicators were mixed but on balance showed further improvement. However, the unemployment rate was little changed during the fourth quarter and a range of labor market indicators suggests that there remains significant underutilization of labor resources. Household spending appears to be rising moderately and business fixed investment is advancing, while the recovery in the housing sector slowed somewhat. The national unemployment rate decreased to 5.6% in December 2014 from 6.7% in December 2013 and from 5.9% in September 2014. The FOMC decided to maintain the overnight lending target rate at zero to 0.25% during the fourth quarter of 2014.\nThe FOMC is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction. The FOMC believes this policy of keeping holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels should help maintain accommodative financial conditions.\nWe expect that the actions of the FOMC will place additional downward pressure on our net interest margin as our interest-earning assets continue to re-price to lower levels, primarily as a result of elevated levels of prepayments, and as we continue to experience a lack of attractive reinvestment opportunities due to low market interest rates.\nWe are required to comply with the terms of the Company MOU that we have entered into with the FRB, and lack of compliance could result in additional regulatory enforcement actions.\nThe Company entered into the Company MOU with the FRB on April 24, 2012 which is substantially similar to and replaced the MOU the Company entered into with our former regulator, the OTS, on June 24, 2011. In accordance with the Company MOU, the Company is required to: (a) obtain written approval from the FRB prior to receiving a capital distribution from the Bank or declaring a dividend to\nshareholders and (b) obtain approval from the FRB prior to repurchasing or redeeming any Company stock or incurring any debt with a maturity of greater than one year. Under the Company MOU the Company was required to submit a comprehensive Capital Plan and a comprehensive Earnings Plan to the FRB. The Company MOU was entered into following the Bank\u2019s entry into the Bank MOU. The Bank MOU was terminated by the OCC on February 26, 2015.\nWhile the Company believes it is in compliance in all material respects with the terms of the Company MOU, a finding by the FRB that the Company failed to comply with the Company MOU could result in additional regulatory scrutiny, constraints on our business, or formal enforcement action. Any of those events could have a material adverse effect on our future operations, financial condition, growth or other aspects of our business.\nAs a result of the Reform Act and recent rulemaking, we will become subject to more stringent capital requirements.\nPursuant to the Reform Act, in July 2013, the Agencies adopted the Final Rules to update the Agencies\u2019 general risk-based capital and leverage capital requirements to incorporate agreements reflected in Basel III as well as the requirements of the Reform Act. Among other things, the Final Capital Rules establish a new minimum common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4.5% and increase the minimum Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio from 4.0% to 6.0%. In addition, the Final Capital Rules add a requirement to maintain a minimum Conservation Buffer, composed of common equity Tier 1 capital, of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets and provide that the failure to maintain the Conservation Buffer will result in restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary cash bonus payments to executive officers. The Final Capital Rules also subjected many savings and loan holding companies, such as Hudson City Bancorp, to consolidated capital requirements. The Final Capital Rules are described in more detail in \u201cRegulation of Hudson City Savings Bank and Hudson City Bancorp\u201d above.\nThe new minimum regulatory capital ratios under the Final Capital Rules became effective for Hudson City Bancorp and Hudson City Savings on January 1, 2015. The failure to meet the established capital requirements could result in the Agencies placing limitations or conditions on our activities or restricting the commencement of new activities, and such failure could subject us to a variety of enforcement remedies available to the federal regulatory authorities, including limiting our ability to pay dividends; issuing a directive to increase our capital; and terminating our FDIC deposit insurance.\nWe are subject to regulatory requirements and limitations that may impact our ability to pay future dividends.\nWe are a unitary savings and loan association holding company regulated by the FRB and almost all of our operating assets are owned by Hudson City Savings Bank. We rely primarily on dividends from the Bank to pay cash dividends to our shareholders and to engage in share repurchase programs. The OCC regulates all capital distributions by the Bank directly or indirectly to us, including dividend payments. As the subsidiary of a savings and loan association holding company, the Bank must file a notice or seek affirmative approval from the OCC at least 30 days prior to each proposed capital distribution. Whether an application is required is based on a number of factors including whether the institution qualifies for expedited treatment under the OCC rules and regulations or if the total amount of all capital distributions (including each proposed capital distribution) for the applicable calendar year exceeds net income for that year to date plus the retained net income for the preceding two years. Currently, Hudson City Savings must seek approval from the OCC for future capital distributions. In addition, as the subsidiary of a savings and loan holding company, Hudson City Savings must also seek approval from the FRB before declaring a dividend.\nIn addition, the Bank may not pay dividends to us if, after paying those dividends, it would fail to meet the required minimum levels under risk-based capital guidelines and the minimum leverage and tangible capital ratio requirements or the OCC has notified the Bank that it is in need of more than normal supervision. Under the prompt corrective action provisions of the FDIA, an insured depository institution such as the Bank is prohibited from making a capital distribution, including the payment of dividends, if, after making such distribution, the institution would become \u201cundercapitalized\u201d (as such term is used in the FDIA). Payment of dividends\nby the Bank also may be restricted at any time at the discretion of the appropriate regulator if it deems the payment to constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Bank will be able to pay dividends at past levels, or at all, in the future.\nIn addition to regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends, the Bank is subject to certain restrictions imposed by federal law on any extensions of credit it makes to its affiliates and on investments in stock or other securities of its affiliates. We are considered an affiliate of the Bank. These restrictions prevent affiliates of the Bank, including us, from borrowing from the Bank, unless various types of collateral secure the loans. Federal law limits the aggregate amount of loans to and investments in any single affiliate to 10% of the Bank\u2019s capital stock and surplus and also limits the aggregate amount of loans to and investments in all affiliates to 20% of the Bank\u2019s capital stock and surplus.\nIf we do not receive sufficient cash dividends or are unable to borrow from the Bank, then we may not have sufficient funds to pay dividends or repurchase our common stock.\nPursuant to the terms of the Company MOU, we are required to seek approval from the FRB at least 30 days prior to declaring any future cash dividend. Each dividend request submitted to the FRB must evidence our compliance with applicable guidance regarding payment of dividends issued by the FRB. This process will enable the FRB to comment on, object to or otherwise prohibit us from paying the proposed dividend. The supervisory guidance issued by the FRB states that we should either eliminate, defer or significantly reduce dividends if (i) our net income available to common shareholders over the past year is insufficient to fully fund a dividend, (ii) our prospective rate of earnings retention is not consistent with our capital needs and our overall current or prospective financial condition or (iii) we will not meet, or are in danger of not meeting, our minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios.\nThe geographic concentration of our loan portfolio and lending activities makes us vulnerable to a downturn in the economy.\nOriginating loans secured by residential real estate is our primary business. Our financial results may be adversely affected by changes in prevailing economic conditions, either nationally or in our local New Jersey and metropolitan New York market areas, including the level of short-term and long-term interest rates, decreases in real estate values, adverse employment conditions, the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal and state government, the strength of the economy in the United States generally and in the Company\u2019s market area in particular, and other significant external events. As a result of our lending practices, we have a concentration of loans secured by real property located primarily in New Jersey, New York and Connecticut. At December 31, 2014, approximately 98.6% of our total loans are residential first mortgage loans and approximately 84.8% of our total loans are in the New York metropolitan area.\nThe value of real estate used as collateral for our loans could result in higher loss experience on our non-performing loans. Adverse changes in the economy, particularly in employment conditions, may also have a negative effect on the ability of our borrowers to make timely repayments of their loans, which would have an adverse impact on our earnings. As a result of the concentration of loans in the New York metropolitan area, a downturn in the local economy could result in an increase in nonperforming loans, which would negatively affect the Company\u2019s interest income and result in higher provisions for loan losses, which would hurt the Company\u2019s earnings. If poor economic conditions result in decreased demand for real estate loans, our profits may decrease because our investment alternatives may earn less income for us than real estate loans.\nNon-performing assets take significant time to resolve and adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nNon-performing assets adversely affect the Company\u2019s net earnings in various ways. The Company generally does not record interest income on non-performing loans or other real estate owned, thereby reducing its earnings, while its loan administration costs are higher for non-performing loans. When the Company takes collateral in foreclosures and similar proceedings, the Company is required to mark the related asset to the lower of the fair value of the collateral at the carrying amount of the loan, which may ultimately result in a loss. Until the recent recessionary cycle, it was our experience that as a non-performing loan approached foreclosure, the borrower sold the underlying property or, if there was a second mortgage or other subordinated lien, the subordinated lien holder would purchase the property to protect their interest thereby resulting in the full payment of principal and interest to Hudson City Savings. This process normally took approximately 12 months. However, due to the unprecedented level of foreclosures and the desire by many states to slow the foreclosure process, we are now experiencing a time frame to repayment or foreclosure of up to 48 months from the initial non-performing period. Given the delays in foreclosures in our market area, the level of our non-performing assets is expected to remain at elevated levels. At December 31, 2014 our non-performing loans amounted to $852.0 million or 3.95% of total loans as compared to $1.05 billion or 4.35% of total loans at December 31, 2013 and our charge-offs, net of recoveries, amounted to $37.3 million for 2014 as compared to $62.8 million in 2013. There can be no assurance that the Company will not experience future increases in non-performing assets.\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry, which limits the manner and scope of our business activities.\nWe are subject to extensive supervision, regulation and examination by the FRB, the OCC, the CFPB and the FDIC. As a result, we are limited in the manner in which we conduct our business, undertake new investments and activities and obtain financing. This regulatory structure is designed primarily for the protection of the deposit insurance funds and our depositors, as well as other consumers, and not to benefit our shareholders. This regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to capital levels, the timing and amount of dividend payments, the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes. In addition, we must comply with significant anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism laws, fair lending and consumer protection laws and the Community Reinvestment Act. As a result of the recent financial crisis which occurred in the banking and financial markets, the overall bank regulatory climate is now marked by caution, conservatism and a renewed focus on compliance and risk management.\nOur failure to comply with applicable regulations, or the failure to develop, implement and comply with corrective action plans to address any identified areas of noncompliance, may result in the assessment of fines and penalties and the commencement of informal or formal regulatory enforcement actions against us. Other negative consequences also can result from such failure, including regulatory restrictions on our activities, reputational damage, restrictions on the ability of institutional investment managers to invest in our securities and increases in our costs of doing business. Increases in our costs of doing business may include increased salaries and benefits expenses associated with hiring additional employees, incurring fees and expenses for outside services, such as consulting and legal advice, and costs associated with enhancing, or acquiring systems and technological infrastructure to strengthen our regulatory compliance program. The occurrence of one or more of these events may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe occurrence of any failure, breach, or interruption in service involving our systems or those of our service providers, including as a result of a cyberattack, could damage our reputation, cause losses, increase our expenses, and result in a loss of customers, an increase in regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and possibly financial liability, any of which could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, and the market price of our stock.\nCommunications and information systems are essential to the conduct of our business, as we use such systems to manage our customer relationships, our general ledger, our deposits and our loans. In the normal course of our business, we collect, process, retain and transmit (by email and other electronic means) sensitive and confidential information regarding our customers, employees and others. We also outsource certain aspects of our data processing to certain third party providers. In addition to confidential information regarding our customers, employees and others, we, and in some cases a third party, compile, process, transmit and store proprietary, non-public information concerning our business, operations, plans and strategies.\nAs a result, our business and operations depend on the secure processing, storage, and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks and those of our third party service providers. Although we devote significant resources and management focus to ensuring the integrity of our systems through information security measures and business continuity programs, our facilities, computer systems, software, and networks, and those of our third party service providers, may be vulnerable to external or internal security breaches, acts of vandalism, unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses or other malicious code and cyberattacks that could have a security impact. In addition, breaches of security may occur through intentional or unintentional acts by those having authorized or unauthorized access to our confidential or other information or the confidential or other information of our customers, clients or counterparties. While we regularly conduct security assessments on our third party service providers, there can be no assurance that their information security protocols are sufficient to withstand a cyberattack or other security breach.\nInformation security risks for financial institutions like us have increased recently in part because of new technologies, the use of the Internet and telecommunications technologies (including mobile devices) to conduct financial and other business transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, perpetrators of fraud, hackers, terrorists and others. In addition to cyber-attacks or other security breaches involving the theft of sensitive and confidential information, hackers recently have engaged in attacks against large financial institutions, particularly denial of service attacks that are designed to disrupt key business services, such as customer-facing web sites. We are not able to anticipate or implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types, especially because the techniques used change frequently and because attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources.\nWe use a variety of physical, procedural and technological safeguards to prevent or limit the impact of systems failures, interruptions and security breaches to protect confidential information from mishandling, misuse or loss, including detection and response mechanisms designed to contain and mitigate security incidents. However, there can be no assurance that such events will not occur or that they will be promptly detected and adequately addressed if they do and early detection of security breaches may be thwarted by sophisticated attacks and malware designed to avoid detection. If there is a failure in or breach of our computer systems or networks, or those of a third party service provider, the confidential and other information processed and stored in, and transmitted through, such computer systems and networks could potentially be jeopardized, or could otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations or the operations of our customers, clients or counterparties.\nThe occurrence of any of the foregoing could subject us to litigation or regulatory scrutiny, cause us significant reputational damage or erode confidence in the security of our systems, products and services, cause us to lose customers or have greater difficulty in attracting new customers, have an adverse effect on the value of our common stock or subject us to financial losses that are either not insured or not fully covered by insurance, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nFurthermore, as information security risks and cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to further enhance or modify our information security measures and/or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities or other exposures arising from operational and security risks.", "PERMNO": 87070, "SIC": 6035, "TIC": "HCBK"}
