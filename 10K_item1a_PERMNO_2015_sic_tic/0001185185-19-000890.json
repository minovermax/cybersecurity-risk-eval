{"cik": "1326205", "company": "India Globalization Capital, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-06-14", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the following risk factors, together with all other information included in this report in evaluating our company and our common stock. If any of the following risks and uncertainties develops into actual events, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In that case, the trading price of our common stock and other securities also could be adversely affected. We make various statements in this section, which constitute \u201cforward-looking statements.\u201d See \u201cForward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nRisks Related to Our Business and Expansion Strategy\nOur cannabinoid strategy makes it difficult to find, retain, and attract management.\nThe environment we work in is heavily regulated, and while we have experience in regulated industries, it is also heavily scrutinized. This regulatory scrutiny takes a toll on management and makes it very difficult to attract and retain talent. Management spends a great deal of time and money explaining and justifying actions, strategy, and business plans to regulators. A myriad of complex factors including regulations regarding money laundering, inter-state commerce, DOJ, FDA, NYSE, SEC, state laws, among others, affect every decision. Navigating this complex set of regulatory landmines and staying focused on generating shareholder value is an arduous task and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in steering clear of all the potential issues, any of which could adversely impact the stock price or lead to delisting from the NYSE American.\nOur cannabinoid strategy makes it difficult to raise money as a public company.\nOur Plant and Cannabinoid Business is based on: a) R&D on cannabinoids; b) medical trials on the efficacy of cannabinoids; c) licensing our intellectual property; and d) growing, processing and distributing hemp. Despite having no direct involvement in selling any controlled substances, the Company is often considered a \u201ccannabis company\u201d with all the nuances that accompany that label, including being blacklisted by banks, investments banks, and by the largest clearing services company. Due to the near-monopoly nature of some of these institutions such as clearing houses, it makes it very difficult for the Company to raise money, deposit share certificates, or even have investment banking relationships. As we cannot control how others perceive us, there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise enough capital for our planned expansion.\nWe have a history of operating losses and there can be no assurance that we can again achieve or maintain profitability.\nOur short-term focus is to gain market share for our Plant and Cannabinoid Business. However, we have had a history of operating losses. For Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018, we had a net loss of almost $4.1 million and $1.8 million, respectively. Accordingly, there can be no guarantee that our efforts will be successful. If we continue to have losses, we will be required to seek additional financing. No assurance can be given the we can raise any such financing and such financing could be dilutive to our shareholders.\nWe expect to acquire companies and we are subject to evolving and often expensive corporate governance regulations and requirements. Our failure to adequately adhere to these requirements, and comply with them with regard to acquired companies, some of which may be non-reporting entities, or the failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures could seriously harm our business and affect our status as a reporting company listed on a national securities exchange.\nAs a public reporting company whose shares are listed for trading on the NYSE American, we are subject to various regulations. Compliance with these evolving regulations is costly and requires a significant diversion of management time and attention, particularly with regard to our disclosure on controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting. As we have made and continue to make acquisitions in foreign countries, our internal controls and procedures may not be able to prevent errors or fraud in the future. We cannot guarantee that we can establish internal controls over financial reporting immediately on companies that we acquire. Thus, faulty judgments, simple errors or mistakes, or the failure of our personnel to enforce controls over acquired companies or to adhere to established controls and procedures, may make it difficult for us to ensure that the objectives of our control systems are met. A failure of our controls and procedures to detect other than inconsequential errors or fraud could seriously harm our ability to continue as a reporting company listed on a national securities exchange.\nWe may engage in strategic transactions that could impact our liquidity, increase our expenses and present significant distractions to our management, and which ultimately may not be successful.\nFrom time to time we may consider strategic transactions, such as acquisitions of companies, asset purchases and out-licensing or in-licensing of products, product candidates, or technologies, particularly those arrangements that seek to leverage other organizations\u2019 internal platforms or competencies for the benefit of our products or potential products. Additional potential transactions that we may consider include a variety of different business arrangements, including spin-offs, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, restructurings, divestitures, business combinations and investments. Any such transaction may require us to incur non-recurring or other charges, may increase our near and long-term expenditures and may pose significant integration challenges or disrupt our management or business, which could adversely affect our operations and financial results. For example, these transactions may entail numerous operational and financial risks, including:\n\u2022 exposure to unknown or unanticipated liabilities, including foreign laws with which we are unfamiliar;\n\u2022 disruption of our business and diversion of our management\u2019s time and attention in order to develop acquired products, product candidates or technologies;\n\u2022 incurrence of substantial debt or dilutive issuances of equity securities to pay for acquisitions, which we may not be able to obtain on favorable terms, if at all;\n\u2022 higher than expected acquisition and integration costs;\n\u2022 write-downs of assets or goodwill or impairment charges;\n\u2022 increased amortization expenses;\n\u2022 difficulty and cost in combining the operations and personnel of any acquired businesses with our operations and personnel;\n\u2022 entering into a long-term relationship with a partner that proves to be unreliable or counterproductive;\n\u2022 impairment of relationships with key suppliers or customers of any acquired businesses due to changes in management and ownership; and\n\u2022 inability to retain key employees of any acquired businesses. Accordingly, although there can be no assurance that we will undertake or successfully complete any transactions of the nature described above, any transactions that we do complete could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects if we are unable to execute on the planned objectives or capitalize on the relationship in the manner that was originally contemplated.\nWe have a limited senior management team size that may hamper our ability to effectively manage a publicly traded company and manage acquisitions and that may harm our business.\nSince we operate in several foreign countries, we use consultants, including lawyers and accountants, to help us comply with regulatory requirements and public company compliance on a timely basis. As we expand, we expect to increase the size of our senior management. However, we cannot guarantee that in the interim period our senior management can adequately manage the requirements of a public company and the integration of acquisitions, and any failure to do so could lead to the imposition of fines, penalties, harm our business, status as a reporting company and/or our listing on the NYSE American.\nThere is a high rate of failure for drug candidates proceeding through clinical trials.\nGenerally, there is a high rate of failure for drug candidates proceeding through clinical trials. We may suffer significant setbacks in our clinical trials similar to the experience of a number of other companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. Further, even if we view the results of a clinical trial to be positive, the FDA or other regulatory authorities may disagree with our interpretation of the data. In the event that we obtain negative results from clinical trials for product candidates or other problems related to potential chemistry, manufacturing and control issues or other hurdles occur and our product candidates are not approved, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue or obtain financing to continue our operations, our ability to execute on our current business plan may be materially impaired, and/or our reputation in the industry and in the investment community might be significantly damaged. In addition, our inability to properly design, commence and complete clinical trials may negatively impact the timing and results of our clinical trials and ability to seek approvals for our drug candidates.\nWe may fail to expand our growing and manufacturing capability in time to meet market demand for our products and product candidates, and the FDA may refuse to accept our facilities or those of our contract manufactures as being suitable for the production of our products and product candidates. Any problems in our growing or manufacturing process could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, before we can begin commercial manufacture of any medicinal product candidates for sale in the U.S., we must obtain FDA regulatory approval for the product, which requires a successful FDA inspection of the manufacturing facilities, which includes the facilities of the processor(s) and quality systems in addition to other product-related approvals. Due to the complexity of the processes used to manufacture our product candidates, we may be unable to initially, or continue to, pass federal, state or international regulatory inspections in a cost-effective manner. If we are unable to comply with manufacturing regulations, we may be subject to fines, unanticipated compliance expenses, recall or seizure of any approved products, total or partial suspension of production and/or enforcement actions, including injunctions, and criminal or civil prosecution. These possible sanctions would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nLegal claims could be filed that may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. We may in the future face risks of litigation and liability claims, the extent of such exposure can be difficult or impossible to estimate and which can negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations are subject to numerous U.S., Indian and Hong Kong laws and regulations relating to the protection of the public and necessary disclosures in regard to financial services. Liability under these laws involves inherent uncertainties. Violations of financial regulation laws are subject to civil, and, in some cases, criminal sanctions. Although we are not aware of any compliance related issues, we may not have been, or may not be, at all times, in complete compliance with all requirements, and we may incur costs or liabilities in connection with such requirements. We may also incur unexpected interruptions to our operations, administrative injunctions requiring operation stoppages, fines and other penalties, which could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. As of March 31, 2019, the Company and several of its officers and directors are parties to four (4) shareholder lawsuits. See Item 3, Legal Proceedings of this report for further information. There can also be no assurance that any insurance coverage we take will be adequate or that we will prevail in any future cases. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to obtain liability insurance that would protect us from any such lawsuits. In the event that are not covered by insurance, our management could expend significant time and resources addressing any such issues. And, the legal fees necessary to defend against multiple lawsuits can be significant, impacting the Company\u2019s overall bottom line when not covered by insurance or where the fees exceed the Company\u2019s insurance policy limits.\nContinued listing on the NYSE is an operating risk for the Company.\nAs previously disclosed, on October 29, 2018, NYSE suspended trading of the Company\u2019s common stock and commenced proceedings to delist the Company\u2019s stock from trading on the Exchange. After a successful appeal, the Company\u2019s stock was relisted for trading on the NYSE American on February 26, 2019. However, given the current regulatory environment for hemp-based products, there remains risk with respect to the Company\u2019s ability to maintain its listing with the NYSE. This risk may limit the Company\u2019s ability to pursue other business opportunities.\nOur expansion is dependent on laws and regulations pertaining to hemp and cannabinoids.\nWe expect to acquire companies and hire management in the areas that we have identified. These include, among others, biopharmaceuticals, with a focus on capitalizing on specific niches within these areas such as cannabinoid-based therapies. Entry into any of these areas requires special knowledge of the industry and products. In the event that we are perceived to be entering the legal marijuana sector, even indirectly or remotely, we could be subject to increased scrutiny by regulators because, among other things, marijuana is a Schedule-1 controlled substance and is illegal under federal law. Our failure to adequately manage the risk associated with these businesses and adequately manage the requirements of the regulators can adversely affect our business, our status as a reporting company and our listing on the NYSE American. Further, any adverse pronouncements from regulators about businesses related to the legal cannabis industry, or the hemp industry could adversely affect our stock price.\nOur company is in a very new and highly regulated industry. Significant and unforeseen changes in policy may have material impacts on our business.\nContinued development in the phytocannabinoids industry is dependent upon continued state legislative authorization of cannabinoids as well as legislation and regulatory policy at the federal level. The federal Controlled Substances Act currently makes cannabinoids use and possession illegal on a national level. While there may be ample public support for legislative authorization, numerous factors impact the legislative process. Any one of these factors could slow or halt use and handling of cannabinoids in the U.S. or in other jurisdictions, which would negatively impact our development of phytocannabinoid-based therapies and our ability to test and productize these therapies.\nMany U.S. state laws are in conflict with the federal Controlled Substances Act. While we do not, and we do not intend, to distribute or sell marijuana in the U.S., it is unclear whether regulatory authorities in the U.S. would object to the registration or public offering of securities in the U.S. by our company, to the status of our company as a reporting company, or even to investors investing in our company, if we engage in legal cannabinoids cultivation and supply pursuant to the laws and authorization of the jurisdiction where the activity takes place. In addition, the status of cannabinoids under the Controlled Substances Act may have an adverse effect on federal agency approval of pharmaceutical use of phytocannabinoid products. Any such objection or interference could delay indefinitely or increase substantially the costs to access the equity capital markets, test our therapies, or create products from these plant and cannabinoid-based therapies.\nOur business is dependent on continuing relationships with clients and strategic partners.\nOur business requires developing and maintaining strategic alliances with contractors that undertake turnkey contracts for infrastructure development projects and with government organizations. The business and our results could be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain continuing relationships and pre-qualified status with key clients and strategic partners.\nOur product candidates may be unable to achieve the expected market acceptance and, consequently, limit our ability to generate revenue from new products.\nEven when product development is successful and regulatory approval has been obtained, our ability to generate sufficient revenue depends on the acceptance of our products by customers. We cannot assure you that Hyalolex\u2122 and other products will achieve the expected level of market acceptance and revenue. The market acceptance of any product depends on a number of factors such as, the price of the product, the effect of the product, the taste of the product, reputation of the Company, competition, and marketing and distribution support.\nThe success and acceptance of a product in one state may not be replicated in other states or may be negatively affected by our activities in another state. Any factors preventing or limiting the market acceptance of our products could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nBusiness interruptions could delay us in the process of developing our product candidates and could disrupt our product sales.\nLoss of our manufacturing facilities, our growing plants, stored inventory or laboratory facilities through fire, theft, natural disasters or other causes, or loss of our botanical raw material due to pathogenic infection or other causes, could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet demand for cannabinoid products or to continue product development activities and to conduct our business. Failure to supply our partners with commercial product may lead to adverse consequences.\nCounterfeit versions of our products could harm our business.\nCounterfeiting activities and the presence of counterfeit products in market and over the internet continue to be a challenge for maintaining a safe product supply. Counterfeit products are frequently unsafe or ineffective, and can be life-threatening. To distributors and users, counterfeit products may be visually indistinguishable from the authentic version. Reports of adverse reactions to counterfeit drugs along with increased levels of counterfeiting could be mistakenly attributed to the authentic product, affect consumer confidence in the authentic product and harm the business of companies such as ours. If our products were to be the subject of counterfeits, we could incur reputational and financial harm.\nWe face intense competition, including from generic products. If our competitors\u2019 market or develop alternative products that are approved more quickly or marketed more effectively than our product candidates or are demonstrated to be safer or more effective than our products, our commercial opportunities will be reduced or eliminated.\nThe plant and cannabinoid products industry is characterized by advancing technology, competition and a strong emphasis on developing proprietary products. We face competition from a number of sources, some of which may target the same indications as our products or product candidates, such as pharmaceutical companies, including generic drug companies, biotechnology companies, drug delivery companies, and academic and research institutions, many of which have greater financial resources, marketing capabilities, including well-established sales forces, manufacturing capabilities, research and development capabilities, experience in obtaining regulatory approvals for product candidates and other resources than us.\nWe may not be able to differentiate any products that we may market from those of our competitors, successfully develop or introduce new products that are less costly or offer better performance than those of our competitors, or offer purchasers of our products payment and other commercial terms as favorable as those offered by our competitors. In addition, there are a number of established products already commercially available and under development by other companies that treat the indications that our product candidates are intended to treat.\nCurrency fluctuations may reduce our assets and profitability.\nWe have assets located in foreign countries that are valued in foreign currencies. Fluctuation of the U.S. dollar relative to the foreign currency may adversely affect our assets and profit.\nOur business relies heavily on our management team and any unexpected loss of key officers may adversely affect our operations.\nThe continued success of our business is largely dependent on the continued services of our key employees. The loss of the services of certain key personnel, without adequate replacement, could have an adverse effect on our performance. Our senior management, as well as the senior management of our subsidiaries, plays a significant role in developing and executing the overall business plan, maintaining client relationships, proprietary processes and technology. While no one is irreplaceable, the loss of the services of any would be disruptive to our business.\nOur quarterly revenue, operating results and profitability will vary.\nFactors that may contribute to the variability of quarterly revenue, operating results or profitability include:\n\u2022 Fluctuations in revenue due to seasonality of the marketplace, which results in uneven revenue and operating results over the year;\n\u2022 Additions and departures of key personnel; and\n\u2022 Strategic decisions made by us and our competitors, such as acquisitions, divestitures, spin-offs, joint ventures, strategic investments and changes in business strategy.\nWe may not successfully register the provisional patents with the USPTO.\nWe have filed ten provisional patents with the USPTO, in the combination therapy space, for the indications of pain, medical refractory epilepsy, eating disorders, and cachexia as part of our intellectual property strategy focused on the phytocannabinoid-based health care industry. Although, one patent has been issued, there is no guarantee that our remaining applications will result in a successful registration with the USPTO. If we are unsuccessful in registering patents, our ability to create a valuable line of products can be adversely affected. This in turn may have a material and adverse impact on the trading price of our common stock.\nWe may be unable to protect our intellectual property rights and/or intellectual property rights licensed to us, and may be subject to intellectual property litigation and infringement claims by third parties.\nWe intend to protect our intellectual property through limited patents and our unpatented trade secrets and know-how through confidentiality or license agreements with third parties, employees and consultants, and by controlling access to and distribution of our proprietary information. However, this method may not afford complete protection, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the U.S. and unauthorized parties may copy or otherwise obtain and use our products, processes or technology. Additionally, there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop similar know-how and trade secrets. We are also dependent upon the owners of intellectual property rights licensed to us under various wholesale license agreements to protect and defend those rights against third party claims. If third parties take actions that affect our rights, the value of our intellectual property, similar proprietary rights or reputation or the licensors who have granted us certain rights under wholesale license agreements, or we are unable to protect the intellectual property from infringement or misappropriation, other companies may be able to offer competitive products at lower prices, and we may not be able to effectively compete against these companies. We also face the risk of claims that we have infringed third parties\u2019 intellectual property rights. Any claims of intellectual property infringement, even those without merit, may require us to:\n\u25cf defend against infringement claims which are expensive and time consuming;\n\u25cf cease making, licensing or using, either temporarily or permanently, products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property;\n\u25cf re-design, re-engineer or re-brand our products or packaging; or\n\u25cf enter into royalty or licensing agreements in order to obtain the right to use a third party\u2019s intellectual property.\nIn the event of claims by third parties for infringement of intellectual property rights we license from third parties under wholesale license agreements, we could be liable for costs of defending allegations of infringement, and there are no assurances the licensors will either adequately defend the licensed intellectual property rights or that they would prevail in the related litigation. In that event, we would incur additional costs and may deprived from generating royalties from these agreements.\nWe may face risks relating to health care privacy and security laws.\nWe may be subject to various privacy and security regulations, including but not limited to HIPAA, as amended by HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, including the related final published omnibus rule. HIPAA mandates, among other things, the adoption of uniform standards for the electronic exchange of information in common health care transactions, as well as standards relating to the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information. These obligations would require the Company to adopt administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to protect such information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA\u2019s privacy and security standards directly applicable to \u201cbusiness associates\u201d - independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney\u2019s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, some of which are more stringent then HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thereby complicating compliance efforts. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil and criminal penalties.\nSome of our lines of business will rely on third-party service providers to host and deliver services and data, and any interruptions or delays in these hosted services, security or privacy breaches, including cybersecurity attacks, or failures in data collection could expose us to liability claims, increased costs, reduced revenue, and harm our business and reputation.\nOur lines of business and services, but especially our development of cannabinoids-based combination therapies for products, including Hyalolex\u2122, and other products for PD, chronic pain, post-traumatic stress disorder, and eating disorders, and our long-term use and/or development of blockchain technologies to solve critical issues facing the Cannabinoids industry, rely on services hosted and controlled directly by our suppliers and distributors and their third-party service providers. We do not have redundancy for all of our systems; many of our critical applications reside in only one of our data centers, and our disaster recovery planning may not account for all eventualities. These facts could cause reputational harm, loss of customers, or loss of future business, thereby reducing our revenue.\nOur suppliers and distributors and their third-party service providers hold customer data, some of which is hosted in third-party facilities. A security incident or cybersecurity attack at those facilities or ours may compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of customer data. We have a cybersecurity policy in place, however, unauthorized access to customer data stored on our computers or networks may be obtained through break-ins, breaches of our secure network by an unauthorized party, employee theft or misuse, or other misconduct. It is also possible that unauthorized access to customer data may be obtained through inadequate use of security controls by customers. Accounts created with weak passwords could allow cyber-attackers to gain access to customer data. If there were an inadvertent disclosure of customer information, or if a third party were to gain unauthorized access to the information we possess on behalf of our customers, our operations could be disrupted, our reputation could be damaged, and we could be subject to claims or other liabilities. In addition, such perceived or actual unauthorized disclosure of the information we collect, or breach of our security could damage our reputation, result in the loss of customers, and harm our business.\nHardware or software failures or errors in our systems or those of our suppliers and distributors or their third-party service providers, could result in data loss or corruption, cause the information that we collect to be incomplete or contain inaccuracies that our customers regard as significant, or cause us to fail to meet committed service levels. Furthermore, our ability to collect and report data may be delayed or interrupted by several factors, including access to the Internet, the failure of our network or software systems or security breaches. In addition, computer viruses or other malware may harm our systems, causing us to lose data, and the transmission of computer viruses or other malware could expose us to litigation. We may also find, on occasion, that we cannot deliver data and reports in near real time because of several factors, including failures of our network or software. If we supply inaccurate information or experience interruptions in our ability to capture, store and supply information in near real time or at all, our reputation could be harmed, we could lose customers, or we could be found liable for damages or incur other losses.\nAll of our data, except accounting data, is stored in the cloud on multiple servers that helps us mitigate the overall risk of losing data. We have a cybersecurity policy in place and are in the process of implementing tighter cybersecurity measures to safeguard against hackers. Complying with these security measures and compliances would incur further costs.\nThe states in which we and our distributers and suppliers and their service providers operate require that we maintain certain information about our customers and transactions. If we fail to maintain such information, we could be in violation of state laws. Laws and regulations relating to the handling of personal data may impede the adoption of our services or result in increased costs, legal claims, fines against us, or reputational damage.\nRisks Related to ownership of our common stock\nOur accounting personnel may make unintentional errors.\nGiven our small size and foreign operations, a small unrectified mistake in the preparation of financial statements and the maintenance of our books and records in accordance with U.S. GAAP and SEC rules and regulations may constitute a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting. For more information, please see Item 9A, \u201cControls and Procedures.\u201d\nFuture sales of common stock by us could cause our stock price to decline and dilute your ownership in our company.\nThe Company has 11,672,178 outstanding public warrants (IGC: IW) to purchase 1,167,217 shares of common stock by surrendering 10 warrants and a payment of $5.00 in exchange for each share of common stock. We have 91,472 units outstanding that can be separated into common stock and warrants. Ten units may be separated into one share of common stock and 20 warrants (IGC: IW). The unit holders are requested to contact the Company or our transfer agent, Continental Stock Transfer & Trust, to separate their units into common stock and warrants. The warrants expire on March 8, 2021. We also have outstanding options to purchase 270,000 shares, expiring between calendar years 2022 and 2024 with a weighted average exercise price of $0.45 per share. We are not restricted from issuing additional shares of our common stock or preferred stock, including any securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, common stock or preferred stock or any substantially similar securities. The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock by us in the market or the perception that such sales could occur. If we raise funds by issuing additional securities in the future or the outstanding warrants or stock options to purchase our common stock are exercised, the newly-issued shares will also dilute your percentage ownership in our company.\nThe market price for our common stock may be volatile.\nThe trading volume in our common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur. Fluctuations in our stock price may not be correlated in a predictable way to our performance or operating results. Our stock price may fluctuate as a result of a number of events and factors such as those described elsewhere in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, events described in this report, and other factors that are beyond our control. In addition, the stock market, in general, has historically experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. Our common stock has also been volatile, with our 52-week price range being at a low of $0.25 and a high of $14.58 per share. These fluctuations are often unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may cause declines in the market price of our common stock. In addition, it is possible, given our current trading price, that we may fail to comply with the minimum trading price required to trade our shares on the NYSE American.\nOur publicly-filed reports are subject to review by the SEC, and any significant changes or amendments required as a result of any such review may result in material liability to us and may have a material adverse impact on the trading price of our common stock.\nThe reports of publicly-traded companies are subject to review by the SEC from time to time for the purpose of assisting companies in complying with applicable disclosure requirements, and the SEC is required to undertake a comprehensive review of a company\u2019s reports at least once every three years under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. SEC reviews may be initiated at any time. We could be required to modify, amend, or reformulate information contained in prior filings as a result of an SEC review, as well as state in filings that we have inadequate control or expertise over financial reporting. Any modification, amendment, or reformulation of information contained in such reports could be significant and result in material liability to us and have a material and adverse impact on the trading price of our common stock\nWe do not anticipate declaring any cash dividends on our common stock.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not plan to pay any cash dividends in the near future. Our current policy is to retain all funds and earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business.\nMaryland anti-takeover provisions and certain anti-takeover effects of our Charter and Bylaws may inhibit a takeover at a premium price that may be beneficial to our stockholders.\nMaryland anti-takeover provisions and certain anti-takeover effects of our charter and bylaws may be utilized, under some circumstances, as a method of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change of control of our company at a premium price that would be beneficial to our stockholders. For more detailed information about these provisions, please see \u201cAnti-takeover Law, Limitations of Liability and Indemnification\u201d as follows:\nBusiness Combinations\nUnder the Maryland General Corporation Law, some business combinations, including a merger, consolidation, share exchange or, in some circumstances, an asset transfer or issuance or reclassification of equity securities, are prohibited for a period of time and require an extraordinary vote. These transactions include those between a Maryland corporation and the following persons (a \u201cSpecified Person\u201d):\n\u2022 an interested stockholder, which is defined as any person (other than a subsidiary) who beneficially owns 10% or more of the corporation\u2019s voting stock, or who is an affiliate or an associate of the corporation who, at any time within a two-year period prior to the transaction, was the beneficial owner of 10% or more of the voting power of the corporation\u2019s voting stock; or an affiliate of an interested stockholder.\nA person is not an interested stockholder if the board of directors approved in advance the transaction by which the person otherwise would have become an interested stockholder. The board of directors of a Maryland corporation also may exempt a person from these business combination restrictions prior to the time the person becomes a Specified Person and may provide that its exemption be subject to compliance with any terms and conditions determined by the board of directors. Transactions between a corporation and a Specified Person are prohibited for five years after the most recent date on which such stockholder becomes a Specified Person. After five years, any business combination must be recommended by the board of directors of the corporation and approved by at least 80% of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of voting stock of the corporation and two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of shares other than voting stock held by the Specified Person with whom the business combination is to be effected, unless the corporation\u2019s stockholders receive a minimum price as defined by Maryland law and other conditions under Maryland law are satisfied.\nA Maryland corporation may elect not to be governed by these provisions by having its board of directors exempt various Specified Persons, by including a provision in its charter expressly electing not to be governed by the applicable provision of Maryland law or by amending its existing charter with the approval of at least 80% of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of outstanding shares of voting stock of the corporation and two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of shares other than those held by any Specified Person. Our Charter does not include any provision opting out of these business combination provisions.\nControl Share Acquisitions\nThe Maryland General Corporation Law also prevents, subject to exceptions, an acquirer who acquires sufficient shares to exercise specified percentages of voting power of a corporation from having any voting rights except to the extent approved by two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter not including shares of stock owned by the acquiring person, any directors who are employees of the corporation and any officers of the corporation. These provisions are referred to as the control share acquisition statute.\nThe control share acquisition statute does not apply to shares acquired in a merger, consolidation or share exchange if the corporation is a party to the transaction, or to acquisitions approved or exempted prior to the acquisition by a provision contained in the corporation\u2019s charter or bylaws. Our Bylaws include a provision exempting us from the restrictions of the control share acquisition statute, but this provision could be amended or rescinded either before or after a person acquired control shares. As a result, the control share acquisition statute could discourage offers to acquire our common stock and could increase the difficulty of completing an offer.\nBoard of Directors\nThe Maryland General Corporation Law provides that a Maryland corporation which is subject to the Exchange Act and has at least three outside directors (who are not affiliated with an acquirer of the company) under certain circumstances may elect by resolution of the board of directors or by amendment of its charter or bylaws to be subject to statutory corporate governance provisions that may be inconsistent with the corporation\u2019s charter and bylaws. Under these provisions, a board of directors may divide itself into three separate classes without the vote of stockholders such that only one-third of the directors are elected each year. A board of directors classified in this manner cannot be altered by amendment to the charter of the corporation. Further, the board of directors may, by electing to be covered by the applicable statutory provisions and notwithstanding the corporation\u2019s charter or bylaws:\n\u2022 provide that a special meeting of stockholders will be called only at the request of stockholders entitled to cast at least a majority of the votes entitled to be cast at the meeting,\n\u2022 reserve for itself the right to fix the number of directors,\n\u2022 provide that a director may be removed only by the vote of at least two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast generally in the election of directors, and\n\u2022 retain for itself sole authority to fill vacancies created by an increase in the size of the board or the death, removal or resignation of a director.\nIn addition, a director elected to fill a vacancy under these provisions serves for the balance of the unexpired term instead of until the next annual meeting of stockholders. A board of directors may implement all or any of these provisions without amending the charter or bylaws and without stockholder approval. Although a corporation may be prohibited by its charter or by resolution of its board of directors from electing any of the provisions of the statute, we have not adopted such a prohibition. We have adopted a staggered board of directors with three separate classes in our charter and given the board the right to fix the number of directors, but we have not prohibited the amendment of these provisions. The adoption of the staggered board may discourage offers to acquire our common stock and may increase the difficulty of completing an offer to acquire our stock. If our Board chose to implement the statutory provisions, it could further discourage offers to acquire our common stock and could further increase the difficulty of completing an offer to acquire our common stock.\nEffect of Certain Provisions of our Charter and Bylaws\nIn addition to the Charter and Bylaws provisions discussed above, certain other provisions of our Bylaws may have the effect of impeding the acquisition of control of our company by means of a tender offer, proxy fight, open market purchases or otherwise in a transaction not approved by our Board of Directors. These provisions of Bylaws are intended to reduce our vulnerability to an unsolicited proposal for the restructuring or sale of all or substantially all of our assets or an unsolicited takeover attempt, which our Board believes is otherwise unfair to our stockholders. These provisions, however, also could have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change in control of our company.\nOur Bylaws provide that with respect to annual meetings of stockholders, (i) nominations of individuals for election to our Board of Directors and (ii) the proposal of business to be considered by stockholders may be made only pursuant to our notice of the meeting, by or at the direction of our Board of Directors, or by a stockholder who is entitled to vote at the meeting and has complied with the advance notice procedures set forth in our Bylaws.\nSpecial meetings of stockholders may be called only by the chief executive officer, the board of directors or the secretary of our company (upon the written request of the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote). At a special meeting of stockholders, the only business that may be conducted is the business specified in our notice of meeting. With respect to nominations of persons for election to our Board of Directors, nominations may be made at a special meeting of stockholders only pursuant to our notice of meeting, by or at the direction of our Board of Directors, or if our Board of Directors has determined that directors will be elected at the special meeting, by a stockholder who is entitled to vote at the meeting and has complied with the advance notice procedures set forth in our Bylaws.\nThese procedures may limit the ability of stockholders to bring business before a stockholders meeting, including the nomination of directors and the consideration of any transaction that could result in a change in control and that may result in a premium to our stockholders.", "PERMNO": 91201, "SIC": 5030, "TIC": "IGC"}
