{"cik": "1057706", "company": "FIRST BANCORP /PR/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRISKS RELATING TO THE CORPORATION\u2019S BUSINESS\nWe are operating under an agreement with our regulators.\nWe are subject to supervision and regulation by the Federal Reserve Board. We are a bank holding company and a financial holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended.\nAs a financial holding company, we are permitted to engage in a broader range of \u201cfinancial\u201d activities than those permitted to bank holding companies that are not financial holding companies. At this time, we currently are not able to engage in new financial activities, and we may not be able to acquire shares or control of other companies.\nAs a result of the Written Agreement, which is designed to enhance our ability to act as a source of strength to FirstBank, as well as other requirements, we must obtain regulatory approval before declaring or paying dividends, receiving dividends from FirstBank, making payments on subordinated debt or trust-preferred securities, incurring, increasing or guaranteeing debt (whether such debt is incurred, increased or guaranteed, directly or indirectly, by us or any of our non-banking subsidiaries) or purchasing or redeeming any capital stock. The Written Agreement also required us to submit to the Federal Reserve a capital plan and requires that we comply with certain notice provisions prior to appointing new directors or senior executive officers and comply with certain payment restrictions on severance payments and indemnification restrictions.\nIf we fail to comply with the Written Agreement and other requirements from our regulators, we may become subject to additional regulatory enforcement action and other adverse regulatory actions that might have a material and adverse effect on our operations.\nOur high level of non-performing loans may adversely affect our future results from operations.\nWe continue to have a high level of non-performing loans as of December 31, 2016, which increased $117.3 million to $568.2 million as of December 31, 2016, or 26%, from $450.9 million as of December 31, 2015. Our non-performing loans represent\napproximately 6% of our $8.9 billion loan portfolio as of December 31, 2016. In addition, we have a high level of total non-performing assets, which increased $124.6 million to $734.5 million as of December 31, 2016, or 20%, from $609.9 million as of December 31, 2015. The increase in total non-performing assets was related, among other things, to the placement in non-accrual status of the Corporation\u2019s $111.8 million exposure to commercial loans guaranteed by the TDF and bonds of the GDB and the Puerto Rico Public Buildings Authority with an aggregate fair value of $20.5 million as of December 31, 2016. If we are unable to effectively maintain the quality of our loan portfolio, our financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nCertain funding sources may not be available to us and our funding sources may prove insufficient and/or costly to replace.\nFirstBank relies primarily on customer deposits, the issuance of brokered CDs, and advances from the FHLB of New York to maintain its lending activities and to replace certain maturing liabilities. As of December 31, 2016, we had $1.4 billion in brokered CDs outstanding, representing approximately 16% of our total deposits, and a reduction of $657.8 million from the year ended December 31, 2015. Approximately $798.8 million in brokered CDs mature over the next twelve months, and the average term to maturity of the retail brokered CDs outstanding as of December 31, 2016 was approximately 1.2 years. None of these CDs are callable at the Corporation\u2019s option.\nAlthough FirstBank has historically been able to replace maturing deposits and advances, we may not be able to replace these funds in the future if our financial condition or general market conditions change. The use of brokered deposits has been particularly important for the funding of our operations. If we are unable to issue brokered deposits, or are unable to maintain access to other funding sources, our results of operations and liquidity would be adversely affected.\nAlternate sources of funding may carry higher costs than sources currently utilized. If we are required to rely more heavily on more expensive funding sources, profitability would be adversely affected. We may determine to seek debt financing in the future to achieve our long-term business objectives. Any future debt financing by the Corporation requires the prior approval of the Federal Reserve, and the Federal Reserve may not approve such financing. Additional borrowings, if sought, may not be available to us, or if available, may not be on acceptable terms. The availability of additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, our credit ratings and our credit capacity. In addition, the Bank may seek to sell loans as an additional source of liquidity. If additional financing sources are unavailable or are not available on acceptable terms, our profitability and future prospects could be adversely affected.\nWe depend on cash dividends from FirstBank to meet our cash obligations.\nAs a holding company, dividends from FirstBank have provided a substantial portion of our cash flow used to service the interest payments on our trust-preferred securities and other obligations. As outlined in the Written Agreement, we cannot receive any cash dividends from FirstBank without the prior written approval of our regulators. In addition, FirstBank is limited by law in its ability to make dividend payments and other distributions to us based on its earnings and capital position. Our inability to receive approval from our regulators to receive dividends from FirstBank, or FirstBank\u2019s failure to generate sufficient cash flow to make dividend payments to us, may adversely affect our ability to meet all projected cash needs in the ordinary course of business and may have a detrimental impact on our financial condition.\nThe Banking Law of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico requires that a minimum of 10% of FirstBank\u2019s net income for the year be transferred to legal surplus until such surplus equals the total of paid-in-capital on common and preferred stock. Amounts transferred to the legal surplus account from the retained earnings account are not available for distribution to the stockholders without the prior consent of the Puerto Rico Commissioner of Financial Institutions. The Puerto Rico Banking Law provides that when the expenditures of a Puerto Rico commercial bank are greater than receipts, the excess of the expenditures over receipts shall be charged against the undistributed profits of the bank, and the balance, if any, shall be charged against the reserve fund, as a reduction thereof. If there is no reserve fund sufficient to cover such balance in whole or in part, the outstanding amount shall be charged against the capital account and the Bank cannot pay dividends until it can replenish the reserve fund to an amount of at least 20% of the original capital contributed. During 2016 and 2015, $9.6 million and $2.8 million, respectively, were transferred to the legal surplus reserve. FirstBank\u2019s legal surplus reserve amounted to $52.4 million and $42.8 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nIf we do not obtain Federal Reserve approval to pay interest, principal or other sums on subordinated debentures or trust-preferred securities, a default may occur.\nThe Written Agreement provides that we cannot declare or pay any dividends or make any distributions of interest, principal or other sums on subordinated debentures or trust-preferred securities without prior written approval of the Federal Reserve. With respect to our outstanding subordinated debentures, we had elected to defer the interest payments that were due in quarterly periods since March 2012. However, during the second quarter of 2016, the Corporation received approval from the Federal Reserve that enabled it to pay $31.2 million for all the accrued but deferred interest payments plus the interest for the second quarter on the Corporation\u2019s subordinated debentures associated with its trust preferred securities. Subsequently, the Corporation received approval that enabled it to pay interest for the third quarter and fourth quarters of 2016. Future interest payments are subject to Federal Reserve approval. It is the intent of the Corporation to request approvals in future periods to continue regularly scheduled quarterly interest payments, although there is no assurance that such approvals will be granted.\nUnder the indentures, we have the right, from time to time, and without causing an event of default, to defer payments of interest on the subordinated debentures by extending the interest payment period at any time and from time to time during the term of the subordinated debentures for up to twenty consecutive quarterly periods. We may need to elect extension periods for future quarterly interest payments if the Federal Reserve advises us that it will not approve such future quarterly interest payments. Our inability to receive approval from the Federal Reserve to make distributions of interest, principal or other sums on our trust-preferred securities and subordinated debentures could result in a default under those obligations if we need to defer such payments for longer than twenty consecutive quarterly periods.\nCredit quality may result in additional losses.\nThe quality of our credits has continued to be under pressure as a result of continued recessionary conditions in the markets we serve that have led to, among other things, high unemployment levels, low absorption rates for new residential construction projects and further declines in property values. Our business depends on the creditworthiness of our customers and counterparties and the value of the assets securing our loans or underlying our investments. When the credit quality of the customer base materially decreases or the risk profile of a market, industry or group of customers changes materially, our business, financial condition, allowance levels, asset impairments, liquidity, capital and results of operations are adversely affected.\nWe have a commercial and construction loan portfolio held for investment in the amount of $3.9 billion as of December 31, 2016. Due to their nature, these loans entail a higher credit risk than consumer and residential mortgage loans, since they are larger in size, concentrate more risk in a single borrower and are generally more sensitive to economic downturns. Furthermore, given the slowdown in the real estate market, the properties securing these loans may be difficult to dispose of if they are foreclosed. As of December 31, 2016, we had $375.1 million in non-performing commercial and construction loans held for investment. During 2015, the Corporation increased the reserve for loan losses by approximately $35 million related to commercial loans extended to or guaranteed by the Puerto Rico government (excluding municipalities). In addition, the Corporation recorded other-than-temporary impairment charges totaling $22.2 million in the last two years, on Puerto Rico government debt securities as a result of the Puerto Rico government\u2019s fiscal situation, including an OTTI charge of $6.3 million in 2016. See \u201cRisks Relating to the Business Environment and Our Industry - The Corporation\u2019s credit quality and the value of our portfolio of Puerto Rico government securities has been and in the future may be adversely affected by Puerto Rico\u2019s economic condition and may be affected by actions taken by the Puerto Rico government or the PROMESA oversight board to address the ongoing fiscal and economic crisis in Puerto Rico.\u201d We may incur additional credit losses over the near term, either because of continued deterioration of the quality of the loans or because of sales of such loans, which would likely accelerate the recognition of losses. Any such losses would adversely impact our overall financial performance and results of operations.\nOur allowance for loan and lease losses may not be adequate to cover actual losses, and we may be required to materially increase our allowance, which may adversely affect our capital, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to the risk of loss from loan defaults and foreclosures with respect to the loans we originate and purchase. We establish a provision for loan and lease losses, which leads to reductions in our income from operations, in order to maintain our allowance for inherent loan and lease losses at a level that our management deems to be appropriate based upon an assessment of the quality of the loan and lease portfolio. Management may fail to accurately estimate the level of inherent loan and lease losses or may have to increase our provision for loan and lease losses in the future as a result of new information regarding existing loans, future increases in non-performing loans, changes in economic and other conditions affecting borrowers or for other reasons beyond our control. In addition, the bank regulatory agencies periodically review the adequacy of our allowance for loan and lease losses and may require an increase in the provision for loan and lease losses or the recognition of additional classified loans and loan charge-offs, based on judgments different than those of management.\nThe level of the allowance reflects management\u2019s estimates based upon various assumptions and judgments as to specific credit risks, evaluation of industry concentrations, loan loss experience, current loan portfolio quality, present economic, political and regulatory conditions and unidentified losses inherent in the current loan portfolio. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan and lease losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires management to make significant estimates and judgments regarding current credit risks and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes. If our estimates prove to be incorrect, our allowance for credit losses may not be sufficient to cover losses in our loan portfolio and our expense relating to the additional provision for credit losses could increase substantially.\nAny such increases in our provision for loan and lease losses or any loan losses in excess of our provision for loan and lease losses would have an adverse effect on our future financial condition and results of operations. Given the difficulties facing some of our largest borrowers, these borrowers may fail to continue to repay their loans on a timely basis or we may not be able to assess accurately any risk of loss from the loans to these borrowers. Also, additional economic weakness, which has resulted in downgrades of Puerto Rico\u2019s general obligation debt to non-investment grade, among other consequences, could require additional increases in reserves.\nChanges in collateral values of properties located in stagnant or distressed economies may require increased reserves.\nFurther deterioration of the value of real estate collateral securing our construction, commercial and residential mortgage loan portfolios would result in increased credit losses. As of December 31, 2016, approximately 1%, 18% and 37% of our loan portfolio consisted of construction, commercial mortgage and residential real estate loans, respectively.\nA substantial part of our loan portfolio is located within the boundaries of the U.S. economy. Whether the collateral is located in Puerto Rico, the USVI, the BVI, or the U.S. mainland, the performance of our loan portfolio and the collateral value backing the transactions are dependent upon the performance of and conditions within each specific real estate market. Puerto Rico has been in an economic recession since 2006. Sustained weak economic conditions that have affected Puerto Rico over the last several years have resulted in declines in collateral values.\nConstruction and commercial loans, mostly secured by commercial and residential real estate properties, entail a higher credit risk than consumer and residential mortgage loans since they are larger in size, may have less collateral coverage, concentrate more risk in a single borrower and are generally more sensitive to economic downturns. As of December 31, 2016, commercial mortgage and construction real estate loans amounted to $1.7 billion or 19% of the total loan portfolio.\nWe measure the impairment of a loan based on the fair value of the collateral, if collateral dependent, which is generally obtained from appraisals. Updated appraisals are obtained when we determine that loans are impaired and are updated annually thereafter. In addition, appraisals are also obtained for certain residential mortgage loans on a spot basis based on specific characteristics such as delinquency levels, age of the appraisal and loan-to-value ratios. The appraised value of the collateral may decrease or we may not be able to recover collateral at its appraised value. A significant decline in collateral valuations for collateral dependent loans may require increases in our specific provision for loan losses and an increase in the general valuation allowance. Any such increase would have an adverse effect on our future financial condition and results of operations. During the year ended December 31, 2016, net charge-offs on construction, commercial mortgage and residential mortgage loan portfolios totaled $1.5 million, $19.6 million and $30.7 million, respectively.\nThe acquisition of certain assets and deposits of Doral Bank through an alliance with another financial institution has magnified certain of the Corporation\u2019s risks and presented new risks.\nOn February 27, 2015, the Corporation, through an alliance with another local financial institution that was the successful lead bidder with the FDIC on the failed Doral Bank, acquired certain assets and deposits of Doral Bank. The transaction presents new risks and magnifies certain of the risks the Corporation already faces that are described in these \u201cRisk Factors\u201d, including the following:\n\u00b7 risks associated with weak economic conditions in the economy and in the real estate market in Puerto Rico, which adversely affect real estate prices, the job market, consumer confidence and spending habits, which may affect, among other things, the continued status of the loans acquired as performing loans, charge-offs and provision expense;\n\u00b7 changes in interest rates and market liquidity, which may reduce interest margins;\n\u00b7 changes in market rates and prices that may adversely impact the value of financial assets and liabilities; and\n\u00b7 failure to realize the anticipated acquisition benefits in the amounts and within the time frames expected.\nInterest rate shifts may reduce net interest income.\nShifts in short-term interest rates may reduce net interest income, which is the principal component of our earnings. Net interest income is the difference between the amounts received by us on our interest-earning assets and the interest paid by us on our interest-bearing liabilities. Differences in the re-pricing structure of our assets and liabilities may result in changes in our profits when interest rates change.\nIncreases in interest rates may reduce the value of holdings of securities.\nFixed-rate securities acquired by us are generally subject to decreases in market value when interest rates rise, which may require recognition of a loss (e.g., the identification of an other-than-temporary impairment on our available-for-sale investment portfolio), thereby adversely affecting our results of operations. Market-related reductions in value also influence our ability to finance these securities. Furthermore, increases in interest rates may result in an extension of the expected average life of certain fixed-income securities, such as fixed-rate pass-through mortgage-backed securities. Such an extension could exacerbate the drop in market value related to shifts in interest rates.\nIncreases in interest rates may reduce demand for mortgage and other loans.\nHigher interest rates increase the cost of mortgage and other loans to consumers and businesses and may reduce demand for such loans, which may negatively impact our profits by reducing the amount of loan interest income.\nAccelerated prepayments may adversely affect net interest income.\nIn general, fixed-income portfolio yields would decrease if the re-investment of pre-payment amounts is at lower rates. Net interest income could also be affected by prepayments of mortgage-backed securities. Acceleration in the prepayments of mortgage-backed securities would lower yields on these securities, as the amortization of premiums paid upon the acquisition of these securities would accelerate. Conversely, acceleration in the prepayments of mortgage-backed securities would increase yields on securities purchased at a discount, as the accretion of the discount would accelerate. These risks are directly linked to future period market interest rate fluctuations. Also, net interest income in future periods might be affected by our investment in callable securities because decreases in interest rates might prompt the early redemption of such securities.\nChanges in interest rates on loans and borrowings may adversely affect net interest income.\nBasis risk is the risk of adverse consequences resulting from unequal changes in the difference, also referred to as the \u201cspread\u201d or basis, between the rates for two or more different instruments with the same maturity and occurs when market rates for different financial instruments or the indices used to price assets and liabilities change at different times or by different amounts. For example, the interest expense for liability instruments such as brokered CDs might not change by the same amount as interest income received from loans or investments. To the extent that the interest rates on loans and borrowings change at different rates and by different amounts, the margin between our LIBOR-based assets and the higher cost of the brokered CDs might be compressed and adversely affect net interest income.\nIf all or a significant portion of the unrealized losses in our investment securities portfolio on our consolidated balance sheet is determined to be other-than-temporarily impaired, we would recognize a material charge to our earnings and our capital ratios would be adversely affected.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016, we recognized a total of $0.4 million, $16.5 million and $6.7 million, respectively, in other-than-temporary impairments. The 2015 and 2016 impairments were primarily related to Puerto Rico government debt securities held by the Corporation, which may continue to be adversely affected by the Puerto Rico government financial difficulties. See \u201cRisks Relating to the Business Environment and Our Industry - The Corporation\u2019s credit quality and the value of our portfolio of Puerto Rico government securities has been and in the future may be adversely affected by Puerto Rico\u2019s economic condition and may be affected by actions taken by the Puerto Rico government or the PROMESA oversight board to address the ongoing fiscal and economic crisis in Puerto Rico.\u201d To the extent that any portion of the unrealized losses in our investment securities portfolio of $66.6 million as of December 31, 2016 is determined to be other-than-temporary and, in the case of debt securities, the loss is related to credit factors, we would recognize a charge to earnings in the quarter during which such determination is made and capital ratios could be adversely affected. Even if we do not determine that the unrealized losses associated with this portfolio require an impairment charge, increases in unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities adversely affect our tangible common equity ratio, which may adversely affect credit rating agency and investor sentiment towards us. Any negative perception also may adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets or might increase our cost of capital. Valuation and other-than-temporary impairment determinations will continue to be affected by external market factors including default rates, severity rates and macro-economic factors.\nDowngrades in our credit ratings could further increase the cost of borrowing funds.\nThe Corporation\u2019s ability to access new non-deposit sources of funding, even if approved by the Federal Reserve, could be adversely affected by downgrades in our credit ratings. The Corporation\u2019s liquidity is to a certain extent contingent upon its ability to obtain external sources of funding to finance its operations. The Corporation\u2019s current credit ratings and any downgrades in such credit ratings can hinder the Corporation\u2019s access to new forms of external funding and/or cause external funding to be more expensive, which could in turn adversely affect results of operations. Also, changes in credit ratings may further affect the fair value of unsecured derivatives that consider the Corporation\u2019s own credit risk as part of the valuation.\nDefective and repurchased loans may harm our business and financial condition.\nIn connection with the sale and securitization of loans, we are required to make a variety of customary representations and warranties relating to the loans sold or securitized. Our obligations with respect to these representations and warranties are generally outstanding for the life of the loan, and relate to, among other things:\n\u00b7 compliance with laws and regulations;\n\u00b7 underwriting standards;\n\u00b7 the accuracy of information in the loan documents and loan files; and\n\u00b7 the characteristics and enforceability of the loan\nA loan that does not comply with these representations and warranties may take longer to sell, may impact our ability to obtain third party financing for the loan, and may not be saleable or may be saleable only at a significant discount. If such a loan is sold before we detect non-compliance, we may be obligated to repurchase the loan and bear any associated loss directly, or we may be obligated to indemnify the purchaser against any loss, either of which could reduce our cash available for operations and liquidity. Management believes that it has established controls to ensure that loans are originated in accordance with the secondary market\u2019s requirements, but mistakes may be made, or certain employees may deliberately violate our lending policies.\nOur controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented, our risk management policies and procedures may be inadequate and operational risk could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations.\nWe may fail to identify and manage risks related to a variety of aspects of our business, including, but not limited to, operational risk, interest-rate risk, trading risk, fiduciary risk, legal and compliance risk, liquidity risk and credit risk. We have adopted and periodically improved various controls, procedures, policies and systems to monitor and manage risk. Any improvements to our controls, procedures, policies and systems, however, may not be adequate to identify and manage the risks in our various businesses. If our risk framework is ineffective, either because it fails to keep pace with changes in the financial markets or our businesses or for other reasons, we could incur losses or suffer reputational damage or find ourselves out of compliance with applicable regulatory mandates or expectations.\nWe may also be subject to disruptions from external events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, which could cause delays or disruptions to operational functions, including information processing and financial market settlement functions. In addition, our customers, vendors and counterparties could suffer from such events. Should these events affect us, or the customers, vendors or counterparties with which we conduct business, our consolidated results of operations could be negatively affected. When we record balance sheet reserves for probable loss contingencies related to operational losses, we may be unable to accurately estimate our potential exposure, and any reserves we establish to cover operational losses may not be sufficient to cover our actual financial exposure, which may have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition for the periods in which we recognize the losses.\nCyber-attacks, system risks and data protection breaches could present significant reputational, legal and regulatory costs.\nFirst BanCorp. is under continuous threat of cyber-attacks especially as we continue to expand customer services via the internet and other remote service channels. Three of the most significant cyber-attack risks that we face are e-fraud, denial-of-service and computer intrusion that might result in loss of sensitive customer data. Loss from e-fraud occurs when cybercriminals breach and extract funds from customer bank accounts. Denial-of-service disrupts services available to our customers through our on-line banking system. Computer intrusion attempts might result in the breach of sensitive customer data, such as account numbers and social security numbers, and any cyber-attacks could present significant reputational, legal and/or regulatory costs to the Corporation if successful. Our risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because of the evolving nature and complexity of the threats from organized cybercriminals and hackers, and our plans to continue to provide electronic banking services to our customers.\nIf personal, non-public, confidential or proprietary information of our customers in our possession were to be mishandled or misused, we could suffer significant regulatory consequences, reputational damage and financial loss. Such mishandling or misuse could include, for example, the erroneous provision of information to parties who are not permitted to have the information, either by fault of our systems, employees, or counterparties, or the interception or other inappropriate use of such information by third parties.\nWe rely on other companies to perform key aspects of our business infrastructure.\nThird parties perform key aspects of our business operations such as data processing, information security, recording and monitoring transactions, online banking interfaces and services, internet connections and network access. While we believe that we have selected these third party vendors carefully, we do not control their actions. Any problems caused by these third parties, including those resulting from disruptions in communication services provided by a vendor, failure of a vendor to handle current or higher volumes, failure of a vendor to provide services for any reason, the provision by a vendor of poor performance of services, or failure of a vendor to notify us of a reportable event, could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and otherwise conduct our business. Financial or operational difficulties of a third party vendor could also hurt our\noperations if those difficulties interfere with the vendor\u2019s ability to serve us. Replacing these third party vendors could also create significant delay and expense. Accordingly, use of such third parties creates an inherent risk to our business operations.\nHurricanes and other weather-related events could cause a disruption in our operations or other consequences that could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nOur operations are located in regions susceptible to hurricanes. Such weather events can cause disruption to our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our overall results of operations. While we maintain hurricane insurance, including coverage for lost profits and extra expense, there is no insurance against the disruption to the markets that we serve that a catastrophic hurricane could produce. Further, a hurricane in any of our market areas could adversely impact the ability of borrowers to timely repay their loans and may adversely impact the value of any collateral held by us. The severity and impact of future hurricanes and other weather-related events are difficult to predict and may be exacerbated by global climate change. The effects of future hurricanes and other weather-related events could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nCompetition for our executives and other key employees is intense, and we may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled people we need to support our business.\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract and retain key people. Competition for the best people in most activities in which we engage can be intense, and we may not be able to hire people or retain them, particularly in light of uncertainty concerning compensation restrictions applicable to banks but not applicable to other financial services firms. The unexpected loss of services of one or more of our key personnel could adversely affect our business because of the loss of their skills, knowledge of our markets and years of industry experience and, in some cases, because of the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement employees. Similarly, the loss of our executives or other key employees, either individually or as a group, could result in a loss of customer confidence in our ability to execute banking transactions on their behalf.\nAs a TARP recipient, we are subject to the executive compensation provisions of the EESA, including amendments to such provisions implemented under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, which limit the types of compensation arrangements that the Corporation may enter into with our most senior leaders. Our competitors may be in an advantageous position to retain and attract senior leaders since we are the only institution in Puerto Rico that is currently subject to TARP-related compensation provisions. Our compensation practices are subject to review and oversight by the Federal Reserve Board. We also may be subject to limitations on compensation practices by the FDIC or other regulators, which may or may not affect our competitors. Limitations on our compensation practices could have a negative impact on our ability to attract and retain talented senior leaders in support of our long term strategy.\nOur compensation practices are subject to oversight by the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC. Any deficiencies in our compensation practices may be incorporated into our supervisory ratings, which can affect our ability to make acquisitions or perform other actions. In addition, the regulation of our compensation practices may change in the future.\nOur compensation practices are subject to oversight by the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC. As discussed above, the Corporation currently is subject to the executive compensation restrictions as a TARP recipient and the 2010 interagency guidance governing the incentive compensation activities of regulated banks and bank holding companies. Our failure to satisfy these restrictions and guidelines could expose us to adverse regulatory criticism, lowered supervisory ratings, and restrictions on our operations and acquisition activities. In addition, the federal banking agencies have proposed new regulations under the Dodd-Frank Act that place restrictions on the incentive compensation practices of banking organizations with $1 billion or more in assets.\nThe scope and content of the U.S. banking regulators\u2019 policies on executive compensation are continuing to develop and are likely to continue evolving in the near future. It cannot be determined at this time whether compliance with such policies will adversely affect the ability of the Corporation and its subsidiaries to hire, retain and motivate their key employees.\nFurther increases in the FDIC deposit insurance premium or in FDIC required reserves may have a significant financial impact on us.\nThe FDIC insures deposits at FDIC-insured depository institutions up to certain limits (currently, $250,000 per depositor account). The FDIC charges insured depository institutions premiums to maintain the Deposit Insurance Fund (the \u201cDIF\u201d). In the event of a bank failure, the FDIC takes control of a failed bank and, if necessary, pays all insured deposits up to the statutory deposit insurance limits using the resources of the DIF. The FDIC is required by law to maintain adequate funding of the DIF, and the FDIC may increase premium assessments to maintain such funding.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act requires the FDIC to increase the DIF\u2019s reserves against future losses, which will require institutions with assets greater than $10 billion, such as FirstBank, to bear an increased responsibility for funding the prescribed reserve to support the DIF. Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act requires the FDIC to bolster the DIF by increasing the required reserve ratio for the industry to 1.35 percent (ratio of reserves to insured deposits) by September 30, 2020.\nThe FDIC\u2019s revised rule on deposit insurance assessments implements a provision in the Dodd-Frank Act that changes the assessment base for deposit insurance premiums from one based on domestic deposits to one based on average consolidated total assets minus average Tier 1 capital. The rule changes the assessment rate schedules for insured depository institutions so that approximately the same amount of revenue would be collected under the new assessment base as would be collected under the previous rate schedule and the schedules previously proposed by the FDIC. The rule also revises the risk-based assessment system for all large insured depository institutions (generally, institutions with at least $10 billion in total assets, such as FirstBank). Under the rule, the FDIC uses a scorecard method to calculate assessment rates for all such institutions.\nIn March 2016, the FDIC adopted a final rule imposing a quarterly deposit insurance assessment surcharge on banks with at least $10 billion in assets of 4.5 cents per $100 of their assessment base, after making certain adjustments once the Deposit Insurance Fund Reserve Ratio reaches or exceeds 1.15 percent. For purposes of this surcharge, the first $10 billion of assets are subtracted from the regular insurance assessment base to determine the surcharge base. The assessment surcharge became effective on July 1, 2016, is assessed as of the third quarter of 2016 and subsequent periods, and applies to FirstBank. The Bank\u2019s current surcharge base is slightly higher than the $10 billion threshold. The surcharge assessments will continue through December 31, 2018 or until the Deposit Insurance Fund Reserve Ratio reaches or exceeds 1.35 percent. In addition, under existing regulations, the FDIC reduced the initial base assessment rate, which reduces the standard risk-based assessment rate. This resulted in a decrease in the total FDIC insurance premium expense (standard risk-based assessment plus assessment surcharge expense) of approximately $1.6 million in the second half of 2016, as the benefit of the reduction in the initial base assessment rate exceeded the surcharge amount. In addition, under the Final Rule, if the Deposit Insurance Fund Reserve Ratio does not reach 1.35 percent by December 31, 2018, a shortfall assessment may be assessed on large banks in the first quarter of 2019 and collected by the FDIC on June 30, 2019. The FDIC also adopted a final rule raising its industry target ratio of reserves to insured deposits to 2 percent, 65 basis points above the statutory minimum, but the FDIC does not project that goal to be met for several years.\nThe FDIC may further increase FirstBank\u2019s premiums or impose additional assessments or prepayment requirements in the future. The Dodd-Frank Act has removed the statutory cap for the reserve ratio, leaving the FDIC free to set this cap going forward.\nOur businesses may be adversely affected by litigation.\nFrom time to time, our customers, or the government on their behalf, may make claims and take legal action relating to our performance of fiduciary or contractual responsibilities. We may also face employment lawsuits or other legal claims. In any such claims or actions, demands for substantial monetary damages may be asserted against us, resulting in financial liability or an adverse effect on our reputation among investors or on customer demand for our products and services. We may be unable to accurately estimate our exposure to litigation risk when we record balance sheet reserves for probable loss contingencies. As a result, reserves we establish to cover any settlements or judgments may not be sufficient to cover our actual financial exposure, which has occurred in the past and may again occur, resulting in a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we are also subject to various regulatory, governmental and law enforcement inquiries, investigations and subpoenas. These may be directed generally to participants in the businesses in which we are involved or may be specifically directed at us. In regulatory enforcement matters, claims for disgorgement, the imposition of penalties and the imposition of other remedial sanctions are possible.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted. A securities class action suit against us could result in substantial costs, potential liabilities and the diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources.\nThe resolution of legal actions or regulatory matters, when unfavorable, has had and could in the future have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations for the quarter in which such actions or matters are resolved or a reserve is established.\nOur businesses may be negatively affected by adverse publicity or other reputational harm.\nOur relationships with many of our customers are predicated upon our reputation as a fiduciary and a service provider that adheres to the highest standards of ethics, service quality and regulatory compliance. Adverse publicity, regulatory actions, like the Written Agreement, litigation, operational failures, the failure to meet customer expectations and other issues with respect to one or more of our businesses could materially and adversely affect our reputation, or our ability to attract and retain customers or obtain sources of funding for the same or other businesses. Preserving and enhancing our reputation also depends on maintaining systems and procedures that address known risks and regulatory requirements, as well as our ability to identify and mitigate additional risks that arise due to changes in our businesses, the market places in which we operate, the regulatory environment and customer expectations. If we fail to promptly address matters that bear on our reputation, our reputation may be materially adversely affected and our business will suffer.\nChanges in accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board may adversely affect our financial statements.\nOur financial statements are subject to the application of U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d), which are periodically revised and expanded. Accordingly, from time to time, we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d). The FASB has issued several financial accounting and reporting\nstandards that will govern key aspects of the Corporation\u2019s financial statements or interpretations thereof when those standards become effective, including those areas where the Corporation is required to make assumptions or estimates. For example, the FASB\u2019s new accounting standard on credit losses, which will become effective for the Corporation on January 1, 2020, will require earlier recognition of credit losses on financial assets. The new accounting model requires that lifetime \u201cexpected credit losses\u201d of financial assets not recorded at fair value through net income, such as loans and held-to-maturity securities, be recorded at inception of the financial asset, replacing the multiple existing impairment model under GAAP which generally require that a loss be \u201cincurred\u201d before it is recognized. For additional information on this and other accounting standards, see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nChanges to financial accounting or reporting standards or interpretations, whether promulgated or required by the FASB or other regulators, could present operational challenges and could require the Corporation to change certain of the assumptions or estimates it previously used in preparing its financial statements, which could negatively impact how it records and reports its financial condition and results of operations generally and/or with respect to particular businesses. For additional information on the key areas for which assumption and estimates are used in preparing the Corporation\u2019s financial statements, see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAny impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may adversely affect our operating results.\nIf our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings. Under GAAP, we review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.\nGoodwill is tested for impairment at least annually. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances, indicating that the carrying value of the goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable, include reduced future cash flow estimates and slower growth rates in the industry.\nThe goodwill impairment evaluation process requires us to make estimates and assumptions with regards to the fair value of our reporting units. Actual values may differ significantly from these estimates. Such differences could result in future impairment of goodwill that would, in turn, negatively impact our results of operations and the reporting unit where the goodwill is recorded. We conducted our most recent evaluation of goodwill during the fourth quarter of 2016.\nThe Step 1 evaluation of goodwill allocated to the Florida reporting unit under our valuation approaches (market and discounted cash flow analyses) indicated that the fair value of the unit was above the carrying amount of its equity book value as of the valuation date (October 1), which meant that Step 2 was not undertaken. Goodwill with a carrying value of $28.1 million was not impaired as of December 31, 2016 or 2015, nor was any goodwill written off due to impairment during 2016, 2015, and 2014. If we are required to record a charge to earnings in our consolidated financial statements because an impairment of the goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nRecognition of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income by the Bank.\nAs of December 31, 2016, the Corporation had a deferred tax asset of $281.7 million (net of a valuation allowance of $207.2 million), including $171.5 million associated with FirstBank\u2019s Net Operating Losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d). Under Puerto Rico law, the Corporation and its subsidiaries, including FirstBank, are treated as separate taxable entities and are not entitled to file consolidated tax returns. To obtain the full benefit of the applicable deferred tax asset attributable to NOLs, FirstBank must have sufficient taxable income within the applicable carry forward period (7 years for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2005, 12 years for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2004 and before January 1, 2013, and 10 years for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2012). The Bank incurred all of its NOLs on or after 2009. Accounting for income taxes requires that companies assess whether a valuation allowance should be recorded against their deferred tax asset based on an assessment of the amount of the deferred tax asset that is more likely than not to be realized.\nThe Corporation recorded a partial reversal of its valuation allowance in the amount of $302.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. The Corporation\u2019s valuation allowance as of December 31, 2016 amounted to $207.2 million. Due to significant estimates utilized in determining the valuation allowance and the potential for changes in facts and circumstances, it is reasonably possible that, in the future, the Corporation will not be able to reverse the remaining valuation allowance or that the Corporation will need to increase its current deferred tax asset valuation allowance.\nThe Corporation\u2019s judgments regarding tax accounting policies and the resolution of tax disputes may impact the Corporation\u2019s earnings and cash flow.\nSignificant judgment is required in determining the Corporation\u2019s effective tax rate and in evaluating its tax positions. The Corporation provides for uncertain tax positions when such tax positions do not meet the recognition thresholds or measurement criteria prescribed by applicable GAAP.\nFluctuations in federal, state, local and foreign taxes or a change to uncertain tax positions, including related interest and penalties, may impact the Corporation\u2019s effective tax rate. When particular tax matters arise, a number of years may elapse before such matters are audited and finally resolved. In addition, tax positions may be challenged by the Puerto Rico Department of Treasury (\u201cPRTD\u201d),\nthe United States Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) and the tax authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate and we may estimate and provide for potential liabilities that may arise out of tax audits to the extent that uncertain tax positions fail to meet the recognition standard under applicable GAAP. Unfavorable resolution of any tax matter could increase the effective tax rate and could result in a material increase in our tax expense. Resolution of a tax issue may require the use of cash in the year of resolution.\nWe must respond to rapid technological changes, and these changes may be more difficult or expensive than anticipated.\nIf competitors introduce new products and services embodying new technologies, or if new industry standards and practices emerge, our existing product and service offerings, technology and systems may become obsolete. Further, if we fail to adopt or develop new technologies or to adapt our products and services to emerging industry standards, we may lose current and future customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The financial services industry is changing rapidly and, in order to remain competitive, we must continue to enhance and improve the functionality and features of our products, services and technologies. These changes may be more difficult or expensive than we anticipate.\nRISKS RELATING TO THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND OUR INDUSTRY\nContinuation of the economic slowdown and decline in the real estate market in Puerto Rico could continue to harm our results of operations.\nThe residential mortgage loan origination business has historically been cyclical, enjoying periods of strong growth and profitability followed by periods of shrinking volumes and industry-wide losses. The market for residential mortgage loan originations has declined over the past few years and this trend may continue to reduce the level of mortgage loans we produce in the future and adversely affect our business. During periods of rising interest rates, the refinancing of many mortgage products tends to decrease as the economic incentives for borrowers to refinance their existing mortgage loans are reduced. In addition, the residential mortgage loan origination business is impacted by home values.\nThe actual rates of delinquencies, foreclosures and losses on loans have been higher during the economic slowdown. Rising unemployment, volatile interest rates and declines in housing prices have had a negative effect on the ability of borrowers to repay their mortgage loans. Any sustained period of increased delinquencies, foreclosures or losses could continue to harm our ability to sell loans, the prices we receive for loans, the values of mortgage loans held for sale or residual interests in securitizations, which could continue to harm our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any additional material decline in real estate values would further weaken the collateral loan-to-value ratios and increase the possibility of loss if a borrower defaults. In such event, we will be subject to the risk of loss on such real estate arising from borrower defaults to the extent not covered by third-party credit enhancement.\nThe Corporation\u2019s credit quality and the value of our portfolio of Puerto Rico government securities has been and in the future may be adversely affected by Puerto Rico\u2019s economic condition and may be affected by actions taken by the Puerto Rico government or the PROMESA oversight board to address the ongoing fiscal and economic crisis in Puerto Rico.\nA significant portion of our financial activities and credit exposure is concentrated in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, which has been in an economic recession since 2006. Based on the most recent information available, the main economic indicators suggest that the Puerto Rico economy remains weak. For fiscal years 2017 and 2018, the Puerto Rico government projects a continued economic contraction in the Commonwealth\u2019s GNP of 2.2% and 2.8%, respectively, while the GDB-EAI in December 2016 decreased 2.9% on a year-over-year basis to 121.1, the lowest number in 25 years. The GDB-EAI is a coincident index of economic activity for Puerto Rico made up of four indicators (non-farm payroll employment, electric power generation, cement sales and gasoline consumption). The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in Puerto Rico was 12.4% in December 2016, which is higher than in any U.S. state. Puerto Rico population decreased by an estimated 6.8% from 2010-2015, driven primarily by falling birth rate, a rising death rate, and migration to the United States mainland, according to the U.S. census data.\nBased on information published by the Puerto Rico government, General Fund net revenues for the fiscal year 2015-2016 totaled approximately $9.175 billion, a year-over-year increase of $214.4 million. Fiscal year revenues were $116.7 million below revised estimates. General Fund net revenues for the first semester of fiscal year 2017 were $3.97 billion, an increase of $75 million year-over-year, and exceeded estimates by approximately $77 million.\nOn April 6, 2016, the Puerto Rico Emergency Moratorium and Financial Rehabilitation Act was enacted, which gives Puerto Rico\u2019s governor emergency powers to deal with the challenging fiscal situation, including the ability to declare a moratorium on any debt payment. Puerto Rico\u2019s governor also issued an executive order intended to protect the GDB\u2019s liquidity by allowing withdrawals only to fund necessary costs for essential services such as health, public safety and education services.\nOn June 30, 2016, pursuant to the debt moratorium law, the Puerto Rico governor ordered a moratorium on the payment of $780 million of the Puerto Rico government\u2019s general obligations and guaranteed debt, along with the payment obligations of certain other issuers. The Puerto Rico government has continued to default on general obligation bonds, including the payment due on January 1, 2017. This followed a default on the principal payment of $367 million of GDB notes due on May 1, 2016. On August 1, 2016, the GDB defaulted on a $28 million payment of interest due to its creditors, including interest due on GDB bonds held by the Corporation. The GDB\ndefault marked the first time the GDB, or any other Puerto Rico agency or instrumentality, failed to pay interest on Puerto Rico government bonds held by the Corporation. On October 1, 2016, the Puerto Rico Public Buildings Authority failed to make a full payment of interest due on its obligation bonds, including bonds held by the Corporation. Generally, based on specific facts and circumstances of the issuer, a default event requires us to classify the defaulted bonds as a non-performing asset. Accordingly, during the third quarter of 2016, bonds of the GDB and the Puerto Rico Public Buildings Authority with an aggregate fair value as of December 31, 2016 of $20.5 million ($35.6 million- amortized cost, including accrued interest of $0.9 million) were classified as non-performing and placed in non-accrual status by the Corporation. These bonds are held as part of the available-for-sale securities portfolio. In the first quarter of 2016, the Corporation recorded a $6.3 million OTTI charge on the aforementioned bonds of the GDB and the Puerto Rico Public Buildings Authority. This was the third OTTI charge on these securities recorded since June 30, 2015, as OTTI charges of $12.9 million and $3.0 million were booked in the second and fourth quarters of 2015. The credit-related impairment loss estimates were based on the probability of default and loss severity in the event of default in consideration of the latest available information about the Puerto Rico government\u2019s financial condition, including the enactment of a debt moratorium law and the declaration of a state of emergency at the GDB, the issuance of the GDB and the Commonwealth\u2019s audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014, as well as issuance of exchange proposals with the Commonwealth\u2019s creditors related to its outstanding bond obligations. In addition to bonds of the GDB and the Puerto Rico Public Buildings Authority, the Corporation owns bonds of the Puerto Rico Housing Finance Authority in the aggregate amount of $7.9 million carried on the Corporation\u2019s books at the aggregate fair value of $6.3 million, which are current as to contractual payments as of December 31, 2016.\nOn June 30, 2016, President Obama signed HR5278 Bill, PROMESA, which established an oversight board, a process for restructuring debt, and expedited procedures for approving critical infrastructure projects in order to address the Puerto Rico government fiscal situation. The independent seven-member oversight board that was appointed by the House of Representatives, Senate and President Obama pursuant to PROMESA has fiscal oversight over Puerto Rico\u2019s finances for an initial term of five years. This marks the largest federal intervention ever into the U.S. municipal bond market. PROMESA enables Puerto Rico to restructure its debt. The PROMESA oversight board had its first meeting on September 30, 2016, and its term will expire once Puerto Rico has posted four structurally balanced budgets in a row and is deemed to have adequate access to the capital markets. The PROMESA oversight board has the power to approve or reject the general government\u2019s proposed budgets until the oversight board is satisfied that the budgets are structurally responsible and based on reasonable expectations and accounting standards.\nDuring their first meeting, the PROMESA oversight board announced the designation of a number of entities as covered entities under PROMESA, including the Commonwealth, all of its public corporations and retirement systems, the University of Puerto Rico and all affiliates and subsidiaries of the foregoing. The designation of an entity as a covered entity has various implications under PROMESA. First, it means that the Governor will have to submit such entity\u2019s annual budgets and, if the PROMESA oversight board so requests, its fiscal plans, to the PROMESA oversight board for its review and approval. Second, covered territorial instrumentalities may not issue debt or guarantee, exchange, modify, repurchase, redeem, or enter into similar transactions with respect to their debts without the prior approval of the PROMESA oversight board. Third, pursuant to certain contracting guidelines approved by the PROMESA oversight board, prior PROMESA oversight board approval is required in connection with any transaction undertaken by a covered entity that (i) is outside the ordinary course of business or (ii) has a material financial impact. Finally, covered entities could also potentially be eligible to use the restructuring procedures provided by PROMESA. The first, Title VI, is a largely out-of-court process through which a government entity and its financial creditors can agree on terms to restructure such entity\u2019s debt. If a supermajority of creditors of a certain category agree, that agreement can bind all other creditors in such category. The second, Title III, draws on the federal bankruptcy code and provides a court-supervised process for a comprehensive restructuring led by the PROMESA oversight board.\nPROMESA contains many provisions that, although similar to the provisions of Chapter 9 or other chapters of the United States Bankruptcy Code, are not identical and may not be interpreted in the same manner. Puerto Rico\u2019s economy may be adversely affected by expenditures cuts or revenue raising measures implemented as a result of PROMESA. An increase in the tax burden of Puerto Rico residents may aggravate the population decline and economic recession. Additionally austerity measures that further reduce governmental expenditures or services, may also increase the rate at which residents leave and reduce the disposable income of residents of Puerto Rico. This decline may, in turn, lead to a decrease in economy activity that will affect the government\u2019s ability to collect revenues as projected. Holders of bonds issued by the Commonwealth and its instrumentalities may be subject to voluntary or involuntary haircuts of interest or principal or both on their bonds as a result of one of the two methods to restructure Puerto Rico\u2019s debt contained in PROMESA.\nPROMESA also created a bipartisan Congressional Task Force on Economic Growth in Puerto Rico. The Task Force consists of an eight-member panel of Congressional members that will review federal laws and programs to improve Puerto Rico\u2019s economy. The Task Force submitted a report during December 2016 with over 75 recommendations to Congress to jump start Puerto Rico\u2019s economy that included dealing with Medicaid, competitive tax treatment for U.S. subsidiaries, granting child tax credits and increasing loans for small businesses and the rum cover-over tax. They also stated that if the government conducts a plebiscite authorized by Congress, they would analyze and take any appropriate legislative action. As of the date of submission of this Form 10-K, the U.S. Congress has not taken action on any of the recommendations in the report.\nOn November 8, 2016, a new governor of Puerto Rico was elected and assumed office in January 2017. In addition a new Resident Commissioner was designated to represent Puerto Rico in the U.S. House of Representatives. Since taking office, Puerto Rico\u2019s governor signed an executive order reducing spending by 10%, created an expedited process for infrastructure projects, implemented a zero-based budgeting methodology, introduced several bills to promote economic development and outlined several labor reforms aimed at reducing the cost of doing business in Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico\u2019s governor also signed an extension to an excise tax on foreign manufacturers which contributes a significant amount of revenue to the general fund. Furthermore, Puerto Rico\u2019s governor signed the \u201cFinancial Emergency and Fiscal Responsibility Act,\u201d which replaces the prior administration\u2019s debt moratorium with a new approach that segregates revenues available after the payment of essential services to pay debt service.\nIn January 2017, the PROMESA oversight board sent a letter to the Puerto Rico governor outlining a minimum of $4.5 billion in fiscal measures that would need to be included in the government\u2019s next fiscal plan in order for the PROMESA oversight board to certify the fiscal plan, which is the first step before negotiations with creditors can occur. In response to the Puerto Rico governor\u2019s request for more time to develop a fiscal plan, the PROMESA oversight board established a number of milestones and conditions it would require if the then-current deadlines were extended. On January 28, 2017, the PROMESA oversight board officially extended various deadlines including moving to (i) February 28, 2017 the deadline for the updated fiscal plan, (ii) March 15, 2017 for the PROMESA oversight board to certify the fiscal plan and (iii) May 1, 2017 for the stay on debt-related litigation. On February 28, 2017, the Puerto Rico governor submitted to the PROMESA oversight board the Puerto Rico government fiscal plan which, among other initiatives, calls for significant reductions in operational expenses and subsides for municipalities and the University of Puerto Rico. The plan, which relies on significant change in economic assumptions vis a vis the baseline, projects a surplus before debt service of $11.6 billion in the aggregate during the ten year projection period (against $35.1 billion in contractual debt service). Estimated savings under the fiscal plan of $3.8 billion fall short of the $4.5 billion figure the PROMESA oversight board recommended. This initial fiscal plan was rejected by the PROMESA oversight board, which claimed the proposal relied on overly optimistic baseline revenue assumptions, economic projections and forecasted savings resulting from measures to reduce public expenditures. A revised fiscal plan was submitted by the Puerto Rico governor on March 11, 2017, including $262 million in additional revenue and changes to healthcare funding. On March 13, 2017, the PROMESA oversight board certified the revised fiscal plan, provided that two amendments are made. One amendment would institute the PROMESA oversight board\u2019s earlier proposal for furloughing most government employees four days a month, with two days for teachers and none for law enforcement officers, by July 1st, 2017 (the beginning of fiscal year 2018), and eliminate the annual Christmas bonus for government workers if the Puerto Rico government does not come up with plans to increase liquidity by $200 million and implement its plan to \u201cright-size\u201d its operations in a fiscal year 2018 budget proposal by April 30th. If it does, the cost-savings measures would be delayed until September 1st. A further determination would then be made as to whether the savings measures are needed or to what extent needed. The other amendment would require an agreement between the Puerto Rico government and the PROMESA oversight board to reduce pension costs 10% by 2020 to be reached within 30 days and finalized by June 30th.\nWith respect to the PREPA, on December 23, 2015, PREPA and more than 70% of its creditors reached an agreement on an RSA that would provide, among other things, for a restructuring of some of PREPA\u2019s outstanding debt at 85 cents on the dollar. The RSA also included a BPA whereby certain of those creditors would purchase new bonds to be issued by PREPA. The implementation of the RSA would provide the basis for PREPA to provide more reliable and lower-cost service, fund its capital needs for the medium term, help ensure environmental compliance, diversify generation resources to include more natural gas, and provide jobs.\nLegislation to establish the necessary securitization framework for the new PREPA debt was passed on February 16, 2016. In June 2016, the Puerto Rico Energy Commission approved a \u201ctransition\u201d charge to PREPA customers that will secure the new debt that will be issued to facilitate the PREPA restructuring. In May and June of 2016, certain bondholders purchased $115 million of bonds pursuant to the BPA. The BPA was amended in late June and bondholders purchased another $264 million on June 30, 2016. Following the BPA amendment, PREPA made the full principal and interest payment due on July 1, 2016. On January 1, 2017, PREPA made its full interest payment and did so without requiring any type of BPA\nOn January 27, 2017, the AAFAF notified all creditors involved that it was extending the January 31, 2017 expiration date of the RSA until March 31, 2017. In addition, AAFAF also notified the parties together with its financial advisors Rothchild, that it would lead negotiations with PREPA creditors.\nAs of December 31, 2016, the Corporation had $323.3 million of direct exposure to the Puerto Rico government, its municipalities and public corporations, compared to $360.7 million as of December 31, 2015. Approximately $191.9 million of the exposure consisted of loans and obligations of municipalities in Puerto Rico that are supported by assigned property tax revenues and for which, in most cases, the good faith, credit and unlimited taxing power of the applicable municipality have been pledged to their repayment. Approximately 89% of the Corporation\u2019s municipality exposure consists primarily of senior priority obligations concentrated in five of the largest municipalities in Puerto Rico (San Juan, Carolina, Bayamon, Mayaguez and Guaynabo). These municipalities are required by law to levy special property taxes in such amounts as shall be required for the payment of all of their respective general obligation bonds and loans. Although the PROMESA oversight board has not designated any of the Commonwealth\u2019s 78 municipalities as covered entities under PROMESA, it may decide to do so in the future. While the fiscal plan submitted by the Puerto Rico governor to the PROMESA oversight board on February 28, 2017 did not contemplate a restructuring of the debt of Puerto\nRico\u2019s municipalities, the plan did call for the gradual elimination of budgetary subsidies provided to municipalities, which constitute a material portion of the operating revenues of certain municipalities. The PROMESA oversight board had previously expressly called for the elimination of these budgetary subsidies as part of any certified fiscal plan. Furthermore, municipalities are also likely to be affected by the negative economic and other effects resulting from expense, revenue or cash management measures taken to address the Puerto Rico government\u2019s fiscal and liquidity shortfalls. In addition to municipalities, the total exposure to the Puerto Rico government entities covered by PROMESA included $6.9 million of loans to units of the Puerto Rico central government, and approximately $81.9 million consisted of loans to public corporations (entities covered by PROMESA), including the direct exposure to PREPA with a book value of $65.5 million as of December 31, 2016 that was sold in the first quarter of 2017 as described above. See \u201cSignificant Events Since the Beginning of 2016 - Sale of the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority Loan\u201d. The PREPA credit facility was placed in non-accrual status in the first quarter of 2015, and interest payments recorded on a cost-recovery basis. The Corporation\u2019s total direct exposure also includes obligations of the Puerto Rico government with an amortized cost of $42.7 million as part of its available-for-sale investment securities portfolio, net of $22.2 million in cumulative OTTI charges, and recorded at a fair value of $26.8 million as of December 31, 2016.\nFurthermore, as of December 31, 2016, the Corporation had $127.7 million outstanding (book value of $111.8 million) in credit facilities extended to the hotel industry in Puerto Rico under which the borrower and the operations of the underlying collateral are the primary sources of repayment and the TDF provides a secondary guarantee for payment performance, compared to $129.4 million outstanding as of December 31, 2015. The TDF is a subsidiary of the GDB that facilitates private sector financings to Puerto Rico\u2019s hotel industry. Adverse developments related to the Puerto Rico government\u2019s fiscal situation introduced additional uncertainty regarding the TDF\u2019s ability to honor its guarantee, including the enactment of Act 21. These facilities were placed in non-accrual status and classified as impaired in the first quarter of 2016, and interest payments are now applied against principal. The Corporation has been receiving payments on the largest of these three facilities sufficient to cover the monthly contractual payments. This facility matured on February 1, 2017 and is currently under renegotiation. In addition, the borrowers\u2019 cash flows related to the other two facilities are insufficient to cover debt service and the Corporation is not receiving collections from the TDF guarantee. As such, these two facilities are collateral dependent loans and charge-offs amounting to $13.9 million were recorded during the second half of 2016, of which $13.0 million was charged against reserves established in prior periods. These loans have been adversely classified since the third quarter of 2015. As of December 31, 2016, the loans guaranteed by the TDF are being carried at 72% of unpaid principal balance, net of reserves and accumulated charge-offs. The Corporation measures impairment on these loans based on the fair value of the collateral and the existence of the government guarantee. Developments of the Puerto Rico government debt restructuring process, with the automatic stay on litigations under PROMESA set to expire on May 1, 2017, and actions taken or those that may have to be taken by the Commonwealth or the PROMESA oversight board to address Puerto Rico\u2019s fiscal and economic crisis could ultimately adversely affect the value of the Puerto Rico government guarantees, including the TDF guarantee. If as a result of developments, including discussions with regulators, loan rating downgrades, progress in the debt restructuring process, or for other reasons, the Corporation determines that additional impairment charges are necessary, such an action would adversely affect the Corporation\u2019s results of operations in the period in which such determination is taken.\nIn addition, the Corporation had $119.9 million in exposure to residential mortgage loans that are guaranteed by the Puerto Rico Housing Finance Authority. Residential mortgage loans guaranteed by the Puerto Rico Housing Finance Authority are secured by the underlying properties and the guarantees serve to cover shortfalls in collateral in the event of a borrower default. The Puerto Rico government guarantees up to $75 million of the principal guaranteed under the mortgage loans insurance program. According to the most recently released audited financial statements of the Puerto Rico Housing Financing Authority, as of June 30, 2015, the Puerto Rico Housing Finance Authority\u2019s mortgage loans insurance program covered loans aggregating approximately $552 million. The regulations adopted by the Puerto Rico Housing Finance Authority require the establishment of adequate reserves to guarantee the solvency of the mortgage loans insurance fund. As of June 30, 2015, the most recent date as to which information is available, the Puerto Rico Housing Finance Authority had a restricted net position for such purposes of approximately $77.4 million.\nFurthermore, as of December 31, 2016, the Corporation had $408.8 million of public sector deposits in Puerto Rico. Approximately 28% is from municipalities and municipal agencies in Puerto Rico and 72% is from public corporations and the central government and agencies in Puerto Rico.\nThe decline in Puerto Rico\u2019s economy since 2006 has resulted in, among other things, a decline in our loan originations, an increase in the level of our non-performing assets, higher loan loss provisions and charge-offs, and an increase in the rate of foreclosure loss on mortgage loans, all of which adversely affected our profitability. During the next four fiscal years, the Commonwealth expects to confront various events that may significantly reduce its revenues or increase its expenditures. To the extent the Commonwealth is unable to address these events, its ability to continue operating and providing essential services to its population may be severely compromised. Any further potential deterioration of economic activity could result in further adverse effects on our profitability and credit quality.\nContinuation of the economic slowdown and decline in the U.S. Virgin Islands could continue to harm our results of operations.\nThe fiscal health of the government of the USVI over the past 10 years has shown signs of deterioration evidenced by persistent budgetary deficits and projected future revenue shortfalls. The accumulated deficit position in the general fund at the end of the fiscal\nyear 2015 was in excess of $74 million and the annual deficit for fiscal year 2016 is projected to be nearly $14 million. In addition to the general fund situation, the USVI is also experiencing growth in its unfunded actuarial accrued liability.\nThe government of the USVI has developed a five-year financial plan, designed to return the general fund to fiscal stability. The fiscal stabilization plan includes a number of revenue enhancement initiatives as well as reductions to government operating expenses. Many of the USVI government\u2019s revenue enhancement initiatives are subject to legislative approval and are in the form of tax increases which could potentially have an adverse effect on the economy. The fiscal stabilization plan is also predicated on access of the government to the financial markets in order to issue deficit financing to cover the operating deficits for 2017 and 2018, which is uncertain.\nAs of December 31, 2016, the Corporation has total exposure to the USVI government and its instrumentalities of $84.7 million. All loans are currently performing and up to date with its principal and interest payments.\nDifficult market conditions have affected the financial industry and may adversely affect us in the future.\nGiven that most of our business is in Puerto Rico and the United States and given the degree of interrelation between Puerto Rico\u2019s economy and that of the United States, we are exposed to downturns in the U.S. economy, including factors such as unemployment and underemployment levels in the United States and real estate valuations. The deterioration of these conditions could adversely affect the credit performance of mortgage loans, credit default swaps and other derivatives, and result in significant write-downs of asset values by financial institutions, including government-sponsored entities as well as major commercial banks and investment banks.\nDespite improving labor markets in the U.S. in the past year, an elevated amount of underemployment and household debt, the volatile interest rate environment, along with a continued sluggish recovery in the consumer real estate market and certain commercial real estate markets in the U.S., pose challenges for the U.S. economic performance and the financial services industry.\nIn particular, we may face the following risks:\n\u00b7 Our ability to assess the creditworthiness of our customers may be impaired if the models and approaches we use to select, manage, and underwrite the loans become less predictive of future behaviors.\n\u00b7 The models used to estimate losses inherent in the credit exposure require difficult, subjective, and complex judgments, including forecasts of economic conditions and how these economic predictions might impair the ability of the borrowers to repay their loans, which may no longer be capable of accurate estimation and which may, in turn, impact the reliability of the models.\n\u00b7 Our ability to borrow from other financial institutions or to engage in sales of mortgage loans to third parties (including mortgage loan securitization transactions with government-sponsored entities and repurchase agreements) on favorable terms, or at all, could be adversely affected by further disruptions in the capital markets or other events, including deteriorating investor expectations.\n\u00b7 Competitive dynamics in the industry could change as a result of consolidation of financial services companies in connection with current market conditions.\n\u00b7 We expect to face increased regulation of our industry. Compliance with such regulation may increase our costs and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities.\n\u00b7 There may be downward pressure on our stock price.\nThe deterioration of economic conditions in the U.S. and disruptions in the financial markets could adversely affect our ability to access capital, our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to comply with the Written Agreement, which could result in further regulatory enforcement actions.\nThe failure of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.\nOur ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by future failures of financial institutions and the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty and other relationships. We have exposure to different industries and counterparties and routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, investment companies and other institutional clients. In certain of these transactions, we are required to post collateral to secure the obligations to the counterparties. In the event of a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding involving one of such counterparties, we may experience delays in recovering the assets posted as collateral, or we may incur a loss to the extent that the counterparty was holding collateral in excess of the obligation to such counterparty, such as the loss of our assets that we pledged to Lehman Brothers, Inc., which we have been trying to recover, so far unsuccessfully.\nIn addition, many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of a default by our counterparty or client. In addition, the credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover\nthe full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due to us. Any losses resulting from our routine funding transactions may materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nLegislative and regulatory actions taken now or in the future may increase our costs and impact our business, governance structure, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe and our subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation by multiple regulatory bodies. These regulations may affect the manner and terms of delivery of our services. If we do not comply with governmental regulations, we may be subject to fines, penalties, lawsuits or material restrictions on our businesses in the jurisdiction where the violation occurred, which may adversely affect our business operations. Changes in these regulations can significantly affect the services that we are asked to provide as well as our costs of compliance with such regulations. In addition, adverse publicity and damage to our reputation arising from the failure or perceived failure to comply with legal, regulatory or contractual requirements could affect our ability to attract and retain customers.\nThe financial crisis of 2008 resulted in government regulatory agencies and political bodies placing increased focus and scrutiny on the financial services industry. The U.S. government intervened on an unprecedented scale, responding by temporarily enhancing the liquidity support available to financial institutions, establishing a commercial paper funding facility, temporarily guaranteeing money market funds and certain types of debt issuances and increasing insurance on bank deposits.\nThese programs have subjected financial institutions, particularly those participating in TARP, to additional restrictions, oversight and costs. In addition, new proposals for legislation are periodically introduced in the U.S. Congress that could further substantially increase regulation of the financial services industry, impose restrictions on the operations and general ability of firms within the industry to conduct business consistent with historical practices, including in the areas of interest rates, financial product offerings and disclosures, and have an effect on bankruptcy proceedings with respect to consumer residential real estate mortgages, among other things. Federal and state regulatory agencies also frequently adopt changes to their regulations or change the manner in which existing regulations are applied.\nFinancial deregulation measures proposed by the Trump administration and members of the U.S. Congress may create regulatory uncertainty for the financial sector, increase competition in certain of our investment strategies and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Trump administration\u2019s short-term legislative agenda may include certain deregulatory measures for the U.S. financial services industry including changes to the Volcker Rule, the U.S. Risk Retention Rules, Basel III capital requirements, the FSOC\u2019s authority and other aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act. On February 3, 2017, President Trump signed an executive order calling for the administration to review U.S. financial laws and regulations in order to determine their consistency with a set of core principles identified in the order. One bill, the Financial CHOICE Act (the \u201cCHOICE Act\u201d), which was sponsored by Rep. Jeb Hensarling last year but was not enacted, is being discussed as an avenue for amending the Dodd-Frank Act and may be subject to revisions and reintroduction in the current session of Congress. The most recent version of the CHOICE Act would eliminate the power of the FSOC to designate non-bank financial institutions as systematically important, repeal the Volcker Rule and change the structure and powers of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. In addition, the CHOICE Act would allow certain qualifying banking organizations with a satisfactory composite supervisory rating and a non-risk weighted leverage ratio of at least 10% to elect to be exempt from enhanced risk-weighted capital ratios, liquidity requirements and other regulations currently applicable to large banking organizations, and would revise the U.S. Risk Retention Rules to remove the risk retention requirement for all asset-backed securitizations other than for certain non-qualifying residential mortgage securitizations. The CHOICE Act also would significantly alter stress testing, possibly exempting qualifying banking organizations from stress tests altogether and eliminating the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s ability to make \u201cqualitative\u201d objections to capital plans submitted by other banking organizations. In addition, the CHOICE Act would also significantly enhance the SEC\u2019s enforcement capabilities and increase the maximum civil penalties and criminal sanctions under federal securities laws, including under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.\nWhether the CHOICE Act will be enacted, and, if so, whether additional amendments would be added during the legislative process remains unclear. However, the results of the recent elections have increased the likelihood that the CHOICE Act or similar financial reform legislation will be enacted. In addition, in the absence of legislative change, the Trump administration may influence the substance of regulatory supervision through, among other things, the appointment of individuals to the Federal Reserve Board. As a result of the recent notice of resignation by one member of the Federal Reserve Board, President Trump is expected to soon be able to nominate persons to fill three of the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s seven seats, including a Vice Chairman for Supervision. In turn, the nomination of new Federal Reserve Board members by Mr. Trump may increase the likelihood that the Federal Reserve Board will depart from adopting capital and liquidity requirements for U.S. banking organizations that are more stringent than those that have been agreed upon at the international level, including the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision\u2019s Basel III framework.\nMeasures focused on deregulation of the U.S. financial services industry may have the effect of increasing competition for our credit-focused businesses or otherwise reducing investment opportunities. Increased competition from banks and other financial institutions in the credit markets could have the effect of reducing credit spreads, which may adversely affect the revenues of our credit and other businesses whose strategies including the provision of credit to borrowers.\nDetermining the full extent of the impact on us of any such potential financial reform legislation, or whether any such particular proposal will become law, at this point in time is highly speculative. However, any such changes may impose additional costs on us, require the attention of our senior management or result in limitations on the manner in which business is conducted.\nWe could be adversely affected by changes in tax laws and regulations or the interpretation of such laws and regulations.\nThe Corporation and its subsidiaries are subject to Puerto Rico income tax laws on their income from all sources. As Puerto Rico corporations, First BanCorp. and its subsidiaries are treated as foreign corporations for U.S. and USVI income tax purposes and are generally subject to U.S. and USVI income tax only on their income from sources within the U.S. and USVI or income effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in those regions. These tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations. We must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws when determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and our valuation allowance. In addition, legislative changes, particularly changes in tax laws, could adversely impact our results of operations.\nFinancial services legislation and regulatory reforms may have a significant impact on our business and results of operations and on our credit ratings.\nThe Corporation faces increased regulation and regulatory scrutiny as a result of, among other things, its participation in the Troubled Assets Relief Program. The U.S. Treasury acquired shares of common stock from the Corporation in October 2011 in exchange for shares of preferred stock that it owned because of the Corporation\u2019s issuance of preferred stock to U.S. Treasury in January 2009 pursuant to the TARP. In July 2010, the Corporation issued to U.S. Treasury a warrant, which amends, restates and replaces the original warrant that it issued to U.S. Treasury in January 2009 under the TARP. The Corporation\u2019s participation in the TARP also imposes limitations on the payments it may make to its senior leaders. For more details on the implications of TARP please refer to the risks factors titled as follow: \u201cCompetition for our executives and other key employees is intense, and we may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled people we need to support our business\u201d above.\nAs discussed above, the Dodd-Frank Act significantly changed the regulation of financial institutions and the financial services industry. The Dodd-Frank Act includes, and the regulations developed and to be developed thereunder include or will include, provisions affecting large and small financial institutions alike. In addition, U.S. banking organizations, including the Corporation and FirstBank, are subject to new and more stringent regulatory capital requirements that generally increase the amounts of capital that we need to hold.\nAs of December 31, 2016, the Corporation had $210 million in trust preferred securities that are now subject to the full phase-out from Tier 1 capital under the final regulatory capital rules discussed above.\nAlthough First BanCorp. and FirstBank were able to meet well-capitalized capital ratios upon implementation of the requirements, and we expect both companies will continue to exceed the minimum risk-based and leverage capital ratio requirements for well-capitalized status under the new capital rules, we may not remain well capitalized.\nAdditional regulatory proposals and legislation, if finally adopted, could change banking laws and our operating environment and that of our subsidiaries in substantial and unpredictable ways. The ultimate effect that such legislation, if enacted, or regulations would have upon our financial condition or results of operations may be adverse.\nWe are subject to regulatory capital adequacy guidelines, and if we fail to meet these guidelines our business and financial condition will be adversely affected.\nUnder regulatory capital adequacy guidelines, and other regulatory requirements, the Corporation and our banking subsidiary must meet guidelines that include quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off balance sheet items, subject to qualitative judgments by regulators regarding components, risk weightings and other factors. If we fail to meet these minimum capital guidelines and other regulatory requirements, our business and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected. If we fail to maintain certain capital levels, or are deemed not well managed under regulatory exam procedures, or if we experience certain regulatory violations, our status as a financial holding company, and our ability to offer certain financial products will be compromised and our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nRulemaking changes implemented by the CFPB will result in higher regulatory and compliance costs related to originating and servicing residential mortgage loans and may adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act significantly changed the regulation of single-family residential mortgage lending in the United States. Among other things, the law transferred rule-making and enforcement powers from a number of federal agencies to the CFPB, imposed new risk retention and recordkeeping requirements on lenders (such as the Bank) that sell single-family residential mortgage loans in the secondary market, required revision of disclosure documents, limited loan originator compensation and expanded recordkeeping and reporting requirements under other federal statutes.\nNew regulations implement the Dodd-Frank Act amendments to the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Truth in Lending Act, and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act. See \u201cRegulation and Supervision - Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\u201d\nAmong other consequences of these numerous changes, the requirements relating to the evaluation of the borrower\u2019s ability to repay the loan may result in reduced credit availability and higher borrowing costs to cover the costs of compliance. The ability of borrowers to raise new defenses in foreclosure proceedings on defaulted mortgage loans also may lead to increased foreclosure costs, extend foreclosure timeliness, and increase the severity of loan losses. Increased repurchase and indemnity requests with respect to mortgage loans sold into the secondary markets may also result.\nThese and other changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act have required substantial modifications to the entire mortgage lending and servicing industry. Their impact may involve changes to our operations and increased compliance costs in making single-family residential mortgage loans. There are new laws and regulations that come into effect in 2017 and 2018 affecting the residential mortgage business and commercial business which may cause us to incur additional increased regulatory and compliance costs. Notwithstanding the above, the new administration has expressed its disagreement with the burden of new regulations and requirements. In addition, House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling issued a press release on January 26, 2017 stating that replacing the Dodd-Frank Act is a top administration and congressional priority. At this point, however, it is uncertain whether any of these regulatory burdens will be relaxed.\nCompliance with stress testing requirements may be challenging.\nThe Corporation is currently subject to supervisory guidance for stress testing practices issued by the federal banking agencies. The current guidance outlines broad principles for a satisfactory stress testing framework and describes various stress testing approaches and how stress testing should be used at various levels within an organization. As previously discussed, the Corporation is also subject to two new stress testing rules that implement provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, one issued by the Federal Reserve Board that applies to First BanCorp. on a consolidated basis and one issued by the FDIC that applies to the Bank.\nThe Corporation submitted its second annual company-run stress test to regulators in July 2016, which was published in October 2016.\nFuture public disclosure of stress test results could result in reputational harm if the Corporation\u2019s results are worse than those of its competitors or otherwise indicate that the Corporation\u2019s risk profile is excessive or elevated. Furthermore, given that the Corporation will be subject to multiple stress testing requirements that are administered at different levels by more than one federal banking agency, and compliance with such requirements will be complicated, if the Corporation fails to fully comply with these requirements, it may be subject to regulatory action.\nMonetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition to being affected by general economic conditions, our earnings and growth are affected by the policies of the Federal Reserve Board. An important function of the Federal Reserve Board is to regulate the money supply and credit conditions. Among the instruments used by the Federal Reserve Board to implement these objectives are open market operations in U.S. government securities, adjustments of the discount rate and changes in reserve requirements against bank deposits. These instruments are used in varying combinations to influence overall economic growth and the distribution of credit, bank loans, investments and deposits. Their use also affects interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits.\nThe monetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. The effects of such policies upon our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adverse.\nWe are subject to numerous laws designed to protect consumers, including the Community Reinvestment Act and fair lending laws, and failure to comply with these laws could lead to a wide variety of sanctions.\nThe Community Reinvestment Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act and other fair lending laws and regulations impose nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions. The Department of Justice and other federal agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations. A successful regulatory challenge to an institution's performance under the Community Reinvestment Act or fair lending laws and regulations could result in a wide variety of sanctions, including damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, restrictions on mergers and acquisitions activity, restrictions on expansion and\nrestrictions on entering new business lines. Private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution's performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation. Such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face a risk of noncompliance and enforcement action related to the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations.\nThe Bank Secrecy Act, the USA PATRIOT Act and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program and file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports as appropriate. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network is authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and has recently engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts with the individual federal banking regulators, as well as the U.S. Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration. We are also subject to increased scrutiny of compliance with trade and economic sanctions requirements and rules enforced by the Office of Foreign Assets Control. If our policies, procedures and systems are deemed deficient, we would be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions, which may include restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of our business plan, including our acquisition plans. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for us. Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRISKS RELATING TO AN INVESTMENT IN THE CORPORATION\u2019S COMMON AND PREFERRED STOCK\nSales in the public market of the approximately 23% of our outstanding shares of common stock that are held by a small group of large stockholders could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nThe following stockholders own an aggregate of approximately 23.2% of our outstanding shares of common stock: funds affiliated with Thomas H. Lee Partners, L.P. (\u201cTHL\u201d), which own approximately 9.2%, and funds managed by Oaktree Capital Management, L.P. (\u201cOaktree\u201d), which own approximately 9.2%, and the U.S. Treasury, which owns approximately 4.7%, excluding shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the U.S. Treasury\u2019s warrant. We have registered these securities for resale under the Securities Act of 1933 and are obligated to keep the prospectus, which is part of the resale registration statement filed with the SEC, current so that the securities can be sold in the public market at any time. The resale of the securities in the public market, or the perception that these sales might occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nIssuance of additional equity securities in the public markets and other capital management or business strategies that we may pursue could depress the market price of our common stock and could result in dilution of holders of our common stock, including purchasers of our common stock under the resale registration statement.\nGenerally, we are not restricted from issuing additional equity securities, including common stock. We may choose to sell additional equity securities, or we could be required in the future to identify, consider and pursue additional capital management strategies to bolster our capital position. We may issue equity securities (including convertible securities, preferred securities, and options and warrants on our common or preferred stock securities) in the future for a number of reasons, including to finance our operations and business strategy, adjust our leverage ratio, address regulatory capital concerns, restructure currently outstanding debt or equity securities or satisfy our obligations upon the exercise of outstanding options or warrants. Future issuances of our equity securities, including common stock, in any transaction that we may pursue may dilute the interests of our existing holders of our common stock and preferred stock and cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nThe Corporation has outstanding a warrant held by the U.S. Treasury to purchase 1,285,899 shares of common stock. If the warrant is exercised, the issuance of shares of common stock would reduce our income per share, and further reduce the book value per share and voting power of our current common stockholders.\nAdditionally, THL and Oaktree have anti-dilution rights, which they acquired when they purchased shares of our common stock in the October 2011 $525 million capital raise. These rights have been, and will be in the future, triggered, subject to certain exceptions, upon our issuance of additional shares of common stock. In such a case, THL and Oaktree had, and will have, the right to acquire the amount of shares of common stock that will enable them to maintain their percentage ownership interest in the Corporation.\nThe market price of our common stock may continue to be subject to significant fluctuations and volatility.\nThe stock markets have frequently experienced high levels of volatility since 2008. These market fluctuations have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, the trading price of our common stock. In addition, the market price of our common stock has been subject to significant fluctuations and volatility because of factors specifically related to our businesses and may continue to fluctuate or decline.\nFactors that could cause fluctuations, volatility or a decline in the market price of our common stock, many of which could be beyond our control, include the following:\n\u00b7 uncertainties and developments related to the resolution of the Puerto Rico government\u2019s fiscal problems;\n\u00b7 our ability to continue to comply with the Written Agreement;\n\u00b7 any additional regulatory actions against us;\n\u00b7 changes or perceived changes in the condition, operations, results or prospects of our businesses and market assessments of these changes or perceived changes;\n\u00b7 announcements of strategic developments, acquisitions and other material events by us or our competitors, including any failures of banks;\n\u00b7 changes in governmental regulations or proposals, or new governmental regulations or proposals, affecting us;\n\u00b7 a continuing recession in the Puerto Rico market and a lack of growth in our other principal markets in the USVI, BVI and U.S.;\n\u00b7 the departure of key employees;\n\u00b7 changes in the credit, mortgage and real estate markets;\n\u00b7 operating results that vary from the expectations of management, securities analysts and investors;\n\u00b7 operating and stock price performance of companies that investors deem comparable to us; and\n\u00b7 the public perception of the banking industry and its safety and soundness.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and the NYSE and the other trading markets for the securities of commercial banks and other financial services companies in particular, have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that sometimes have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance or Puerto Rico\u2019s economic environment. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted. A securities class action suit against us could result in substantial costs, potential liabilities and the diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources.\nOur suspension of dividends may have adversely affected and may further adversely affect our stock price and could result in the expansion of our Board of Directors.\nIn consideration of the financial results reported for the second quarter ended June 30, 2009, we decided, as a matter of prudent fiscal management and following applicable Federal Reserve Board\u2019s guidance, to suspend the payment of dividends. The Corporation\u2019s ability to declare and pay dividends is dependent on certain Federal regulatory considerations, including the guidelines of the Federal Reserve Board regarding capital adequacy and dividends and on the requirements of the Written Agreement which requires prior written approval of the Federal Reserve to declare or pay dividends. During the fourth quarter of 2016, following the requisite regulatory approval, the Corporation announced the declaration of a cash dividend on its outstanding shares of Series A through E Noncumulative Perpetual Monthly Income Preferred Stock for the month of December 2016. Dividends on our Series A through E Preferred Stock had not been paid since July 2009. The Corporation has to date receive approval to pay the monthly dividends on the Corporation\u2019s Series A through E Preferred Stock through March 2017. Although there is no assurance that any dividends will be declared on the Corporation\u2019s Series A through E Preferred Stock in any future periods, the Corporation intends to continue to request the Federal Reserve\u2019s approval pursuant to the requirements of the Written Agreement to enable it to continue to pay the monthly dividends on its Series A through E Preferred Stock.\nThe holders of the preferred stock have the right to appoint two additional members to our Board of Directors. Any member of the Board of Directors appointed by the holders of Series A through E Preferred Stock is required to vacate his or her office if the Corporation resumes the payment of dividends in full for twelve consecutive monthly dividend periods.", "PERMNO": 11018, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "FBP"}
