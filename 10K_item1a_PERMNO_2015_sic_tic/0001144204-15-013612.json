Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the following factors and all other information contained in this Report before you make any investment decisions with respect to our securities.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe may be unable to continue as a going concern based on our historical performance, which has included losses, an accumulated deficit, and a working capital deficit. We may continue to generate losses and be unable to service our outstanding liabilities in the future.\nWe have historically incurred operating losses, and we may continue to generate negative cash flows as we implement our business plan for 2015. There can be no assurance that our continuing efforts to execute our business plan will be successful and that we will be able to continue as a going concern. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with US GAAP, which contemplates our continuation as a going concern. Our net loss for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $2.4 million as compared to net income of $28.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The operating results for the year ended December 31, 2014 included $3.3 million of net losses related to financing instruments, a net gain of $4.2 million from extinguishment of debt and the operating results for the year ended December 31, 2013 included $26.7 million of net gains related to financing instruments.\nNet cash used in operations during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 was $0.4 million each period. As of December 31, 2014, we have an accumulated deficit of $239.4 million. We also have a working capital deficit of $39.2 million, including $37.4 million in current liabilities for our derivative and debenture financing instruments which are due August 1, 2015 and for which we do not have the necessary capital to re-pay.\nWe currently do not have sufficient cash or commitments for financing to sustain our operations for the next twelve months if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations. Our plan continues to be to develop new client and customer relationships and substantially increase our revenue derived from our products/services and IP licensing. If our revenues do not reach the level anticipated in our plan, we may require additional financing in order to execute our operating plan. If additional financing is required, we cannot predict whether this additional financing will be in the form of equity, debt, or another form, and we may not be able to obtain the necessary additional capital on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all. In the event that financing sources are not available, or that we are unsuccessful in increasing our revenues and profits, we may be unable to implement our current plans for expansion, repay our debt obligations or respond to competitive pressures, any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe convertible debentures and preferred stock used to finance the Company, which may be converted into common stock at the sole option of the holders, have a highly dilutive impact when they are converted, greatly increasing the number of shares of common stock outstanding. During 2014, there were 3,834 million shares of common stock issued for these conversions. We cannot predict if or when each holder may or may not elect to convert into shares of common stock.\nIn May 2014, we completed a merger to increase the quantity of authorized shares of common stock available for issuance to satisfy the conversion rights under certain outstanding convertible securities and avoid an event of default. We can provide no assurance that the additional quantity of authorized shares will be sufficient to satisfy all future conversions of the outstanding convertible securities. If we have insufficient authorized shares in the future due to security conversions or otherwise and are unable to respond to requests for conversion, we may be subject to an event of default under the terms of such instruments.\nOur management and Board may be unable to execute their plans to grow our revenues and achieve continued profitability and positive cash flows, which could cause us to discontinue our operations. The risk associated with a possible discontinuance of the business could prevent us from attracting or retaining key personnel, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf our management and Board are unable to maintain and execute our plans, then we may fail to grow our revenues, manage costs and achieve continued profitability and positive cash flows, which may cause us to discontinue our operations. The risks associated with the possible discontinuance of the business could further prevent us from attracting and retaining management and staff, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAll of our assets are pledged to secure certain debt obligations. If we fail to repay and/or otherwise satisfy the debt obligations, our assets could be seized and liquidated for the benefit of the debt holders.\nThe convertible debentures that were initially issued to YA Global are secured by all of our assets. The secured convertible debentures mature on August 1, 2015. In the event we are unable to repay and/or otherwise satisfy the secured convertible debentures in accordance with the related agreements, our assets could be seized and liquidated for the benefit of the debt holders and result in the discontinuance of our business.\nOur future profitability depends on the timely introduction of new and updated products and the acceptance of these new and updated products in the marketplace.\nRapid technological change and market development are typical for the industries we serve. Our future revenue and profitability will depend in large part on timely development and introduction of new and upgraded products that address evolving market requirements. If we fail to effectively launch new and innovative products or allow our current product offerings to become stale in our advancing industry, we may lose market share to our competitors. Any inability, for technological or other reasons, to successfully grow and upgrade our product portfolio could materially adversely affect our business.\nExisting shareholders will experience significant dilution when certain investors, such as YA Global, convert their preferred stock to common stock, convert convertible debentures to common stock, or when the investors exercise their warrants for common stock.\nThe issuance of shares of common stock pursuant to the conversion of our Series C and D convertible preferred stock, the conversion of convertible debentures to common stock, or the exercise of warrants could result in a significant increase in the outstanding shares of common stock and will have a material dilutive impact on our shareholders. Additionally, our net earnings per share would decrease and the market price of our common stock per share would decline.\nOur common stock is deemed to be \u201cpenny stock\u201d which may make it more difficult for investors to sell their shares due to suitability requirements.\nOur common stock is deemed to be \u201cpenny stock\u201d as defined in Rule 3a51-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d). Certain requirements regarding penny stocks may reduce the potential market for our common stock by reducing the number of potential investors. The penny stock designation could make it more difficult for investors in our common stock to sell shares to third parties or to otherwise dispose of them. This could cause our stock price to decline.\nBroker-dealers dealing in penny stocks are required to provide potential investors with a document disclosing the risks of penny stocks. Moreover, broker-dealers are required to determine whether an investment in a penny stock is a suitable investment for a prospective investor. These requirements reduce the potential market of investors in our stock and could cause the stock price to decline. The potential market for \u201cpenny stocks\u201d is further reduced by a Deposit Trust Company (\u201cDTC\u201d) \u201cchill\u201d, which prevents trading from occurring on the electronic trading system as further described below.\nDue to the accounting treatment of the convertible preferred stock, warrants and convertible debenture instruments issued by us, our net income or loss may not be reflective of our operating performance and could have a material adverse impact on our market\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, we reported a net loss of $2.4 million and a net income of $28.5 million respectively. The net losses resulted primarily from non-cash losses arising from the adjustment to value our derivative and debenture liabilities at fair value. The loss adjustments are primarily due to modifications to the terms of the convertible debentures including the extension of the maturity date to August 2015. We adjust the value of these liabilities to reflect the estimated fair value at each balance sheet date. As a result, we could experience significant fluctuations in our reported net income or losses in future periods from financing related gains or losses incurred to record the liabilities at fair value. The financing related gains and losses incurred to record the liabilities at fair value have historically been significant and have resulted in net losses that are not reflective of the Company\u2019s operating performance as reporting in operating income or loss. The complexity associated the fair value calculations and sophistication required by investors to distinguish and understand our operating performance relative to the reported net income and losses may cause our financial statements to be difficult to comprehend, analyze, and assess. As a result, the potential investor market for our common stock could be reduced resulting in a material adverse impact on our market value.\nA majority of our assets are intangible assets, which will have little or no value if our operations do not generate current or future cash flow.\nAt December 31, 2014, a majority of our total assets were intangible assets, consisting primarily of rights related to our patents and other intellectual property. If our results of operations do not generate sufficient cash flows in the future, the assets will have little or no value, which could lead to us recognizing impairment losses for such assets. This could materially adversely affect the value of our stock and the ability of our shareholders to recoup their investments in our stock.\nAt December 31, 2013, we carried goodwill arising from the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of tangible assets acquired in our purchase of NeoMedia Europe GmbH. We test goodwill for impairment annually or when events or changes in circumstances may warrant. We may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined, resulting in a materially adverse impact on our results of operations. As a result of our testing goodwill for impairment at December 31, 2014, we determined that our goodwill was fully impaired.\nWe may not be able to compete effectively in markets where our competitors have more resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur market is highly competitive and characterized by an increasing number of entrants that have introduced or developed products and services similar to those we offer. We believe that competition will continue to intensify and increase in the near future. Our target market is rapidly evolving and is subject to continuous technological change. As a result, our competitors may be better positioned to address these developments or may react more favorably to these changes, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to protect our intellectual property rights and may be liable for infringing the intellectual property rights of others, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur success is dependent upon our proprietary technology, including patents and other intellectual property, and on the ability to protect proprietary technology and other intellectual property rights. In addition, we must conduct our operations without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties. We also intend to rely upon unpatented trade secrets and the know-how and expertise of our employees, as well as our patents. To protect our proprietary technology and other intellectual property, we rely primarily on a combination of the protections provided by applicable patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws as well as on confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements. Although we believe that we have taken appropriate steps to protect our unpatented proprietary rights, including requiring that our employees and third parties who are granted access to our proprietary technology enter into confidentiality agreements, we can provide no assurance that these measures will be sufficient to protect our rights against third parties. Others may independently develop or otherwise acquire patented or unpatented technologies or products similar or superior to ours.\nSome provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws may deter takeover attempts, which may limit the opportunity of our shareholders to sell their shares at a premium to the then-current market price.\nSome of the provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so might be beneficial to our shareholders by providing them with the opportunity to sell their shares at a premium to the then-current market price. On December 10, 1999, our Board adopted a shareholders\u2019 rights plan and declared a non-taxable dividend of the right to acquire one-one hundredth of a share of our Series A Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, on each outstanding share of our common stock to shareholders of record on December 20, 1999 and each share of common stock issued thereafter until a pre-defined hostile takeover date. The shareholders\u2019 rights plan, or so-called \u201cpoison pill\u201d, was adopted as an anti-takeover measure. The shareholders\u2019 rights plan was designed to enable all shareholders not engaged in a hostile takeover attempt to receive fair and equal treatment in any proposed takeover of us and to guard against partial or two-tiered tender offers, open market accumulations, and other hostile tactics to gain control of us. The shareholders\u2019 rights plan was not adopted in response to any effort to acquire control of us at the time of adoption, however it may have the effect of rendering more difficult, delaying, discouraging, preventing, or rendering more costly an acquisition of us or a change in control of us. Certain shareholders, who were our founders, Charles W. Fritz, William E. Fritz and The Fritz Family Limited Partnership and their holdings, were exempted from the triggering provisions of our shareholders\u2019 rights plan, as a result of the fact that, as of the plan\u2019s adoption, their holdings might have otherwise triggered the plan. The Shareholder Rights Plan was due to expire December 10, 2009; however, it was extended and remains in effect.\nIn addition, our Certificate of Incorporation authorizes our Board to designate and issue preferred stock, in one or more series, the terms of which may be determined at the time of issuance by our Board, without further action by shareholders, and may include voting rights, including the right to vote as a series on particular matters, preferences as to dividends and liquidation, conversion, redemption rights, and sinking fund provisions.\nPreferred stock may have a negative impact on other stockholders or the pursuit of certain corporate actions.\nThe issuance of any preferred stock could have a material adverse effect on the rights of holders of our common stock, and, therefore, could reduce the value of shares of our common stock. In addition, specific rights granted to future holders of preferred stock could be used to restrict our ability to merge with, or sell our assets to, a third party. The ability of our Board to issue preferred stock could have the effect of rendering more difficult, delaying, discouraging, preventing, or rendering more costly an acquisition of us or a change in our control.\nIn the future, there could be government regulations and legal uncertainties that could harm our business.\nAny new legislation or regulation, the application of laws and regulations from jurisdictions whose laws do not currently apply to our business, or the application of existing laws and regulations to the internet and other online services, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations. The growth and development of the market for mobile commerce may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws to impose additional burdens on companies conducting business online. The adoption of any additional laws or regulations may decrease the growth of the internet, mobile telecommunications or other mobile services, which could, in turn, decrease the demand for our services and increase our cost of doing business, or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 84239, "SIC": 7373, "TIC": "NEOM"}
