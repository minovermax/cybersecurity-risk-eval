RISK FACTORS\nRISK FACTORS AND CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS\nOur businesses are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Any of the risks described below or elsewhere in this report on Form 10-K or in our other SEC filings could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. Additional risks and uncertainties we are not presently aware of or that we currently consider immaterial may also affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nOversight of Risk and Related Processes\nA key accountability of the Board of Directors is the oversight of material risk. Management and the Board of Directors have responsibility for overseeing the identification and mitigation of top risks. Management identifies and analyzes risks to determine the impact and other attributes such as timing, likelihood and management control. Identification and analysis occur formally through a top risk assessment conducted by senior management, the financial disclosure process, and internal auditing and compliance with financial and operational controls. Management also identifies and analyzes risk through development of goals and key performance indicators, which include risk identification to determine barriers to implementing our strategy. We promote a culture of compliance, including tone at the top. The process for risk mitigation includes adherence to our code of conduct and compliance policies, operation of formal risk management structures and overall business management to mitigate the risks inherent in the implementation of strategy. We manage and further mitigate risks through formal risk management structures, including a management executive risk committee and services such as internal audit/business risk management and legal. Management communicates regularly with our Board of Directors and key stakeholders regarding risk. Senior management presents and communicates a periodic risk assessment to our Board of Directors which provides information on the risks management believes are material, including the earnings impact, timing, likelihood and management control. The Board of Directors approaches oversight, management and mitigation of risk as an integral and continuous part of its governance of Otter Tail Corporation. The Board of Directors regularly reviews management\u2019s top risk assessment and analyzes areas of existing and future risks and opportunities. Finally, the Board of Directors conducts an annual strategy session where our future plans and initiatives are reviewed.\nOPERATIONAL RISKS\nThe economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and measures taken to arrest its spread, as well as any emergency measures we take in response, could adversely impact our business, including our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.\nThe outbreak and global spread of COVID-19, which has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization, has adversely impacted economic activity and conditions worldwide and is currently impacting our business operations. The extent to which COVID-19 will continue to impact our business is highly uncertain and will depend on future developments, including the efficacy and availability of vaccines, the spread of COVID-19 variants and the extent of federal, state and local government responses affecting the economy. In particular, the COVID-19 pandemic could, among other things:\n\u2022reduce customer demand in our Manufacturing segment, where we experienced a significant but temporary decline in orders in 2020 as many of our customers temporarily closed their plants, which led to actions to reduce our operations, including furloughing of employees and eliminating positions;\n\u2022reduce customer demand in our Electric segment, including demand from commercial and industrial customers;\n\u2022reduce customer demand in our Plastics segment;\n\u2022result in lower PVC pipe sales due to potential delays or cancellation of public water and wastewater infrastructure projects caused by funding shortfalls;\n\u2022lead to disruptions of our workforce;\n\u2022force us to temporarily close certain plants or construction sites if precautions to prevent the spread of the virus at those locations are not effective;\n\u2022increase our bad debt expenses, particularly in our Electric segment;\n\u2022increase our future pension benefit cost and funding requirements;\n\u2022increase health insurance premiums;\n\u2022disrupt the supply chains, delivery systems or construction workforce related to our Electric segment maintenance requirements and capital expenditure plans, resulting in further delays and increased costs;\n\u2022disrupt global financial markets, reducing our ability to access capital necessary to finance such expenditures, and which could in the future negatively affect our liquidity; and\n\u2022result in a recession or market correction that could materially affect our business and the value of our common stock.\nWe continue to monitor developments involving our workforce, customers, construction contractors, suppliers and vendors and take steps to mitigate against additional impacts, but given the unprecedented and evolving nature of these circumstances, we cannot predict the full extent of the impact that COVID-19 will have on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.\nOur strategy includes large capital investments, which are subject to risks.\nOur business strategy includes major capital investments at our existing companies. Our capital investment program planned for the next five years includes investments in renewable generation, transmission asset additions and upgrades, and technology and infrastructure projects. These capital projects are planned years in advance of their in-service dates and are subject to various risks including: obtaining necessary permits, licenses and approvals in a timely manner; adverse changes in regulatory treatment or public policy; changes in commodity pricing, equipment and construction costs; technology changes; delivery delays of critical materials and components; delays caused by construction accidents, injuries or public health crises; adverse weather conditions; unforeseen product defects; limited access to capital; and other adverse conditions. Capital investments in our Electric segment are subject to regulatory approval and are at risk of not being granted timely or full recovery of our investments. The inability to complete capital projects on budget and in a timely manner could adversely impact our financial condition and operating results.\nOur acquisition or disposition strategies are subject to risk and may adversely impact our financial position and operating results.\nAs part of our business strategy, we continually assess our mix of businesses and potential strategic acquisitions or dispositions. This investment strategy is subject to various risks including the ability to identify appropriate acquisition candidates or successfully negotiate and finance any acquisitions. In addition, difficulties in integrating the operations, services, products and personnel of the acquired business, and the potential loss of key employees, customers and suppliers of the acquired business could adversely impact our financial condition and operating results.\nThe sale of any of our businesses may result in the recognition of a loss, if the business is sold for less than its book value and may expose us to risk arising from indemnification obligations that arose out of the conduct of the business prior to the sale. These obligations may include such things as warranty and environmental obligations or the recoverability of certain assets sold as part of the transaction. Unforeseen costs related to these obligations could impact our operating results.\nWeather impacts, including normal seasonal fluctuation and extreme weather events could adversely affect our operating results.\nOur Electric segment business is seasonal and weather patterns can have a material impact on our financial performance. Demand for electricity is normally greater in the winter and summer months. Unusually mild summers and winters could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our Plastics segment businesses are affected by weather\u2019s impact on contractors whose work can be delayed and therefore reduce the need for PVC pipe during winter weather and extreme wet conditions.\nOur businesses are located in areas that could be subject to natural disasters such as severe snow and ice storms, tornadoes, flooding and fires. These factors could result in interruption of our business and damage to our facilities. An extreme weather event within our utility service areas could directly affect our capital assets, causing disruption in service to customers and result in repair or replacement costs, due to downed wires and poles or damage to other operating equipment.\nIn addition to variations in seasonal weather patterns, more widespread climate change may also create physical and financial risk to our businesses. Physical risks of climate change, such as more frequent or more extreme weather events, changes in temperature and precipitation patterns, changes to ground and surface water availability, and other phenomena, could affect some or all of our operations. Severe weather or other natural disasters related to climate change could be destructive and result in increased costs and disruptions in our operations. Extreme weather conditions, such as uncommonly long periods of high or low ambient temperature, in general require more utility system backup, adding to costs and contributing to increased system stress on our utility infrastructure, which could cause service interruptions.\nThe loss of, or significant reduction in revenue from, any of our key customers could have an adverse effect on our operating results.\nWhile no single customer provides more than 10% of our consolidated operating revenue, each of our segments have customers which account for over 10% of the segment\u2019s operating revenues. In 2020, one customer accounted for 11% of Electric segment revenue, three customers combined to account for 46% of Manufacturing segment operating revenue and two customers combined to account for 45% of Plastics segment operating revenue. The loss of any one of these customers, or a significant decline in sales to these customers, would have a significant negative impact on the segment's financial position and operating results, and could have a significant negative impact on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial position and operating results.\nWe are subject to counterparty credit risk.\nWe extend credit to our customers in the ordinary course of business in each of our operating segments. Our customers' ability to pay depends on a variety of factors including macroeconomic conditions, local economic conditions, including unemployment rates, and industry conditions in which our commercial and industrial customers operate. Increased customer delinquencies and bad debts could adversely impact our operating results and liquidity.\nA cyber incident, security breach or system failure could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nThe operation of our business is dependent on the secure function of our computer hardware and software systems. Furthermore, all our businesses require us to collect and maintain sensitive customer data, as well as confidential employee and shareholder information, which is subject to electronic theft or loss. We also use third-party vendors to electronically process certain of our business transactions. Information systems, both ours and those of third parties, are vulnerable to security breaches by computer hackers and cyber terrorists, and the negligent or intentional breach of established controls and procedures or mismanagement of confidential information by employees. We may also be impacted by attacks and data security breaches of financial institutions, merchants or third-party processors. While we regularly conduct cybersecurity assessments, we cannot be certain our information security systems and protocols and those of our vendors and other third parties are sufficient to withstand a cyber-attack or other security breach.\nA major cyber incident could result in significant expenses to investigate and repair security breaches or system damage and could lead to litigation, fines, other remedial action, heightened regulatory scrutiny and damage to our reputation. For example, we may be subject to liability under various federal, state and international data protection laws. These laws are subject to change and expansion and may require additional operational changes to comply.\nThe misappropriation, corruption or loss of personally identifiable information and other confidential data could lead to significant monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions and breach notification and mitigation expenses such as credit monitoring and result in reputational damage affecting relations with shareholders, customers and regulators. In addition to property and casualty insurance which may cover restoration of data, certain physical damage or third-party injuries, we have cybersecurity insurance related to a breach event. However, damage and claims arising from such incidents may not be covered or may exceed the amount of any available insurance.\nThe inability to attract and retain a qualified workforce could have an adverse effect on our operations.\nThe success of our business heavily depends on the leadership of our executive officers and key employees to implement our strategy. In addition, all of our businesses rely on technical employees who possess certain specialized knowledge. The inability to attract and maintain a skilled and stable workforce may negatively affect our ability to service our customers, manufacture products, or successfully manage our business and achieve our objectives. Competition for skilled workers is high and can lead to increased labor expenses, decreased productivity and potentially lost business opportunities. Our ability to maintain productivity, relationships with customers, competitive costs, and quality services is limited by the ability to employ the necessary skilled personnel and could negatively affect our operating results, financial position and cash flows.\nFINANCIAL RISKS\nWe are subject to capital market and interest rate risks.\nWe rely on access to debt and equity capital markets as a source of liquidity to fund our investment initiatives, including rate base growth investments in our Electric segment and opportunities for investment, including acquisitions, in our Manufacturing and Plastics segments. Capital markets are impacted by global and domestic economic conditions, monetary policy, commodity prices, geopolitical events and other factors. If we are unable to access capital on acceptable terms and at reasonable costs, our ability to implement our business plans may be adversely affected. In addition, higher market interest rates on outstanding variable-rate short-term indebtedness could also impact our operating results.\nA decrease in our credit rating could increase our borrowing costs and result in additional contractual costs.\nWe rely on our investment grade credit ratings to provide acceptable costs for accessing the capital markets. A downgrade of our credit ratings could result in higher borrowing costs thereby negatively impacting our operating results and limiting our ability to access capital markets, which may negatively impact our ability to implement our business plans. In addition, OTP is a party to contracts that require the posting of collateral or settlement of applicable contracts if credit ratings fall below certain levels.\nOur pension and other postretirement benefit plans are subject to investment and interest rate risks.\nThe financial obligations and related costs of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans are affected by numerous factors. Assumptions related to future costs, investment returns, actuarial estimates and interest rates have a significant effect on our funding obligations and the cost recognized for these plans. If our pension plan assets do not achieve our estimated long-term rate of return or if our other estimates prove to be inaccurate, our financial position, operating results and cash flows may be adversely impacted. In addition, our funding requirements could be impacted by changes to the Pension Protection Act.\nWe rely on our subsidiaries to provide sufficient earnings and cash flows to allow us to meet our financial obligations and pay dividends to our shareholders.\nOtter Tail Corporation is a holding company with no significant operations of its own. The primary source of funds for payment of our financial obligations and dividends to our shareholders is from cash provided by our subsidiary companies. Our ability to meet our financial obligations and pay dividends on our common stock principally depends on the earnings, cash flows, capital requirements and general financial position of our subsidiary companies. In addition, OTP is subject to federal and state regulations which may restrict its ability to pay dividends. Finally, we are also reliant on our subsidiary companies to maintain compliance with financial covenants under our various short and long-term debt agreements. Our debt agreements include restrictions on the payment of cash dividends upon an event of default.\nChanges in tax laws could materially affect our financial condition and operating results.\nOur provision for income taxes and tax obligations are impacted by various tax laws and regulations, including the availability of various tax credits, IRS tax policies such as tax normalization, and at times, the ability to carryforward net operating losses. Changes in tax laws, regulations and interpretations could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results. Tax law changes that reduce or eliminate production or investment tax credits may impact the economics of constructing certain electric generation resources, which may adversely impact our planned investments.\nA significant impairment of our goodwill would negatively impact our financial position and operating results.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $37.6 million of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. We have recorded goodwill for businesses in our Manufacturing and Plastics segments. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. The goodwill impairment test requires us to estimate the fair value of the businesses being tested. Estimating the fair value of a business unit requires significant judgments and estimates, including estimates of future operating results and cash flows, among others. These estimates can be affected by numerous factors, including changes in economic, industry or market conditions, changes in business operations, changes in competition or changes in technologies. Any changes in key assumptions or material differences between actual and forecasted financial performance could affect our fair value estimates and lead to a goodwill impairment charge that could adversely affect our financial position and operating results, as well as impact compliance with financing agreement covenants.\nELECTRIC SEGMENT RISKS\nGeneral economic and industry conditions impact our business.\nSeveral factors, many of which are beyond our control, may contribute to reduced demand for energy from our customers or increase the cost of providing energy to our customers. These risks include economic growth or decline in our service areas, demographic changes in our customer base and changes in customer demand or load growth, due to, among other items, proliferation of distributed generation, energy efficiency initiatives, and technological advancements. In addition, customer demand could be impacted by increased competition in our service territories or the loss of a service territory or franchise. Other risks include increased transmission or interconnection costs, generation curtailment, and changes in the manner in which wholesale power is purchased and sold. A decrease in revenues or an increase in expenses related to our electric operations could negatively impact our financial condition, operating results and liquidity.\nOur utility business is significantly impacted by government legislation and regulation.\nWe are subject to federal and state legislation, government regulations and regulatory actions that may have a negative impact on our business and results of operations. The electric rates OTP is allowed to charge for its electric services are one of the most important items influencing our financial position, operating results and liquidity. The rates OTP charges its electric customers are subject to review and determination by state and federal regulators. Our ability to obtain rate adjustments to maintain reasonable rates of return depends on regulatory action under applicable statutes and regulations and we cannot provide assurance that rate adjustments will be obtained or reasonable rates of return on capital will be authorized. There is no assurance the applicable regulatory authority will judge all our costs to have been prudently incurred or that rates will produce full recovery of such costs. In addition, there could be changes in the regulatory environment that would impair the ability of OTP to recover costs historically collected from their customers. OTP will file rate cases with, or seek cost recovery authorization from, federal and state regulatory authorities. An adverse decision by one or more regulatory authorities concerning the level or method of determining electric utility rates, the authorized returns on equity, recoverability of fuel, purchase power and other costs, approval of depreciation rates, implementation of enforceable federal reliability standards or other regulatory matters, permitted business activities (such as ownership or operation of nonelectric businesses) or any prolonged delay in rendering a decision in a rate or other proceeding (including with respect to the recovery of capital expenditures in rates) could adversely impact our operating results.\nFederal and state environmental regulation could require us to incur substantial capital expenditures and increased operating costs or make it no longer economically viable to operate some of our facilities.\nWe are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations relating to air quality, water quality, waste management, natural resources and health safety. These laws and regulations regulate the modification and operation of existing facilities, the construction and operation of new facilities and the proper storage, handling, cleanup and disposal of hazardous waste and toxic substances. Compliance with these legal requirements requires us to commit significant resources and funds toward environmental monitoring, installation and operation of pollution control equipment, payment of emission fees and securing environmental permits. Obtaining environmental permits can entail significant expense and cause substantial construction delays. Failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations, even if caused by factors beyond our control, may result in civil or criminal liabilities, penalties and fines.\nExisting environmental laws or regulations may be revised, and new laws or regulations may be adopted or become applicable to us. Revised or additional regulations, which result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions, particularly if those costs are not fully recoverable from customers, could have a material effect on our operating results and make it no longer economically viable to operate some of our facilities.\nLegislation, regulation or other actions related to climate change, greenhouse gas emissions, and other air pollutants could materially impact us.\nCurrent and future federal, state, regional and international regulations to address global climate change and reduce greenhouse gas GHG emissions and other air pollutants, including measures such as mandated levels of renewable generation, mandatory reductions in CO2 emission levels, taxes on CO2 emissions or cap-and-trade regimes, could require us to incur significant new costs, which could negatively impact our financial position, operating results and cash flows if such costs cannot be recovered through rates granted by ratemaking authorities or through increased market prices for electricity. Future federal regulatory rulemaking will be impacted by the Biden administration's priorities and objectives, which may include more stringent requirements for reducing GHG emissions and other air pollutants from existing fossil fuel-fired power plants, and other objectives that may impact our operating results, financial position or cash flows.\nState implementation plans for compliance with the second implementation period of the RHR are due in mid-2021. Coyote Station, OTP's jointly-owned coal-fired power plant, is subject to assessment under the RHR as part of the state of North Dakota's state implementation plan. We cannot predict the impact the state implementation plan have on us until the plan is finalized and adopted. However, significant emission control investments could be required, or in light of the costs for such emission control equipment, there are scenarios where it may not be economically feasible to invest in such equipment and an early retirement of, or the sale of our interest in, Coyote Station would be necessary. The costs of such a retirement or sale would be material, a significant asset impairment charge could be required and OTP would be subject to state commission approval to recover such costs from customers. In addition, it may be necessary to pursue replacement electric generation facilities as an alternative, which may require incurring significant investment in new facilities that would be subject to regulatory permits and approvals.\nIn addition to complying with legislation and regulation, we could be subject to litigation related to climate change. Costs of such litigation could be significant, and an adverse outcome could require substantial capital expenditures, changes in operations and possible payment of penalties or damages which could affect our operating results and cash flows if the costs are not recoverable in rates or covered by insurance.\nTo the extent investors view climate change, fossil fuel combustion, and GHG emissions as a financial risk, our stock price or our ability to access capital markets on favorable terms and conditions could be adversely impacted.\nViolations of extensive legal and regulatory compliance requirements may have a negative impact on our business and results of operations.\nWe are subject to an extensive legal and regulatory framework imposed under federal and state laws and regulatory agencies, including the FERC and the NERC. We could be subject to potential financial penalties for compliance violations. Our transmission systems and electric generation facilities are subject to the NERC mandatory reliability standards, including cybersecurity standards. If a serious reliability incident did occur, it could have a material effect on our operations or financial results. Some states have the authority to impose substantial penalties in the event of non-compliance. We attempt to mitigate the risk of regulatory penalties through formal training. However, there is no guarantee our compliance program will be sufficient to ensure against violations.\nIn addition, energy policy initiatives at the state or federal level could increase incentives for distributed generation or authorize municipal utility formation or acquisition of service territory, or local initiatives could introduce generation or distribution requirements that could change the current integrated utility model.\nThese laws and regulations significantly influence our operations and may affect our ability to recover costs from our customers. We are required to have numerous permits, licenses, approvals and certificates from the agencies and other organizations that regulate our business. We believe we have obtained the necessary approvals for our existing operations and that our business is conducted in accordance with applicable laws and regulatory requirements; however, we are unable to predict the impact on our operating results from the future regulatory activities of any of these agencies and other organizations. Changes in regulations or the imposition of additional regulations could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nOur transmission and generation facilities could be vulnerable to cyber and physical attack.\nOTP owns electric transmission and generation facilities subject to mandatory and enforceable standards advanced by the NERC. These bulk electric system facilities provide the framework for the electrical infrastructure of OTP\u2019s service territory and interconnected systems, the operation of which is dependent on information technology systems. Further, the information systems that operate OTP\u2019s electric system are interconnected to external networks. Parties that wish to disrupt the U.S. bulk power system or OTP\u2019s operations could view OTP\u2019s computer systems, software or networks as attractive targets for cyber-attack.\nIn addition, OTP\u2019s generation and transmission facilities are spread throughout a large service territory. These facilities could be subject to physical attack or vandalism that could disrupt OTP\u2019s operations or conceivably the regional or U.S. bulk power system.\nOTP is subject to mandatory cybersecurity and physical security regulatory requirements. OTP implements the NERC standards for operating its transmission and generation assets and stays abreast of best practices within business and the utility industry to protect its computers and computer-controlled systems from outside attack. We rely on industry accepted security measures and technology to securely maintain confidential and proprietary information necessary for the operation of our systems. In an effort to reduce the likelihood and severity of cyber intrusions, we have cybersecurity processes and controls and disaster recovery plans designed to protect and preserve the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data and systems. We also take prudent and reasonable steps to protect the physical security of our generation and transmission facilities. However, all these measures and technology may not adequately prevent security breaches or cyber-attacks or enable us to recover effectively from such a breach or attack. Any significant interruption or failure of our information systems or any significant breach of security due to cyber-attacks, hacking or internal security breaches or physical attack of our generation or transmission facilities could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur generating facilities are subject to operational risks that could result in unscheduled plant outages and increased costs.\nThe operation of electric generating facilities involves many risks, including facility shutdowns due to equipment or process failures; labor disputes; operator error; catastrophic events such as fires, explosions, and floods; the dependence on a specific fuel source; and the risk of performance below expected levels of output or efficiency. We could be subject to costs associated with any unexpected failure to produce or deliver power, including failures caused by a breakdown or forced outage, as well as repairing damages to facilities.\nWe rely on a limited number of suppliers to provide coal and coal transportation to our facilities. A failure to perform by any of these counterparties may arise due to liquidity challenges or insolvency, operational deficiencies, or other circumstances such as severe weather or natural disasters, which could impact our ability to provide service to our customers or require us to seek alternative sources for these products and services, if available, which could lead to increased costs adversely impacting our operating results.\nOur generating facilities are subject to operational risks that could result in early closure or a sale of our interest.\nEarly closure of, or the sale of our interest in, a generating facility due to operational or economic factors, environmental regulation or risks of litigation could have a material adverse impact on our operating results. In the event of an early closure, a significant asset impairment charge could be required and we would be obligated to pay for costs of closure of our share of the generating facility. We may not be able to recover our remaining investment and the costs associated with the early closure, include costs associated with decommissioning, remediation, reclamation and restoration of the property, and any costs of terminating contracts associated with the generating facility, such as coal supply arrangements. In the event of a sale of our interest in a generating facility, we may not be able to negotiate the sale on favorable terms, which could result in the recognition of a loss on the sale and other potential liabilities.\nThe loss of a major generating facility would require OTP to identify and receive approval for other sources of generation for its customers, if available, and expose it to higher purchased power costs. In addition, OTP may not be able to obtain timely regulatory approval for new generation resources to replace closed facilities.\nWe are subject to risks associated with energy markets.\nOur electric business is subject to the risks associated with energy markets, including market supply and changing energy prices. If we are faced with shortages in market supply, we may be unable to fulfill our contractual obligations to our retail, wholesale and other customers at previously anticipated costs. This could force us to obtain alternative energy or fuel supplies at higher costs or suffer increased liability for unfulfilled contractual obligations. Any significantly higher than expected energy or fuel costs would negatively affect our financial performance.\nMANUFACTURING SEGMENT RISKS\nCompetition from foreign and domestic manufacturers, the price and availability of raw materials, trade policy and tariffs affecting prices and markets for raw material and manufactured products, prices and supply of scrap or recyclable material and general economic conditions could affect the revenues and earnings of our manufacturing businesses.\nOur manufacturing businesses are subject to intense risks associated with competition from foreign and domestic manufacturers, many of whom have broader product lines, greater distribution capabilities, greater capital resources, larger marketing, research and development personnel and facilities and other capabilities that may place downward pressure on margins and profitability. The companies in our Manufacturing segment use a variety of raw materials in the products they manufacture, including steel, aluminum and polystyrene and other plastics resins. Costs for these items can fluctuate significantly. Federal trade policies, including imposed and proposed tariffs could significantly increase the prices and delivery of raw materials such as steel and aluminum that are critical to our manufacturing businesses. If our manufacturing businesses are not able to pass on cost increases to their customers, it could have a negative effect on profit margins in our Manufacturing segment. Additionally, a certain amount of residual material (scrap) is a by-product of the manufacturing and production processes used by our manufacturing companies. Declines in commodity prices for these scrap materials due to weakened demand or excess supply, can negatively impact the profitability of our manufacturing companies as it reduces their ability to mitigate the cost associated with excess material. Changes in macroeconomic conditions can negatively impact demand in the end-use markets for products and parts that we manufacture, resulting in reduced sales and profits. There is no assurance the initiatives underway to increase revenues and improve margins at our manufacturing businesses will be successful.\nEconomic conditions in the end markets in which our customers operate can have an adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows.\nOur manufacturing businesses derive a large amount of their revenues from customers in the following industry sectors: recreational vehicle/powersports, lawn and garden, construction, agriculture, energy, horticultural and life science. Factors affecting any of these industries in general, or any of our customers in particular, could adversely affect us because our net sales growth largely depends on the continued growth of our customers\u2019 businesses in their respective industries. These factors include:\n\u2022seasonality of demand for our customers\u2019 products which may cause our manufacturing capacity to be underutilized for periods of time;\n\u2022our customers\u2019 failure to successfully market their products, to gain or retain widespread commercial acceptance of their products or to compete effectively in their industries;\n\u2022loss of market share for our customers\u2019 products, which may lead our customers to reduce or discontinue purchasing our products and components and to reduce prices, thereby exerting pricing pressure on us;\n\u2022economic conditions in the markets in which our customers operate; in particular, the United States, including recessionary periods such as a global economic downturn;\n\u2022our customers\u2019 decision to insource the production of components that has traditionally been outsourced to us; and\n\u2022product design changes or manufacturing process changes that may reduce or eliminate demand for the components we supply.\nWe expect future sales will continue to depend on the success of our customers. If economic conditions or demand for our customers\u2019 products deteriorate, we may experience a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur business and operating results may be adversely affected if we are not able to maintain our manufacturing, engineering and technological expertise.\nThe markets for our manufacturing businesses are characterized by changing technology and evolving process development. The continued success of our businesses will depend on our ability to:\n\u2022hire, retain and expand our pool of qualified engineering and trade-skilled personnel;\n\u2022maintain technological leadership in our industry;\n\u2022implement new and expand on current robotics, automation and tooling technologies; and\n\u2022anticipate or respond to changes in manufacturing processes in a cost-effective and timely manner.\nWe may not be able to develop the capabilities required by our customers in the future. The emergence of new technologies, industry standards or customer requirements may render our equipment, inventory or processes obsolete or uncompetitive. We may have to acquire new technologies and equipment to remain competitive. The acquisition and implementation of new technologies and equipment may require us to incur significant expense and capital investment, which could reduce our margins and affect our operating results. When we establish or acquire new facilities, we may not be able to maintain or develop our manufacturing, engineering and technological expertise due to a lack of trained personnel, effective training of new staff or technical difficulties with machinery. Failure to anticipate and adapt to customers\u2019 changing technological needs and requirements, to hire and retain a sufficient number of engineers, and to maintain manufacturing, engineering and technological expertise may have a material adverse effect on our businesses and operating results.\nOur manufacturing operations are subject to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that could result in liabilities to us.\nOur manufacturing operations, which include painting and coating processes, are subject to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing discharges to air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances, the cleanup of contaminated sites and health and safety matters. We could incur material costs, including cleanup costs, civil and criminal fines, penalties and third-party claims for cost recovery, property damage or personal injury as a result of violations of or liabilities under such laws and regulations. The ultimate cost of remediating contaminated sites, if any, is difficult to accurately predict and could exceed estimates. In addition, as environmental, health and safety laws and regulations have tended to become stricter, we could incur additional costs complying with requirements that are promulgated in the future.\nPLASTICS SEGMENT RISKS\nOur plastics operations are highly dependent on a limited number of vendors for PVC resin and a limited supply of PVC resin.\nWe rely on a limited number of vendors to supply the PVC resin used in our plastics business. Two vendors provided over 99% of our total purchases of PVC resin in 2020. In addition, the supply of PVC resin may be limited primarily due to manufacturing capacity and the limited availability of raw material components. Most U.S. resin production plants are located in the Gulf Coast region, which may increase the risk of a shortage of resin in the event of a hurricane or other natural disaster in that region. The loss of a key vendor or any interruption or delay in the availability or supply of PVC resin could disrupt our ability to deliver our plastic products, cause customers to cancel orders or require us to incur additional expenses to obtain PVC resin from alternative sources, if such sources are available.\nWe compete against many other manufacturers of PVC pipe and manufacturers of alternative products. Customers may not distinguish our products from those of our competitors.\nThe plastic pipe industry is fragmented and competitive due to the number of producers and the fungible nature of the product. We compete not only against other plastic pipe manufacturers, but also against ductile iron, steel and concrete pipe manufacturers. Due to shipping costs, competition is usually regional instead of national in scope, and the principal areas of competition are a combination of price, service, warranty, and product performance. Our inability to compete effectively in each of these areas and to distinguish our plastic pipe products from competing products may adversely affect the financial performance of our plastics business.\nChanges in PVC resin prices can negatively affect our plastics business.\nThe PVC pipe industry is highly sensitive to commodity raw material pricing volatility. Historically, when resin prices are rising or stable, margins and sales volume have been higher and when resin prices are falling, sales volumes and margins have been lower. Changes in PVC resin prices can negatively affect PVC pipe prices, profit margins on PVC pipe sales and the value of our finished goods inventory.\nExternal factors beyond our control can cause fluctuations in demand for our PVC pipe products and changes in our prices and margins, which could adversely impact our operating results.\nOur PVC pipe products, sold through distributors and wholesalers, are primarily used in municipal and rural water projects, wastewater projects, storm drainage systems and reclamation systems. External factors beyond our control can cause volatility in raw material prices, demand for our products, prices of our product and volumes and deterioration in operating margins. These factors can magnify the impact of economic cycles on our business and results of operations. Examples of external factors include:\n\u2022general economic conditions including housing and construction markets which can be cyclical;\n\u2022increases in interest rates;\n\u2022severe weather and natural disasters;\n\u2022governmental regulation in the United States;\n\u2022funding shortages for municipal water and wastewater projects can also adversely impact demand for our products.\n\u2022pandemics and other public health threats.\nGENERAL RISK FACTORS\nEconomic conditions could negatively impact our businesses.\nOur businesses are affected by local, national and worldwide economic conditions. Tightening of credit in financial markets could adversely affect the ability of customers to finance purchases of our goods and services, resulting in decreased orders, cancelled or deferred orders, slower payment cycles, and increased bad debt and customer bankruptcies. Our businesses may also be adversely affected by decreases in the general level of economic activity, such as decreases in business and consumer spending. A decline in the level of economic activity and uncertainty regarding energy and commodity prices could adversely affect our results of operations and our future growth.\nIf we are unable to achieve the organic growth we expect, our financial performance may be adversely affected.\nWe expect much of our growth in the next few years will come from major capital investment at existing companies. To achieve the organic growth we expect, we must have access to the capital markets, be successful with capital expansion programs related to organic growth, develop new products and services, expand our markets and increase efficiencies in our businesses. Competitive and economic factors could adversely affect our ability to do this. If we are unable to achieve and sustain consistent organic growth, we will be less likely to meet our earnings growth targets, which may adversely affect the market price of our common shares.", "PERMNO": 60098, "SIC": 4911, "TIC": "OTTR"}
