RISK FACTORS\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur long-term success is highly dependent on our ability to open new, primarily company-owned clinics, and is subject to many unpredictable factors.\nOne of the key means of achieving our growth strategy will be through opening new, primarily company-owned clinics and operating those clinics on a profitable basis. We expect this to be the case for the foreseeable future. We have opened 246 franchised clinics since April 2010, but we have opened only one company-owned clinic, which we then sold to a franchisee. We currently manage 11 company-owned clinics, all of which were recently acquired from existing franchisees. We may not be able to open new company-owned clinics as quickly as planned. In the past, we have experienced delays in opening some franchised clinics, for various reasons, including the landlord\u2019s failure to turn over the premises to our franchisee on a timely basis. Such delays could happen again in future clinic openings. Delays or failures in opening new, primarily company-owned clinics could materially and adversely affect our growth strategy and our business, financial condition and results of operations. As we operate more clinics, our rate of expansion relative to the size of our clinic base will eventually decline.\nIn addition, one of our biggest challenges is locating and securing an adequate supply of suitable new clinic sites in our target markets. Competition for those sites is intense, and other medical and retail concepts that compete for those sites may have unit economic models that permit them to bid more aggressively for those sites than we can. There is no guarantee that a sufficient number of suitable sites will be available in desirable areas or on terms that are acceptable to us in order to achieve our growth plan. Our ability to open new clinics also depends on other factors, including:\n\u2022\nnegotiating leases with acceptable terms;\n\u2022\nidentifying, hiring and training qualified employees in each local market;\n\u2022\ntimely delivery of leased premises to us from our landlords and punctual commencement of our build-out construction activities;\n\u2022\nmanaging construction and development costs of new clinics, particularly in competitive markets;\n\u2022\nobtaining construction materials and labor at acceptable costs, particularly in urban markets;\n\u2022\nunforeseen engineering or environmental problems with leased premises;\n\u2022\ngenerating sufficient funds from operations or obtaining acceptable financing to support our future development;\n\u2022\nsecuring required governmental approvals, permits and licenses (including construction permits and operating licenses) in a timely manner and responding effectively to any changes in local, state or federal laws and regulations that adversely affect our costs or ability to open new clinics; and\n\u2022\navoiding the impact of inclement weather, natural disasters and other calamities.\nOur progress in opening new, primarily company-owned clinics from quarter to quarter may occur at an uneven rate. If we do not open new clinics in the future according to our current plans, the delay could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe intend to develop new, primarily company-owned clinics in our existing markets, expand our footprint into adjacent markets and selectively enter into new markets. However, there are numerous factors involved in identifying and securing an appropriate site, including, but not limited to: identification and availability of suitable locations with the appropriate population demographics, psychographics, traffic patterns, local retail and business attractions and infrastructure that will drive high levels of customer traffic and sales per clinic; consumer acceptance of our chiropractic practice concept; financial conditions affecting developers and potential landlords, such as the effects of macro-economic conditions and the credit market, which could lead to these parties delaying or canceling development projects (or renovations of existing projects), in turn reducing the number of appropriate locations available; developers and potential landlords obtaining licenses or permits for development projects on a timely basis; anticipated commercial, residential and infrastructure development near our new clinics; and availability of acceptable lease arrangements.\nWe may not be able to successfully develop critical market presence for our brand in new geographical markets, as we may be unable to find and secure attractive locations, build name recognition or attract new customers. If we are unable to fully implement our development plan, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. See Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements for subsequent events.\nNew clinics, once opened, may not be profitable, and the increases in average clinic sales and comparable clinic sales that we have experienced in the past may not be indicative of future results.\nTypically, our new clinics continue to increase sales for their first 36 months of operation. Our analysis of clinic growth leads us to believe that revenue growth will continue past 36 months. However, we cannot assure you that this will occur for future clinic openings. In new markets, the length of time before average sales for new clinics stabilize is less predictable and can be longer as a result of our limited knowledge of these markets and consumers\u2019 limited awareness of our brand. New clinics may not be profitable and their sales performance may not follow historical patterns. In addition, our average clinic sales and comparable clinic sales may not increase at the rates achieved over the past several years. Our ability to operate new clinics, especially company-owned clinics, profitably and increase average clinic sales and comparable clinic sales will depend on many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nconsumer awareness and understanding of our brand;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions, which can affect clinic traffic, local rent and labor costs and prices we pay for the supplies we use;\n\u2022\nchanges in consumer preferences and discretionary spending;\n\u2022\ncompetition, either from our competitors in the chiropractic industry or our own clinics;\n\u2022\ntemporary and permanent site characteristics of new clinics;\n\u2022\nchanges in government regulation; and\n\u2022\nother unanticipated increases in costs, any of which could give rise to delays or cost overruns.\nIf our new clinics do not perform as planned, our business and future prospects could be harmed. In addition, if we are unable to achieve our expected average clinics sales, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur failure to manage our growth effectively could harm our business and operating results.\nOur growth plan includes a significant number of new clinics. Our existing clinic management systems, administrative staff, financial and management controls and information systems may be inadequate to support our planned expansion. Those demands on our infrastructure and resources may also adversely affect our ability to manage our existing clinics. Managing our growth effectively will require us to continue to enhance these systems, procedures and controls and to hire, train and retain managers and team members. We may not respond quickly enough to the changing demands that our expansion will impose on our management, clinic teams and existing infrastructure which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur expansion into new markets may be more costly and difficult than we currently anticipate with the resulting risk of slower growth than we expect.\nWe plan to open clinics in markets where we have little or no operating experience. Clinics we open in new markets may take longer to reach expected sales and profit levels on a consistent basis and may have higher construction, occupancy, marketing or operating costs than clinics we open in existing markets, thereby affecting our overall profitability. New markets may have competitive conditions, consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns that are more difficult to predict or satisfy than our existing markets. We may need to make greater investments than we originally planned in advertising and promotional activity in new markets to build brand awareness. We may find it more difficult in new markets to hire, motivate and keep qualified employees who share our vision and culture. We may also incur higher costs from entering new markets, particularly with company-owned clinics if, for example, we hire and assign regional managers to manage comparatively fewer clinics than in more developed markets. For these reasons, both our new franchised clinics and our new company-owned clinics may be less successful than our existing franchised clinics or may achieve target rates of patient visits at a slower rate. If we do not successfully execute our plans to enter new markets, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nWe will be subject to all of the risks associated with leasing space subject to long-term non-cancelable leases for clinics that we intend to operate.\nWe do not intend to own any of the real property where our company-owned clinics will operate. We expect the spaces for the company-owned clinics we intend to open in the future will be leased. We anticipate that our leases generally will have an initial term of five or ten years and generally can be extended only in five-year increments (at increased rates). We expect that all of our leases will require a fixed annual rent, although some may require the payment of additional rent if clinic sales exceed a negotiated amount. We expect that our leases will typically be net leases, which require us to pay all of the cost of insurance, taxes, maintenance and utilities, and that these leases will not be cancellable by us. If a future company-owned clinic is not profitable, resulting in its closure, we may nonetheless be committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease including, among other things, paying the base rent for the balance of the lease term. In addition, we may fail to negotiate renewals as each of our leases expires, either on commercially acceptable terms or at all, which could cause us to pay increased occupancy costs or to close stores in desirable locations. These potential increases in occupancy costs and the cost of closing company-owned clinics could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may not succeed in our plans to reacquire regional developer licenses or to purchase existing franchises, which could delay or prevent revenue increases we require to obtain profitability.\nOur growth strategies include the selected re-acquisition of regional developer licenses and the purchase of existing franchised clinics. While we have the right to repurchase the regional developer license in several of our regional developer agreements, we cannot assure you that regional developers will cooperate with us should we choose to exercise such options. Similarly, we cannot assure you that regional developers whose licenses do not include repurchase options, or franchisees, none of whose franchise agreements contain repurchase options, will agree to sell their licenses or franchised clinics to us on terms we consider acceptable, or at all. Our failure to repurchase selected regional developer licenses or to purchase selected existing franchises on attractive terms could materially delay our growth plans, which could have the effect of delaying or preventing the increases in revenues we require to obtain profitability.\nOur intended reliance on sources of revenue other than from franchise and regional developer licenses exposes us to risks including the loss of revenue and reduction of working capital.\nFrom the commencement of our operations until the present, we have relied exclusively on the sale of franchises and regional developer licenses as sources of revenue until the franchises we have sold begin to generate royalty revenues. We intend to place less reliance in the future on these sources of revenue as we implement our strategy of developing and operating company-owned clinics. We will not realize revenues from company-owned clinics until the opening of those clinics, and we will be required to use our working capital, including the proceeds from our initial public offering, to operate our business and to develop company-owned clinics. If the opening of our company-owned clinics is delayed or if the cost of developing company-owned clinics exceeds our expectations, we may experience insufficient working capital to fully implement our development plans, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur potential need to raise additional capital to accomplish our objectives of expanding into new markets and opening company-owned clinics exposes us to risks including limiting our ability to develop or acquire clinics and limiting our financial flexibility.\nWe intend to use a portion of the proceeds from our initial public offering as consideration for future development and acquisitions of company-owned clinics and related businesses. If we do not have sufficient cash resources, our ability to develop and acquire clinics and related businesses could be limited unless we are able to obtain additional capital through future debt or equity financings. Using cash to finance development and acquisition of clinics and related businesses could limit our financial flexibility by reducing cash available for operating purposes. Using debt financing could result in lenders imposing financial covenants that limit our operations and financial flexibility. Using equity financing may result in dilution of ownership interests of our existing stockholders. We may also use common stock as consideration for the future acquisition of clinics and related businesses. If our common stock does not maintain a sufficient market value or if prospective acquisition candidates are unwilling to accept our common stock as part of the consideration for the sale of their clinics or businesses, we may be required to use more of our cash resources or greater debt financing to complete these acquisitions.\nChanges in economic conditions and adverse weather and other unforeseen conditions could materially affect our ability to maintain or increase sales at our clinics or open new clinics.\nOur services emphasize maintenance therapy, which is generally not a medical necessity, and should be viewed as discretionary medical expenditures. The United States in general or the specific markets in which we operate may suffer from depressed economic activity, recessionary economic cycles, higher fuel or energy costs, low consumer confidence, high levels of unemployment, reduced home values, increases in home foreclosures, investment losses, personal bankruptcies, reduced access to credit or other economic factors that may affect consumer discretionary spending. Traffic in our clinics could decline if consumers choose to reduce the amount they spend on non-critical medical procedures. Negative economic conditions might cause consumers to make long-term changes to their discretionary spending behavior, including reducing medical discretionary spending on a permanent basis. In addition, given our geographic concentrations in the West, Southwest and mid-Atlantic regions of the United States, economic conditions in those particular areas of the country could have a disproportionate impact on our overall results of operations, and regional occurrences such as local strikes, terrorist attacks, increases in energy prices, adverse weather conditions, tornadoes, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, droughts, fires or other natural or man-made disasters could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Adverse weather conditions may also impact customer traffic at our clinics. All of our clinics depend on visibility and walk-in traffic, and the effects of adverse weather may decrease visits to malls in which our clinics are located and negatively impact our revenues. If clinic sales decrease, our profitability could decline as we spread fixed costs across a lower level of sales. Reductions in staff levels, asset impairment charges and potential clinic closures could result from prolonged negative clinic sales, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur dependence on the success of our franchisees exposes us to risks including the loss of royalty revenue and harm to our brand.\nA substantial portion of our revenues comes from royalties generated by our franchised clinics. We anticipate that franchise royalties will represent a substantial part of our revenues in the future. As of December 31, 2014, we had 122 franchisees operating 246 clinics. Accordingly, we are reliant on the performance of our franchisees in successfully opening and operating their clinics and paying royalties to us on a timely basis. Our franchise system subjects us to a number of risks as described in the next four risk factors, any one of which could impact our ability to collect royalty payments from our franchisees, may harm the goodwill associated with our brand and may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur franchisees are independent operators over whom we have limited control.\nFranchisees are independent operators, and their employees are not our employees. Accordingly, their actions are outside of our control. Although we have developed criteria to evaluate and screen prospective franchisees, we cannot be certain that our franchisees will have the business acumen or financial resources necessary to operate successful franchises in their approved locations, and state franchise laws may limit our ability to terminate or modify these franchise agreements. Moreover, despite our training, support and monitoring, franchisees may not successfully operate stores in a manner consistent with our standards and requirements, or may not hire and adequately train qualified managers and other store personnel. The failure of our franchisees to operate their franchises successfully and the actions taken by their employees could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, our brand and our ability to attract prospective franchisees, and on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA recent decision by the United States National Labor Relations Board held that McDonald\u2019s Corporation could be held jointly liable for labor and wage violations by its franchisees. If this decision is upheld it could result in us having responsibility for damages, reinstatement, back pay and penalties in connection with labor law violations by our franchisees over whom we have no control, and could have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to the risk that our franchise agreements may be terminated or not renewed.\nEach franchise agreement is subject to termination by us as the franchisor in the event of a default, generally after expiration of applicable cure periods, although under certain circumstances a franchise agreement may be terminated by us upon notice without an opportunity to cure. The default provisions under the franchise agreements are drafted broadly and include, among other things, any failure to meet operating standards and actions that may threaten our intellectual property. In addition, each franchise agreement has an expiration date. Upon the expiration of the franchise agreement, we or the franchisee may, or may not, elect to renew the franchise agreement. If the franchise agreement is renewed, the franchisee will receive a new franchise agreement for an additional term. Such option, however, is contingent on the franchisee\u2019s execution of the then-current form of franchise agreement (which may include increased royalty payments, advertising fees and other costs), and the payment of a renewal fee. If a franchisee is unable or unwilling to satisfy any of the foregoing conditions, we may elect to not renew the expiring franchise agreement, in which event the franchise agreement will terminate upon expiration of its term. The termination or non-renewal of a franchise agreement could result in the reduction of royalty payments we receive.\nOur franchisees may not meet timetables for opening their clinics, which could reduce the royalties we receive.\nOur franchise agreements specify a timetable for opening the clinic. Failure by our franchisees to open their clinics within the specified time limit would result in the reduction of royalty payments we receive and could result in the termination of the franchise agreement. Of our 268 franchise agreements for sold but unopened clinics as of December 31, 2014, franchisees under 160 franchise agreements have not met the opening timetable specified in their franchise agreement.\nOur franchisees may elect bankruptcy protection and deprive us of income.\nThe bankruptcy of a franchisee could negatively impact our ability to collect payments due under such franchisee\u2019s franchise agreement. In a franchisee bankruptcy, the bankruptcy trustee may reject the franchisee\u2019s franchise agreement pursuant to Section 365 under the United States Bankruptcy Code, in which case we would no longer receive royalty payments from the franchisee.\nOur regional developers are independent operators over whom we have limited control.\nOur regional developers are independent operators. Accordingly, their actions are outside of our control. We depend upon our regional developers to sell a minimum number of franchises within their territory and to assist the purchasers of those franchises to develop and operate their clinics. The failure by regional developers to sell the specified minimum number of franchises within the time limits set forth in their regional developer license agreements would reduce the franchise fees we receive, delay the payment of royalties to us and result in a potential event of default under the regional developer license agreement. Of our total of 26 regional developer licenses as of December 31, 2014, regional developers under 11 regional developer licenses have not met their minimum franchise sales and/or opening requirements within the time periods specified in their regional developer license agreements.\nWe present EBITDA as a supplemental measure to help us describe our operating performance. EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure commonly used in our industry and should not be construed as an alternative to net income (loss) or as a better indicator of operating performance.\nEBITDA consists of net income (loss), before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. We present EBITDA as a supplemental measure to help us describe our operating performance. EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure commonly used in our industry and should not be construed as an alternative to net income (loss) (as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP) or as a better indicator of operating performance. You should not consider EBITDA as a substitute for operating profit, as an indicator of our operating performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. We may calculate EBITDA differently from other companies.\nIn addition, in the future we may incur expenses similar to those excluded when calculating EBITDA. Our presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computation of EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies do not calculate EBITDA in the same fashion.\nOur management does not consider EBITDA in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. The principal limitation of EBITDA is that it excludes significant expenses and income that are required by GAAP to be recorded in our financial statements. Some of these limitations are: (i) EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements, for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; (ii) EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; (iii) EBITDA does not reflect the interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debts, and although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future; and (iv) EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements.\nOur ability to operate effectively could be impaired if we fail to attract and retain our executive officers.\nOur success depends, in part, upon the continuing contributions of our executive officers and key employees at the management level. Although we have employment agreements with certain of our key executive officers, there is no guarantee that they will not leave. The loss of the services of any of our executive officers or the failure to attract other executive officers could have a material adverse effect on our business or our business prospects. If we lose the services of any of our key employees at the operating or regional level, we may not be able to replace them with similarly qualified personnel, which could harm our business.\nA lack of qualified employees will significantly hinder our growth plans and adversely affect our results of operations.\nAs we grow, our ability to increase productivity and profitability will be limited by our ability to employ, train and retain skilled personnel. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain an adequate skilled labor force necessary to operate efficiently, that our labor expenses will not increase as a result of a shortage in the supply of skilled personnel or that we will not have to curtail our planned internal growth as a result of labor shortages.\nOur clinics and chiropractors compete for patients in a highly competitive environment that may make it more difficult to increase patient volumes and revenues.\nThe business of providing chiropractic services is highly competitive in each of the markets in which our clinics operate. The primary bases of such competition are quality of care and reputation, price of services, marketing and advertising strategy and implementation, convenience, traffic flow and visibility of office locations and hours of operation. Our clinics compete with all other chiropractors in their local market. Many of those chiropractors have established practices and reputations in their markets. Some of these competitors and potential competitors may have financial resources, affiliation models, reputations or management expertise that provide them with competitive advantages against us, which may make it difficult to compete against them. Our two largest multi-unit competitors are HealthSource Chiropractic, which currently operates 442 units, and ChiroOne, which operates 42 units. In addition, a number of other chiropractic franchises and chiropractic practices that are attempting to duplicate or follow our business model are currently operating in our markets and in other parts of the country and may enter our existing markets in the future.\nOur success is dependent on the chiropractors who control the professional corporations, or PC owners, with whom we enter into management services agreements, and we may have difficulty locating qualified chiropractors to replace PC owners.\nWith the exception of franchisees that are owned by chiropractors, or franchisees that are owned by non-chiropractors in states that do not regulate the corporate practice of chiropractic, our chiropractic services are provided by legal entities organized under state laws as professional corporations, or PCs. Each PC employs or contracts with chiropractors in one or more offices. Each of the PCs is wholly owned by one or more licensed chiropractors, or medical professionals as state law may require, the PC owner, and we do not own any capital stock of any PC. We and our franchisees that are not owned by chiropractors enter into management services agreements with PCs to provide on an exclusive basis all non-clinical services of the chiropractic practice. The PC owner is critical to the success of a clinic because he or she has control of all clinical aspects of the practice of chiropractic and the provision of chiropractic services. Under our arrangements with the PC owners, the PC owners are prohibited from selling, transferring, pledging or assigning the stock of the PC to a third party without our consent. In addition, we can require the PC owner to sell his or her interest in the PC to any person designated by us that is permitted to hold an ownership interest in the PC. However, upon the departure of a PC owner, we may not be able to locate one or more suitably qualified licensed chiropractors to hold the ownership interest in the PC and maintain the success of the departing PC owner. Also, a court may decide not to enforce these transfer restrictions in a given situation.\nOur management services agreements with our affiliated PCs could be challenged by a state or chiropractor under laws regulating the practice of chiropractic.\nThe laws of every state in which we operate contain restrictions on the practice of chiropractic and control over the provision of chiropractic services. The laws of many states where we operate permit a chiropractor to conduct a chiropractic practice only as an individual, a member of a partnership or an employee of a PC, limited liability company or limited liability partnership. These laws typically prohibit chiropractors from splitting fees with non-chiropractors and prohibit non-chiropractic entities, such as chiropractic management services organizations, from engaging in the practice of chiropractic and from employing chiropractors. The specific restrictions against the corporate practice of chiropractic, as well as the interpretation of those restrictions by state regulatory authorities, vary from state to state. However, the restrictions are generally designed to prohibit a non-chiropractic entity from controlling or directing clinical care decision-making, engaging chiropractors to practice chiropractic or sharing professional fees. The form of management agreement that we utilize ourselves, and that we recommend to our franchisees that are management service organizations, explicitly prohibits the management service organization from controlling or directing clinical care decisions. However, there can be no assurance that all of our franchisees that are management service organizations will strictly follow the provisions in our recommended form of management agreement. The laws of many states also prohibit chiropractic practitioners from paying any portion of fees received for chiropractic services in consideration for the referral of a patient. Any challenge to our contractual relationships with our affiliated PCs by chiropractors or regulatory authorities could result in a finding that could have a material adverse effect on our operations, such as voiding one or more management services agreements. Moreover, the laws and regulatory environment may change to restrict or limit the enforceability of our management services agreements. We could be prevented from affiliating with chiropractor-owned PCs or providing comprehensive business services to them in one or more states.\nWe and our affiliated chiropractor-owned PCs are subject to complex laws, rules and regulations, compliance with which may be costly and burdensome.\nWe, and the chiropractor-owned PCs we and our franchisees provide management services for, are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations, including:\n\u2022\nstate regulations on the practice of chiropractic;\n\u2022\nthe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended, and its implementing regulations, or HIPAA, and other federal and state laws governing the collection, dissemination, use, security and confidentiality of patient-identifiable health and financial information;\n\u2022\nfederal and state laws and regulations which contain anti-kickback and fee-splitting provisions and restrictions on referrals;\n\u2022\nthe federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and similar state laws that restrict the methods that we and third party collection companies may use to contact and seek payment from patients regarding past due accounts;\n\u2022\nstate and federal labor laws, including wage and hour laws.\nMany of the above laws, rules and regulations applicable to us and our affiliated PCs are ambiguous, have not been definitively interpreted by courts or regulatory authorities and vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Accordingly, we may not be able to predict how these laws and regulations will be interpreted or applied by courts and regulatory authorities, and some of our activities could be challenged. In addition, we must consistently monitor changes in the laws and regulatory schemes that govern our operations. Although we have tried to structure our business and contractual relationships in compliance with these laws, rules and regulations in all material respects, if any aspect of our operations were found to violate applicable laws, rules or regulations, we could be subject to significant fines or other penalties, required to cease operations in a particular jurisdiction, prevented from commencing operations in a particular state or otherwise be required to revise the structure of our business or legal arrangements. Our efforts to comply with these laws, rules and regulations may impose significant costs and burdens, and failure to comply with these laws, rules and regulations may result in fines or other charges being imposed on us.\nOur facilities are subject to extensive federal and state laws and regulations relating to the privacy and security of individually identifiable information.\nHIPAA required the United States Department of Health and Human Service to adopt standards to protect the privacy and security of individually identifiable health-related information, or PHI. The department released final regulations containing privacy standards in December 2000 and published revisions to the final regulations in August 2002. The privacy regulations extensively regulate the use and disclosure of PHI. The regulations also provide patients with significant rights related to understanding and controlling how their health information is used or disclosed. The security regulations require healthcare providers to implement administrative, physical and technical practices to protect the security of individually identifiable health information that is maintained or transmitted electronically. The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, which was signed into law in February of 2009, enhanced the privacy, security and enforcement provisions of HIPAA by, among other things, extending HIPAA\u2019s privacy and security standards directly applicable to \u201cbusiness associates,\u201d which, like us, are independent contractors or agents of covered entities (such as the chiropractic PCs and other healthcare providers) that create, receive, maintain, or transmit PHI in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also established security breach notification requirements, created a mechanism for enforcement of HIPAA by state attorneys general, and increased penalties for HIPAA violations. Violations of HIPAA or HITECH could result in civil or criminal penalties. In addition to HIPAA, there are numerous federal and state laws and regulations addressing patient and consumer privacy concerns, including unauthorized access or theft of personal information. State statutes and regulations vary from state to state. Lawsuits, including class actions and action by state attorneys general, directed at companies that have experienced a privacy or security breach also can occur. We have established policies and procedures in an effort to ensure compliance with these privacy related requirements. However, if there is a breach, we may be subject to various penalties and damages and may be required to incur costs to mitigate the impact of the breach on affected individuals.\nOur business model depends on proprietary and third party management information systems that we use to, among other things, track financial and operating performance of our clinics, and any failure to successfully design and maintain these systems or implement new systems could materially harm our operations.\nWe depend on integrated management information systems, some of which are provided by third parties, and standardized procedures for operational and financial information, as well as for patient records and our billing operations. We may experience unanticipated delays, complications, data breaches or expenses in implementing, integrating, and operating our systems. Our management information systems regularly require modifications, improvements or replacements that may require both substantial expenditures as well as interruptions in operations. Our ability to implement these systems is subject to the availability of skilled information technology specialists to assist us in creating, implementing and supporting these systems. Our failure to successfully design, implement and maintain all of our systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to properly maintain the integrity of our data or to strategically implement, upgrade or consolidate existing information systems, our reputation and business could be materially adversely affected.\nWe increasingly use electronic means to interact with our customers and collect, maintain and store individually identifiable information, including, but not limited to, personal financial information and health-related information. Despite the security measures we have in place to ensure compliance with applicable laws and rules, our facilities and systems, and those of our third-party service providers, may be vulnerable to security breaches, acts of cyber terrorism, vandalism or theft, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors or other similar events. Additionally, the collection, maintenance, use, disclosure and disposal of individually identifiable data by our businesses are regulated at the federal and state levels as well as by certain financial industry groups, such as the Payment Card Industry organization. Federal, state and financial industry groups may also consider from time to time new privacy and security requirements that may apply to our businesses. Compliance with evolving privacy and security laws, requirements, and regulations may result in cost increases due to necessary systems changes, new limitations or constraints on our business models and the development of new administrative processes. They also may impose further restrictions on our collection, disclosure and use of individually identifiable information that are housed in one or more of our databases. Noncompliance with privacy laws, financial industry group requirements or a security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of personal, sensitive and/or confidential information, whether by us or by one of our vendors, could have material adverse effects on our business, operations, reputation and financial condition, including decreased revenue; material fines and penalties; increased financial processing fees; compensatory, statutory, punitive or other damages; adverse actions against our licenses to do business; and injunctive relief whether by court or consent order.\nWe along with our affiliated PCs and their chiropractors may be subject to malpractice and other similar claims and may be unable to obtain or maintain adequate insurance against these claims.\nThe provision of chiropractic services by chiropractors entails an inherent risk of potential malpractice and other similar claims. While we do not have responsibility for compliance by affiliated PCs and their chiropractors with regulatory and other requirements directly applicable to chiropractors, claims, suits or complaints relating to services provided at the offices of our franchisees or affiliated PCs may be asserted against us. As we develop company-owned clinics, our exposure to malpractice claims will increase. We have experienced one malpractice claim since our founding in April, 2010, which we are vigorously defending and do not expect its outcome to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. The assertion or outcome of these claims could result in higher administrative and legal expenses, including settlement costs or litigation damages. Our current minimum professional liability insurance coverage required for our franchisees, affiliated PCs and company-owned clinics is $1 million per occurrence and $3 million in annual aggregate, with a self-insured retention of $0 per claim and $0 annual aggregate. In addition, we have a corporate entity policy with coverage of $1 million per occurrence and $3 million in annual aggregate. Our inability to obtain adequate insurance or an increase in the future cost of insurance to us and the chiropractors who provide chiropractic services or an increase in the amount we have to self-insure may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nWe could be party to litigation that could adversely affect us by distracting management, increasing our expenses or subjecting us to material money damages and other remedies.\nIn addition to potential malpractice claims, we are also subject to a variety of other claims arising in the ordinary course of our business, including personal injury claims, contract claims and claims alleging violations of federal and state law regarding workplace and employment matters, equal opportunity, harassment, discrimination and similar matters, and we could become subject to class action or other lawsuits related to these or different matters in the future. Regardless of whether any claims against us are valid, or whether we are ultimately held liable, claims may be expensive to defend and may divert time and money away from our operations and hurt our performance. A judgment in excess of our insurance coverage for any claims could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Any adverse publicity resulting from these allegations may also materially and adversely affect our reputation or prospects, which in turn could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to the risk that our current insurance may not provide adequate levels of coverage against claims.\nOur current insurance policies may not be adequate to protect us from liabilities that we incur in our business. Additionally, in the future, our insurance premiums may increase, and we may not be able to obtain similar levels of insurance on reasonable terms, or at all. Any substantial inadequacy of, or inability to obtain insurance coverage could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurthermore, there are types of losses we may incur that cannot be insured against or that we believe are not economically reasonable to insure. Such losses could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. As a public company, we intend to enhance our existing directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance. Failure to obtain and maintain adequate directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance would likely adversely affect our ability to attract and retain qualified officers and directors.\nEvents or rumors relating to our brand names could significantly impact our business.\nRecognition of our brand names, including \u201cTHE JOINT...THE CHIROPRACTIC PLACE\u201d, and the association of those brands with quality, convenient and inexpensive chiropractic maintenance care are an integral part of our business. The occurrence of any events or rumors that cause patients to no longer associate the brands with quality, convenient and inexpensive chiropractic maintenance care may materially adversely affect the value of the brand names and demand for chiropractic services at our franchisees or their affiliated PCs.\nRisks Related to Our Recent Initial Public Offering and Listing of Our Common Stock on the NASDAQ Capital Market\nOur stock price could be volatile and could decline.\nThe price at which our common stock will trade could be extremely volatile and may fluctuate substantially due to the following factors, some of which are beyond our control:\n\u2022\nvariations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nvariations between our actual operating results and the expectations of securities analysts, investors and the financial community;\n\u2022\nannouncements of developments affecting our business or expansion plans by us or others; and\n\u2022\nconditions and trends in the chiropractic industry.\nAs a result of these and other factors, investors in our common stock may not be able to resell their shares at or above the initial offering price.\nIn the past, securities class action litigation often has been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities. This type of litigation, if directed at us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, and our business and stock price may be adversely affected if we do not adequately address those weaknesses or if we have other material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting.\nWe did not adequately implement certain controls over our financial reporting cycle. These areas included properly segregated duties due to the size of our accounting department and inefficient accounting for and reporting of complex transactions. The existence of these or one or more other material weaknesses or significant deficiencies could result in errors in our financial statements, and substantial costs and resources may be required to rectify any internal control deficiencies. If we cannot produce reliable financial reports, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, the market price of our stock could decline significantly, we may be unable to obtain additional financing to operate and expand our business, and our business and financial condition could be harmed. We have added additional support personnel in our accounting department and in December 2014 retained a chief financial officer, which we believe will remediate these weaknesses.\nOur officers and directors and their affiliates exercise significant control over us.\nOur founders, executive officers and directors and their immediate family members beneficially own, in the aggregate, approximately 53.3% of our outstanding common stock. These stockholders may have interests that are different from yours. As a result, these stockholders will be able to exercise significant control over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions, which could delay or prevent someone from acquiring or merging with us.\nProvisions of Delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we have elected to be subject to the Delaware anti-takeover provisions contained in Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. Under Delaware law, a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the Board of Directors has approved the transaction. Our Board of Directors could rely on this provision to prevent or delay an acquisition of us. For a description of our capital stock, see \u201cDescription of Capital Stock.\u201d\nFuture sales of our common stock may depress our stock price.\nSales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market by our officers, directors or significant shareholders may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Shares issued upon the exercise of outstanding options and shares issuable upon the exercise of the warrants we issued to the underwriters in our recent initial public offering also may be sold in the public market. Such sales could create the perception to the public of difficulties or problems with our business. As a result, these sales might make it more difficult for us to sell securities in the future at a time and price that we deem necessary or appropriate.\nAs of March 11, 2015, we had 9,621,581 shares of common stock outstanding. After the lock-up agreements entered into by our directors, officers and certain shareholders in connection with our initial public offering expire one year after the date of the completion of our initial public offering (or, in limited circumstances after 180 days from such date), an additional 6,171,601 shares will be eligible for sale in the public market, of which 5,132,086 shares are currently held by founders, directors, executive officers and other affiliates, and are subject to volume limitations under Rule 144 of the Securities Act and certain other restrictions. The underwriters may also, in their sole discretion, permit our founders, officers, directors and current stockholders to sell shares prior to the expiration of the lockup agreements.\nFinancial forecasting by us and financial analysts that may publish estimates of our financial results will be difficult because of our limited operating history, and our actual results may differ from forecasts.\nAs a result of our limited operating history, it is difficult to accurately forecast our revenues, operating expenses and results, and operating data. The inability by us or the financial community to accurately forecast our operating results could cause our net losses in a given quarter to be greater than expected, which could cause a decline in the trading price of our common stock. We have a limited amount of meaningful historical financial data upon which to base planned operating expenses. We base our current and forecasted expense and cash expenditure levels on our operating plans and estimates of future revenues, which are dependent on the growth of the number of customers and the demand for our products. As a result, we may be unable to make accurate financial forecasts or to adjust our spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected shortfalls in revenues. We believe that these difficulties in forecasting are even greater for financial analysts that may publish their own estimates of our financial results.\nOur management may not use the proceeds of our initial public offering effectively.\nOur management has broad discretion over the use of proceeds of our initial public offering. Accordingly, it is possible that our management may allocate the proceeds in ways that do not improve our operating results. In addition, these proceeds may not be invested to yield a favorable rate of return pending our use of the proceeds.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends. You will not receive funds without selling shares, and you may lose the entire amount of your investment.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital stock and do not intend to pay dividends in the foreseeable future. We intend to invest our future earnings, if any, to fund our growth. We cannot assure you that you will receive a positive return on your investment when you subsequently sell your shares or that you will not lose the entire amount of your investment.\nThe requirements of being a public company, including compliance with the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, may strain our resources, increase our costs and distract management, and we may be unable to comply with these requirements in a timely or cost-effective manner.\nAs a public company with listed equity securities, we need to comply with certain laws, regulations and requirements, including corporate governance provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act,\u201d related regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or \u201cSEC,\u201d and the requirements of The NASDAQ Capital Market. Complying with these statutes, regulations and requirements occupies a significant amount of time of our Board of Directors and management and results in significant costs and expenses. In addition to devoting resources to the operation of our business, we have been required to:\n\u2022\ninstitute more comprehensive corporate governance and compliance functions;\n\u2022\ndesign, establish, evaluate and maintain a system of internal control over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the related rules and regulations of the SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board;\n\u2022\ncomply with rules promulgated by The NASDAQ Capital Market;\n\u2022\nprepare and distribute periodic public reports in compliance with our obligations under the federal securities laws;\n\u2022\nestablish new internal policies, such as those relating to disclosure controls and procedures and insider trading;\n\u2022\nto a greater degree than previously, involve and retain outside counsel and accountants in the above activities; and\n\u2022\nestablish an investor relations function.\nWe are an emerging growth company and our reliance on the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions and relief from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies but are not applicable to emerging growth companies. In particular, while we are an emerging growth company, we will not be required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we will be subject to reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and we will not be required to hold non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\nWe may remain an emerging growth company until as late as December 31, 2019 (the fiscal year-end following the fifth anniversary of the completion of this offering), though we may cease to be an emerging growth company earlier under certain circumstances, including (i) if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of any June 30, in which case we would cease to be an emerging growth company as of the following December 31 or (ii) if our gross revenues exceed $1 billion in any fiscal year. Investors may find our common stock less attractive if we rely on these exemptions and relief. If some investors find our common stock less attractive for this reason, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock, and our stock price may decline and/or become more volatile.\nWe will be obligated to develop and maintain proper and effective internal controls over financial reporting. We may not complete our analysis of our internal controls over financial reporting in a timely manner, or these internal controls may not be determined to be effective, which may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nBeginning with our second annual report on SEC Form 10-K after becoming a public company, we will be required, pursuant to Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This assessment will need to include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting. We may not be able to complete evaluation, testing and any required remediation in a timely fashion. During the evaluation and testing process, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will be unable to confirm that our internal controls are effective.\nWhen we cease to be an emerging growth company, our auditors will be required to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls. If we are unable to confirm that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our auditors are unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which would cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nClaims for indemnification by our directors and officers may reduce our available funds to satisfy successful third-party claims against us and may reduce the amount of money available to us.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide that we will indemnify our directors and officers, in each case to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. In addition, we have entered and expect to continue to enter into agreements to indemnify our directors, executive officers and other employees as determined by our Board of Directors. Under the terms of such indemnification agreements, we are required to indemnify each of our directors and officers, to the fullest extent permitted by the laws of the state of Delaware, if the basis of the indemnitee\u2019s involvement was by reason of the fact that the indemnitee is or was a director or officer of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or was serving at the Company\u2019s request in an official capacity for another entity. We must indemnify our officers and directors against all reasonable fees, expenses, charges and other costs of any type or nature whatsoever, including any and all expenses and obligations paid or incurred in connection with investigating, defending, being a witness in, participating in (including on appeal), or preparing to defend, be a witness or participate in any completed, actual, pending or threatened action, suit, claim or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, or establishing or enforcing a right to indemnification under the indemnification agreement. The indemnification agreements also require us, if so requested, to advance within 30 days of such request all reasonable fees, expenses, charges and other costs that such director or officer incurred, provided that such person will return any such advance if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification by us. Any claims for indemnification by our directors and officers may reduce our available funds to satisfy successful third-party claims and may reduce the amount of money available to us.", "PERMNO": 15072, "SIC": 6794, "TIC": "JYNT"}
