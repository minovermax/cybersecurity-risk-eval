RISK FACTORS\nOur operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may affect our financial results, and the accuracy of the forward looking statements we make in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We make statements regarding anticipated product introductions and performance, changes in markets, customers and customer order rates, expenditures in research and development, growth in revenue and improvement in profits, taxation levels, the effects of product pricing, and competition, all of which represent our expectations and beliefs about future events. Our actual results may vary from these expectations because of a number of factors that affect our business. The most important of these factors include the following:\n\u2022\nWe have recently introduced or are in the process of introducing a number of products based upon our 3D MRS technology and the failure of this technology to perform up to our expectations or gain wide-spread market acceptance would materially adversely affect our future anticipated operating results. We believe our MRS technology is unique in the marketplace based upon its ability to inhibit reflections and offer microscopic quality images at production line speeds. We have high expectations about the prospect for longer-term growth in sales of products based on this technology. We have incorporated the MRS technology into various products, including our 3D AOI offerings, the SQ3000 and SQ3000\u2122 3D CMM, CyberGage\u00ae360 and products for OEM customers, including KLA, Nordson-YESTECH, and others. We also expect to use this technology in other new products, including next generation sensors and systems for semiconductor back-end, mid-end, and advanced packaging inspection and metrology applications. We believe these new products will significantly increase our revenues in the future. If the MRS technology does not meet our performance expectations, if the products we have introduced or are about to introduce based upon the MRS technology do not operate up to specifications, if the market otherwise does not find this technology attractive, or if we are unable to efficiently identify new customers and new applications for this technology given our current sales channels, our operating results for 2019, and expectations for longer-term growth in revenue, would be materially adversely affected.\n\u2022\nOur business has been and will continue to be significantly impacted by the global economy and uncertainty in the outlook for the global economy makes it more likely that our actual results will differ materially from expectations. Economic uncertainties affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways, making it difficult to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities, and negatively impacting our operating results. Economic instability or uncertainty could cause tightening of credit in financial markets, may lead consumers and businesses to postpone spending, and may cause our customers to cancel, decrease or delay their existing and future orders with us. In addition, financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers, distributors or customers could result in product delays, increased accounts receivable defaults and inventory challenges. The OEMs and semiconductor manufacturers that purchase our sensors and the manufacturers that purchase our inspection system products are largely dependent on continued demand for consumer and commercial electronics, including smartphones, tablets and computers. Demand for electronics is a function of the health of the economies in the United States and around the world. Sales of our metrology products and services are also dependent upon the health of the global economy and the competitiveness of the end products manufactured by the customers we serve. Our results would be adversely affected in the future if these economies were to experience recessions, or if the products manufactured by our end customers are not successful in the marketplace.\n\u2022\nWorld events beyond our control may affect our operations. Our operations and markets could be negatively affected by world events that effect economies and commerce in specific countries, such as China, Singapore and Japan, in which we do business. Natural disasters have affected travel patterns and accessibility in these countries in the past and other natural occurrences could affect the business we do in these countries in the future. Terrorist activity or other armed conflicts that could occur in countries in which we do business, labor disputes that impact complex international shipping arrangements, or other unanticipated actions by local populations could affect our ability to do business in specific geographies. Many of the countries in which we do business can be affected by economic forces that are different from the forces that affect the United States and change the amount of business we conduct.\n\u2022\nGlobal trade conflicts may negatively impact our sales and results of operations. Ongoing trade conflicts with other countries, particularly China, may impact our sales and results of operations. Concerns over the impact of the U.S. and China trade war on the global economy may cause our customers to refrain from making investments in capital equipment, which would negatively impact our sales. We or our suppliers source certain raw materials and components from China. If the United States were to increase existing tariff levels or impose new tariffs, our supply chain and costs would be negatively impacted, resulting in an increase in our cost structure and negatively impacting our operating profits.\n\u2022\nOur operating results have varied, and will likely continue to vary significantly, from quarter to quarter. Our quarterly operating results have varied in the past and will likely continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter. For example, our expectation for sales in the first quarter of 2019 is significantly lower than our sales in the fourth quarter of 2018. Some of the factors that may influence our operating results include the following: changes in customer demand for our sensors, inspection systems and metrology products, which is influenced by economic conditions in our markets and the overall health of the global economy; demand for products that use circuit boards and semiconductors; market acceptance of our products and those developed by our OEM customers; competition; seasonal variations in customer demand; the timing, cancellation or delay of customer orders, particularly our 3D MRS-enabled AOI systems and MX600 memory module inspection systems; the timing of product shipments and related customer acceptances; and product development and other costs, including increased research, development, engineering and marketing expenses associated with our introduction of new products and product enhancements, and ongoing sales and marketing activities.\n\u2022\nThe markets for capital equipment in the electronics assembly and semiconductor industries in which we operate are cyclical, and we cannot predict with precision when market downturns will occur. We operate in cyclical markets - the electronics assembly and semiconductor capital equipment markets - that periodically adjust independent of global economic conditions. For example, sluggish conditions in the markets for electronics assembly and semiconductor capital equipment emerged late in the fourth quarter of 2018. In the past, we have not been able to predict with accuracy the timing or magnitude of periodic downturns in these markets. Some of these downturns have severely affected our operations and generated several years of unprofitable operations. Ultimately, we have difficulty determining the duration or severity of any market downturns, the strength of any subsequent recoveries, and the long-term impact that economic conditions may have on our business.\n\u2022\nSales of sensors to five OEM customers constituted 30% of our revenue in 2018, and the loss of any of these customers could have a materially adverse impact on our results of operations. Although we anticipate that our future revenue and operations will be less dependent on any particular customer, given recent success with new products based on our high precision 3D MRS sensor technology, and the anticipated future revenue potential of our other products, including those products we anticipate introducing in the future, if the order rates from these five OEM customers are negatively impacted by global economic events or competitive factors, if they choose sensors manufactured by other suppliers, or otherwise terminate their relationships with us, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\u2022\nWe generate over 70% of our revenue from export sales that are subject to risks of international operations. Our export sales are subject to many of the risks of international operations, including:\n\u2022\ncurrency controls and fluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nchanges in local market business requirements and increased cost and development time required to modify and translate our products for local markets;\n\u2022\ninability to recruit qualified personnel in a specific country or region;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in establishing and maintaining relationships with local vendors;\n\u2022\ndiffering foreign technical standards;\n\u2022\ndiffering regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nexport restrictions and controls, tariffs and other trade barriers;\n\u2022\nreduced protection for intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nchanges in political and economic conditions;\n\u2022\npotentially adverse tax assessments; and\n\u2022\nterrorism, disease, or other events that may affect local economies and our access to markets outside the United States.\n\u2022\nOur development and assembly operations in Singapore, and our sales operations in Asia, are subject to unique risks because of the remote nature of the operations. Our Singapore development and manufacturing operations, and our Asian sales operations, present a number of risks. These risks relate to the retention of personnel, management of product development and operations, management and access to customer and distributor interactions, control over administrative and business processes, regulatory and legal issues and other matters relating to foreign operations. Our financial performance, ability to serve our customers and ability to manufacture and sell products in Asia could be negatively impacted if we are unable to retain our Asian based employees, if it costs more than expected to retain these employees or hire other experienced employees in a timely manner, if we are unable to manage these employees appropriately, or if we are unable to locate suitable sources of components for our products manufactured in Asia.\n\u2022\nExchange rate fluctuations may have a significant negative impact on our revenue and results of operations. Most of our international export sales are negotiated, invoiced and paid in U.S. dollars. Significant fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies could have a negative impact on the price competitiveness of our products relative to foreign competitors and the willingness of customers to purchase our products. A significant portion of our cost of revenues, research and development and sales and marketing costs are denominated in the Singapore dollar. In addition, other sales and marketing costs are denominated in British Pounds Sterling and the Chinese Yuan. Our costs will increase and our results will be negatively impacted in future periods, if the U.S. dollar weakens relative to the currencies of these countries. Fluctuations in the relationship between the U.S. dollar and the currencies of other geographies could have a significant negative impact on our future revenue, costs and results of operations.\n\u2022\nOur products could become obsolete. Our current products, as well as the products we have under development, are designed to operate with the technology that we believe currently exists or may exist for electronic components, printed circuit boards, memory modules and semiconductor manufacturing markets, including semiconductor back-end, mid-end and advanced packaging inspection and metrology applications. The products we develop to meet customer needs and requirements are subject to rapid technological change and, because it takes considerable time to develop new products, we must anticipate industry trends, as well as technological developments, in order to effectively compete. Further, because we do not have unlimited development resources, we might choose to forgo the pursuit of what becomes a leading technology or market and devote our resources to technologies and markets that are less successful. If we incorrectly anticipate technology developments or market trends, or have inadequate resources to develop our products to deal with changes in technology and markets, our products could become obsolete, and our future revenue and operating results would be negatively impacted.\n\u2022\nThe market for most surface mount capital equipment has become more mature and price competitive. The electronics capital equipment market for surface mount technologies is becoming more mature, resulting in increased price pressure on suppliers of this type of equipment. Consequently, our SMT electronic assembly inspection systems and alignment sensor products have become subject to increased levels of price competition and competition from other suppliers, which may or may not utilize different technology, including lower cost Asian based suppliers.\n\u2022\nThe market for 3D AOI equipment for printed circuit board inspection has become more price competitive, which has negatively impacted our margins. Pricing for 3D AOI equipment for inspection of printed circuit boards with less demanding features and complexity has become more competitive, resulting in increased price pressure. In some instances, our SQ3000 3D AOI system competes in the marketplace for inspection of printed circuit boards in which the inspection requirements are less complex and stringent. In this segment of the market, we have experienced competitive pressures that have reduced the sales prices for our SQ3000 3D AOI system, which in turn has negatively impacted our revenue and gross margins. If this level of competition were to increase in the future, our revenue and gross margins would be negatively impacted.\n\u2022\nBecause of the high cost of changing equipment, customers in our markets are sometimes resistant to purchasing our products even if they are superior. We believe that, because of the high cost of installation and integration of new inspection equipment into production lines, once an SMT customer has selected a vendor\u2019s equipment, the customer generally relies upon that equipment and, to the extent possible, subsequent generations of the same vendor\u2019s equipment. Accordingly, unless our systems offer performance or cost advantages that outweigh the expense of installing and integrating new systems, it may be difficult for us to achieve significant sales to a customer that currently uses a competitor\u2019s equipment.\n\u2022\nOur ability to compete in the markets for our products is dependent upon our ability to recruit new capable channel partners and direct sales employees and the sales skills of our channel partners and employees. In order to generate significant incremental revenue in the future, we need to expand and enhance our sales capabilities by recruiting new, high quality channel partners and sales employees. Our efforts to increase the size and capability of our direct sales team and channel partners will increase our cost structure. If we are unable to successfully improve our direct sales team and sales channel, our future sales will be negatively impacted, and we will not obtain an adequate return on the increase in our cost structure. To the extent our competitors have relationships with stronger channel partners, it may be difficult for us to achieve significant incremental revenue, even if our products are technologically superior.\n\u2022\nCompetitors in Asia may be able to compete favorably with us based on lower production and employee costs. We compete with large multinational companies when selling our inspection system products. These competitors are able to take advantage of greater financial resources and larger sales distribution networks. We also compete with new Asian based suppliers, many of which may have lower overall production and employee costs and are willing to offer their products at lower selling prices to customers.\n\u2022\nWe are exposed to credit risk through sales to our OEM customers and distributors of our inspection system and metrology products. We sell our products through key OEM customers, and usually have significant credit exposure with respect to these customers. In addition, we sell our inspection system and metrology products through a network of international distributors. These distributors tend to be small and have limited financial resources and access to capital. Although these distributors do not hold our products in inventory for re-sale, we are exposed to credit risk and would incur losses if they are unable to pay for the products they have purchased from us.\n\u2022\nWe are dependent upon outside suppliers for components of our products, and delays in or unavailability of those components would adversely affect our results. We use outside contractors to manufacture the components used in many of our products and some of the components we order require significant lead times that could affect our ability to sell our products if the components are not available. In addition, if these components do not meet stringent quality requirements or become obsolete, there could be delays in the availability of our products, and we could be required to make significant investments in designing replacement components.\n\u2022\nBreaches of our network security could expose us to losses. We manage and store on our network systems various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our operations and products. There has been an increasing incidence of unauthorized access to the computer networks of various technology companies. Computer programmers and hackers may be able to gain unauthorized access to our network system and steal proprietary information, compromise confidential information, create system disruptions, or cause shutdowns. These parties may also be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that disrupt our operations and create security vulnerabilities. Attacks on our network systems could result in significant losses, compromise our competitive advantages and damage our reputation with customers.\n\u2022\nOur efforts to protect our intellectual property may be less effective in certain foreign countries, where intellectual property rights are not as well protected as in the United States. The laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the U.S., and many U.S. companies have encountered substantial problems in protecting their proprietary rights against infringement abroad. Consequently, there is a risk that we may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary rights in certain foreign countries. If this occurs, it would be easier for our competitors to develop and sell competing products in these countries.\n\u2022\nWe may fail to adequately protect our intellectual property and therefore lose our competitive advantage. Our future success and competitive position depend in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary technology for our principal product families, and we rely, in part, on patent and trade secret law and confidentiality agreements to protect that technology. If we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property, our competitors may be able to duplicate and enhance the products we have developed. We own or have licensed a number of patents, and have filed applications for additional patents. Any of our pending patent applications may be rejected, and we may be unable to develop additional proprietary technology that is patentable in the future. In addition, the patents that we do own or that have been issued or licensed to us may not provide us with competitive advantages and may be challenged by third parties. Further, third parties may also design around these patents. In addition to patent protection, we rely upon trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information and technology. We routinely enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and other third parties. Even though these agreements are in place, there can be no assurance that trade secrets and proprietary information will not be disclosed, that others will not independently develop technology substantially equivalent to our proprietary technology or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets, or that we can fully protect our trade secrets and proprietary information. Violations by others of our confidentiality agreements and the loss of employees who have specialized knowledge and expertise could harm our competitive position and cause our sales and operating results to decline as a result of increased competition. Costly and time-consuming litigation might be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights, and failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection might adversely affect our ability to continue our research or bring products to market.\n\u2022\nProtection of our intellectual property rights, or the efforts of third parties to enforce their own intellectual property rights against us, may result in costly and time-consuming litigation, substantial damages, lost product sales and/or the loss of important intellectual property rights. We may be required to initiate litigation in order to enforce any patents issued to or licensed by us, or to determine the scope or validity of a third party\u2019s patent or other proprietary rights. Any litigation, regardless of outcome, could be expensive and time consuming, and could subject us to significant liabilities or require us to re-engineer our products or obtain expensive licenses from third parties. There can be no assurance that any patents issued to or licensed by us will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted thereunder will provide us with a competitive advantage. In addition, our commercial success depends in part on our ability to avoid infringing or misappropriating patents or other proprietary rights owned by third parties. We periodically receive communications from third parties asserting that our products infringe, or may infringe, the proprietary rights of these third parties or others. These claims of infringement may lead to protracted and costly litigation, which could require us to pay substantial damages or have the sale of our products stopped by an injunction. Infringement lawsuits or claims could also cause product delays or require us to redesign our products and these delays could result in the loss of substantial revenues. We may also be required to obtain a license from the third party or cease activities utilizing the third party\u2019s proprietary rights. We may not be able to enter into such a license or such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms. Accordingly, the patent infringement litigation or claims could hinder our ability to sell our products, or make the sale of these products more expensive.\n\u2022\nWe have significant deferred tax assets recorded on our balance sheet based on the income tax laws and income tax rates at which they are expected to be utilized in the future. Our ability to utilize these deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient profits in future periods. A change in income tax laws or a further reduction in income tax rates in the future could require us to write-down the value of our deferred tax assets. The amount of any write-down could be large and may result in a significant charge against future earnings. Our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets and realize their value is dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient levels of profitability and taxable income in future periods. If we do not generate sufficient profits and taxable income in future periods, we most likely would be required to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets, resulting in a significant charge against earnings.\n\u2022\nOur stock price is highly volatile. The trading price of our common stock fluctuates significantly in response to, among other risks, the risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as:\n\u2022\nconditions or trends in the industry in which we operate\u037e\n\u2022\nquarterly variations in our operating results\u037e\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the stock market in general and market prices for the stock of companies that provide sensing technology solutions in particular\u037e\n\u2022\nchanges in financial estimates by us or securities analysts and recommendations by securities analysts\u037e\n\u2022\nchanges in capital structure, including issuance of additional debt or equity to the public\u037e and\n\u2022\ntransactions in our common stock by major investors and certain analyst reports, news and speculation.\n\u2022\nThe absence of significant market liquidity in our common stock could impact the ability of our shareholders to purchase and sell larger blocks, the attractiveness of our stock to institutional shareholders, and the market value of our common stock. There were 7,100,825 shares of our common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2018. Although our common stock is traded in the NASDAQ Global Market, in part because of the number of shares we have outstanding and available for trading, the daily trading volume in our stock is low, averaging less than 50,000 shares per day. Shareholders wishing to purchase or sell larger blocks of stock may not be able to do so quickly, and disposal by any shareholder of a significant block of stock could adversely affect the sale price in the marketplace. Further, institutional investors often have policies against investment in stock that is illiquid, and many institutional investors may elect not to purchase or hold our stock because of the inability to dispose of it. Lack of institutional interest in our common stock can negatively impact its market price and liquidity.\n\u2022\nWe must attract, engage, retain and integrate key research and development employees in order to be successful, and failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our ability to profitably grow our business. Identifying, hiring, developing, training and retaining highly-skilled research and development employees is critical to our future, and competition for these types of employees is intense. Failure to successfully hire key research and development employees or the loss of key research and development employees could have a significant negative impact on our ability to create innovative new products, effectively compete in the markets we serve, and on our ability to profitably grow our business.\n\u2022\nWe are dependent on several key employees, including Dr. Subodh Kulkarni, our President and Chief Executive Officer, for new product innovation and much of the sales, marketing and business development activity related to our products (especially our MRS sensors). These key employees perform a critical role for us with respect to product strategy and new product development. Also, they have been instrumental in development and expansion of our relationships with key OEM customers, including KLA and Nordson-YESTECH. If the employment of Dr. Kulkarni and other key employees with CyberOptics were to end for any reason, our ability to develop innovative products and achieve sustained long-term revenue growth may be negatively impacted.", "PERMNO": 11825, "SIC": 3827, "TIC": "CYBE"}
