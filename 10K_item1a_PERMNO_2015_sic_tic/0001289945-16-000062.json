RISK FACTORS\nThe following important factors, among others, could cause our actual operating results to differ materially from those indicated or suggested by forward-looking statements made in this 2015 Form 10-K or presented elsewhere by management from time to time.\nThe rate of subscriber and revenue erosion could exceed our ability to reduce operating expenses in order to maintain overall positive operating cash flow.\nOur wireless revenue is dependent on the number of subscribers that use our paging devices. There is intense competition for these subscribers from other paging service providers and alternate wireless communications providers such as mobile phone and mobile data service providers. In addition to competition, our customers may be impacted by the introduction of new technologies. We are unable to predict how customer perceptions of the value of our wireless services will be impacted by the development of new wireless technologies.\nWe expect our subscriber numbers and revenue to continue to decline into the foreseeable future. As this revenue erosion continues, maintaining positive cash flow is dependent on substantial and timely reductions in selected operating expenses. Reductions in operating expenses require both the reduction of internal costs and negotiation of lower costs from outside vendors. There can be no assurance that we will be able to reduce our operating expenses commensurate with the level of revenue erosion. The inability to reduce operating expenses would have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and statement of income including our continued ability to remain profitable, produce positive operating cash flow, pay cash dividends to stockholders, and repurchase shares of our common stock.\nService to our customers could be adversely impacted by network rationalization.\nWe have an active program to consolidate the number of networks and related transmitter locations, which is referred to as network rationalization. Network rationalization is necessary to match our technical infrastructure to our smaller subscriber base and to reduce both site rent and telecommunication costs. The implementation of the network rationalization program could adversely impact service to our existing subscribers despite our efforts to minimize the impact on subscribers. This adverse impact could increase the rate of gross subscriber cancellations and/or the level of wireless revenue erosion. Adverse changes in gross subscriber cancellations and/or revenue erosion could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and statement of income, including our continued ability to remain profitable, produce positive operating cash flow, pay cash dividends to stockholders, and repurchase shares of our common stock.\nWe may be unable to find vendors able to supply us with paging equipment based on future demands.\nWe purchase paging equipment from third party vendors. This equipment is sold or leased to customers in order to provide wireless messaging services. The reduction in industry demand for paging equipment has caused various suppliers to cease manufacturing this equipment. There can be no assurance that we can continue to find vendors to supply paging equipment, or that the vendors will supply equipment at costs that allow us to remain a competitive alternative in the wireless messaging industry. A lack of paging equipment could impact our ability to provide certain wireless messaging services and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and statement of income, including our continued ability to remain profitable, produce positive operating cash flow, pay cash dividends to stockholders, and repurchase shares of our common stock.\nIf we are unable to retain key management personnel, we might not be able to find suitable replacements in a timely basis, or at all, and our business could be disrupted.\nOur success is largely dependent upon the continued service of a relatively small group of experienced and knowledgeable executive and management personnel. We believe that there is, and will continue to be, intense competition for qualified personnel in the telecommunication and software industries, and there is no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain the personnel necessary for the management and development of our business. Turnover, particularly among senior management, can also create distractions as we search for replacement personnel, which could result in significant recruiting, relocation, training and other costs, and can cause operational inefficiencies as replacement personnel become familiar with our business and operations. In addition, manpower in certain areas may be constrained, which could lead to disruptions over time. The elimination or reconfiguration of employee responsibilities could impact retention decisions by key executives and management personnel. The loss or unavailability of one or more of our executive officers or the inability to attract or retain key employees in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and statement of income, including our continued ability to remain profitable, produce positive operating cash flow, pay cash dividends to stockholders, and repurchase shares of our common stock.\nIn order to grow our software revenue and bookings and maintain our wireless revenue and subscribers we are dependent on our ability to effectively manage our employee base in areas such as sales, marketing, product development and implementation.\nGrowth in our software revenue and bookings and maintenance of our wireless revenue and subscriber base is dependent on the productivity of our sales organization. A number of mitigating factors could adversely impact our productivity assumptions. Those factors include competitive forces, employee turnover, product innovation and overall market conditions. Our software revenue and bookings growth is also dependent on our ability to attract, integrate and retain employees in our operations. To protect our employee base from competition for talent, we review market based compensation information and develop a market-competitive compensation and rewards strategy. The future costs of these programs is dependent on market conditions that are subject to change. Adverse changes in our sales productivity or ability to attract, integrate and retain employees could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and statement of income including our continued ability to remain profitable, produce positive operating cash flow, pay dividends to stockholders and repurchase shares of our common stock.\nWe may experience a long sales cycle for our software products.\nOur software revenue growth results from a long sales cycle that from initial contact to final sales order may take six to 18 months depending on the type of software solution. Our software sales and marketing efforts involve educating our customers on the technical capabilities of our software solutions and the potential benefits from the deployment of our software. The inherent unpredictability of decision making resulting from budget constraints, multiple approvals and administrative issues may result in fluctuating bookings and revenue from month to month and quarter to quarter. Our bookings and corresponding revenue are dependent on actions that have occurred in the past. In every month we need to spend substantial time, effort, and expense on our marketing and sales efforts that may not result in future revenue.\nThe impact of this sales cycle could adversely impact our operating cash flow and margins and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and statement of income, including our continued ability to remain profitable, produce positive operating cash flow, pay cash dividends to stockholders, and repurchase shares of our common stock.\nWe may be unable to maintain successful relationship with our channel partners.\nWe use channel partners such as resellers, consulting firms, original equipment manufacturers, and technology partners to license and support our products. Contract defaults by any of these channel partners may materially adversely affect our ability to develop, market, sell, or support our communication solution offerings. If we are unable to maintain our relationships with these channel partners, and our channel partners fail to comply with their contractual obligations to us, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and statement of income, including our continued ability to remain profitable, produce positive operating cash flow, pay cash dividends to stockholders, and repurchase shares of our common stock.\nWe may be unable to realize the benefits associated with our deferred income tax assets.\nWe have significant deferred income tax assets that are available to offset future taxable income and increase cash flows from operations. The use of these deferred income tax assets is dependent on the availability of taxable income in future periods. The availability of future taxable income is dependent on our ability to profitably manage our operations to support a growing base of software revenue offset by declining wireless subscribers and revenue. To the extent that anticipated reductions in operating expenses do not occur or sufficient revenue is not generated, we may not achieve sufficient taxable income to allow for use of our deferred income tax assets. The accounting for deferred income tax assets is based upon an estimate of future results, and the\nvaluation allowance may be increased or decreased as conditions change or if we are unable to implement certain tax planning strategies. If we are unable to use these deferred income tax assets, our financial condition and statement of income may be materially affected. In addition, a significant portion of our deferred income tax assets relate to net operating losses. If our ability to utilize these losses is limited, due to Internal Revenue Code (\u201cIRC\u201d) Section 382, our financial condition and statement of income may be materially affected.\nOur wireless products are regulated by the FCC and, to a lesser extent, state and local regulatory authorities. Changes in regulation could result in increased costs to us and our customers.\nWe are subject to regulation by the FCC and, to a lesser extent, by state and local authorities. Changes in regulatory policy could increase the fees we must pay to the government or to third parties, and could subject us to more stringent requirements that could cause us to incur additional capital and/or operating costs. To the extent additional regulatory costs are passed along to customers, those increased costs could adversely impact subscriber cancellations.\nFor example, the FCC issued an order in October 2007 that mandated paging carriers (including the Company) along with all other CMRS providers serving a defined minimum number of subscribers to maintain an emergency back-up power supply at all cell sites to enable operation for a minimum of eight hours in the event of a loss of commercial power (the \u201cBack-up Power Order\u201d). Ultimately, after a hearing by the DC Circuit Court and disapproval by the Office of Management and Budget (the \u201cOMB\u201d) of the information collection requirements of the Back-Up Power Order, the FCC indicated that it would not seek to override the OMB\u2019s disapproval. Rather the FCC indicated that it would issue a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking with the goal of adopting revised back-up power rules. To date, there has been no Notice of Proposed Rulemaking by the FCC and we are unable to predict what impact, if any, a revised back-up power rule could have on our operations, cash flows, ability to continue payment of cash dividends to stockholders, and ability to repurchase shares of our common stock.\nThe FCC continues to consider changes to the rules governing the collection of universal service fees. The FCC is evaluating a flat monthly charge per assigned telephone number as opposed to assessing universal service contributions based on telecommunication carriers\u2019 interstate revenue. There is no timetable for any rulemaking to implement this numbers-based methodology. If the FCC adopts a numbers-based methodology, our attempt to recover the increased contribution costs from our customers could significantly diminish demand for our services, and our failure to recover such increased contribution costs could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and statement of income, including our continued ability to remain profitable, produce positive operating cash flow, pay cash dividends to stockholders and repurchase shares of our common stock.\nCertain of our software products are regulated by the FDA. The application of or changes in regulations could impact our ability to market new or revised software products to our customers.\nCertain of our software products are regulated by the FDA as medical devices. The classification of our software products as medical devices means that we are required to comply with certain registration and listing, labeling, medical device reporting, removal and correction, and good manufacturing practice requirements. Updates to these products or the development of new products could require us to seek clearance from the FDA before we are permitted to market or sell these software products. In addition, changes to FDA regulations could impact existing software products or updates to existing products. The impact of delays in FDA clearance or changes to FDA regulations could impact our ability to market or sell our software products and could have a material adverse effect on our software sales, financial condition and statement of income, including our continued ability to remain profitable, produce positive operating cash flow, pay cash dividends to stockholders and repurchase shares of our common stock.\nWe have investigated potential acquisitions and may not be able to identify an opportunity at favorable terms or have the ability to close on financing necessary to consummate the transaction\nWe cannot provide any assurances that we will be successful in finding such acquisitions or consummating future acquisitions on favorable terms. We anticipate that our acquisitions will be financed through a combination of methods, including but not limited to the use of available cash on hand, and, if necessary, borrowings from third party financial institutions. Disruptions in credit markets and an unwillingness to lend may limit our ability to finance acquisitions.\nWe have investigated potential acquisitions and may be unable to successfully integrate such acquisitions into our business and may not achieve all or any of the operating synergies or anticipated benefits of those acquisitions.\nWe continue to evaluate acquisitions of other businesses where we believe such acquisitions will yield increased cash flows, improved market penetration and/or identified operating efficiencies and synergies. We may face various challenges with our integration efforts, including the combination and simplification of product and service offerings, sales and marketing approaches and establishment of combined operations. Although acquired businesses may have significant operating histories, we may have\nlimited or no history of owning and operating these businesses. If we were to acquire these businesses, there can be no assurance that:\n\u2022\nsuch businesses will perform as expected;\n\u2022\nsuch businesses will not incur unforeseen obligations or liabilities;\n\u2022\nsuch businesses will generate sufficient cash flow to support the indebtedness, if incurred, to acquire them or the expenditures needed to develop them; and/or\n\u2022\nthe rate of return from such businesses will justify the decision to invest the capital to acquire them.\nIf we do not realize all or any of the anticipated benefits of an acquisition, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and statement of income, including our continued ability to remain profitable, produce positive operating cash flow, pay cash dividends to stockholders, and repurchase shares of our common stock.\nTechnical problems and higher costs may affect our product development initiatives.\nOur future software revenue growth depends on our ability to develop, introduce and effectively deploy new solutions and features to our existing software solutions. These new features and functionalities are designed to address both existing and new customer requirements. We may experience technical problems and additional costs as these new features are tested and deployed. Failure to effectively develop new or improved software solutions could adversely impact software revenue growth and could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition and statement of income including our continued ability to remain profitable, produce positive operating cash flow, pay cash dividends to stockholders, and repurchase shares of our common stock.\nWe may experience litigation on intellectual property infringement.\nIntellectual property infringement litigation has become commonplace. This litigation can be protracted, expensive, and time consuming. Although we have not experienced any litigation of this type in the past, there is no assurance that we will remain immune to this type of predatory litigation. Any such claims, whether meritorious or not, could be time consuming and costly in terms of both resources and management time.\nThird parties may claim we infringe their intellectual property rights. We may receive claims that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others, including claims regarding patents, copyrights, and trademarks. The number of these claims may grow as a result of constant technological change in the segments in which our software products compete, the extensive patent coverage of existing technologies, and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents.\nOur portfolio of issued patents and copyrights may be insufficient to defend ourselves against intellectual property infringement claims. We understand these risks and will take reasonable and appropriate action to protect ourselves as we develop and deploy additional software solutions. Should we experience litigation on intellectual property infringement, such litigation could have a material adverse impact on our ability to sell our software solutions and on our financial condition and statement of income including our continued ability to remain profitable, produce positive operating cash flow, pay cash dividends to stockholders, and repurchase shares of our common stock.\nWe may encounter issues with privacy and security of personal information.\nA substantial portion of our revenue comes from healthcare customers. Our software solutions may handle or have access to personal health information subject in the United States to HIPPA, HITECH and related regulations as well as legislation and regulations in foreign countries. These statutes and related regulations impose numerous requirements regarding the use and disclosure of personal health information with which we must comply. Our failure to accurately anticipate or interpret these complex and technical laws and regulations could subject us to civil and/or criminal liability. Such failure could adversely impact our ability to market and sell our software solutions to healthcare customers, and have a material adverse impact on our software sales, financial condition and statement of income including our continued ability to remain profitable, produce positive operating cash flow, pay cash dividends to stockholders and repurchase shares of our common stock.\nSystem disruptions and security threats to our computer networks, satellite control or telecommunications systems could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe performance and reliability of our computer network and telecommunications systems infrastructure is critical to our operations. Any computer system or satellite network error or failure, regardless of cause, could result in a substantial outage that materially disrupts our operations. In addition, we face the threat to our computer systems of unauthorized access, computer hackers, computer viruses, malicious code, organized cyber-attacks and other security problems and system disruptions. Our computer systems may be vulnerable to these threats. A user who circumvents security measures could misappropriate proprietary\ninformation or cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations. We utilize a multilayered security framework including detailed security policies and procedures, security appliances and software, third party vulnerability testing and detailed Business Continuity Plans. However, we may be required to expend significant resources to protect against the threat of these system disruptions and security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by these disruptions and breaches. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, statement of income and cash flows.\nWe may encounter issues with international sales and expansion.\nA portion of our revenue comes from international sales and we plan to further expand our international presence. We may not be successful in our efforts to expand into these international markets. Our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks, including:\n\u2022\ncompliance with foreign and United States laws and regulations including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the United Kingdom Bribery Act of 2010;\n\u2022\nvolatility in international political and economic environments;\n\u2022\nimposition of taxes, export controls, tariffs, embargoes and other trade barriers;\n\u2022\nchanges in regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nlack of strong intellectual property protection;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in staffing, developing and managing foreign operations;\n\u2022\nlimitations on the repatriation and investment of funds;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; and\n\u2022\ngeopolitical developments, including war and terrorism.\nIn addition, uncertain economic conditions in Australia, Asia (particularly China) and the Pacific Rim and Europe, the implementation of stringent financial austerity measures by many national governments, and the continuing risk of conflict and political instability in the Middle East could lead to delays or cancellations of our sales orders and impact our ability to timely execute our sales strategy and generate bookings and software revenue.\nWe are unable to predict the impact of these factors. Any one or more of these factors could adversely affect our business, financial condition and statement of income including our continued ability to remain profitable, produce positive operating cash flow, pay cash dividends to stockholders, and repurchase shares of our common stock.\nGeneral economic conditions that are largely out of our control may adversely affect our financial condition and statement of income.\nOur business is sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, both in the United States and foreign markets. Recessionary economic cycles, higher interest rates, inflation, higher levels of unemployment, higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws, or other economic factors that may affect business spending or buying habits could adversely affect the demand for our services. This adverse impact could increase the rate of gross subscriber cancellations and/or the level of revenue erosion. Adverse changes in gross subscriber cancellations and/or revenue erosion could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and statement of income, including our continued ability to remain profitable, produce positive operating cash flow, pay cash dividends to stockholders, and repurchase shares of our common stock.\nA significant portion of our revenue is derived from healthcare customers and we are impacted by changes in the healthcare economic environment. The healthcare industry is highly regulated and is subject to changing political, legislative, regulatory, and other economic developments. These developments can have a dramatic effect on the decision-making and the spending for information technology and software. This economic uncertainty can add to the unpredictability of decision-making and lengthen our sales cycle.\nFurther, the consequences of the implementation of healthcare reform legislation continue to impact both the economy in general and the healthcare market in particular. The uncertainty created by the legislation is impacting customer decision making and information technology plans in our key healthcare market. We are unable to predict the full consequences of this uncertainty on our operations. Adverse changes in the economic environment could adversely impact our ability to market and sell our wireless and software solutions to healthcare customers and have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and statement of income including our continued ability to remain profitable, produce positive operating cash flow, pay cash dividends to stockholders, and repurchase shares of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 90464, "SIC": 4812, "TIC": "SPOK"}
