RISK FACTORS\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K, including Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contains forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties that could cause our future business, financial condition or results of operations to differ materially from our historical results or currently anticipated results, including those set forth below.\nRisks Related to Our Pending Acquisition\nOur pending acquisition is subject to various uncertainties, including closing conditions that are outside of our control, and there can be no assurances as to whether and when it may be completed.\nOn April 30, 2015, we entered into a Merger Agreement with entities that were formed on behalf of affiliates of the Consortium pursuant to which the Consortium will acquire us. The consummation of\nthe merger is subject to customary closing conditions and a number of the conditions are not within our control, and may prevent, delay or otherwise materially adversely affect the completion of the transaction. These conditions include, among other things:\n\u2022 the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the requisite affirmative vote of our stockholders;\n\u2022 the receipt of applicable approvals from regulatory bodies in the United States and the People's Republic of China;\n\u2022 the absence of any legal restraints or prohibitions on the consummation of the merger; and\n\u2022 our divestiture of certain of our investments in Taiwan.\nIn addition, it is possible that a change, event, fact, effect or circumstance could occur that could lead to a material adverse effect to us, which may give the Consortium the ability to not complete the merger. We cannot predict with certainty whether and when any of the required closing conditions will be satisfied or if another uncertainty may arise.\nThe Merger Agreement may also be terminated under specified circumstances, including by the Consortium if, among other things, an alternative proposal to acquire us is publicly commenced by a third party and we have not taken certain actions within a specified period of time.\nIf the merger does not receive, or timely receive, the required regulatory approvals and clearance, or if the Merger Agreement is terminated or another event occurs delaying or preventing the merger, such delay or failure to complete the merger may cause uncertainty or other negative consequences that may materially and adversely affect our sales, financial performance and operating results, and the price per share for our common stock and perceived acquisition value.\nAdditionally, if the merger is not completed for any reason, to the extent that the current market price of our common stock reflects an increase resulting from a market assumption that the transaction will be completed, the market price of our common stock may decline by the value attributed to this assumption, or could decline even more. Furthermore, we will be required to pay certain costs relating to the merger, whether or not it is completed, such as significant fees and expenses relating to legal, accounting and other services. In addition, we could be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the merger. If the merger is not completed, these risks may materially and adversely affect our stock price, operating results and ongoing business.\nOur obligation to pay a termination fee to the Consortium under certain circumstances could require us to use available cash that would have otherwise been available for general corporate purposes and may discourage other companies from trying to acquire us.\nIf the Merger Agreement is terminated, in certain circumstances, we would be required to pay the Consortium a termination fee of $28.0 million, which may require us to use available cash that would have otherwise been available for general corporate purposes. Furthermore, until the merger is completed or the Merger Agreement is terminated, with limited exceptions, we are prohibited from entering into or soliciting any acquisition proposals, and these provisions coupled with a potential termination fee, if any, could discourage other companies from trying to acquire us for a higher price. For these and other reasons, a failed merger could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition, which in turn would materially and adversely affect our business or financial condition, the price per share of our common stock or our perceived acquisition value.\nWhile the merger is pending, we are subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions that could materially adversely affect our business relationships with our customers, vendors, suppliers and other third parties.\nThe Merger Agreement includes restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to the completion of the merger, generally requiring us to conduct our business in the regular and ordinary course, consistent with past practice and policies, and subjecting us to a variety of specified limitations absent the Consortium's prior written consent. We may find that these and other contractual arrangements in the Merger Agreement may delay or prevent us from or limit our ability to respond effectively to competitive pressures, industry developments and future business opportunities that may arise during such period, even if our management and board of directors think they may be advisable. The pendency of the merger may also divert management's attention and our resources from ongoing business and operations. Our employees, customers, vendors and suppliers may have uncertainties about the effects of the merger. In connection with the pending merger, it is possible that our business relationships with our customers, vendors, suppliers and others may be subject to disruption as these parties may elect to delay or defer certain business decisions, including purchase or design-win decisions, or might decide to seek to terminate, change or renegotiate their relationship with us as a result of the merger. If any of these effects were to occur, it could materially and adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition, as well as the market price of our common stock and our perceived acquisition value, regardless of whether the merger is completed. The adverse effect of any such disruptions could be exacerbated by a delay in the completion of the acquisition for any reason, including delays associated with obtaining regulatory approvals, or termination of the merger agreement. In addition, whether or not the merger is completed, while it is pending we will continue to incur costs, fees, expenses and charges related to the proposed merger, which may materially and adversely affect our business results and financial condition.\nWe may have difficulty motivating and retaining executives and other key employees due to the pending acquisition.\nCurrent and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with us following completion of the merger, which may materially adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key employees and have an adverse effect on us while the acquisition is pending. This uncertainty may impair our ability to retain and motivate key personnel in the months leading up to the completion of the acquisition. If key employees depart because of this uncertainty or other issues related to the merger, we may incur significant costs in identifying, hiring, and retaining replacements for departing employees, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nIf the proposed acquisition is not completed, we will have incurred substantial costs that may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition as well as the market price of our common stock.\nIf the merger is not completed, the price of our common stock may decline to the extent that such market price reflects a market assumption that the merger will be completed. In addition, we have incurred and will incur substantial costs in connection with the proposed merger. These costs are primarily associated with the fees of our financial advisors, accountants, and legal counsel and will be payable regardless of whether the merger is completed. In addition, as part of preparing for the closing of the merger, we have taken actions necessary to divest certain of our investments in Taiwan. If the merger is not completed, we may not be able to unwind these actions or the divestiture of such investments.\nWe have also diverted significant management resources in an effort to complete the merger. If the acquisition is not completed, we will have received little or no benefit in respect of such costs incurred. Furthermore, if the merger is not completed, we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets and our vendors, suppliers, customers, customer prospects, and employees. Any of these factors could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition or on the trading price of our common stock.\nIn connection with the Merger Agreement, a number of lawsuits have been filed against us challenging the merger, and an unfavorable judgment or ruling in one or more of these lawsuits could prevent or delay the consummation of the merger, result in substantial costs, or have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nBeginning on May 4, 2015, a number of putative class action lawsuits have been filed in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Santa Clara. In general, the lawsuits assert that, among other things, the members of our board of directors breached their fiduciary duties to stockholders by initiating a process that undervalues our company, by agreeing to a transaction that does not adequately reflect our true value, and that we and the Consortium aided and abetted the board of directors' alleged breaches of fiduciary duties. The lawsuits generally seek to enjoin the merger as contemplated by the Merger Agreement, or, alternatively, seek rescission of a consummated merger. No trial date has been set. We currently are unable to predict the outcome of this action and therefore cannot determine the likelihood of loss nor estimate the loss or a range of possible loss.\nLitigation is inherently uncertain, and there can be no assurances that the defense of these stockholder lawsuits will be successful. In addition, we have obligations, under certain circumstances, to hold harmless and indemnify each of the defendant directors against judgments, fines, settlements and expenses related to claims against such directors and otherwise to the fullest extent permitted under Delaware law and our bylaws and certificate of incorporation. Such obligations may apply to these lawsuits. An unfavorable outcome in these lawsuits could prevent or delay the consummation of the merger, result in substantial costs to us, or have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nFor the majority of our revenues, we depend on a few key customers and, the loss of one or more of our key customers, or their key end-user customers, could significantly reduce our revenues.\nA relatively small number of OEMs, VARs and distributors account for a significant portion of our revenues. Some of these OEMs and VARs are major producers of mobile phones, including smartphones, for some of the largest companies in the mobile phone industry and may rely upon one or more key end-user customers for a significant portion of their revenue. Any material delay, alteration, cancellation or reduction of purchase orders from or change in the purchasing patterns of one or more of our major customers or distributors, or their key end-user customers, could result in our failure to achieve our revenue forecast for a particular period. For example, in our second quarter of fiscal 2012, we experienced an unexpected cutback in orders from certain of our key customers. This reduced the unit sales of our OmniBSI and OmniPixel3-HS based products and adversely affected our revenue for that quarter.\nIf we are unable to retain one or more of our largest OEM, VAR or distributor customers, if we are unable to maintain our current level of revenues from one or more of these significant customers, if our OEM, VAR or distributor customers are unable to retain one or more of their key end-user customers, or if we are unable to attract new customers to replace the revenue lost from such customers, our business and results of operation would be impaired, and our stock price could decrease, potentially significantly. Such a delay, alteration, cancellation or reduction of purchase orders, a change in purchasing patterns or our inability to retain a key customer or several of our smaller customers could be caused by, among other things, failure to meet our customers', including their key end-user customers', demand for our products or to timely develop and introduce new products that meet the needs of our customers, including their key end-user customers, and that are efficiently and successfully integrated into their products. In addition, on April 30, 2015, we entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by the Consortium. This pending transaction may create uncertainty for our\ncurrent and potential customers, which could cause them to terminate, or not to renew or enter into, agreements with us.\nIn fiscal 2014 and 2015, approximately 55.1% and 53.0%, respectively, of our revenues came from sales to our top five customers. In addition, in fiscal 2015, two OEM customers accounted for approximately 25.3% of our revenues, and one distributor customer accounted for approximately 13.3% of our revenues. Our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will continue to depend significantly on our ability to retain our current key customers and to attract new customers, as well as on the financial condition and success of our OEMs, VARs and distributors, including their ability to retain their key end-user customers and attract new customers.\nWe face foreign business, political and economic risks, because a majority of our products and those of our customers are manufactured and sold outside of the United States.\nWe face difficulties in managing our third party foundries, color filter application service providers, packaging and other manufacturing service providers and our foreign distributors, most of whom are located in Asia. In addition, our presence in Asia presents the challenge of managing foreign operations and maintaining good relations with our employees located there. Any political and economic instability in Asia might have an adverse impact on foreign exchange rates and could cause service disruptions for our vendors and distributors and adversely affect our customers.\nSales outside of the United States accounted for a significant portion of our revenues for fiscal 2014 and 2015. In addition, since the third quarter of fiscal 2014, we experienced a decline in sales of products that were used in mobile phones made by end-user customers located in North America, which was partially offset by an increase in the sale of products that were used in mobile phones made by end-user customers located in China. We anticipate that sales outside of the United States, in particular in China and the emerging market in India, will account for a substantial portion of our revenues in future periods. We continue to invest resources in China and India in anticipation of continued revenues from these markets. Dependence on sales to foreign customers, in particular in China and India, involves certain risks, including:\n\u2022 increased price competition, in particular in the China market;\n\u2022 longer payment cycles;\n\u2022 the adverse effects of tariffs, duties, price controls or other restrictions that impair trade;\n\u2022 decreased visibility as to future demand;\n\u2022 difficulties in accounts receivable collections; and\n\u2022 burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and labor practices.\nAlthough we believe that our long standing relationships with OEMs in Asia, especially China, could assist us in sales trends favoring the Asian markets, sales driven by end-user customers in these markets could also create additional risks and challenges such as increased unpredictability of our sales because we tend to experience greater fluctuations in demand, often at a rapid pace, from end-user customers in Asia as compared to end-user customers in North America. Since a significant amount of our revenues is derived from markets outside of the United States, a slowdown in demand in these markets could have an adverse effect on our financial results. For example, in the third quarter of fiscal 2015, demand for our products slowed down in the China market, possibly attributable to the competitive environment faced by our customers and a protracted upgrade cycle for the local wireless infrastructure. This demand slowdown in the region had negatively impacted our revenues. If this slowdown in the China market continues, our future results of operation could be adversely affected as well.\nSales of our products have to date been denominated principally in U.S. dollars. Over the last several years, the value of the U.S. dollar has fluctuated when compared with other currencies. Future increases in the value of the U.S. dollar, if any, would increase the price of our products in the currency of the countries in which our customers are located. This may result in our customers seeking lower-priced suppliers, which could adversely impact our operating results. If a larger portion of our international revenues were to be denominated in foreign currencies in the future, we would be subject to increased risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nWe face intense competition in our markets from CMOS and CCD image-sensor manufacturers, and if we are unable to compete successfully we may not be able to maintain or grow our business.\nThe image-sensor market is intensely competitive, and we expect competition in this industry to continue to increase. This competition has resulted in rapid technological change, evolving standards, reductions in product selling prices and rapid product obsolescence. If we are unable to successfully meet these competitive challenges, we may be unable to maintain and grow our business. Any inability on our part to compete successfully would also adversely affect our results of operations and impair our financial condition.\nOur image-sensor products face competition from other companies that sell CMOS image sensors and from companies that sell CCD image sensors. Many of our competitors have longer operating histories, greater presence in key markets, greater name recognition, larger customer bases, more established strategic and financial relationships and significantly greater financial, sales and marketing, distribution, technical and other resources than we do. Many of them also have their own manufacturing facilities, which may give them a competitive advantage. As a result, they may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and customer requirements or devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products. Our competitors include established CMOS image-sensor manufacturers such as ON Semiconductor, Samsung, Sharp, Sony, STMicroelectronics and Toshiba as well as CCD image-sensor manufacturers such as Panasonic, Sharp and Sony. Many of these competitors own and operate their own fabrication facilities, which in certain circumstances may give them the ability to price their products more aggressively than we can, respond more rapidly than we can to changing market opportunities or more easily meet increased demands for their products. In addition, we compete with a large number of smaller CMOS manufacturers that has required, and in the future may require, us to reduce our prices. For instance, we have seen increased competition in the markets for VGA image-sensor products with resulting pressures on product pricing. Downward pressure on pricing could result both in decreased revenues and lower gross margins, which would adversely affect our profitability. From time to time, other companies enter the CMOS image-sensor market by using obsolete and available manufacturing equipment. These new entrants gain market share in the short-term by pricing their products significantly below current market levels, which puts additional downward pressure on the prices we can obtain for our products.\nOur competitors may acquire or enter into strategic or commercial agreements or arrangements with foundries or providers of color filter application, wafer probe testing, assembly or packaging services. These strategic arrangements between our competitors and third party service providers could involve preferential or exclusive arrangements for our competitors. Such strategic alliances could impair our ability to secure sufficient capacity from foundries and service providers to meet our demand for wafer manufacturing, color filter application, wafer probe testing, assembly or packaging services, adversely affecting our ability to meet customer demand for our products. In addition, competitors may enter into exclusive relationships with distributors, which could reduce available distribution channels for our products and impair our ability to sell our products and grow our business. Further, some of our customers could also become developers of image sensors, and this could potentially adversely affect our results of operations, business and prospects.\nThe development of new and more complex products can increase our cost of revenue and adversely affect our gross margins.\nA key component of our future success is the continued development of new and innovative products and technologies. These new products and technologies are often times very complex and may require additional equipment and resources to develop and manufacture. In addition, for these new products, we may initially experience lower production yields than our other more established products. These new products and technologies also often have a higher cost structure than our existing products and technologies because we must devote more time and effort to developing the products and technologies and our suppliers and manufacturers may incur additional costs by acquiring new equipment or components in order to meet our design specification and capacity requirements. As our product mix shifts to include a higher volume of these new products and technologies, our gross margins may be lower than in comparable historical periods. For example, our OmniBSI-2 products have very different production requirements when compared to our previous generation products and we had to request our suppliers to install new equipment and tooling, which increased the production costs for these new products. Because we experienced increased sales of our OmniBSI-2 products since fiscal 2013, and expect these products to continue to constitute a significant percentage of our total sales in fiscal 2016, we anticipate that our gross margins will remain at lower levels than we have experienced historically, before our introduction of OmniBSI-2. If we are unable to sufficiently increase our ASPs to offset these higher production costs, increase our yields or lower the costs associated with the development and manufacture of these new products and technologies, our gross margins could continue to be negatively affected.\nReductions in our average selling prices may lower our revenues and, as a result, may reduce our gross margins.\nWe have experienced and expect to continue to experience pressure to reduce the selling prices of our products, and our ASPs have generally declined over time as a result. Competition in our product markets is intense and as competition continues to intensify, we anticipate that these pricing pressures will increase. Consequently, we expect that the ASPs for many of our products will continue to decline over time. If sales of mobile phones that use our products continue to shift from those made by end-user customers located in North America to those made by end-user customers located in Asia, we anticipate that this trend will place additional pressure on the pricing of our products due to the strong pricing pressure that we continue to experience in Asia. Unless we can increase unit sales sufficiently to offset these declines in our ASPs, our revenues will decline. Reductions in our ASPs have adversely affected our gross margins, and unless we can reduce manufacturing costs to compensate, additional reductions in our ASPs will continue to adversely affect our gross margins and could materially and adversely affect our operating results and impair our financial condition. Historically, we have increased and are likely to continue to increase our research, development and related expenses in the long-term to continue the development of new image-sensor products that can be sold at higher selling prices and/or manufactured at lower cost. If we are unable to timely introduce new products that incorporate more advanced technology and include more advanced features that can be sold at higher ASPs, or if we are unable to successfully develop more cost-effective technologies, our financial results could be adversely affected.\nSales of our image-sensor products for mobile phones, including smartphones, account for a large portion of our revenues, and any decline in sales to the mobile phone market or failure of this market and other emerging markets to continue to grow as expected could adversely affect our results of operations.\nSales to the mobile phone market, including smartphones, account for a large portion of our revenues. Although we can only estimate the percentages of our products that are used in the mobile phone market due to the significant number of our image-sensor products that are sold to module\nmakers or through distributors and VARs, we believe that the mobile phone market accounted for approximately 61% and 68% of our revenues in fiscal 2014 and 2015, respectively. We expect that revenues from sales of our image-sensor products to the mobile phone market will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues during fiscal 2016 and beyond. Any factors adversely affecting the demand for our image sensors in this market could cause our business to suffer and adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows. The digital image-sensor market for mobile phones is extremely competitive, and we expect to face increased competition in this market in the future. In addition, we continue to believe the market for mobile phones is also relatively concentrated and the top five producers account for approximately 50% of the annual unit sales of these products. If we do not continue to achieve design wins with key mobile phone manufacturers or if we experience a cutback in orders from our key customers, such as the cutback we experienced in our second quarter of fiscal 2012, our market share or revenues could decrease. The mobile phone image-sensor market is also subject to rapid technological change. In order to compete successfully in this market, we will have to correctly forecast customer demand for technological improvements and be able to deliver such products on a timely basis at competitive prices. If we fail to correctly forecast customer demand in our target markets and timely deliver products at competitive prices, our results of operations, business and prospects would be materially and adversely affected. In addition, current domestic and global economic conditions could negatively affect the mobile phone market if consumers and/or businesses defer purchases in response to tighter credit, negative financial news, and/or decreased corporate or consumer spending.\nWe also expect that image sensors will continue to be incorporated into products for and become more important in the notebook and webcam, entertainment, security, medical and automotive industries. As image sensors begin to fill a greater role in these other markets, the challenges and risks that we face in these other markets could increase and could be similar to some of the challenges and risks that we face in the mobile phone market. If our sales to the mobile phone market and other emerging markets do not increase and/or the mobile phone market and other emerging markets do not grow as expected, our results of operations, business and prospects would be materially adversely affected.\nIf we do not forecast customer demand correctly, our business could be impaired and our stock price may decline.\nOur sales are generally made on the basis of purchase orders rather than long-term purchase commitments; however, we manufacture products and build inventory based on our estimates of customer demand. Accordingly, we must rely on multiple assumptions to forecast customer demand. Various external factors that are outside of our control can make it difficult to accurately make such forecasts. For example, the domestic and global economic conditions that have existed since fiscal 2009 have made it extremely challenging to accurately predict customer demand, which has demonstrated increased volatility. There is no guarantee that customer demand will increase or will remain at current levels. If customer demand continues to be volatile, historical models for predicting customer demand may no longer be reliable. In addition, our customers may cancel or defer orders at any time by mutual written consent. If we overestimate customer demand, we may manufacture products that we may be unable to sell, or we may have to sell at lower prices. For example, we experienced unexpected cutbacks in orders from certain of our key customers, and as a result our inventories at the end of the second and third quarters of fiscal 2012 were higher than we intended them to be. Under such circumstances, we may be required to record significant provisions for excess and obsolete inventories. This could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We need to accurately predict customer demand because we must often place noncancelable orders with our manufacturers to have products manufactured before we receive firm purchase orders from our customers. Conversely, if we underestimate customer demand, we may be unable to manufacture sufficient products quickly enough to meet actual demand, which could damage our reputation, impair\nour relationships with our customers, cause us to lose one or more customers and impair our ability to grow our business. In preparation for new product introductions, we gradually ramp down production of established products. With our 12-14 week production cycle, it is extremely difficult to predict precisely how many units of established products we will need. It is also difficult to accurately predict the speed of the ramp of our new products and the impact on inventory levels presented by the shorter life cycles of end-user customers' products. The shorter product life cycle is a result of an increase in competition and the growth of various consumer-product applications for image sensors. Under these circumstances, it is possible that we could underestimate market demand, suffer from shortages of certain products, and face the risk of being unable to fulfill customer orders.\nWe also face the risk of excess inventory and product obsolescence if we overestimate market demand for our products and build inventories in excess of demand, especially if our customer demand were to become volatile. We may be unable to sell inventories that were built in excess of demand, or we may have to sell at lower prices to eliminate excess inventories. Under such circumstances, we may be required to record significant provisions for excess and obsolete inventories. This could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We expect the business environment to remain volatile in fiscal 2016, especially in the consumer-oriented product markets, which can continue to affect our ability to accurately forecast customer demand. Our ability to accurately forecast sales is also a critical factor in our ability to meet analyst expectations for our quarterly and annual operating results. Any failure to meet these expectations would likely lead to a substantial decline in our stock price.\nOur future success depends on the timely development, introduction, marketing and selling of new products, which we might not be able to achieve.\nOur failure to successfully develop new products that achieve market acceptance in a timely fashion and that can be efficiently and successfully integrated with our customers', including their key end-user customers', products could adversely affect our ability to grow our business and improve our operating results. The development, introduction and market acceptance of new products is critical to our ability to sustain and grow our business. Any failure to successfully develop, introduce, market and sell new products could materially adversely affect our business and operating results. The development of new products is highly complex, and we have experienced delays in completing the development and introduction of new products. For example, during the first half of fiscal 2012, we experienced an unanticipated extension in the product development cycle of our OV8830 product. This delayed the production ramp up of this new sensor. By the end of our second quarter of fiscal 2012, we only shipped this product in very limited quantities, which had an adverse effect on our revenues. From time to time, we have also encountered unexpected manufacturing problems as we increase the production of new products. Consumers continue to expect the sophistication of image sensors in consumer products to increase, and the number of consumer products that use image sensors has continued to grow. This results in a requirement for us to continue to build and develop image sensors with advanced technologies that can be used in a variety of consumer products. As our products integrate new and more advanced technologies and functions, they become more complex and increasingly difficult to design, debug and produce. Successful product development and introduction depends on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022 accurate prediction of market requirements and evolving standards, including imaging pixel resolution, output interface standards, power requirements, optical lens size, input standards and operating systems for webcams and other platforms;\n\u2022 development of advanced technologies and capabilities, including our CameraCubeChip, OmniBSI, OmniBSI+ and OmniBSI-2 technologies;\n\u2022 timely development completion and introduction of new CMOS image sensors that satisfy our customers', including their key end customers', requirements and specifications;\n\u2022 development of products that maintain technological advantages over the products of our competitors, including advantages with respect to the functionality and imaging pixel capability of our image-sensor products and our proprietary testing processes; and\n\u2022 market acceptance of the new products, including our PureCel and PureCel-S sensors.\nAccomplishing all of these steps is difficult, time consuming and expensive. We may be unable to develop new products or product enhancements in time to capture market opportunities, satisfy the requirements and specifications of our customers, including their key end customers, or achieve significant or sustainable acceptance in new and existing markets. If our competitors develop new products or technologies on a more expedited basis than us or are successful in developing products that are accepted more rapidly and broadly by the market than our products, we could lose market share. Matching or surpassing technological advances that may be developed by our competitors could require an extended period of time. In addition, our products could become obsolete sooner than anticipated because of a rapid change in one or more of the technologies related to our products or the reduced life cycles of consumer products.\nDesign wins are a key determinant of future revenues, and failure to obtain design wins adversely affects our revenues and impairs our ability to grow our business.\nOur success has been, and will continue to be, dependent upon manufacturers and their customers designing our image-sensor products into their products. To achieve design wins, which are decisions by manufacturers and their customers to design our products into their systems, we must define and deliver cost effective and innovative image-sensor solutions on a timely basis that satisfy the manufacturers' and their customers' requirements and specifications. Our ability to achieve design wins is subject to numerous risks including competitive pressures, the compatibility of our products with newly developed technologies or designs used in our customers' products, as well as delays in our product development cycle. Even if our products meet the manufacturers' and their customers' requirements and specifications, we may not succeed in achieving a particular design win due to factors out of our control, such as customers' preferences or other business decisions that determine the components to be used in a product. If we do not achieve a design win with a prospective customer, it may be difficult to sell our image-sensor products to such prospective customer in the future because once a manufacturer has designed a supplier's products into its systems, the manufacturer may be reluctant to change its source of components due to the significant costs, time, efforts and risks associated with qualifying a new supplier and modifying its design platforms. In addition, there is no guarantee that we will be able to continue to achieve design wins with manufacturers with which we have achieved design wins in the past. As manufacturers take on new projects for their customers, there is no obligation on their part to continue to design our products into their customers' new products. Accordingly, if we fail to achieve design wins with key device manufacturers that embed image sensors in their products, our market share or revenues could decrease. Furthermore, to the extent that our competitors secure design wins, our ability to grow our business in the future will be impaired.\nWe depend on a limited number of third party wafer foundries, which reduces our ability to control our manufacturing process.\nUnlike some of our larger competitors, we do not own or operate a semiconductor fabrication facility. Instead, we rely on TSMC, PTC, Huali and XMC to produce all of our wafers. Historically, we have relied on TSMC to provide us with a substantial majority of our wafers. As a part of our joint venture agreement with TSMC, TSMC has agreed to commit substantial wafer manufacturing capacity\nto us in exchange for our commitment to purchase a substantial portion of our wafers from TSMC, subject to pricing and technology requirements.\nWe secure manufacturing capacity in any particular period on a purchase order basis. The foundries have no obligation to supply products to us for any specific period, in any specific quantity or at any specific price, except as set forth in a particular purchase order. In general, our reliance on third party foundries involves a number of significant risks, including:\n\u2022 reduced control over delivery schedules, quality assurance, manufacturing yields and production costs;\n\u2022 lack of guaranteed production capacity or product supply;\n\u2022 unavailability of, or delayed access to, next generation or key process technologies; and\n\u2022 financial difficulties or disruptions in the operations of third party foundries due to causes beyond our control.\nThe size of the orders we place with our foundries depends on actual or anticipated sales volumes of our products. Because our foundries provide services to a number of companies, in the event they receive increased orders from us or one or more of the other companies that they service, they may be unable to provide us with the requested quantity of products, may subordinate our request to the requests of other larger companies or may increase the prices they charge us. In fiscal 2011, the entire semiconductor industry, including us, experienced supply constraints. Due to the lack of availability of products, supply constraints forced companies in the industry to be unable to meet customers' product demands and to take certain actions such as allocating available products among their customers or, in some cases, increasing the prices of their products. This resulted in harm to customer relations, the loss of sales to customers and, in some cases, the loss of future business with those customers. We faced these same challenges then as we sought to meet our customers' demand for our products. If constraints in supply were to happen again or if for any reason our foundries are unable to provide a sufficient number of products to us on a timely basis and at acceptable yields and cost, we may be unable to achieve future growth, which could result in our revenues, gross margins and other financial results being materially and adversely affected.\nThe current global economic conditions could materially affect our foundries and cause them to be unable to provide necessary services to us. In addition, the pending acquisition by the Consortium may create uncertainty for our foundries, which could cause them to terminate, or not to renew or enter into, agreements with us, or to otherwise change the way in which they have historically provided services to us. If TSMC, PTC, or any of our other foundries were unable to continue manufacturing our wafers in the required quantities, at acceptable quality, yields and costs, or in a timely manner, we would have to identify and qualify substitute foundries, which would be time consuming and difficult, and could increase our costs or result in unforeseen manufacturing problems. In addition, if competition for foundry capacity increases, we may be required to pay increased amounts for manufacturing services. We are also exposed to additional risks if we transfer our production of semiconductors from one foundry to another, as such transfer could interrupt our manufacturing process. Further, some of our foundries may also develop their own image-sensor products and we would have to identify and qualify other sources for these products.\nWe rely on a joint venture company for color filter application and on third party service providers for packaging and other back-end services, which reduces our control over delivery schedules, product quality and cost, and could adversely affect our ability to deliver products to customers.\nWe rely on VisEra for the color filter application of our completed wafers. In addition, we rely on Lingsen and Tong Hsing for substantially all of our ceramic chip packages. We rely on XinTec and WLCSP, both being investee companies, for CSP packaging, which are generally used in our products\ndesigned for the smallest form factor applications. We rely on several specialized service providers, one of which is Tong Hsing, to perform the necessary wafer probe tests and prepare good die for use in COB packaging, a delivery format referred to as reconstructed wafer. If the current global economic conditions do not continue to improve or remain stable, these service providers' ability to continue to fulfill our packaging, color filter processing and related requirements could be adversely affected. If for any reason one or more of these service providers were to become unable or unwilling to continue to provide services of acceptable quality, at acceptable costs or in a timely manner, our ability to deliver our products to our customers could be severely impaired. We would have to identify and qualify substitute service providers, which could be time consuming and difficult and could result in unforeseen operational problems. Substitute service providers might not be available or, if available, might be unwilling or unable to offer services on acceptable terms.\nIn addition, if competition for color filter application, packaging, or other back-end services increases, we may be required to pay or invest significant amounts to secure access to these services, which could adversely impact our operating results. The number of companies that provide these services is limited and some of them have limited operating histories and financial resources. In the event our current providers refuse or are unable to continue to provide these services to us, we may be unable to procure services from alternate service providers. Furthermore, if customer demand for our products increases, we may be unable to secure sufficient additional capacity from our current service providers on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. These factors may cause unforeseen product shortages or may increase our costs of manufacturing, which would adversely affect our operating results and cash flows.\nRecent domestic and worldwide economic conditions adversely affected and could have future adverse effects on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nSince the latter part of fiscal 2009, we have experienced fluctuations in our financial results due in part to changing macroeconomic conditions. As macroeconomic conditions have improved, our sales have also generally tended to improve and when macroeconomic uncertainties have returned, our sales have generally tended to be negatively impacted, although that has not always been the case. For example, in fiscal 2014, macroeconomic conditions appeared to continue to improve, and our annual sales increased slightly when compared to fiscal 2013. However, for the second half of fiscal 2014, we actually experienced a decline in sales when compared to the similar period in fiscal 2013. Given the continuing uncertainties in current economic environment and the volatility in our business, we remain cautious and we expect our customers to be cautious as well, which could affect our future results. If the economic recovery slows down or even dissipates, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nFluctuations in our quarterly operating results have caused volatility in the market price of our common stock and also make it difficult to predict our future operating results.\nOur quarterly operating results have varied significantly from quarter to quarter in the past and are likely to vary significantly in the future based on a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors and other industry risks, many of which are more fully discussed in our other risk factors, include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022 our gain or loss of a large customer, or cutbacks in orders from such customers;\n\u2022 the timing and size of orders from our customers;\n\u2022 the volume and mix of our product sales;\n\u2022 competitive pricing pressures and ASPs, in particular in the China market;\n\u2022 volatility and lack of visibility in the markets in which we sell our products, in particular in the China market;\n\u2022 production costs for our products;\n\u2022 our ability to accurately forecast demand for our products;\n\u2022 our ability to achieve acceptable wafer manufacturing or back-end processing yields;\n\u2022 our ability to achieve design wins;\n\u2022 our ability to manage our product transitions;\n\u2022 the availability of production capacity at the suppliers that manufacture our products or process our products;\n\u2022 the growth of the market for products and applications using CMOS image sensors;\n\u2022 the volume of our product returns;\n\u2022 the seasonal nature of customer demand for our products;\n\u2022 the deferral of customer orders in anticipation of new products, product designs or enhancements;\n\u2022 the announcement and introduction of products and technologies by our competitors;\n\u2022 adverse changes in domestic or global economic conditions;\n\u2022 the fair value of our interest rate swaps;\n\u2022 the impairment of our intangible assets or other long-lived assets;\n\u2022 the level of our operating expenses; and\n\u2022 fluctuations in our effective tax rate from quarter to quarter.\nOur introduction of new products and our product mix have affected, and may continue to affect, our quarterly operating results. Changes in our product mix could adversely affect our operating results, because some products provide higher margins than others. We typically experience lower yields when manufacturing new products through the initial production phase, and consequently our gross margins on new products have historically been lower than our gross margins on our more established products. We also anticipate that the rate of orders from our customers may vary significantly from quarter to quarter. Our operating expenses are relatively fixed in the short-term, and our inventory levels are based on our expectations of future revenues. Consequently, if we do not achieve the revenues we expect in any quarter, expenses and inventory levels could be disproportionately high, adversely impacting our operating results and cash flows for that quarter, and potentially in future quarters.\nAll of these factors are difficult to forecast and could result in fluctuations in our quarterly operating results. Our operating results in any given quarter could be substantially less than anticipated, and, if we fail to meet market analysts' expectations, a substantial decline in our stock price could result. Fluctuations in our quarterly operating results could adversely affect the price of our common stock in a manner unrelated to our long-term operating performance.\nLitigation regarding intellectual property could divert management attention, be costly to defend and prevent us from using or selling the challenged technology.\nIn recent years, there has been significant litigation in the United States involving intellectual property rights, including the semiconductor industry. We have in the past been, currently are and may in the future be, subject to legal proceedings and claims with respect to our intellectual property,\nincluding such matters as trade secrets, patents, product liabilities and other actions arising out of the normal course of business. These claims may increase as our intellectual property portfolio becomes larger and/or more valuable. Intellectual property claims against us, and any resulting lawsuit, may cause us to incur significant expenses, subject us to liability for damages and invalidate our proprietary rights. Any potential intellectual property litigation against us would likely be time-consuming and expensive to resolve and would divert management's time and attention and could also force us to take actions such as:\n\u2022 ceasing the sale or use of products or services that incorporate the infringed intellectual property;\n\u2022 obtaining from the holder of the infringed intellectual property a license to sell or use the relevant technology, which license may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all; or\n\u2022 redesigning those products or services that incorporate the disputed intellectual property, which could result in substantial unanticipated development expenses and delay and prevent us from selling the products until the redesign is completed, if at all.\nIf we are subject to a successful claim of infringement and we fail to develop non-infringing intellectual property or license the infringed intellectual property on acceptable terms and on a timely basis, we may be unable to sell some or all of our products, and our operating results could be adversely affected. We may in the future initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our intellectual property rights or to determine the scope and validity of our proprietary rights or the proprietary rights of competitors. These claims could also result in significant expense and the diversion of technical and management attention.\nIn addition, third parties may assert claims of infringement and misappropriation of proprietary rights based on the use or resale of our products against our suppliers or the OEMs, VARs or distributors with whom we do business. In addition, the end-user customers of these OEMs, VARs or distributors may also be named as parties in these claims. Under our agreements with these parties, we may be required to defend protracted and costly litigation on their behalf, regardless of the merits of these claims, or to indemnify these parties for such claims. Because our suppliers and our customers and their end-user customers are often times much larger than we are and have much greater resources than we do, they may be more likely to be the target of an infringement or misappropriation of proprietary rights claim by third parties than we would be, which could increase our chances of becoming involved in a future lawsuit or of being required to indemnify these parties. We could also voluntarily agree to defend or indemnify third parties in instances where we are not obligated to do so if we determine it would be important to our business relationships. Recently, infringement claims relating to our image sensors were brought against some of the end-user customers of our customers. These customers or their applicable end-user customers have requested indemnification from us for this matter. Although we are unable at this time to estimate any possible loss and it is uncertain whether this matter will result in any material expense to us, if we are ultimately required to make indemnification payments to these customers or their end-user customers, it could result in us being forced to pay significant damages on behalf of our customers or their end-user customers that could increase our expenses, disrupt our ability to sell our products and reduce our revenue. A party making an infringement or misappropriation of proprietary rights claim against our customers or their end-user customers, if successful, could also secure an injunction or other court order that could prevent our customers or their end-user customers from selling their products that incorporate our image sensors. If we are required or agree to defend or indemnify any of our suppliers, customers or their end-user customers in connection with any claims of infringement or misappropriation of proprietary rights or injunctions are secured by third parties that prevent the sale of products that incorporate our image sensors, we could incur significant costs and expenses and experience a significant decrease in our revenue that could adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition.\nWe may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property, and therefore we may lose some of our competitive advantage.\nWe rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws as well as nondisclosure agreements and other methods to protect our proprietary technologies. We have been issued patents and have a number of pending United States and foreign patent applications. However, we cannot provide assurance that any patent will be issued as a result of any applications or, if issued, that any claims allowed will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. It is possible that existing or future patents may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. We have experienced the cancellation of a patent in the past and although we do not believe this cancellation had a material adverse effect on our business or prospects, there may be other situations where our inability to adequately protect our intellectual property rights could materially and adversely affect our competitive position and operating results. If a third party can copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology without authorization, develop corresponding technology independently or design around our patents, this could materially adversely affect our business and prospects. Effective patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in foreign countries. Any disputes over our intellectual property rights, whatever the ultimate resolution of such disputes, may result in costly and time-consuming litigation or require the license of additional elements of intellectual property for a fee.\nOur use of derivative financial instruments to reduce interest rate risk may result in added volatility in our quarterly operating results\nWe do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. However, we do utilize derivative financial instruments to reduce interest rate risk. We have a variable rate mortgage loan that totaled $23.1 million as of April 30, 2015. To manage the related interest rate risk, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement, effectively converting our mortgage loan into a fixed rate loan. Under generally accepted accounting principles, the fair values of the swap contract, which will either be amounts receivable from or payable to counterparties, are reflected as either assets or liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We record its fair value change in our Consolidated Statements of Income, in \"Other income, net.\" The associated impact on our quarterly operating results is directly related to changes in prevailing interest rates. If interest rates increase, we would have a non-cash gain on the swap, and vice versa. Consequently, this swap contract will introduce volatility to our operating results.\nWe are also exposed to credit loss in the event of non-performance by the counterparty to the interest rate swap agreement. However, we do not anticipate non-performance by the counterparty.\nOur business is subject to seasonal fluctuations which may in turn cause fluctuations in our results of operations and cash flows from period to period.\nMany of the products using our image sensors, such as mobile phones, cameras for entertainment applications, such as tablets and wearable devices, notebooks and webcams, and DSCs are consumer electronics goods. These mass-market camera devices generally have seasonal cycles which historically have caused the sales of our customers to fluctuate quarter-to-quarter. In addition, since a very large number of the manufacturers who use our products are located in China and Taiwan, the pattern of demand for our image sensors has been influenced by the timing of the extended lunar or Chinese New Year holiday, a period in which the factories which use our image sensors generally close. Consequently, demand for our image sensors has historically been stronger in the second and third quarters of our fiscal year and weaker in the first and fourth quarters of our fiscal year. However, due to macroeconomic uncertainties and changes in our end-user customer demands in the past several years, the seasonal cycle of our business has been less predictable. Given the current economic environment and continued changes in our end-user demands, we remain cautious towards the return of the historical seasonal cycle of our business. If our historical cycle resumes and continues in future\nyears, it could result in the fluctuation of our results of operations and cash flows from period to period. Alternatively, if we experience future events, such as the recent macroeconomic uncertainties or other events outside of our control, our historical seasonal cycle could be disrupted and our results of operations and cash flows could differ from our historical seasonal cycles.\nThere are risks associated with our operations in China.\nIn December 2000, we established OmniVision Semiconductor (Shanghai) Co. Ltd., or OSC, primarily for the testing of our image-sensor products. In October 2008, we formed Shanghai OmniVision Semiconductor Technology Co. Ltd., or OST, for the purpose of expanding our testing capabilities. In October 2010, through our wholly-owned subsidiary OmniVision Technologies (Shanghai) Co. Ltd., or OTC, we constructed research facilities in Shanghai. In April 2011, we also formed OmniVision Optoelectronics Technologies (Shanghai) Co. Ltd. for the purpose of expanding our manufacturing capabilities for CameraCubeChip production. Then in July 2013, we formed Omni Vision Technologies (Wuhan) Co, Ltd, or OV-Wuhan, to support our growing research and development efforts. There are certain administrative, legal and governmental risks to operating in China that could result in increased operating expenses or could hamper us in the development of our operations in China. The risks from operating in China that could increase our operating expenses and adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and ability to deliver our products and grow our business include, without limitation:\n\u2022 difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations, particularly in attracting and retaining personnel qualified to design, sell, test and support our products;\n\u2022 difficulties in managing employee relations;\n\u2022 implications of the ongoing general labor disputes in China;\n\u2022 increases in the value of the Chinese Yuan, or CNY;\n\u2022 difficulties in coordinating our operations in China with those in California;\n\u2022 difficulties in enforcing contracts in China;\n\u2022 difficulties in protecting intellectual property;\n\u2022 diversion of management attention;\n\u2022 imposition of burdensome governmental regulations;\n\u2022 difficulties in maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies across our global operations, including inventory management and financial consolidation;\n\u2022 political and economic instability, which could have an adverse impact on foreign exchange rates in Asia and could impair our ability to conduct our business in China; and\n\u2022 inadequacy of the local infrastructure to support our operations.\nProblems with wafer manufacturing and/or back-end processing yields could result in higher product costs and could impair our ability to meet customer demand for our products.\nIf the foundries manufacturing the wafers used in our products cannot achieve the yields we expect, we could incur higher unit costs and reduced product availability. Foundries that supply our wafers have experienced problems in the past achieving acceptable wafer manufacturing yields. Wafer yields are a function of both our design technology and the particular foundry's manufacturing process technology. These risks increase with our introduction of more advanced and novel products and technology, as well as with increased customer demand that requires these new products to be produced more quickly and in greater quantities than our historical volume. Certain risks are inherent\nin the introduction of new products and technology. Low yields may result from design errors or manufacturing failures in new or existing products. During the early stages of production, production yields for new products are typically lower than those of established products. Unlike many other semiconductor products, optical products can be effectively tested only when they are complete. Accordingly, we perform final testing of our products only after they are assembled. As a result, yield problems may not be identified until our products are well into the production process. The risks associated with low yields could be increased because we rely on third party offshore foundries for our wafers, which can increase the effort and time required to identify, communicate and resolve manufacturing yield problems. In addition to wafer manufacturing yields, our products are subject to yield loss in subsequent manufacturing steps, often referred to as back-end processing, such as the application of color filters and micro-lenses, dicing (cutting the wafer into individual devices, or die) and packaging. Any of these potential problems with wafer manufacturing and/or back-end processing yields could result in a reduction in our gross margins and/or our ability to timely deliver products to customers, which could adversely affect our customer relations and make it more difficult to sustain and grow our business.\nWe depend on the increased acceptance of mass-market image-sensor applications to grow our business and increase our revenues.\nOur business strategy depends in large part on the continued growth of the various markets into which we sell our image-sensor products, including the markets for mobile phones, entertainment devices such as tablets and wearable devices, notebook and webcams, digital still and video cameras, commercial and security and surveillance applications, automotive and medical applications. If these markets do not grow and develop as we anticipate, we may be unable to sustain or grow the sales of our products. Each of these markets has already been, and may continue to be, adversely impacted by current global economic conditions where consumers and businesses have deferred purchases of products in these markets as a result of tighter credit, negative financial news, and decreased corporate or consumer spending. Such conditions have negatively affected, and may continue to negatively affect our business.\nIn addition, the market price of our common stock may be adversely affected if certain of these new markets do not emerge or develop as expected. Securities analysts may already factor revenue from such new markets into their future estimates of our financial performance and should such markets not develop as expected by such securities analysts the trading price of our common stock could be adversely affected.\nOur lengthy manufacturing, packaging and assembly cycle, in addition to our customers' design cycle, may result in uncertainty and delays in generating revenues.\nThe production of our image sensors requires a lengthy manufacturing, packaging and assembly process, typically lasting approximately 12-14 weeks. Additional time may pass before a customer commences taking volume shipments of products that incorporate our image sensors. Even when a manufacturer decides to design our image sensors into its products, the manufacturer may never ship final products incorporating our image sensors. Given this lengthy cycle, we experience a delay between the time we incur expenditures for research and development and sales and marketing efforts and the time we generate revenue, if any, from these expenditures. This delay makes it more difficult to forecast customer demand, which adds uncertainty to the manufacturing planning process and could adversely affect our operating results. In addition, the product life cycle for certain of our image-sensor products designed for use in certain applications can be relatively short. If we fail to appropriately manage the manufacturing, packaging and assembly process, our products may become obsolete before they can be incorporated into our customers' products and we may never realize a return on investment for the expenditures we incur in developing and producing these products.\nOur ability to deliver products that meet customer demand is dependent upon our ability to meet new and changing requirements for color filter application and image-sensor packaging.\nWe expect that as we develop new products to meet technological advances and new and changing industry and customer demands, our color filter application and ceramic, plastic and chip scale packaging requirements will also evolve. Our ability to continue to profitably deliver products that meet customer demand is dependent upon our ability to obtain third party services that meet these new requirements on a cost-effective basis. There can be no assurances that any of these parties will be able to develop enhancements to the services they provide to us to meet these new and changing industry and customer requirements. Furthermore, even if these service providers are able to develop their services to meet new and evolving requirements, these services may not be available at a cost that enables us to sustain our profitability.\nThe high level of complexity and integration of our products increases the risk of latent defects, which could damage customer relationships and increase our costs.\nOur products are based upon evolving technology, and because we integrate many functions on a single chip, are highly complex. The integration of additional functions into already complex products could result in a greater risk that customers or end-users could discover latent defects or subtle faults after we have already shipped significant quantities of a product. Although we test our products, we have in the past and may in the future encounter defects or errors. Delivery of products with defects or reliability, quality or compatibility problems may damage our reputation and ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers. In addition, product defects and errors could result in additional development costs, diversion of technical resources, delayed product shipments, increased product returns, product warranty costs for recall and replacement and product liability claims against us which may not be fully covered by insurance.\nWe may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if our goodwill, intangible assets or long-term investments become impaired.\nUnder generally accepted accounting principles, we are required to review our intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our intangible assets may not be recoverable include a decline in stock price and market capitalization, and slower growth rates in our industry.\nWe may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which we determine that our intangible assets or long-term investments have been impaired. Any such charge would adversely impact our results of operations. As of April 30, 2015, our goodwill totaled approximately $10.2 million, our intangible assets totaled approximately $52.3 million and our long-term investments totaled approximately $192.0 million.\nIf we need additional capital in the future, it may not be available to us on favorable terms, or at all.\nOur cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, in total, has increased in fiscal 2015 primarily from cash provided by operating activities. Although we currently expect our available cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, together with cash we anticipate generating from operating activities, will be sufficient to satisfy our capital requirements over approximately the next twelve months and foreseeable future, if we are unable to sell our inventories or collect on our accounts receivable as anticipated, we may be required to raise additional capital through equity or debt financing. Such additional financing may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. If we raise additional funds through issuances of equity, convertible debt securities or other securities\nconvertible into equity, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution in their percentage ownership and any new securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock.\nWe maintain a backlog of customer orders that is subject to cancellation or delay in delivery schedules, and any cancellation or delay may result in lower than anticipated revenues.\nOur sales are generally made pursuant to standard purchase orders. We include in our backlog only those customer orders for which we have accepted purchase orders and assigned shipment dates within the upcoming 12 months. Orders constituting our current backlog are subject to cancellation or changes in delivery schedules, and backlog may not necessarily be an indication of future revenue. Any cancellation or delay in orders which constitute our current or future backlog may result in lower than expected revenues.\nIf we are unable to maintain processes and procedures to sustain effective internal control over our financial reporting, our ability to provide reliable and timely financial reports could be harmed and this could have a material adverse effect on our stock price.\nWe are required to comply with the rules promulgated under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Section 404 requires that we prepare an annual management report assessing the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, and requires a report by our independent registered public accounting firm addressing the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.\nWe have in the past discovered, and may in the future discover, areas of our internal control that need improvement. If issues were to arise with respect to our internal controls in future periods, they could impair our ability to produce accurate and timely financial reports.\nAs our business changes, ongoing compliance with the provisions of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and maintenance of effective internal control over financial reporting may require that we hire additional qualified finance and accounting personnel. Because other businesses face similar challenges, there is significant competition for such personnel, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and/or retain suitably qualified employees.\nCorporate governance regulations have increased our compliance costs and could further increase our expenses if changes occur within our business.\nWe are subject to corporate governance laws and regulations affecting public companies, including the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 that impose certain requirements on us and on our officers, directors, attorneys and independent registered public accounting firm. In order to comply with these rules, we added internal resources and have utilized additional outside legal, accounting and advisory services, which increased our operating expenses. We expect to incur ongoing operating expenses as we maintain compliance with Section 404. In addition, if we undergo significant modifications to our structure through personnel or system changes, acquisitions, or otherwise, it may be increasingly difficult to maintain compliance with the existing and evolving corporate governance regulations.\nWe hold a significant amount of marketable securities which are subject to general market risks over which we have no control.\nAs of April 30, 2015, we held cash and cash equivalents totaling $318.9 million, and short-term investments totaling $205.3 million. These assets are managed on our behalf by unrelated third parties in accordance with a cash management policy that has been approved by our board of directors and restricts our investments to a maximum maturity of 18 months and to investment-grade instruments. As\nof April 30, 2015, we did not hold any illiquid investments and we have not realized any losses. In the past, uncertainties in global capital markets associated with a repricing of risk had caused disruptions in the orderly function of markets which are ordinarily characterized by virtually unlimited liquidity. If we were to make a future investment in certain illiquid securities that are dependent on the orderly functioning of the capital markets, and if we were required to liquidate these types of securities at short notice, such liquidation could result in losses of principal, which would have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may experience integration or other problems with potential future acquisitions, which could have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations. New acquisitions could dilute the interests of existing stockholders, and the announcement of new acquisitions could result in a decline in the price of our common stock.\nWe may acquire, or invest in, businesses that offer products, services and technologies that we believe would complement our products, including CMOS image-sensor manufacturers. We may also make acquisitions of, or investments in, businesses that we believe could expand our distribution channels. Even if we were to announce an acquisition, we may not be able to complete it. In addition, any future acquisition or substantial investment could present numerous risks, including:\n\u2022 difficulty in realizing the potential technological benefits of the transaction;\n\u2022 difficulty in integrating the technology, operations or work force of the acquired business with our existing business;\n\u2022 unanticipated expenses related to technology integration;\n\u2022 disruption of our ongoing business;\n\u2022 difficulty in realizing the potential financial or strategic benefits of the transaction;\n\u2022 difficulty in maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies;\n\u2022 possible impairment of relationships with employees, customers, suppliers and strategic partners as a result of integration of new businesses and management personnel;\n\u2022 reductions in our future operating results from amortization of intangible assets;\n\u2022 impairment of resulting goodwill; and\n\u2022 potential unknown or unexpected liabilities associated with acquired businesses.\nWe expect that any future acquisitions could include consideration to be paid in cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and our common stock. If and when consideration for a transaction is paid in common stock, it will result in dilution to our existing stockholders.\nWe may not achieve continued benefits from our joint venture with TSMC.\nIn October 2003, together with TSMC, we formed VisEra, a joint venture in Taiwan, for the purposes of providing manufacturing services. Since its formation, TSMC and we have expanded the scope of VisEra's activities through the provision of additional funding.\nIn January 2006, VisEra acquired certain color filter application equipment from TSMC and assumed direct responsibility for providing the color filter application services that had previously been provided to us by TSMC. We expect that VisEra will be able to provide us with a committed supply of high quality manufacturing services at competitive prices. However, there are significant legal, governmental and relationship risks to managing the business scope of VisEra, and we cannot ensure that we will continue to receive the expected benefits from the joint venture. For example, VisEra may not be able to provide manufacturing services that have competitive technology or prices, which could\nadversely affect our product offerings and our ability to meet customer requirements for our products. In addition, the existence of VisEra may also make it more difficult for us to secure dependable services from competing merchant vendors who provide similar manufacturing services.\nWe may not achieve all of the anticipated benefits of our alliances with, and strategic investments in, third parties.\nWe expect to develop our business partly through forming alliances or joint ventures with and making strategic investments in other companies, some of which may be companies at a relatively early stage of development. For example, we have made an investment in XinTec, a company that provides CSP packaging services, and WLCSP, a company that also provides chip scale packaging services.\nOur investments in these and other companies may negatively impact our operating results, because, under certain circumstances, we are required to recognize our portion of any loss recorded by each of these companies or to consolidate them into our operating results. We expect to continue to utilize partnerships, strategic alliances and investments, particularly those that enhance our manufacturing capacity and those that provide manufacturing services and testing capability. These investments and partnering arrangements are crucial to our ability to grow our business and meet the increasing demands of our customers. However, we cannot ensure that we will achieve the benefits we expect from these alliances. For example, we may not be able to obtain acceptable quality and/or wafer manufacturing yields from these companies, which could result in higher operating costs and could impair our ability to meet customer demand for our products. In addition, certain of these investments or partnering relationships may place restrictions on the scope of our business, the geographic areas in which we can sell our products and the types of products that we can manufacture and sell. For example, our agreement with TSMC provides that we may not engage in business that will directly compete with the business of VisEra. This type of non-competition provision may impact our ability to grow our business and to meet the demands of our customers.\nChanges in our relationships with our joint venture and/or companies in which we hold less than a majority interest could change the way we account for such interests in the future.\nAs part of our strategy, we have formed a joint venture with one of our foundry partners, and we hold equity interests in other companies from which we purchase certain manufacturing services. For the investments that we account for under the equity method, we record as part of income or expense our share of the increase or decrease in the equity of the companies in which we have invested. It is possible that, in the future, our relationships and/or our interests in or with our joint venture or other investees could change. Such changes have resulted in the past, and could result in the future, in deconsolidation or consolidation of such entities, as the case may be, which could result in changes in our reported results.\nThe use of our image sensors in end-user products in the medical and automotive industries could result in us being named as a defendant in product liability claims, which could adversely affect our business and reputation.\nOur image sensors have been incorporated into certain end-user products in the medical and automotive industries, and we expect that they will continue to increase as a percentage of our overall business. The use of the medical and automotive industry products into which our image sensors are designed could result in an unsafe condition, injury, or even death as a result of, among other factors, component failures, manufacturing flaws, design defects or inadequate disclosure of product-related risks or product-related information. These factors could result in product liability claims seeking damages for personal injury, and we could be named as a defendant in such claims. Because the outcome of product liability claims is not predictable and is difficult to assess or quantify, we cannot\nprovide assurance that such claims will not materially adversely affect our business or damage the reputation of our products or our company.\nIf we do not effectively manage our growth, our ability to increase our revenues and improve our earnings could be adversely affected.\nOur growth has placed, and will continue to place, a significant strain on our management and other resources. To manage our growth effectively, we must, among other things:\n\u2022 continuously improve our operational, financial and accounting systems;\n\u2022 train, manage and maintain good relations with our existing employee base in both our U.S. and international locations;\n\u2022 attract and retain qualified personnel with relevant experience; and\n\u2022 effectively manage accounts receivable and inventory.\nFor example, our failure to effectively manage our inventory levels could result either in excess inventories, which could adversely affect our gross margins and operating results, or lead to an inability to fill customer orders, which would result in lower sales and could harm our relationships with existing and potential customers.\nWe must also manage multiple relationships with customers, business partners and other third parties, such as our foundries and process and assembly vendors. Moreover, future growth could significantly overburden our management and financial systems and other resources. We may not make adequate allowances for the costs and risks associated with our expansion. In addition, our systems, procedures or controls may not be adequate to support our operations, and we may not be able to expand quickly enough to capitalize on potential market opportunities. Our future operating results will also depend, in part, on our ability to expand sales and marketing, research and development, accounting, finance and administrative support.\nOur future tax rates and tax payments could be higher than we anticipate and may harm our results of operations.\nAs a multinational corporation, we conduct our business in many countries and are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions. The taxation of our business is subject to the application of multiple and sometimes conflicting tax laws and regulations as well as multinational tax conventions. The application of tax law is subject to legal and factual interpretation, judgment and uncertainty. For example, we were under tax examination in a foreign jurisdiction starting from the fiscal year ended April 30, 2004. This tax examination was concluded in November 2014. We may be involved in similar tax examinations in the future that could result in additional expense and time spent cooperating with such examinations, and may have a negative effect on our financial results depending on the outcome of such examinations.\nFurthermore, tax laws themselves are subject to change. For example, the U.S Congress may introduce tax reform proposals that will affect the taxation of foreign earnings. The Group of Twenty Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors, or G-20, has also approved an action plan from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development to address perceived problems of corporate income tax avoidance through aggressive tax planning. Consequently, taxing authorities may impose tax assessments or judgments against us that could result in a significant charge to our earnings or otherwise negatively impact our financial results.\nA number of other factors will also affect our future tax rate, and some of these factors could increase our effective tax rate in future periods, which could adversely impact our operating results. These factors include changes in non-deductible stock-based compensation, changes in tax laws or the\ninterpretation of tax laws, changes in the proportion and geographic mix of our revenue or earnings, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in available tax credits, the resolution of issues arising from tax audits, and the repatriation of non-U.S. earnings for which we have not previously provided U.S. taxes.\nWe continually review our tax positions and provide for, or reverse, unrecognized tax benefits as issues arise.\nTax benefits that we receive may be terminated or revoked in the future and, as a result, may harm our results of operations.\nIn fiscal 2013, we obtained a partial tax holiday from the Singapore Economic Development Board, an agency of the Government of Singapore. This partial tax holiday allows for reduced rates of Singapore income tax on certain classes of income generated from our business operations in Singapore from September 1, 2012 through August 31, 2022. As a result, we anticipate that a significant portion of the income we earn in Singapore during this period will be taxed at the reduced rates of Singapore income tax. For fiscal 2015, the effect of the Singapore partial tax holiday, in the aggregate, was increasing the overall benefit from income taxes from what it otherwise would have been by $25.0 million, thus increasing diluted net income per share by $0.42.\nIn order to retain these tax benefits in Singapore, we must meet several requirements as to capital and business spending, headcount and activities. If we fail to meet these requirements or if the Singapore government enacts changes to existing tax laws or regulations, the tax benefits that we have received may be terminated, revoked, or reduced, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur sales through distributors increase the complexity of our business and may reduce our ability to forecast revenues.\nDuring fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2015, approximately 18.8% and 24.7%, respectively, of our revenues came from sales through distributors. We expect that revenues from sales through distributors will vary from year to year, but will continue to represent a significant proportion of our total revenues. Selling through distributors reduces our ability to accurately forecast sales and increases the complexity of our business, requiring us to, among other matters:\n\u2022 manage a more complex supply chain;\n\u2022 manage the level of inventory at each distributor;\n\u2022 provide for credits, return rights and price protection;\n\u2022 estimate the impact of credits, return rights, price protection and unsold inventory at distributors; and\n\u2022 monitor the financial condition and creditworthiness of our distributors.\nAny failure to manage these challenges could cause us to inaccurately forecast sales and carry excess or insufficient inventory, thereby adversely affecting our operating results and cash flows.\nOur business could be harmed if we lose the services of one or more members of our senior management team, or if we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel.\nThe loss of the services of one or more of our executive officers or key employees, which has occurred from time to time, or the decision of one or more of these individuals to join a competitor, could adversely affect our business and harm our operating results and financial condition. Our success depends to a significant extent on the continued service of our senior management and certain other\nkey technical personnel. None of our senior management is bound by an employment or non-competition agreement. We do not maintain key man life insurance on any of our employees.\nOur success also depends on our ability to identify, attract and retain qualified sales, marketing, finance, management and technical personnel. We have experienced, and may continue to experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining candidates with appropriate qualifications. The pending acquisition by the Consortium may create uncertainty for our employees, which could adversely affect our ability to retain key employees and hire new talents. If we do not succeed in hiring and retaining candidates with appropriate qualifications, our revenues, operations and product development efforts could be harmed.\nWe substantially completed the implementation of a new enterprise resource planning system, a process which presents a number of significant operational risks.\nAs our business grows and becomes more complex, it is necessary that we expand and upgrade our enterprise resource planning system, or ERP, and other management information systems which are critical to the operational, accounting and financial functions of our company. We evaluated alternative solutions, both short-term and long-term, to meet the operating, administrative and financial reporting requirements of our business. We have made and will continue to make further enhancements and upgrades to the ERP, as necessary. Significant management attention and resources have been used and extensive planning has occurred to support effective implementation of the new ERP system. However, such implementation, as well as enhancements or upgrades to the system carries certain risks, including the risk of significant design errors that could materially and adversely affect our operating results and impact our ability to manage our business. As a result, there is a risk that deficiencies may exist in the future and that they could constitute significant deficiencies, or, in the aggregate, a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting.\nOur operations may be impaired as a result of disasters, business interruptions or similar events.\nDisasters and business interruptions such as earthquakes, water, fire, electrical failure, accidents and epidemics affecting our operating activities, major facilities, and employees' and customers' health could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. In particular, our Asian operations and most of our third party service providers involved in the manufacturing of our products are located within relative close proximity. Therefore, any disaster that strikes within or close to that geographic area, such as the earthquake and flooding that occurred in China, could be extremely disruptive to our business and could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. We are currently developing and implementing a disaster recovery plan.\nActs of war and terrorist acts may seriously harm our business and revenue, costs and expenses and financial condition.\nActs of war or terrorist acts, wherever they occur around the world, may cause damage or disruption to our business, employees, facilities, suppliers, distributors or customers, which could significantly impact our revenue, costs, expenses and financial condition. In addition, as a company with significant operations and major distributors and customers located in Asia, we may be adversely impacted by heightened tensions and acts of war that occur in locations such as the Korean Peninsula, Taiwan and China. The potential for future terrorist attacks, the national and international responses to terrorist attacks or perceived threats to national security, and other acts of war or hostility have created many economic and political uncertainties that could adversely affect our business and results of operations in ways that cannot presently be predicted. We are uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts and acts of war.\nNew regulations related to conflict minerals may cause us to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in the manufacturing of our products.\nAs a public company, we are subject to new requirements under the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 that require us to exercise due diligence, disclose and report whether or not our products contain conflict minerals The implementation of these new requirements could adversely affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of the minerals used in the manufacture of our products. In addition, we will incur additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements, including costs related to conducting diligence procedures to determine the sources of conflict minerals that may be used or necessary to the production of our products and, if applicable, potential changes to products, processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. It is also possible that we may face reputational harm if we determine that certain of our products contain minerals not determined to be conflict free or if we are unable to alter our products, processes or sources of supply to avoid such materials.\nRisks Related to the Securities Markets and Ownership of Our Common Stock\nOur stock has been and will likely continue to be subject to substantial price and volume fluctuations due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control that may prevent our stockholders from selling our common stock at a profit.\nThe market price of our common stock has fluctuated substantially, and there can be no assurance that such volatility will not continue. Since the beginning of fiscal 2002 through June 22, 2015, the closing sales price of our common stock has ranged from a high of $36.42 per share to a low of $1.18 per share. The closing sales price of our common stock on June 22, 2015 was $26.67 per share. The securities markets have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations in the past, and the market prices of the securities of semiconductor companies have been especially volatile. This market volatility, as well as the outcome of the pending acquisition by the Consortium, and general economic, market or political conditions, including the current global economic situation, could reduce the market price of our common stock in spite of our operating performance. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors, including:\n\u2022 developments with respect to the pending acquisition by the Consortium;\n\u2022 actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022 changes in expectations as to our future financial performance;\n\u2022 changes in financial estimates of securities analysts;\n\u2022 release of lock-up or other transfer restrictions on our outstanding shares of common stock or sales of additional shares of common stock;\n\u2022 sales or the perception in the market of possible sales of shares of our common stock by our directors, officers, employees or principal stockholders;\n\u2022 changes in market valuations of other technology companies; and\n\u2022 announcements by us or our competitors of significant technical innovations, design wins, contracts, standards or acquisitions.\nDue to these factors, the price of our stock may decline and investors may be unable to resell their shares of our stock for a profit. In addition, the stock market experiences extreme volatility that often is unrelated to the performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may cause our stock price to decline regardless of our performance.\nProvisions in our charter documents and Delaware law could prevent or delay a change in control of our company and may reduce the market price of our common stock.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable. These provisions include:\n\u2022 adjusting the price, rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of preferred stock without stockholder approval;\n\u2022 providing for a classified board of directors with staggered, three-year terms;\n\u2022 requiring supermajority voting to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws;\n\u2022 limiting the persons who may call special meetings of stockholders; and\n\u2022 prohibiting stockholder actions by written consent.\nProvisions of Delaware law also may discourage, delay or prevent another company from acquiring or merging with us. Our board of directors could adopt a preferred stock rights agreement. If adopted, the exercise of rights under the rights agreement could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change of control of our company, including, without limitation, discouraging a proxy contest or making more difficult the acquisition of a substantial block of our common stock. The rights agreement could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for our common stock.", "PERMNO": 88458, "SIC": 3674, "TIC": "OVTI"}
