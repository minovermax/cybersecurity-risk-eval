RISK FACTORS.\nThe following is a summary of the risk factors that we believe are most relevant to our business. These are factors that, individually or in the aggregate, we think could cause our actual results to differ significantly from anticipated or historical results. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In that case, the value of our common stock could decline and shareholders may lose all or part of their investment. You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently, you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties. We undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, unless required by law.\nAn investment in our securities involves risks. The following is a summary of the principal risks that you should carefully consider before investing in our securities.\nRisks Related to Converting to a Financial Holding Company\n\u2022We operate in a highlight regulated environment, and if we are found to be in violation of any of the federal, state or local laws or regulations applicable to us, our business could suffer.\n\u2022We will become subject to extensive regulation and supervision upon becoming a financial holding company, which may adversely affect our business.\n\u2022If we withdraw the Company\u2019s election to be regulated as a BDC in the future, we will no longer be subject to regulation under the 1940 Act.\n\u2022Loss of pass-through tax treatment would substantially reduce net assets and income available for dividends.\nRisks Related to the Economy\n\u2022Political, social and economic uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic creates and exacerbates risks.\n\u2022The COVID-19 pandemic has caused severe disruptions in the U.S. economy and has disrupted financial activity in the areas in which we or our portfolio companies operate.\n\u2022Economic recessions could impair our portfolio companies and harm our operating results.\n\u2022Capital markets are currently experiencing disruption and instability and we cannot predict how long these conditions will continue. Such market conditions could materially and adversely affect debt and equity capital markets in the United States and abroad, which could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022If we cannot obtain additional capital because of either regulatory or market price constraints, we could be forced to curtail or cease our new lending and investment activities, our net asset value could decrease and our level of distributions and liquidity could be affected adversely.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Structure\n\u2022We are dependent upon our Senior Lending Team and our Executive Committee for our future success, and if we are unable to hire and retain qualified personnel or if we lose any member of our Senior Lending Team or our Executive Committee our ability to achieve our investment objective could be significantly harmed.\n\u2022Our investment portfolio is recorded at fair value, with our Board having final responsibility for overseeing, reviewing and approving, in good faith, its estimate of fair value and, as a result, there is uncertainty as to the value of our portfolio investments.\n\u2022Because we borrow money, the potential for loss on amounts invested in us is magnified and may increase the risk of investing in us.\n\u2022Any unrealized depreciation we experience in our portfolio may be an indication of a portfolio company\u2019s inability to meet its repayment obligations to us with respect to affected loans or a potential impairment of the value of affected equity investments. This could result in realized losses in the future and ultimately in reductions of our income and gains available for distribution in future periods.\n\u2022If we are unable to source investments effectively, we may be unable to achieve our investment objective.\n\u2022Any failure on our part to maintain our status as a BDC would reduce our operating flexibility.\n\u2022We may experience fluctuations in our quarterly and annual results.\n\u2022Changes in laws or regulations governing our operations may adversely affect our business or cause us to alter our business strategy.\n\u2022Because we have received the approval of our stockholders, we are subject to 150% asset coverage beginning after July 26, 2018.\n\u2022We may not be able to pay distributions to our shareholders, our distributions may not grow over time and a portion of our distributions may be a return of capital.\nRisk Related to SBA Lending\n\u2022NSBF, our wholly-owned subsidiary, is subject to regulation by the SBA, which has specific risks.\n\u2022We have specific risks associated with SBA loans.\nRisks Related to U.S. Federal Income Tax\n\u2022We will be subject to corporate-level income tax if we are unable to maintain our qualification as a RIC or are unable to make the distributions required to maintain RIC tax treatment.\n\u2022Because we intend to distribution substantially all of our income to our shareholders to maintain our tax treatment as a RIC, we will continue to need additional capital to finance our growth, and regulations governing our operations as a BDC will affect our ability to, and the way in which we, raise additional capital and make distributions.\nRisks Related to Our Investments Generally\n\u2022Our investments are very risky and highly speculative.\n\u2022We are subject to risks associated with the discontinuation of LIBOR, which will affect our cost of capital and results of operations.\n\u2022The lack of liquidity in our investments may adversely affect our business.\n\u2022We are a non-diversified investment company within the meaning of the 1940 Act, and therefore we may invest a significant portion of our assets in a relatively small number of issuers, which subjects us to a risk of significant loss if any of these issuers defaults on its obligations under any of its debt instruments or as a result of a downturn in the particular industry.\n\u2022Defaults by our portfolio companies will harm our operating results.\n\u2022Prepayments of our debt investments by our portfolio companies could adversely impact our results of operations and reduce our return on equity.\n\u2022If the assets securing the loans that we make decrease in value, then we may lack sufficient collateral to cover losses.\nRisks Related to Our Securities\n\u2022Our common stock price may be volatile and may decrease substantially.\n\u2022Our shareholders may experience dilution upon repurchase of common shares.\n\u2022Stockholders may incur dilution if we sell shares of our common stock in one or more offerings at prices below the then current net asset value per share of our common stock or issue securities to subscribe to, convert to or purchase shares of our common stock.\nRISKS RELATED TO CONVERTING TO A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment, and if we are found to be in violation of any of the federal, state, or local laws or regulations applicable to us, our business could suffer.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act, was enacted in 2010. The Dodd-Frank Act significantly changed federal financial services regulation and affects, among other things, the lending, deposit, investment, trading, and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies. In addition to the statutory requirements under the Dodd-Frank Act, the legislation also delegated authority to US banking, securities and derivatives regulators to impose additional restrictions through required rulemaking. The Dodd-Frank Act requires a company that owns an bank to serve as a \u201csource of strength\u201d to the institution. We believe that we have the ability to serve in the future as a source of strength to NBNYC, subject to the relevant Regulatory Approvals and required shareholder approval to withdraw our election as a BDC. A company that owns a bank is also subject to the Dodd-Frank Act \u201cVolcker Rule.\u201d We do not believe that the \u201cVolcker Rule\u201d materially impacts our operations as presently conducted.\nFor so long as we remain a BDC, the 1940 Act imposes numerous constraints on our operations. For a discussion of those constraints. See \u201cItem 1. Business - Regulation\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any failure to comply with the requirements imposed on BDCs by the 1940 Act, if applicable, could have material adverse consequences to us or our investors, including possible enforcement action by the SEC.\nOther changes in the laws or regulations applicable to us more generally, may negatively impact the profitability of our business activities, require us to change certain of our business practices, materially affect our business model, limit the activities in which we may engage, affect retention of key personnel, require us to raise additional regulatory capital, increase the amount of liquid assets that we hold, otherwise affect our funding profile or expose us to additional costs (including increased compliance costs). Any such changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to make any necessary changes and may adversely affect our ability to conduct our business as previously conducted or our results of operations or financial condition.\nWe are also subject to, and may become subject to, a wide range of federal, state, and local laws and regulations, such as local licensing requirements, and retail financing, debt collection, consumer protection, environmental, health and safety, creditor, wage-hour, anti-discrimination, whistleblower and other employment practices laws and regulations and we expect these costs to increase going forward. The violation of these or future requirements or laws and regulations could result in administrative, civil, or criminal sanctions against us, which may include fines, a cease and desist order against the subject operations or even revocation or suspension of our license to operate the subject business. As a result, we have incurred and may incur increased capital and operating expenditures and other costs to comply with these requirements and laws and regulations.\nChanges in laws, regulations, or policies may adversely affect our business.\nWe are unable to predict all of the ways in which this change in the regulatory environment could impact our anticipated business models or objectives. The laws and regulations governing lending, servicing, and debt collection activities or the regulatory or enforcement environment at the federal level or in any of the states in which we anticipate operating may change at any time which may have an adverse effect on our current or anticipated business.\nWe are unable to predict how future legislative proposals or programs will be administered or implemented or in what form, or whether any additional or similar changes to statutes or regulations, including the interpretation or implementation thereof, will occur in the future. Any such action could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways and could have an adverse effect on our anticipated business operations.\nOur inability to comply with regulatory requirements in a particular jurisdiction could have a material adverse effect on our anticipated operations in that market and on our reputation generally. No assurance can be given that applicable laws or regulations will not be amended or construed differently or that new laws and regulations will not be adopted, either of which could materially adversely affect our anticipated business.\nWe will become subject to extensive regulation and supervision upon becoming a financial holding company, which may adversely affect our business.\nUpon becoming a financial holding company, we will become subject to a wide range of statutory and regulatory restrictions and requirements that will affect many aspects of our business, including our lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy and growth. We may be required to restructure, terminate or divest certain of our businesses to comply with applicable requirements, which may impose additional costs and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. Failure to comply with laws, regulations, policies or other regulatory guidance could result in civil or criminal sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil monetary penalties and damage to our reputation. In addition, we will be required to serve as a \u201csource of strength\u201d to NBNYC. A company that owns a bank is also subject to the Dodd-Frank Act \u201cVolcker Rule.\u201d We do not believe that the \u201cVolcker Rule\u201d materially impacts our operations as presently conducted.\nCongress and federal regulatory agencies continually review banking laws, regulations, policies and other supervisory guidance for possible changes. Other changes in the laws or regulations that will be applicable to us as a financial holding company, including changes in the interpretation or implementation of those regulations or policies, may negatively impact the profitability of our business activities, require us to change certain of our business practices, materially affect our business model, limit the activities in which we may engage, affect retention of key personnel, require us to raise additional regulatory capital, increase the amount of liquid assets that we hold, otherwise affect our funding profile or expose us to additional costs (including increased compliance costs). Any such changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to make any necessary changes and may adversely affect our ability to conduct our business as previously conducted or our results of operations or financial condition.\nFederal law may discourage certain acquisitions of our common stock which could have a material adverse effect on our shareholders.\nFederal law may make it more difficult for someone to acquire our common stock in certain circumstances. Under federal law and subject to certain exemptions, a person, entity or group must notify the federal banking agencies before acquiring control of a bank holding company. An acquisition of 10% or more of any class of voting stock of a bank holding company generally\ncreates a rebuttable presumption that the acquirer \u201ccontrols\u201d the bank holding company. In addition, a bank holding company must obtain the prior approval of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System before, among other things, acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5 percent of the voting shares of any bank, including NBNYC. If the transaction is consummated, investors will be responsible for ensuring that they do not, directly or indirectly, acquire shares of our common stock in excess of the amount which can be acquired without regulatory approval. These provisions could delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us, despite the possible benefit to our shareholders, or otherwise adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nIf we withdraw the Company\u2019s election to be regulated as a BDC in the future, we will no longer be subject to regulation under the 1940 Act.\nAs part of our plan to reposition the Company as a bank holding company, we intend to ask our shareholders to approve the proposal to withdraw our election to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. If our shareholders approve the withdrawal of our BDC election, we will, effective upon receipt by the SEC of our application for withdrawal, no longer be regulated as a BDC and will no longer be subject to the regulatory provisions of the 1940 Act, which is designed to protect the interests of investors in investment companies, including certain laws and regulations related to insurance, custody, capital structure, composition of the Board of Directors, affiliated transactions, leverage limitations, and compensation arrangements.\nThe withdrawal of the Company\u2019s election to be regulated as a BDC would result in a significant change in our accounting and financial reporting requirements.\nIf the Company withdraws its election to be regulated as a BDC, the Company would no longer be subject to FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 946, Financial Services - Investment Companies, which would result in a significant change in our accounting and financial reporting requirements. Our financial statements are currently presented and accounted for under the specialized method of accounting applicable to investment companies, which requires us to recognize our investments, including controlled investments, at fair value. As a BDC, we are currently precluded from consolidating any entity other than another investment company that acts as an extension of our investment operations and facilitates the execution of our investment strategy or an investment in a controlled operating company that provides substantially all of its services to us. Our financial statements currently consolidate the accounts of the Company and NSBF, and excludes other wholly-owned portfolio investments. Our financial statements reflect our investments at fair value, as determined in good faith by our Board of Directors. Certain of our portfolio companies\u2019 financial statements are separately provided as significant unconsolidated wholly-owned subsidiaries. If the Company withdraws its election to be regulated as a BDC, the Company expects that it will be required to consolidate the financial statements of certain of its controlled or majority-owned portfolio investments together with those of the Company, which would be a significant change in our accounting and financial reporting requirements.\nOur shareholders would no longer have the protections of the 1940 Act upon the withdrawal of the Company\u2019s election to be regulated as a BDC.\nIf the Company ceases to operate as a BDC, our shareholders would no longer have the following protections of the 1940 Act:\n\u2022we would no longer be subject to the requirement under the 1940 Act that we maintain a ratio of assets to senior securities of at least 150%;\n\u2022we would no longer be subject to provisions of the 1940 Act prohibiting us from protecting any director or officer against any liability to the Company or our shareholders arising from willful malfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence, or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of that person\u2019s office;\n\u2022we would no longer be required to provide and maintain an investment company blanket bond issued by a reputable fidelity insurance company to protect us against larceny and embezzlement;\n\u2022while the majority of our directors would still be required to be \u201cindependent\u201d under applicable NASDAQ regulations, we would no longer be required to ensure that a majority of our directors are persons who are not \u201cinterested persons,\u201d as defined in the 1940 Act, and certain persons who would be prevented from serving on our Board of Directors if we were a BDC would be able to serve on our Board of Directors;\n\u2022we would no longer be subject to provisions of the 1940 Act regulating transactions between BDCs and certain affiliates;\n\u2022we would no longer be subject to provisions of the 1940 Act restricting our ability to issue shares below net asset value or in exchange for services or to issue warrants and options;\n\u2022we would no longer be required to disclose the Company\u2019s net asset value per share in our financial statements;\n\u2022we would no longer be subject to provisions of the 1940 Act restricting our ability to change the nature of our business or fundamental investment policies without having to obtain the approval of our shareholders;\n\u2022we would no longer be subject to the provisions of the 1940 Act limiting our ability to grant stock based compensation to officers, directors and employees or to provide a profit sharing program for them; and\n\u2022we would no longer be subject to the other protective provisions set out in the 1940 Act and the rules and regulations promulgated under the 1940 Act.\nIn addition, we are very much affected by the legal, regulatory, tax and accounting regimes under which we operate. We periodically evaluate whether those regimes and our existing corporate structure are the optimum means for the operation and capitalization of our business. As a result of these evaluations, we may decide to proceed with structural and organizational changes (certain of which may require the approval of our shareholders), which could result in material dispositions of various assets, changes in our corporate form or other fundamental changes. We may incur certain costs in completing these evaluations and may receive no benefit from these expenditures, particularly if we do not proceed with any changes.\nLoss of pass-through tax treatment would substantially reduce net assets and income available for dividends.\nWe have operated so as to qualify as a RIC. If we meet source of income, diversification and distribution requirements, we will qualify for effective pass-through tax treatment. Upon withdrawing our election to be regulated as a BDC, we would cease to qualify for such pass-through tax treatment. If we fail to qualify as a RIC, we will have to pay corporate-level taxes on all of our income whether or not we distribute it, which would substantially reduce the amount of income available for distribution to our shareholders, and all of our distributions will be taxed to our shareholders as ordinary corporate distributions. We anticipate that if the Company obtains the required regulatory approvals to complete the NBNYC acquisition, and the approval of the Company\u2019s shareholders to withdraw the Company\u2019s election as a BDC under the 1940 Act, the Company will no longer qualify as a RIC beginning with the taxable year that the Company withdraws its BDC election. For more information, see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Executive Summary\u201d and \u201cRisk Factors - Risks Related to Converting to a Financial Holding Company.\u201d\nRISKS RELATED TO THE ECONOMY\nPolitical, social and economic uncertainty, including uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic, creates and exacerbates risks.\nSocial, political, economic and other conditions and events (such as natural disasters, epidemics and pandemics, terrorism, conflicts and social unrest) will occur that create uncertainty and have significant impacts on issuers, industries, governments and other systems, including the financial markets, to which companies and their investments are exposed. As global systems, economies and financial markets are increasingly interconnected, events that once had only local impact are now more likely to have regional or even global effects. Events that occur in one country, region or financial market will, more frequently, adversely impact issuers in other countries, regions or markets, including in established markets such as the United States. These impacts can be exacerbated by failures of governments and societies to adequately respond to an emerging event or threat.\nUncertainty can result in or coincide with, among other things: increased volatility in the financial markets for securities, derivatives, loans, credit and currency; a decrease in the reliability of market prices and difficulty in valuing assets (including portfolio company assets); greater fluctuations in spreads on debt investments and currency exchange rates; increased risk of default (by both government and private obligors and issuers); further social, economic, and political instability; nationalization of private enterprise; greater governmental involvement in the economy or in social factors that impact the economy; changes to governmental regulation and supervision of the loan, securities, derivatives and currency markets and market participants and decreased or revised monitoring of such markets by governments or self-regulatory organizations and reduced enforcement of regulations; limitations on the activities of investors in such markets; controls or restrictions on foreign investment, capital controls and limitations on repatriation of invested capital; the significant loss of liquidity and the inability to purchase, sell and otherwise fund investments or settle transactions (including, but not limited to, a market freeze); unavailability of currency hedging techniques; substantial, and in some periods extremely high rates of inflation, which can last many years and have substantial negative effects on credit and securities markets as well as the economy as a whole; recessions; and difficulties in obtaining and/or enforcing legal judgments.\nFor example, in December 2019, COVID-19 emerged in China and proceeded to spread rapidly to other countries, including the United States. See \u201c-The COVID-19 pandemic has caused severe disruptions in the U.S. economy and has disrupted financial activity in the areas in which we or our portfolio companies operate.\u201d\nGeneral uncertainty surrounding the dangers and impact of COVID-19 (including the preventative measures taken in response thereto) and additional uncertainty regarding new variants of COVID-19, most notably the Delta and Omicron variants, has to date created significant disruption in supply chains and economic activity, contributed to labor difficulties and is having a particularly adverse impact on transportation, hospitality, tourism, entertainment and other industries, including industries in which certain of our portfolio companies operate which has in turn created significant business disruption issues for certain of our portfolio companies, and materially and adversely impacted the value and performance of certain of our portfolio\ncompanies.\nIn addition, disruptions in the capital markets caused by the COVID-19 pandemic have increased the spread between the yields realized on risk-free and higher risk securities, resulting in illiquidity in parts of the capital markets. These and future market disruptions and/or illiquidity would be expected to have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Unfavorable economic conditions also would be expected to increase our funding costs, limit our access to the capital markets or result in a decision by lenders not to extend credit to us. These events could limit our investment originations, limit our ability to grow and have a material negative impact on our and our prospective portfolio companies\u2019 operating results and the fair values of our debt and equity investments.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is continuing as of the date hereof, and its extended duration may have further adverse impacts on our portfolio companies, including for the reasons described herein.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused severe disruptions in the U.S. economy and has disrupted financial activity in the areas in which we or our portfolio companies operate.\nAs of the filing date of this Annual Report, the COVID-19 pandemic is continuing. This outbreak has led and for an unknown period of time will continue to lead to disruptions in local, regional, national and global markets and economies affected thereby. Many states, including those in which we and our portfolio companies operate, have issued orders requiring the closure of, or certain restrictions on the operation of, non-essential businesses and/or requiring residents to stay at home. The COVID-19 pandemic and restrictive measures taken to contain or mitigate its spread have caused, and are continuing to cause, business shutdowns, or the re-introduction of business shutdowns, cancellations of events and restrictions on travel, significant reductions in demand for certain goods and services, reductions in business activity and financial transactions, supply chain interruptions and overall economic and financial market instability both globally and in the United States. Such effects will likely continue for the duration of the pandemic, which is uncertain, and for some period thereafter.\nWhile several countries, as well as certain states, counties and cities in the United States, began to relax the early public health restrictions with a view to partially or fully reopening their economies, many cities world-wide have since experienced a surge in the reported number of cases, hospitalizations and deaths related to the COVID-19 pandemic. This recent increase in cases led to the re-introduction of restrictions and business shutdowns in certain states, counties and cities in the United States and globally and could continue to lead to the re-introduction of such restrictions and business shutdowns elsewhere. Beginning in December 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized certain vaccines for emergency use. However, it remains unclear how quickly the vaccines will be distributed or when \u201cherd immunity\u201d will be achieved and the restrictions that were imposed to slow the spread of the virus will be lifted entirely. Delays in distributing the vaccines or an actual or perceived failure to achieve \u201cherd immunity\u201d could lead people to continue to self-isolate and not participate in the economy at pre-pandemic levels for a prolonged period of time. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, the U.S. economy and most other major global economies may continue to experience a recession, and our business and operations, as well as the business and operations of our portfolio companies, could be materially adversely affected by a prolonged recession in the U.S. and other major markets.\nThe impact of COVID-19 led to significant volatility and declines in the global public equity markets and it is uncertain how long this volatility will continue. As COVID-19 continues to spread, the potential impacts, including a global, regional or other economic recession, are increasingly uncertain and difficult to assess. Some economists and major investment banks have expressed concern that the continued spread of the virus globally could lead to a world-wide economic downturn, the impacts of which could last for some period after the pandemic is controlled and/or abated.\nGeneral uncertainty surrounding the dangers and impact of COVID-19 (including the preventative measures taken in response thereto and additional uncertainty regarding new variants of COVID-19 that have emerged) has to date created significant disruption in supply chains and economic activity and are having a particularly adverse impact on transportation, hospitality, tourism, entertainment and other industries, including industries in which certain of our portfolio companies operate which has in turn created significant business disruption issues for certain of our portfolio companies, and materially and adversely impacted the value and performance of certain of our portfolio companies.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is continuing as of the filing date of this Annual Report, and its extended duration may have further adverse impacts on our portfolio companies after December 31, 2021, including for the reasons described herein.\nAny public health emergency, including the COVID-19 pandemic or any outbreak of other existing or new epidemic diseases, or the threat thereof, and the resulting financial and economic market uncertainty could have a significant adverse impact on us and the fair value of our investments and our portfolio companies.\nThe extent of the impact of any public health emergency, including the COVID-19 pandemic, on our and our portfolio companies\u2019 operational and financial performance will depend on many factors, including the duration and scope of such public health emergency, the actions taken by governmental authorities to contain its financial and economic impact, the extent of any related travel advisories and restrictions implemented, the impact of such public health emergency on overall supply and demand, goods and services, investor liquidity, consumer confidence and levels of economic activity and the extent of its disruption to important global, regional and local supply chains and economic markets, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. In addition, our and our portfolio companies\u2019 operations may be significantly impacted, or even temporarily or permanently halted, as a result of government quarantine measures, voluntary and precautionary restrictions on travel or meetings and other factors related to a public health emergency, including its potential adverse impact on the health of any of our or our portfolio companies\u2019 personnel. This could create widespread business continuity issues for us and our portfolio companies.\nMoreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted and is likely to further adversely impact our operations and the operations of our borrowers, customers, portfolio companies and business partners. A number of factors impacting us or our borrowers, customers or business partners could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition, including but not limited to:\n\u2022increases in loan delinquencies, losses and charge-offs;\n\u2022increases in borrowers seeking and being granted deferments of principal and interest payments, especially following the conclusion of the six months of payments made directly by the SBA under provisions of the CARES Act, which could negatively impact cash flow from net interest and servicing payments normally available to the Company, during the deferment period;\n\u2022collateral for loans, including real estate, may decline in value, which could cause loan losses to increase;\n\u2022demand for our, and our portfolio companies\u2019, business products and solutions may decline, making it difficult to grow or maintain our assets and income;\n\u2022net worth and liquidity of the guarantors on our loans may decline, which could cause loan losses to increase;\n\u2022our risk management policies and practices may be negatively impacted by among, other things, changes in the SBA 7(a) loan program, including changes to SBA rules, regulations and SBA standard operating procedures;\n\u2022cyber risk has increased as criminals have sought to take advantage of the changes of business practices necessitated by COVID-19.\nThese factors may also cause the valuation of our investments to differ materially from the values that we may ultimately realize. Our valuations, and particularly valuations of private investments and private companies, are inherently uncertain, may fluctuate over short periods of time and are often based on estimates, comparisons and qualitative evaluations of private information. As a result, our valuations may not show the completed or continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting measures taken in response thereto. Any public health emergency, including the COVID-19 pandemic or any outbreak of other existing or new epidemic diseases, or the threat thereof, and the resulting financial and economic market uncertainty could have a significant adverse impact on us and the fair value of our investments and our portfolio companies.\nAs of the date of this Form 10-K, it is impossible to determine the scope of this outbreak, or any future outbreaks, how long any such outbreak, market disruption or uncertainties may last, the effect any governmental actions will have or the full potential impact on us and our portfolio companies. As the potential impact of COVID-19 is difficult to predict, the extent to which COVID-19 could negatively affect our and our portfolio companies\u2019 operating results or the duration of any potential business or supply-chain disruption, is uncertain. Any potential impact to our results of operations will depend to a large extent on future developments and new information that could emerge regarding the duration and severity of COVID-19 and the actions taken by authorities and other entities to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact, all of which are beyond our control. These potential impacts, while uncertain, could adversely affect our and our portfolio companies\u2019 operating results.\nIf the economy is unable to substantially reopen or remain reopened, and high levels of unemployment continue for an extended period of time, loan delinquencies, loan non-accruals, problem assets, and bankruptcies may increase. In addition, collateral for our loans may decline in value, which could cause loan losses to increase and the net worth and liquidity of loan guarantors could decline, impairing their ability to honor commitments to us. An increase in loan delinquencies and non-accruals or a decrease in loan collateral and guarantor net worth could result in increased costs and reduced income which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nEconomic recessions or downturns, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, could impair our portfolio companies and harm our operating results.\nMany of our portfolio companies may be susceptible to economic slowdowns or recessions and may be unable to repay our debt\ninvestments during these periods. The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted economic markets, and the prolonged economic impact is uncertain. In the past, instability in the global capital markets resulted in disruptions in liquidity in the debt capital markets, significant write-offs in the financial services sector, the re-pricing of credit risk in the broadly syndicated credit market and the failure of major domestic and international financial institutions. In particular, in past periods of instability, the financial services sector was negatively impacted by significant write-offs as the value of the assets held by financial firms declined, impairing their capital positions and abilities to lend and invest. In addition, continued uncertainty surrounding the impact of trade deals between Britain and the European Union following the United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the European Union and uncertainty between the United States and other countries, including China, with respect to trade policies, treaties, and tariffs, among other factors, have caused disruption in the global markets. There can be no assurance that market conditions will not worsen in the future.\nIn an economic downturn, we may have non-performing assets or non-performing assets may increase, and the value of our\nportfolio is likely to decrease during these periods. Adverse economic conditions may also decrease the value of any collateral securing our loans. A severe recession may further decrease the value of such collateral and result in losses of value in our portfolio and a decrease in our revenues, net income, assets and net worth. Unfavorable economic conditions also could increase our funding costs, limit our access to the capital markets or result in a decision by lenders not to extend credit to us on terms we deem acceptable. These events could prevent us from increasing investments and harm our operating results.\nThe occurrence of recessionary conditions and/or negative developments in the domestic and international credit markets may\nsignificantly affect the markets in which we do business, the value of our investments, and our ongoing operations, costs and profitability. Any such unfavorable economic conditions, including rising interest rates, may also increase our funding costs, limit our access to capital markets or negatively impact our ability to obtain financing, particularly from the debt markets. In addition, any future financial market uncertainty could lead to financial market disruptions and could further impact our ability to obtain financing.\nThese events could limit our investment originations, limit our ability to grow and negatively impact our operating results and\nfinancial condition.\nGlobal economic, political and market conditions may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, including our revenue growth and profitability.\nVarious social and political circumstances in the U.S. and around the world (including wars and other forms of conflict, including rising trade tensions between the United States and China, and other uncertainties regarding actual and potential shifts in the U.S. and foreign, trade, economic and other policies with other countries, terrorist acts, security operations and catastrophic events such as fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes and global health epidemics), may also contribute to increased market volatility and economic uncertainties or deterioration in the U.S. and worldwide. Specifically, the rising conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and resulting market volatility, could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. In response to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the U.S. and other countries have imposed sanctions or other restrictive actions against Russia. Any of the above factors, including sanctions, export controls, tariffs, trade wars and other governmental actions, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common shares and/or debt securities to decline. These market and economic disruptions could also negatively impact the operating results of our portfolio companies.\nCapital markets are currently experiencing disruption and instability and we cannot predict how long these conditions will continue. Such market conditions could materially and adversely affect debt and equity capital markets in the United States and abroad, which could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs a BDC, we must maintain our ability to raise additional capital for investment purposes. Without sufficient access to the capital markets or credit markets, we may be forced to curtail our business operations or we may not be able to pursue new business opportunities. The U.S. capital markets have experienced extreme volatility and disruption since the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, as evidenced by the volatility in global stock markets as a result of, among other things, uncertainty surrounding the pandemic and the fluctuating price of commodities such as oil. Despite actions of the U.S. federal government and foreign governments, these events have contributed to unpredictable general economic conditions that are materially and adversely impacting the broader financial and credit markets and reducing the availability of debt and equity capital for the market as a whole. These conditions could continue for a prolonged period of time or worsen in the future.\nGiven the ongoing and dynamic nature of the circumstances, it is difficult to predict the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. The extent of such impact will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain, including the duration or reoccurrence of any potential business or supply chain disruption, the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and the actions taken by governments and their citizens to contain the COVID-19 pandemic or treat its impact. As the result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related adverse local and national economic consequences, we could be subject to any of the following risks, any of which could have a material, adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations:\n\u2022Current market conditions may make it difficult to raise equity capital because, subject to some limited exceptions, as a BDC, we are generally not able to issue additional shares of our common stock at a price less than the NAV per share without first obtaining approval for such issuance from our stockholders and our independent directors. In addition, these market conditions may make it difficult to access or obtain new indebtedness with similar terms to our existing indebtedness.\n\u2022Significant changes or volatility in the capital markets may also have a negative effect on the valuations of our investments. While most of our investments are not publicly traded, applicable accounting standards require us to assume as part of our valuation process that our investments are sold in a principal market to market participants (even if we plan on holding an investment through its maturity).\n\u2022Significant changes in the capital markets may adversely affect the pace of our investment activity and economic activity generally.\n\u2022The illiquidity of our investments may make it difficult for us to sell such investments to access capital if required, and as a result, we could realize significantly less than the value at which we have recorded our investments if we were required to sell them for liquidity purposes. An inability to raise or access capital, and any required sale of all or a portion of our investments as a result, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe United Kingdom referendum decision to leave the European Union may create significant risks and uncertainty for global markets and our investments.\nThe decision made in the United Kingdom referendum to leave the European Union has led to volatility in global financial markets, and in particular in the markets of the United Kingdom and across Europe, and may also lead to weakening in consumer, corporate and financial confidence in the United Kingdom and Europe. Under the terms of the withdrawal agreement negotiated and agreed to between the United Kingdom and the European Union, the United Kingdom's departure from the European Union was followed by a transition period which ran until December 31, 2020 and during which the United Kingdom continued to apply European Union law and was treated for all material purposes as if it were still a member of the European Union. On December 24, 2020, the European Union and United Kingdom governments signed a trade deal (the \u201cTrade Agreement\u201d) that applied provisionally from January 1, 2021 until the end of April 2021, when the European Parliament approved the Trade Agreement, and that now governs the relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union. The Trade Agreement implements significant regulation around trade, transport of goods and travel restrictions between the United Kingdom and the European Union.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, the longer term economic, legal, political and social framework to be put in place between the United Kingdom and the European Union are unclear at this stage and are likely to lead to ongoing political and economic uncertainty and periods of exacerbated volatility in both the United Kingdom and in wider European markets for some time. In particular, the decision made in the United Kingdom referendum may lead to a call for similar referenda in other European jurisdictions which may cause increased economic volatility and uncertainty in the European and global markets. This volatility and uncertainty may have an adverse effect on the economy generally and on our ability, and the ability of our portfolio companies, to execute our respective strategies and to receive attractive returns.\nIn particular, currency volatility may mean that our returns and the returns of our portfolio companies will be adversely affected by market movements and may make it more difficult, or more expensive, for us to implement appropriate currency hedging. Potential declines in the value of the British Pound and/or the euro against other currencies, along with the potential downgrading of the United Kingdom\u2019s sovereign credit rating, may also have an impact on the performance of any of our portfolio companies located in the United Kingdom or Europe.\nA failure or the perceived risk of a failure to raise the statutory debt limit of the U.S. could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nU.S. debt ceiling and budget deficit concerns have increased the possibility of additional credit-rating downgrades and economic slowdowns, or a recession in the United States. Although U.S. lawmakers passed legislation to raise the federal debt ceiling on multiple occasions, including the most recent increase in December 2021, ratings agencies have lowered or threatened to lower the long-term sovereign credit rating on the United States.\nThe impact of this or any further downgrades to the U.S. government\u2019s sovereign credit rating or its perceived creditworthiness could adversely affect the U.S. and global financial markets and economic conditions. Absent further quantitative easing by the Federal Reserve, these developments could cause interest rates and borrowing costs to rise, which may negatively impact our ability to access the debt markets on favorable terms. In addition, disagreement over the federal budget has caused the U.S. federal government to shut down for periods of time. Continued adverse political and economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we cannot obtain additional capital because of either regulatory or market price constraints, we could be forced to curtail or cease our new lending and investment activities, our net asset value could decrease and our level of distributions and liquidity could be affected adversely.\nOur ability to secure additional financing and satisfy our financial obligations under indebtedness outstanding from time to time will depend upon our future operating performance, which is subject to the prevailing general economic and credit market conditions, including interest rate levels and the availability of credit generally, and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. The prolonged continuation or worsening of current economic and capital market conditions could have a material adverse effect on our ability to secure financing on favorable terms, if at all.\nIf we are unable to obtain additional debt capital, then our equity investors will not benefit from the potential for increased returns on equity resulting from leverage to the extent that our investment strategy is successful and we may be limited in our ability to make new commitments or fundings to our portfolio companies.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS AND STRUCTURE\nWe are dependent upon our Senior Lending Team and our Executive Committee for our future success, and if we are unable to hire and retain qualified personnel or if we lose any member of our Senior Lending Team or our Executive Committee our ability to achieve our investment objective could be significantly harmed.\nWe depend on our Senior Lending Team and Executive Committee as well as other key personnel for the identification, final selection, structuring, closing and monitoring of our investments. These executive officers and employees have critical industry experience and relationships that we rely on to implement our business plan. Our future success depends on the continued service of our Senior Lending Team and our Executive Committee and the replacement of any departing individuals with others of comparable skills and experience. The departure of any of the members of our Senior Lending Team, our Executive Committee or a significant number of our senior personnel could have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve our investment objective. As a result, we may not be able to operate our business as we expect, and our ability to compete could be harmed, which could cause our operating results to suffer.\nOur financial condition and results of operations will depend on our ability to manage and deploy capital effectively.\nOur ability to achieve our investment objective will depend on our ability to manage and deploy capital, which will depend, in turn, on our management\u2019s ability to identify, evaluate and monitor, and our ability to finance and invest in, companies that meet our investment criteria.\nAccomplishing our investment objective on a cost-effective basis will largely be a function of our management\u2019s handling of the investment process, its ability to provide competent, attentive and efficient services and our access to investments offering acceptable terms. In addition to monitoring the performance of our existing investments, our Senior Lending Team and our Executive Committee is called upon, from time to time, to provide managerial assistance to some of our portfolio companies.\nThese demands on their time may distract them or slow the rate of investment. Even if we are able to grow and build upon our investment operations, any failure to manage our growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. The results of our operations will depend on many factors, including the availability of opportunities for investment, readily accessible short and long-term funding alternatives in the financial markets and economic conditions. Furthermore, if we cannot successfully operate our business or implement our investment policies and strategies as described herein, it could negatively impact our ability to pay dividends.\nWe operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities, which could reduce returns and result in losses.\nWe compete for investments with other financial institutions and various SMB lenders, as well as other sources of funding. Additionally, competition for investment opportunities has emerged among alternative investment vehicles, such as CLOs, some of which are sponsored by other alternative asset investors, as these entities have begun to focus on making investments in SMBs. As a result of these new entrants, competition for our investment opportunities may intensify. Many of our competitors will be substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than us. For example, some competitors may have a lower cost of capital and access to funding sources that will not be available to us. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments than we will have. These characteristics could allow our competitors to consider a wider variety of investments, establish more relationships and offer better pricing and more flexible structuring than we will be able to offer. We may lose investment opportunities if we do not match our competitors\u2019 pricing, terms and structure. If we are forced to match our competitors\u2019 pricing, terms and structure, we may not be able to achieve acceptable returns on our investments or may bear substantial risk of capital loss. Furthermore, many of our competitors will have greater experience operating under, or will not be subject to, the regulatory restrictions that the 1940 Act will impose on us as a BDC, or the source-of-income, asset diversification, and distribution requirements we must satisfy to maintain our tax treatment as a RIC.\nIf we are unable to source investments effectively, we may be unable to achieve our investment objective.\nOur ability to achieve our investment objective depends on our Senior Lending Team\u2019s and our Executive Committee\u2019s ability to identify, evaluate and invest in suitable companies that meet our investment criteria. Accomplishing this result on a cost-effective basis is largely a function of our marketing capabilities, our management of the investment process, our ability to provide efficient services and our access to financing sources on acceptable terms. In addition to monitoring the performance of our existing investments, members of our Senior Lending Team, our Executive Committee and our other investment professionals may also be called upon to provide managerial assistance to our portfolio companies. These demands on their time may distract them or slow the rate of investment. To grow, we need to continue to hire, train, supervise and manage new employees and to implement computer and other systems capable of effectively accommodating our growth. However, we cannot provide assurance that any such employees will contribute to the success of our business or that we will implement such systems effectively. Failure to manage our future growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business model depends to a significant extent upon strong referral relationships, and our inability to maintain or further develop these relationships, as well as the failure of these relationships to generate investment opportunities, could adversely affect our business.\nWe expect that members of our Senior Lending Team and our Executive Committee will maintain their relationships with intermediaries, financial institutions, investment bankers, commercial bankers, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants, consultants, alliance partners, and other individuals within their networks, and we will rely, to a significant extent, upon these relationships to provide us with potential investment opportunities. If our Senior Lending Team and our Executive Committee fail to maintain its existing relationships or develop new relationships with sources of investment opportunities, we may not be able to grow our investment portfolio. In addition, individuals with whom members of our Senior Lending Team and our Executive Committee have relationships are not obligated to provide us with investment opportunities, and, therefore, there is no assurance that such relationships will generate investment opportunities for us.\nOur investment portfolio is recorded at fair value, with our Board having final responsibility for overseeing, reviewing and approving, in good faith, its estimate of fair value and, as a result, there is uncertainty as to the value of our portfolio investments.\nUnder the 1940 Act, we are required to carry our portfolio investments at market value or, if there is no readily available market value, at fair value as determined by us, with our Board having final responsibility for overseeing, reviewing and approving, in good faith, our estimate of fair value. Typically, there is not a public market for the securities of the privately held companies in which we invest. As a result, we value these securities annually and quarterly at fair value based on various inputs, including management, third-party valuation firms and our audit committee, and with the oversight, review and approval of our Board.\nThe determination of fair value and consequently, the amount of unrealized gains and losses in our portfolio, are to a certain degree, subjective and dependent on a valuation process approved by our Board. Certain factors that may be considered in determining the fair value of our investments include external events, such as private mergers, sales and acquisitions involving comparable companies. Because such valuations, and particularly valuations of private securities and private companies, are inherently uncertain, they may fluctuate over short periods of time and may be based on estimates. Our determinations of fair value may differ materially from the values that would have been used if a ready market for these securities existed. Due to this uncertainty, our fair value determinations may cause our net asset value on a given date to materially understate or overstate the value that we may ultimately realize on one or more of our investments. As a result, investors purchasing our common stock based on an overstated net asset value would pay a higher price than the value of our investments might warrant. Conversely, investors selling stock during a period in which the net asset value understates the value of our investments will receive a lower price for their stock than the value of our investments might warrant.\nAny unrealized depreciation we experience in our portfolio may be an indication of a portfolio company\u2019s inability to meet its repayment obligations to us with respect to affected loans or a potential impairment of the value of affected equity investments. This could result in realized losses in the future and ultimately in reductions of our income and gains available for distribution in future periods.\nAs a BDC, we are required to carry our investments at market value or, if no market value is ascertainable, at the fair value as determined in good faith by our Board. Decreases in the market values or fair values of our investments will be recorded as unrealized depreciation. Any unrealized depreciation in our portfolio could be an indication of a portfolio company's inability to meet its repayment obligations to us with respect to affected loans or a potential impairment of the value of affected equity investments. This could result in realized losses in the future and ultimately in reductions of our income and gains available for distribution in future periods.\nBecause we borrow money, the potential for loss on amounts invested in us is magnified and may increase the risk of investing in us.\nBorrowings, also known as leverage, magnify the potential for loss on investments in our indebtedness and on invested equity capital. As we use leverage to partially finance our investments, investors will experience increased risks of investing in our securities. If the value of our assets increases, then leveraging would cause the net asset value attributable to our common stock to increase more sharply than it would have had we not leveraged. Conversely, if the value of our assets decreases, leveraging would cause net asset value to decline more sharply than it otherwise would have had we not leveraged our business. Similarly, any increase in our income in excess of interest payable on the borrowed funds would cause our net investment income to increase more than it would without the leverage, while any decrease in our income would cause net investment income to decline more sharply than it would have had we not borrowed. Such a decline could negatively affect our ability to pay common stock dividends, scheduled debt payments or other payments related to our securities. Leverage is generally considered a speculative investment technique.\nIllustration: The following table illustrates the effect of leverage on returns from an investment in our common stock assuming various annual returns, net of expenses. The calculations in the table below are hypothetical and actual returns may be higher or lower than those appearing in the table below:\n(1) Assumes $1,056.6 million in total assets, $479.4 million in debt outstanding, $403.9 million in net assets as of December 31, 2021, and an average cost of funds of 3.38%. Actual interest payments may be different.\n(2) In order for us to cover our annual interest payments on indebtedness, we must achieve annual returns on our December 31, 2021 total assets of at least 1.54%.\nOur ability to achieve our investment objective may depend in part on our ability to access additional leverage on favorable terms, and there can be no assurance that such additional leverage can in fact be achieved.\nTo the extent we borrow money to finance our investments, changes in interest rates will affect our cost of capital and net investment income.\nTo the extent we borrow money to finance investments, our net investment income will depend, in part, upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we invest those funds. As a result, we can offer no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income in the event we borrow money to finance our investments. In periods of rising interest rates, our cost of funds would increase, which could reduce our net investment income. We expect that our long-term fixed-rate investments will be financed primarily with equity and/or long-term debt. We may use interest rate risk management techniques in an effort to limit our exposure to interest rate fluctuations. Such techniques may include various interest rate hedging activities to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act. If we do not implement these techniques properly, we could experience losses on our hedging positions, which could be material. In addition, depending on the frequency and magnitude of rising interest rates, these interest rate increases could negatively impact premiums received on the sale of guaranteed SBA loans, and further, could increase prepayment speeds on outstanding SBA loans, potentially negatively impacting the Company\u2019s financial results.\nBecause we have received the approval of our shareholders, we are subject to 150% asset coverage beginning after July 26, 2018.\nAt the Company\u2019s Special Meeting of Shareholders, held on July 26, 2018, its shareholders approved, among other things, the reduction of the Company\u2019s asset coverage requirements for senior securities from 200% to 150%, effective July 27, 2018. As a result, we are able to increase our leverage up to an amount that reduces our asset coverage ratio from 200% to 150% (i.e., the amount of debt may not exceed 66 2/3% of the value of our assets) beginning on July 27, 2018, assuming that additional borrowings are available. As of December 31, 2021, we had aggregate principal amount of senior securities outstanding of $479,451,000, and our asset coverage was 184%.\nLeverage magnifies the potential for loss on investments in our indebtedness and on invested equity capital. As we use leverage to partially finance our investments, investors will experience increased risks of investing in our securities. If the value of our assets increases, then the additional leverage would cause the net asset value attributable to our common stock to increase more sharply than it would have had we not increased our leverage. Conversely, if the value of our assets decreases, the additional leverage would cause net asset value to decline more sharply than it otherwise would have had we not increased our leverage. Similarly, any increase in our income in excess of interest payable on the borrowed funds would cause our net investment income to increase more than it would without the additional leverage, while any decrease in our income would cause net investment income to decline more sharply than it would have had we not increased our leverage. Such a decline could negatively affect our ability to pay common stock dividends, scheduled debt payments or other payments related to our securities. Leverage is generally considered a speculative investment technique.\nIn addition, the ability of BDCs to increase their leverage will increase the capital available to BDCs and thus competition for the investments that we seek to make. This may negatively impact pricing on the investments that we do make and adversely affect our net investment income and results of operations.\nAny failure on our part to maintain our status as a BDC could reduce our operating flexibility.\nWe have elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. The 1940 Act imposes numerous constraints on the operations of BDCs. For example, BDCs are required to invest at least 70% of their gross assets in specified types of securities, primarily in private companies or thinly-traded U.S. public companies, cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities and other high quality debt investments that mature in one year or less. Furthermore, any failure to comply with the requirements imposed on BDCs by the 1940 Act could cause the SEC to bring an enforcement action against us and/or expose us to claims of private litigants. In addition, upon approval of a majority of our shareholders, we may elect to withdraw our status as a BDC. If we decide to withdraw our election, or if we otherwise fail to maintain our qualification, as a BDC, we may be subject to the substantially greater regulation under the 1940 Act as a closed-end investment company. Compliance with such regulations could significantly decrease our operating flexibility, and could significantly increase our costs of doing business For more information, see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Executive Summary\u201d and \u201cRisk Factors - Risks Related to Converting to a Financial Holding Company.\u201d\nRegulations governing our operation as a BDC affect our ability to raise additional capital and the way in which we do so. As a BDC, the necessity of raising additional capital may expose us to risks, including the typical risks associated with leverage.\nWe may issue debt securities or preferred stock and/or borrow money from banks or other financial institutions, which we refer to collectively as \u201csenior securities,\u201d up to the maximum amount permitted by the 1940 Act. Under the provisions of the 1940 Act, and pursuant to the approval that we received from our shareholders on July 26, 2018, we are permitted, as a BDC, to issue senior securities in amounts such that our asset coverage ratio, as defined in the 1940 Act, equals at least 150% of gross assets less all liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior securities, after each issuance of senior securities. See \u201cRegulation.\u201d If the value of our assets declines, we may be unable to satisfy this test. If that happens, we may be required to sell a portion of our investments and, depending on the nature of our leverage, repay a portion of our indebtedness at a time when such sales may be disadvantageous. Also, any amounts that we use to service our indebtedness would not be available for distributions to our common shareholders. Continuing to expand our debt financing activities in SBA 7(a) loans, SBA 504 loans and conventional loans will require us to raise additional capital. The failure to continue to generate such loans on a consistent basis could have a material impact on our results of operations, and accordingly, our ability to make distributions to our shareholders.\nWe generally may not issue and sell our common stock at a price below net asset value per share. However, at an August 3, 2021 special meeting of shareholders, our shareholders authorized us to sell shares of our common stock (during the following 12 months or until our 2022 annual meeting of shareholders) at a price below its then current net asset value per share subject to certain conditions (including that the cumulative number of shares sold does not exceed 20% of its then outstanding common stock immediately prior to each such sale). We also may sell our common stock, or warrants, options or rights to acquire our common stock, at a price below the then-current net asset value per share of our common stock if our Board determines that such sale is in our best interests and in the best interests of our shareholders, and our shareholders approve such sale. In any such case, the price at which our securities are to be issued and sold may not be less than a price that, in the determination of our Board, closely approximates the market value of such securities (less any distributing commission or discount). If we raise additional funds by issuing more common stock or senior securities convertible into, or exchangeable for, our common stock, then the percentage ownership of our shareholders at that time will decrease, and shareholders may experience dilution.\nWe may not be able to pay distributions to our shareholders, our distributions may not grow over time and a portion of our distributions may be a return of capital.\nWe intend to pay distributions to our shareholders out of assets legally available for distribution. We cannot assure investors that we will achieve investment results that will allow us to make a specified level of cash distributions or year-to-year increases in cash distributions. Our ability to pay distributions might be adversely affected by, among other things, the impact of one or more of the risk factors described in this annual report. In addition, the inability to satisfy the asset coverage test applicable to us as a BDC can limit our ability to pay distributions. All distributions will be paid at the discretion of our Board and will depend on our earnings, our financial condition, maintenance of our RIC tax treatment, compliance with applicable BDC regulations and such other factors as our Board may deem relevant from time to time. We cannot assure investors that we will pay distributions to our shareholders in the future.\nWhen we make distributions, we will be required to determine the extent to which such distributions are paid out of current or accumulated earnings and profits. Distributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits will be treated as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of an investor\u2019s basis in our stock and, assuming that an investor holds our stock as a capital asset, thereafter as a capital gain. Generally, a non-taxable return of capital will reduce an investor\u2019s basis in our stock for federal tax purposes, which will result in higher tax liability when the stock is sold. Stockholders should read any written disclosure accompanying a distribution carefully and should not assume that the source of any distribution is our ordinary income or gains.\nOur Board may change our investment objective, operating policies and strategies without prior notice or shareholder approval, the effects of which may be adverse.\nAlthough we must obtain shareholder approval to cease to be, or withdraw our election as, a BDC, our Board has the authority to modify or waive our investment objective, current operating policies, investment criteria and strategies without prior notice and without shareholder approval. We cannot predict the effect any changes to our current operating policies, investment criteria and strategies would have on our business, net asset value, operating results and value of our stock. However, the effects might be adverse, which could negatively impact our ability to make distributions and cause shareholders to lose all or part of their investment.\nInternal control deficiencies could impact the accuracy of our financial results or prevent the detection of fraud. As a result, shareholders could lose confidence in our financial and other public reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our common stock.\nEffective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and, together with adequate disclosure controls and procedures, are designed to prevent fraud. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company\u2019s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Any failure by us to identify future deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting in a timely manner or remediate any such deficiencies, could prevent us from accurately and timely reporting our financial results. Inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nWe are required to disclose changes made in our internal control and procedures on a quarterly basis and our management is required to assess the effectiveness of these controls annually. An independent assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls could detect problems that our management\u2019s assessment might not. Undetected material weaknesses in our internal controls could lead to financial statement restatements and require us to incur the expense of remediation. In the event that we are unable to maintain or achieve compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and related rules, the market price of our common stock may be adversely affected.\nOur business is subject to increasingly complex corporate governance, public disclosure and accounting requirements that are costly and could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nWe are subject to changing rules and regulations of federal and state government as well as the stock exchange on which our common stock is listed. These entities, including the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the SEC and the Nasdaq Global Market, have issued a significant number of new and increasingly complex requirements and regulations over the course of the last several years and continue to develop additional regulations and requirements in response to laws enacted by Congress. Our efforts to comply with existing requirements, or any revised or amended requirements, have resulted in, and may continue to result in, an increase in expenses and a diversion of management\u2019s time from other business activities.\nIn addition, our failure to keep pace with any such rules, or for our management to appropriately address compliance with such rules fully and in a timely manner, exposes us to an increasing risk of inadvertent non-compliance. While our management team takes reasonable efforts to ensure that we are in full compliance with all laws applicable to its operations, the increasing rate and extent of regulatory change increases the risk of a failure to comply, which may result in our ability to operate our business in the ordinary course or may subject us to potential fines, regulatory findings or other matters that may materially impact our business.\nChanges in laws or regulations governing our operations may adversely affect our business or cause us to alter our business strategy.\nWe and our portfolio companies are subject to applicable local, state and federal laws and regulations, including, without limitation, federal immigration laws and regulations. New legislation may be enacted or new interpretations, rulings or regulations could be adopted, including those governing the types of investments we are permitted to make, any of which could harm us and our shareholders, potentially with retroactive effect. Additionally, any changes to the laws and regulations governing our operations relating to permitted investments may cause us to alter our investment strategy in order to avail ourselves of new or different opportunities. Such changes could result in material differences to the strategies and plans set forth herein and may result in our investment focus shifting from the areas of expertise of our Senior Lending Team and our Executive Committee to other types of investments in which our Senior Lending Team and our Executive Committee may have less expertise or little or no experience. Thus, any such changes, if they occur, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and the value of your investment.\nRISKS RELATED TO SBA LENDING\nNSBF, our wholly-owned subsidiary, is subject to regulation by the SBA, which has specific risks.\nOur wholly-owned subsidiary, NSBF, is licensed by the SBA as an SBLC. In order to operate as an SBLC, a licensee is required to maintain a minimum regulatory capital (as defined by SBA regulations) of the greater of (1) 10% of its outstanding loans receivable and other investments or (2) $1.0 million. Moreover, before consenting to a securitization, NSBF and other securitizers must, among other things, be considered well capitalized by the SBA. For NSBF and other SBLC securitizers, the SBA will consider it well capitalized if it maintains a minimum unencumbered paid in capital and paid in surplus equal to at least 10% of its assets, excluding the guaranteed portion of 7(a) loans. In addition, an SBLC is subject to certain other regulatory restrictions. Among other things, SBLCs are required to: establish, adopt, and maintain a formal written capital plan; submit to the SBA for review a credit policy that demonstrates the SBLC\u2019s compliance with the applicable regulations and the SBA\u2019s Standard Operating Procedures for origination, servicing and liquidation of 7(a) loans; submit to the SBA for review and approval annual validation, with supporting documentation and methodologies, demonstrating that any scoring model used by the SBLC is predictive of loan performance; obtain SBA approval for loan securitization and borrowings; and adopt and fully implement an internal control policy which provides adequate direction for effective control over and accountability for operations, programs, and resources.\nAdditionally, in connection with our 2018 examination by the SBA, NSBF entered into a voluntary agreement with the SBA to meet certain other requirements and conditions. See \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors - If NSBF fails to comply with SBA regulations in connection with the origination, servicing, or liquidation of an SBA 7(a) loan, liability on the SBA guaranty, in whole or in part, could be transferred to NSBF.\u201d\nWe have specific risks associated with SBA loans.\nWe have generally sold the guaranteed portion of SBA loans in the secondary market. Such sales have resulted in our earning premiums and creating a stream of servicing income. Sale prices for guaranteed portions of SBA 7(a) loans can be negatively impacted by market conditions, in particular a higher interest rate environment, which can lead to higher prepayments during the period, resulting in lower sale prices in the secondary market. A reduction in the price of guaranteed SBA 7(a) loans could negatively impact our business. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue originating these loans, or that a secondary market will exist for, or that we will continue to realize premiums upon the sale of the guaranteed portions of the SBA 7(a) loans.\nIf NSBF fails to comply with SBA regulations in connection with the origination, servicing, or liquidation of an SBA 7(a) loan, liability on the SBA guaranty, in whole or part, could be transferred to NSBF.\nSince we sell the guaranteed portion of substantially all of our SBA 7(a) loan portfolio, we retain credit risk on the non-guaranteed portion of the SBA loans. We share pro rata with the SBA in any recoveries. In the event of default on an SBA loan, our pursuit of remedies against a borrower is subject to SBA approval.\nIf we fail to comply with certain of the SBA\u2019s regulations in connection with the origination, servicing, or liquidation of an SBA 7(a) loan, the SBA may be released from liability on its guaranty of a 7(a) loan, and may refuse to honor a guaranty purchase request in full (referred to by SBA as a \u201cdenial\u201d) or in part (referred to by SBA as a \u201crepair\u201d), or recover all or part of the funds already paid in connection with a guaranty purchase. In the event of a repair or denial, liability on the guaranty, in whole or part, would be transferred to NSBF. In addition, the growth in the number of loans made by NSBF, changes in SBA regulations and economic factors may adversely impact our current repair and denial rate. In connection with NSBF\u2019s 2018 examination by the SBA, NSBF entered into a voluntary agreement with the SBA. We have adopted the agreement pursuant to our commitment to operate under the SBA\u2019s Loan Program Requirements and the agreement formalizes many of the actions NSBF had previously taken to strengthen its operational procedures as they relate to NSBF\u2019s delegated lender authority. Consistent with the terms of the agreement, NSBF established a segregated restricted cash account in the amount of $10 million to account for potential post-purchase repairs and denials of guaranteed portions of SBA 7(a) loans, and take certain actions to demonstrate the sufficiency of NSBF\u2019s liquidity and establish certain additional reporting and compliance procedures. We continue to assess and develop our policies and procedures to facilitate the successful implementation of our business, liquidity and operations.\nCurtailment of the government-guaranteed loan programs could adversely affect our results of operations.\nAlthough the SBA 7(a) Program has been in existence since 1953, there can be no assurance that the federal government will maintain the SBA 7(a) program, or that it will continue to guarantee loans at current levels. Furthermore, in an effort to support\nour communities during the pandemic, we participated in the PPP under the CARES Act whereby we made loans to small businesses and those loans are subject to the regulatory requirements that require forbearance of loan payments for a specified time or limit our ability to pursue all available remedies in the event of a loan default. If the borrower under the PPP loan fails to qualify for loan forgiveness, we may be at the heightened risk of holding these loans at unfavorable interest rates as compared to the loans to customers that we would have otherwise extended credit. If we cannot continue originating and selling government-guaranteed loans, we will generate fewer origination fees and our ability to generate gains on the sale of loans will decrease. From time-to-time, the government agencies that guarantee these loans reach their internal budgeted limits and cease to guarantee loans for a stated time period. In addition, these agencies may change their rules for extending loans. Also, Congress may adopt legislation that would have the effect of discontinuing or changing the SBA\u2019s programs. Non-governmental programs could replace government programs for some borrowers, but the terms might not be equally acceptable. If these changes occur, the volume of loans to SMBs and industrial borrowers of the types that now qualify for government-guaranteed loans could decline, as could the profitability of these loans.\nCurtailment of our ability to utilize the SBA 7(a) Loan Program by the Federal government would adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe are dependent upon the federal government to maintain the SBA 7(a) program. There can be no assurance that the SBA 7(a) program will be maintained or that loans will continue to be guaranteed at current levels. From time-to-time the SBA has reached its internal budgeted limits and ceased to guarantee loans for a stated period of time. In addition, the SBA may change its rules regarding loans or Congress may adopt legislation or fail to approve a budget that would have the effect of discontinuing, reducing availability of funds for, or changing loan programs. Non-governmental programs could replace government programs for some borrowers, but the terms might not be equally acceptable. If these changes occur, the volume of loans to small businesses that now qualify for government guaranteed loans could decline, as could the profitability of these loans.\nNSBF\u2019s failure to maintain PLP status or maintain its SBA 7(a) license would adversely affect our results of operations.\nNSBF has been granted PLP status and originates, sells and services small business loans and is authorized to place SBA guarantees on loans without seeking prior SBA review and approval. Being a national lender, PLP status allows NSBF to expedite loans since NSBF is not required to present applications to the SBA for concurrent review and approval. The loss of PLP status would adversely impact our marketing efforts and ultimately loan origination volume which would negatively impact our results of operations.\nThere can be no assurance that NSBF will be able to maintain its status as a PLP or that NSBF can maintain its SBA 7(a) license. If NSBF cannot continue originating and selling government guaranteed loans at current levels, we would experience a decrease in future servicing spreads and earned premiums and negatively impact our results of operations.\nOur loans under the Section 7(a) Loan Program involve a high risk of default and such default could adversely impact our results of operations.\nLoans to small businesses involve a high risk of default. Such loans are generally not rated by any statistical rating organization. Small businesses usually have smaller product lines and market shares than larger companies and therefore may be more vulnerable to competition and general economic conditions. These businesses\u2019 success typically depends on their management talents and efforts of one person or a small group of persons whose death, disability or resignation would adversely affect the business. Because these businesses frequently have highly leveraged capital structures, reduced cash flow resulting from economic downturns can severely impact the businesses\u2019 ability to meet their obligations, which could impact our results of operations. The portions of Section 7(a) loans to be retained by us do not benefit directly from any SBA guarantees; in an event of default, however, we and the SBA typically cooperate in collateral foreclosure or other work-out efforts and share in any resulting collections.\nThe loans we make under the Section 7(a) Loan Program face competition.\nThere are several other non-bank lenders as well as a large number of banks that participate in the SBA Section 7(a) Loan Program. All of these participants compete for the business of eligible borrowers. In addition, pursuant to the 1940 Act, the Company is limited as to the amount of indebtedness it may have. Accordingly, we may be at a competitive disadvantage with regard to other lenders or financial institutions that may be able to achieve greater leverage at a lower cost and are not subject to SBA regulations.\nA governmental failure to fund the SBA could adversely affect NSBF\u2019s SBA 7(a) loan originations and our results of operations.\nWe are dependent upon the Federal government to maintain the SBA 7(a) Program. NSBF\u2019s lending business could be materially and adversely affected by circumstances or events limiting the availability of funds for this program. In October 2013, Congress failed to approve a budget, which, in turn, eliminated availability of funds for the SBA 7(a) program. At the time, the government shutdown affected SBA 7(a) lenders\u2019 ability to originate SBA 7(a) loans. More recently, the government shut down in January 2018 due to a lapse in appropriations, and the SBA closed all non-disaster related programs and activities, including the SBA 7(a) program. The government could again fail to fund the SBA which would affect NSBF\u2019s ability to originate government guaranteed loans and to sell the government guaranteed portions of those loans in the secondary market. Any failure to fund the SBA could adversely affect NSBF\u2019s SBA 7(a) loan originations and our results of operations.\nA government shutdown could adversely affect NSBF\u2019s SBA 7(a) loan originations and our results of operations.\nWe are dependent upon the Federal government to maintain the SBA 7(a) program. NSBF\u2019s lending business could be materially and adversely affected by circumstances or events limiting the availability of funds for this program. In October 2013, Congress failed to approve a budget, which, in turn, eliminated availability of funds for the SBA 7(a) program. At the time, the government shutdown affected SBA 7(a) lenders\u2019 ability to originate SBA 7(a) loans. More recently, the partial government shut down in December 2018 until January 2019, the longest standing partial shutdown in history, resulted in a halt to the SBA 7(a) program. The government could again experience a government shutdown which would affect NSBF\u2019s ability to originate government guaranteed loans and to sell the government guaranteed portions of those loans in the secondary market. Any government shutdown could adversely affect NSBF\u2019s SBA 7(a) loan originations and our results of operations.\nAs a participating lender in the SBA Paycheck Protection Program (\u201cPPP\u201d), the Company and NSBF are subject to additional credit risks and risks of litigation from NSBF\u2019s customers or other parties regarding NSBF\u2019s processing of loans for the PPP and risks that the SBA may not fund some or all PPP loan guaranties.\nOn March 27, 2020, President Trump signed the CARES Act, which included a $349 billion loan program administered through the SBA referred to as the PPP. Under the PPP, small businesses and other entities and individuals can apply for loans from existing SBA lenders and other approved regulated lenders that enroll in the program, subject to numerous limitations and eligibility criteria. On or about April 16, 2020, the SBA notified lenders that the $349 billion earmarked for the PPP was exhausted. Congress approved additional funding for the PPP of approximately $320 billion on April 24, 2020. NSBF is participating as a lender in the PPP. The PPP opened on April 3, 2020\u037e however, because of the short timeframe between the passing of the CARES Act and the opening of the PPP, there has been some ambiguity in the laws, rules and guidance regarding the operation of the PPP, which may expose the Company and NSBF to risks relating to noncompliance with the PPP. During the duration of the PPP, NSBF funded approximately 10,570 PPP loans totaling $1.19 billion. Since the opening of the PPP, several large banks participating in the PPP have been subject to litigation regarding the process and procedures that such banks have used in processing applications for the PPP. The Company and NSBF may be exposed to the risk of litigation, from both customers and non-customers that approached the Company and NSBF regarding PPP loans, regarding its process and procedures used in processing applications for the PPP. If any such litigation is filed against the Company or NSBF and is not resolved in a manner favorable to the Company or NSBF, it may result in significant financial liability or adversely affect the Company\u2019s or NSBF\u2019s reputation. In addition, litigation can be costly, regardless of outcome. Any financial liability, litigation costs or reputational damage caused by PPP related litigation could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nNSBF also has credit risk on PPP loans if a determination is made by the SBA that there is a deficiency in the manner in which a PPP loan was originated, funded, or serviced by NSBF, such as an issue with the eligibility of a borrower to receive a PPP loan, which may or may not be related to the ambiguity in the laws, rules and guidance regarding the operation of the PPP or additional or new laws, rules, and guidance. In the event of a loss resulting from a default on a PPP loan and a determination by the SBA that there was a deficiency in the manner in which the PPP loan was originated, funded, or serviced by NSBF, the SBA may deny its liability under the guaranty, reduce the amount of the guaranty, or, if it has already paid under the guaranty, seek recovery of any loss related to the deficiency from the Company.\nIn addition, in order to facilitate NSBF\u2019s involvement as an authorized lender in the PPP, during the second quarter of 2020, NSBF entered into PPP loan participation agreements where NSBF originated PPP loans and sold participating interests to four banks. See \u201cPPP Loan Participations.\u201d In accordance with the terms of the PPP participation agreements and SBA regulations and guidance, NSBF, as the originating lender, must continue to hold the PPP loan note, the PPP loan documents and service the PPP loan (i.e., retain all servicing rights). Moreover, as the originating lender, NSBF is the party responsible to the SBA with respect to all servicing actions, including requests for advance purchases and loan forgiveness, and will be the party\neligible for the guarantee purchase of the PPP loan. NSBF has agreed that it will repurchase from the Participants on demand the Participants\u2019 Percentage of any outstanding principal and interest under the applicable PPP Loan under certain standard representations and warranties, including in the event of a loss due to fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of NSBF or any failure to recover under the SBA guarantee as a result of any deficiency in documenting or servicing such PPP Loan by NSBF.\nWe could be adversely affected by weakness in the residential housing and commercial real estate markets.\nWeakness in residential home and commercial real estate values could impair our ability to collect on defaulted SBA loans as real estate is pledged in many of our SBA loans as part of the collateral package.\nRISKS RELATED TO U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX\nWe will be subject to corporate-level income tax if we are unable to maintain our treatment as a RIC or are unable to make the distributions required to maintain RIC tax treatment.\nAlthough we have elected to be treated as a RIC, no assurance can be given that we will be able to maintain our tax treatment as a RIC in the future. To maintain our tax treatment as a RIC, we must meet certain source-of-income, asset diversification, and distribution requirements.\nThe income source requirement will be satisfied if we obtain at least 90% of our income for each year from dividends, interest, gains from the sale of stock or securities or similar sources.\nThe asset diversification requirement will be satisfied if we meet certain asset diversification requirements at the end of each quarter of our taxable year. Failure to meet those requirements may result in our having to dispose of certain investments quickly in order to prevent the loss of our qualification as a RIC. Because most of our investments will be in private companies, and therefore will be relatively illiquid, any such dispositions could be made at disadvantageous prices and could result in substantial losses. The Annual Distribution Requirement for a RIC will be satisfied if we distribute to our shareholders on an annual basis at least 90% of our net ordinary income and net short-term capital gains in excess of our net long-term capital losses, if any. Because we use debt financing, we are subject to certain asset coverage ratio requirements under the 1940 Act and financial covenants under loan and credit agreements that could, under certain circumstances, restrict us from making distributions necessary to satisfy the distribution requirement. If we are unable to obtain cash from other sources, we could fail to qualify for tax treatment as a RIC.\nIf we fail to qualify for RIC tax treatment for any reason and remain or become subject to corporate income tax, the resulting corporate taxes could substantially reduce our net assets, the amount of income available for distribution and the amount of our distributions.\nWe cannot predict how new tax legislation will affect us, our investments, or our stockholders, and any such legislation could adversely affect our business.\nLegislative or other actions relating to taxes could have a negative effect on us. The rules dealing with U.S. federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the Internal Revenue Service and the U.S. Treasury Department. The current U.S. presidential administration has proposed significant changes to the existing U.S. tax rules, and there are a number of proposals in Congress that would similarly modify the existing U.S. tax rules. The likelihood of any such legislation being enacted is uncertain, but new legislation and any U.S. Treasury regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions interpreting such legislation could significantly and negatively affect our ability to qualify for tax treatment as a RIC or the U.S. federal income tax consequences to us and our stockholders of such qualification, or could have other adverse consequences. Stockholders are urged to consult with their tax advisor regarding tax legislative, regulatory, or administrative developments and proposals and their potential effect on an investment in our securities.\nBecause we intend to distribute substantially all of our income to our shareholders to maintain our tax treatment as a RIC, we will continue to need additional capital to finance our growth, and regulations governing our operation as a BDC will affect our ability to, and the way in which we, raise additional capital and make distributions.\nAs a RIC, we generally are required to distribute substantially all of our ordinary income to meet the Annual Distribution Requirement and the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement (discussed below), which consequently increases the need to raise additional debt and equity capital. Furthermore, as a result of issuing senior securities, we would also be exposed to typical risks associated with leverage, including an increased risk of loss. If we issue preferred stock, the preferred stock would rank \u201csenior\u201d to common stock in our capital structure, preferred shareholders would have separate voting rights on certain matters and might have other rights, preferences, or privileges more favorable than those of our common shareholders, and the issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for holders of our common stock or otherwise be in your best interest.\nWe may have difficulty paying our required distributions if we recognize income before or without receiving cash representing such income.\nFor U.S. federal income tax purposes, we are required to include in our taxable income certain amounts that we have not yet received in cash, such as original issue discount, which may arise if we receive warrants in connection with the origination of a loan or possibly in other circumstances, or PIK interest. Such original issue discount or increases in loan balances as a result of contractual PIK arrangements will be included in our taxable income before we receive any corresponding cash payments. We also may be required to include in our taxable income certain other amounts that we will not receive in cash. Since, in certain cases, we may recognize taxable income before or without receiving corresponding cash payments, we may have difficulty meeting the Annual Distribution Requirement necessary to maintain our tax treatment as a RIC. Accordingly, to satisfy our RIC distribution requirements, we may have to sell some of our investments at times and/or at prices we would not consider advantageous, raise additional debt or equity capital or forgo new investment opportunities. If we are not able to obtain cash from other sources, we may fail to qualify for tax treatment as a RIC and thus become subject to corporate-level income tax.\nWe may in the future choose to pay dividends in our own stock, in which case investors may be required to pay tax in excess of the cash they receive.\nWe may distribute taxable dividends that are payable in part in our stock. In accordance with certain applicable Treasury regulations and published guidance issued by the Internal Revenue Service, a publicly offered RIC may treat a distribution of its own stock as fulfilling the RIC distribution requirements if each shareholder may elect to receive his or her entire distribution in either cash or stock of the RIC, subject to a limitation that the aggregate amount of cash to be distributed to all shareholders must be at least 20% of the aggregate declared distribution. If too many shareholders elect to receive cash, the cash available for distribution must be allocated among the shareholders electing to receive cash (with the balance of the distribution paid in stock). In no event will any shareholder, electing to receive cash, receive less than the lesser of (a) the portion of the distribution such shareholder has elected to receive in cash or (b) an amount equal to his or her entire distribution times the percentage limitation on cash available for distribution. If these and certain other requirements are met, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the amount of the dividend paid in stock will be equal to the amount of cash that could have been received instead of stock. Taxable shareholders receiving such dividends will be required to include the amount of the dividends as ordinary income (or as long-term capital gain to the extent such distribution is properly reported as a capital gain dividend) to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, a U.S. shareholder may be required to pay tax with respect to such dividends in excess of any cash received. If a U.S. shareholder sells the stock it receives as a dividend in order to pay this tax, the sales proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the dividend, depending on the market price of our stock at the time of the sale. Furthermore, with respect to non-U.S. shareholders, we may be required to withhold U.S. tax with respect to such dividends, including in respect of all or a portion of such dividend that is payable in stock. In addition, if a significant number of our shareholders determine to sell shares of our stock in order to pay taxes owed on dividends, it may put downward pressure on the trading price of our stock.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR INVESTMENTS GENERALLY\nOur investments are very risky and highly speculative.\nWe invest primarily in senior secured term loans and select equity investments issued by companies, some of which are highly leveraged. The majority of senior secured loans are SBA 7(a) loans and the majority of equity investments are comprised of controlled affiliate equity investments.\nSenior Secured Loans. There is a risk that the collateral securing our loans, in most cases real estate, may decrease in value over time, may be difficult to sell in a timely manner, may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value based upon the success of the business and market conditions, including as a result of the inability of the portfolio company to raise additional capital, and, in some circumstances, our lien could be subordinated to claims of other creditors. In addition, deterioration in a portfolio company\u2019s financial condition and prospects, including its inability to raise additional capital, may be accompanied by deterioration in the value of the collateral for the loan. Consequently, the fact that a loan is secured does not guarantee that we will receive principal and interest payments according to the loan\u2019s terms, or at all, or that we will be able to collect on the loan should we be forced to enforce our remedies. In some cases we may take second lien position on additional business or personal assets to secure further our first lien positions.\nEquity Investments. We occasionally invest directly in the equity securities of portfolio companies. The equity interests we receive may not appreciate in value and, in fact, may decline in value. Accordingly, we may not be able to realize gains from our equity interests, and any gains that we do realize on the disposition of any equity interests may not be sufficient to offset any other losses we experience.\nIn addition, investing in SMBs involves a number of significant risks, including:\n\u2022these companies may have limited financial resources and may be unable to meet their obligations under their debt securities that we hold, which may be accompanied by a deterioration in the value of any collateral and a reduction in the likelihood of us realizing any guarantees we may have obtained in connection with our investment;\n\u2022they typically have shorter operating histories, narrower product lines and smaller market shares than larger businesses, which tend to render them more vulnerable to competitors\u2019 actions and market conditions, as well as general economic downturns;\n\u2022they are more likely to depend on the management talents and efforts of a small group of persons; therefore, the death, disability, resignation or termination of one or more of these persons could have a material adverse impact on our portfolio company and, in turn, on us;\n\u2022they generally have less predictable operating results, may from time to time be parties to litigation, may be engaged in rapidly changing businesses with products subject to a substantial risk of obsolescence, and may require substantial additional capital to support their operations, finance expansion or maintain their competitive position;\n\u2022they may have difficulty accessing the capital markets to meet future capital needs, which may limit their ability to grow or to repay their outstanding indebtedness upon maturity; and\n\u2022our executive officers and directors may, in the ordinary course of business, be named as defendants in litigation arising from our investments in the portfolio companies.\nAn investment strategy focused primarily on smaller privately held companies involves a high degree of risk and presents certain challenges, including the lack of available information about these companies, a dependence on the talents and efforts of only a few key portfolio company personnel and a greater vulnerability to economic downturns.\nOur portfolio consists primarily of debt and equity investments in smaller privately-owned companies. Investing in these types of companies involves a number of significant risks. Typically, the debt in which we invest is not initially rated by any rating agency; however, we believe that if such investments were rated, they would be below investment grade. Below investment grade securities, which are often referred to as \u201chigh yield\u201d or \u201cjunk,\u201d have predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer\u2019s capacity to pay interest and repay principal. Compared to larger publicly-owned companies, these small companies may be in a weaker financial position and experience wider variations in their operating results, which may make them more vulnerable to economic downturns. Typically, these companies need more capital to compete; however, their access to capital is limited and their cost of capital is often higher than that of their competitors. Our portfolio companies often face intense competition from larger companies with greater financial, technical and marketing resources and their success typically depends on the managerial talents and efforts of an individual or a small group of persons. Therefore, any loss of its key employees could affect a portfolio company\u2019s ability to compete effectively and harm its financial condition. Further, some of these companies conduct business in regulated industries that are susceptible to regulatory changes. These factors could impair the cash flow of our portfolio companies and result in other events, such as bankruptcy. These events could limit a portfolio company\u2019s ability to repay its obligations to us, which may have an adverse effect on the return on, or the recovery of, our investment in these businesses. Deterioration in a borrower\u2019s financial condition and prospects may be accompanied by deterioration in the value of the loan\u2019s collateral.\nGenerally, little public information exists about these companies, and we are required to rely on the ability of our Senior Lending Team and our Executive Committee to obtain adequate information to evaluate the potential returns from investing in these companies. If we are unable to uncover all material information about these companies, we may not make a fully informed investment decision, and we may lose money on our investments. Also, privately held companies frequently have less diverse product lines and smaller market presence than larger competitors. These factors could adversely affect our investment returns as compared to companies investing primarily in the securities of public companies.\nWe are exposed to risks associated with changes in interest rates.\nBecause we borrow money to make investments, our net investment income will depend, in part, upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we invest those funds. As a result, we can offer no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income.\nA reduction in the interest rates on new investments relative to interest rates on current investments could have an adverse impact on our net investment income. However, an increase in interest rates could decrease the value of any investments we hold which earn fixed interest rates and also could increase our interest expense, thereby decreasing our net income. Also, an increase in interest rates available to investors could make an investment in our common stock less attractive if we are not able to increase our dividend rate, which could reduce the value of our common stock. Further, rising interest rates could also adversely affect our performance if such increases cause our borrowing costs to rise at a rate in excess of the rate that our investments yield.\nThe majority of our debt investments are based on floating rates, primarily the Prime Rate. General interest rate fluctuations can be expected to have a substantial impact on the interest income we receive on our debt investments. For example, a reduction in interest rates could decrease the value of any investments we hold which earn floating interest rates. Alternatively, an increase in interest rates could decrease the value of any investments we hold which earn fixed interest rates.\nGeneral interest rate fluctuations may also have an impact on the value of our stock and our rate of return on invested capital. Because we have borrowed money, our net investment income depends, in part, upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate that our investments yield. As a result, we can offer no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. For example, rising interest rates could also adversely affect our performance if such increases cause our borrowing costs to rise at a rate in excess of the rate that our investments yield, thereby decreasing our net income. Also, an increase in interest rates available to investors could make an investment in our common stock less attractive if we are not able to increase our dividend rate, which could reduce the value of our common stock.\nIf general interest rates rise, there is a risk that the borrowers on our debt investments in floating rate loans will be unable to pay escalating interest amounts, which could result in a default under their loan documents with us. Rising interest rates could also cause borrowers to shift cash from other productive uses to the payment of interest, which may have a material adverse effect on their business and operations and could, over time, lead to increased defaults. In addition, rising interest rates may increase pressure on us to provide fixed rate loans to our borrowers, which could adversely affect our net investment income in the future as interest rates continue to fluctuate.\nTrading prices for debt that pays a fixed rate of return tend to fall as interest rates rise. Trading prices tend to fluctuate more for fixed-rate securities that have longer maturities. Moreover, an increase in interest rates available to investors could make investment in our common stock less attractive if we are not able to increase our dividend rate, which could reduce the value of our common stock. U.S. Federal Reserve policy, including with respect to certain interest rates and the decision to end its quantitative easing policy, may also adversely affect the value, volatility and liquidity of dividend- and interest-paying securities. Market volatility, rising interest rates and/or a return to unfavorable economic conditions could adversely affect our business.\nWe may enter into certain hedging transactions, such as interest rate swap agreements, in an effort to mitigate our exposure to adverse fluctuations in interest rates and we may increase our floating rate investments to position the portfolio for rate increases. However, we cannot assure you that such transactions will be successful in mitigating our exposure to interest rate risk or if we will enter into such interest rate hedges. Hedging transactions may also limit our ability to participate in the benefits of lower interest rates with respect to our portfolio investments.\nWe do not have a policy governing the maturities of our investments. This means that we are subject to greater risk (other things being equal) than a fund invested solely in shorter-term securities. A decline in the prices of the debt we own could adversely affect our net asset value. Also, an increase in interest rates available to investors could make an investment in our common stock less attractive if we are not able to increase our dividend rate.\nIn periods of rising interest rates, to the extent we borrow money subject to a floating interest rate, our cost of funds would increase, which could reduce our net investment income. Further, rising interest rates could also adversely affect our performance if we hold investments with floating interest rates, subject to specified minimum interest rates (such as a LIBOR floor), while at the same time engaging in borrowings subject to floating interest rates not subject to such minimums. In such a scenario, rising interest rates may increase our interest expense, even though our interest income from investments is not increasing in a corresponding manner as a result of such minimum interest rates.\nIf general interest rates rise, there is a risk that the portfolio companies in which we hold floating rate securities will be unable to pay escalating interest amounts, which could result in a default under their loan documents with us. Rising interest rates could also cause portfolio companies to shift cash from other productive uses to the payment of interest, which may have a material adverse effect on their business and operations and could, over time, lead to increased defaults. In addition, rising interest rates may increase pressure on us to provide fixed rate loans to our portfolio companies, which could adversely affect our net investment income, as increases in our cost of borrowed funds would not be accompanied by increased interest income from such fixed-rate investments.\nTo the extent that we make floating rate debt investments, a rise in the general level of interest rates would lead to higher interest rates applicable to our debt investments. Accordingly, an increase in interest rates may result in an increase in the amount of the Incentive Fee payable to the Adviser.\nGeneral interest rate fluctuations may have a substantial negative impact on our investments and investment opportunities and, accordingly, may have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve our investment objective and the rate of return on invested capital. Because we may borrow money to make investments, our net investment income will depend, in part, upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we invest these funds. As a result, there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income.\nWe are subject to risks associated with the discontinuation of LIBOR, which will affect our cost of capital and results of operations.\nLIBOR is the basic rate of interest used in lending transactions between banks on the London interbank market and is widely used as a reference for setting the interest rate on loans globally. We typically use LIBOR as a reference rate in term loans we extend to portfolio companies such that the interest due to us pursuant to a term loan extended to a portfolio company is calculated using LIBOR. The terms of our debt investments generally include minimum interest rate floors which are calculated based on LIBOR.\nOn March 5, 2021, the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority (the \"FCA\"), which regulates LIBOR, announced that the 1-week and 2-month U.S. dollar LIBOR settings will cease publication after December 31, 2021 and the overnight 1, 3, 6 and 12 months U.S. dollar LIBOR settings will cease publication after June 30, 2023. However, the FCA has indicated it will not compel panel banks to continue to contribute to LIBOR after the end of 2021 and the Federal Reserve Board, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation have encouraged banks to cease entering into new contracts that use U.S. dollar LIBOR as a reference rate no later than December 31, 2021.\nTo identify a successor rate for U.S. dollar LIBOR, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (\"ARRC\"), a U.S.-based group convened by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, was formed. On July 29, 2021, the ARCC formally recommended the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) as its preferred alternative replacement rate for LIBOR. SOFR is a measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight, collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities, and is based on directly observable U.S. Treasury-backed repurchase transactions Although SOFR appears to be the preferred replacement rate for U.S. dollar LIBOR, at this time, it is not possible to predict the effect of any such changes, any establishment of alternative reference rates or other reforms to LIBOR that may be enacted in the United States, United Kingdom or elsewhere. Although there have been a few issuances utilizing SOFR or the Sterling Over Night Index Average, an alternative reference rate that is based on transactions, it is unknown whether these alternative reference rates will attain market acceptance as replacements for LIBOR.\nThe elimination of LIBOR or any other changes or reforms to the determination or supervision of LIBOR could have an adverse impact on the market value of and/or transferability of any LIBOR-linked securities, loans, and other financial obligations or extensions of credit held by or due to us or on our overall financial condition or results of operations. In addition, while the majority of our LIBOR-linked loans contemplate that LIBOR may cease to exist and allow for amendment to a new base rate without the approval of 100% of the lenders, if LIBOR ceases to exist, we will still need to renegotiate the credit agreements extending beyond June 2023 with our portfolio companies that utilize LIBOR as a factor in determining the interest rate, in order to replace LIBOR with the new standard that is established, which may have an adverse effect on our overall financial condition or results of operations. Following the replacement of LIBOR, some or all of these credit agreements may bear interest at a lower interest rate, which could have an adverse impact on the value and liquidity of our investment in these\nportfolio companies and, as a result on our results of operations. Moreover, if LIBOR ceases to exist, we may need to renegotiate certain terms of our credit facilities. If we are unable to do so, amounts drawn under our credit facilities may bear interest at a higher rate, which would increase the cost of our borrowings and, in turn, affect our results of operations.\nInflation may adversely affect the business, results of operations and financial condition of our portfolio companies.\nCertain of our portfolio companies may be impacted by inflation. If such portfolio companies are unable to pass any increases in their costs along to their customers, it could adversely affect their results and impact their ability to pay interest and principal on our loans. In addition, any projected future decreases in our portfolio companies\u2019 operating results due to inflation could adversely impact the fair value of those investments. Any decreases in the fair value of our investments could result in future unrealized losses and therefore reduce our net assets resulting from operations.\nOur investments in leveraged portfolio companies may be risky, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nInvestment in leveraged companies involves a number of significant risks. Leveraged companies in which we invest may have limited financial resources and may be unable to meet their obligations under their loans and debt securities that we hold. Such developments may be accompanied by deterioration in the value of any collateral and a reduction in the likelihood of our realizing any guarantees that we may have obtained in connection with our investment. Smaller leveraged companies also may have less predictable operating results and may require substantial additional capital to support their operations, finance their expansion or maintain their competitive position.\nOur portfolio companies may incur debt that ranks equally with, or senior to, our investments in such companies.\nOur portfolio companies may have, or may be permitted to incur, other debt that ranks equally with, or in some cases senior to, the debt in which we invest. By their terms, such debt instruments may entitle the holders to receive payment of interest or principal on or before the dates on which we are entitled to receive payments with respect to the debt instruments in which we invest. Also, in the event of insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or bankruptcy of a portfolio company, holders of debt instruments ranking senior to our investment in that portfolio company would typically be entitled to receive payment in full before we receive any distribution. After repaying such senior creditors, such portfolio company may not have sufficient remaining assets to repay its obligation to us. In the case of debt ranking equally with debt instruments in which we invest, we would have to share on an equal basis any distributions with other creditors holding such debt in the event of an insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or bankruptcy of the relevant portfolio company.\nSecond priority liens on collateral securing loans that we make to our portfolio companies may be subject to control by senior creditors with first priority liens. If there is a default, the value of the collateral may not be sufficient to repay in full both the first priority creditors and us.\nCertain loans that we make are secured by a second priority security interest in the same collateral pledged by a portfolio company to secure senior first lien debt owed by the portfolio company to commercial banks or other traditional lenders. Often the senior lender has procured covenants from the portfolio company prohibiting the incurrence of additional secured debt without the senior lender\u2019s consent. Prior to and as a condition of permitting the portfolio company to borrow money from us secured by the same collateral pledged to the senior lender, the senior lender will require assurances that it will control the disposition of any collateral in the event of bankruptcy or other default. In many such cases, the senior lender will require us to enter into an \u201cintercreditor agreement\u201d prior to permitting the portfolio company to borrow from us. Typically the intercreditor agreements we will be requested to expressly subordinate our debt instruments to those held by the senior lender and further provide that the senior lender shall control: (1) the commencement of foreclosure or other proceedings to liquidate and collect on the collateral; (2) the nature, timing and conduct of foreclosure or other collection proceedings; (3) the amendment of any collateral document; (4) the release of the security interests in respect of any collateral; and (5) the waiver of defaults under any security agreement. Because of the control we may cede to senior lenders under intercreditor agreements we may enter, we may be unable to realize the proceeds of any collateral securing some of our loans.\nIf we make subordinated investments, the obligors or the portfolio companies may not generate sufficient cash flow to service their debt obligations to us.\nWe may make subordinated investments that rank below other obligations of the obligor in right of payment. Subordinated investments are subject to greater risk of default than senior obligations as a result of adverse changes in the financial condition of the obligor or economic conditions in general. If we make a subordinated investment in a portfolio company, the portfolio company may be highly leveraged, and its relatively high debt-to-equity ratio may create increased risks that its operations might not generate sufficient cash flow to service all of its debt obligations.\nThe disposition of our investments may result in contingent liabilities.\nWe currently expect that substantially all of our investments will involve loans and private securities. In connection with the disposition of an investment in loans and private securities, we may be required to make representations about the business and financial affairs of the portfolio company typical of those made in connection with the sale of a business. We may also be required to indemnify the purchasers of such investment to the extent that any such representations turn out to be inaccurate or with respect to potential liabilities. These arrangements may result in contingent liabilities that ultimately result in funding obligations that we must satisfy through our return of distributions previously made to us.\nThere may be circumstances where our debt investments could be subordinated to claims of other creditors or we could be subject to lender liability claims.\nEven though we may have structured certain of our investments as secured loans, if one of our portfolio companies were to go bankrupt, depending on the facts and circumstances, and based upon principles of equitable subordination as defined by existing case law, a bankruptcy court could subordinate all or a portion of our claim to that of other creditors and transfer any lien securing such subordinated claim to the bankruptcy estate. The principles of equitable subordination defined by case law have generally indicated that a claim may be subordinated only if its holder is guilty of misconduct or where the senior loan is re-characterized as an equity investment and the senior lender has actually provided significant managerial assistance to the bankrupt debtor. We may also be subject to lender liability claims for actions taken by us with respect to a borrower\u2019s business or instances where we exercise control over the borrower. It is possible that we could become subject to a lender\u2019s liability claim, including as a result of actions taken in rendering significant managerial assistance or actions to compel and collect payments from the borrower outside the ordinary course of business.\nThe lack of liquidity in our investments may adversely affect our business.\nWe generally invest in companies whose securities are not publicly traded, and whose securities will be subject to legal and other restrictions on resale or will otherwise be less liquid than publicly traded securities. There is no established trading market for the securities in which we invest. The illiquidity of these investments may make it difficult for us to sell these investments when desired. In addition, if we are required to liquidate all or a portion of our portfolio quickly, we may realize significantly less than the value at which we had previously recorded these investments. As a result, we do not expect to achieve liquidity in our investments in the near-term. Further, we may face other restrictions on our ability to liquidate an investment in a portfolio company to the extent that we have material non-public information regarding such portfolio company.\nOur failure to make follow-on investments in our portfolio companies could impair the value of our portfolio.\nFollowing an initial investment in a portfolio company, we may make additional investments in that portfolio company as \u201cfollow-on\u201d investments, in order to: (1) increase or maintain in whole or in part our equity ownership percentage; (2) exercise warrants, options or convertible securities that were acquired in the original or a subsequent financing; or (3) attempt to preserve or enhance the value of our investment. We may elect not to make follow-on investments or otherwise lack sufficient funds to make those investments. We will have the discretion to make any follow-on investments, subject to the availability of capital resources. The failure to make follow-on investments may, in some circumstances, jeopardize the continued viability of a portfolio company and our initial investment, or may result in a missed opportunity for us to increase our participation in a successful operation. Even if we have sufficient capital to make a desired follow-on investment, we may elect not to make a follow-on investment because we do not want to increase our concentration of risk, we prefer other opportunities, we are subject to BDC requirements that would prevent such follow-on investments, or the follow-on investment would affect our qualification as a RIC.\nOur portfolio may lack diversification among portfolio companies which may subject us to a risk of significant loss if one or more of these companies default on its obligations under any of its debt instruments.\nOur portfolio holds a limited number of controlled affiliate portfolio companies. Beyond the asset diversification requirements associated with our qualification as a RIC under the Code, we do not have fixed guidelines for diversification, and our investments may be concentrated in relatively few companies. As our portfolio is less diversified than the portfolios of some larger funds, we are more susceptible to failure if a single loan fails. Similarly, the aggregate returns we realize may be significantly adversely affected if a small number of investments perform poorly or if we need to write down the value of any one investment.\nWe are a non-diversified investment company within the meaning of the 1940 Act, and therefore we may invest a significant portion of our assets in a relatively small number of issuers, which subjects us to a risk of significant loss if any of these\nissuers defaults on its obligations under any of its debt instruments or as a result of a downturn in the particular industry.\nWe are classified as a non-diversified investment company within the meaning of the 1940 Act, and therefore we may invest a significant portion of our assets in a relatively small number of issuers in a limited number of industries. As of December 31, 2021, our three largest investments, NMS, NTS and NBL equaled approximately 11%, 3% and 4%, respectively, of the fair value of our total assets. Beyond the asset diversification requirements associated with our qualification as a RIC, we do not have fixed guidelines for diversification, and while we are not targeting any specific industries, relatively few industries may become significantly represented among our investments. To the extent that we assume large positions in the securities of a small number of issuers, our net asset value may fluctuate to a greater extent than that of a diversified investment company as a result of changes in the financial condition or the market\u2019s assessment of the issuer, changes in fair value over time or a downturn in any particular industry. We may also be more susceptible to any single economic or regulatory occurrence than a diversified investment company.\nOur portfolio may be concentrated in a limited number of industries, which may subject us to a risk of significant loss if there is a downturn in a particular industry in which a number of our investments are concentrated.\nOur portfolio may be concentrated in a limited number of industries. A downturn in any particular industry in which we are invested could significantly impact the aggregate returns we realize. If an industry in which we have significant investments suffers from adverse business or economic conditions, as these industries have to varying degrees, a material portion of our investment portfolio could be affected adversely, which, in turn, could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.\nBecause we may not hold controlling equity interests in certain of our portfolio companies, we may not be in a position to exercise control over our portfolio companies or to prevent decisions by management of our portfolio companies that could decrease the value of our investments.\nWe do not currently hold controlling equity positions in the majority of our portfolio companies where our investments are in the form of debt, particularly SBA loans. As a result, we are subject to the risk that a portfolio company may make business decisions with which we disagree, and that the management and/or shareholders of a portfolio company may take risks or otherwise act in ways that are adverse to our interests. Due to the lack of liquidity of the debt and equity investments that we typically hold in our portfolio companies, we may not be able to dispose of our investments in the event we disagree with the actions of a portfolio company and may therefore suffer a decrease in the value of our investments.\nDefaults by our portfolio companies will harm our operating results.\nA portfolio company\u2019s failure to satisfy financial or operating covenants imposed by us or other lenders could lead to defaults and, potentially, termination of its loans and foreclosure on its secured assets, which could trigger cross-defaults under other agreements and jeopardize our portfolio company\u2019s ability to meet its obligations under the debt securities that we hold. We may incur expenses to the extent necessary to seek recovery upon default or to negotiate new terms with a defaulting portfolio company. Any extension or restructuring of our loans could adversely affect our cash flows. In addition, if one of our portfolio companies were to go bankrupt, even though we may have structured our interest as senior debt, depending on the facts and circumstances, including the extent to which we actually provided managerial assistance to that portfolio company, a bankruptcy court might recharacterize our debt holding and subordinate all or a portion of our claim to that of other creditors. If any of these occur, it could materially and adversely affect our operating results and cash flows. For example, the Company closed on its $5.4 million investment in ADR Partners, LLC dba banc-serv Partners, LLC (\u201cBSP\u201d) in June 2016. Subsequently, as previously disclosed, the Company invested $1.7 million in additional capital and recorded $7.1 million in unrealized losses on the BSP investment to write down the fair value of the investment to $0.0 by June 30, 2019. The BSP investment resulted in protracted litigation with Kerri Agee, the former owner and President of BSP, who filed for bankruptcy and was indicted in 2019 for, and convicted in 2021 of, defrauding the SBA. The Agee litigation concluded with Newtek Business Services Holdco 5, Inc. (\u201cHoldco 5\u201d), a Company subsidiary, obtaining a nondischargeable judgment against Agee in the amount of $6.2 million in January 2022. Holdco 5 intends to vigorously pursue all of its rights relating to this matter, though there can be no assurances of the possibility of recovering some or substantially all of the assets referred to in the judgement. HoldCo 5 has not recorded any gain contingency relating to this litigation.\nIf we and our portfolio companies are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, our business and prospects could be harmed, and if we and our portfolio companies are required to devote significant resources to protecting their intellectual property rights, the value of our investment could be reduced.\nThe proprietary software essential to our business and that of our controlled portfolio companies is owned by us and made available to them for their use. Our future success and competitive position will depend in part upon our ability to maintain and protect proprietary technology used in our products and services. We will rely, in part, on patent, trade secret and trademark law to protect that technology, but competitors may misappropriate our intellectual property, and disputes as to ownership of intellectual property may arise. We may, from time to time, be required to institute litigation to enforce the patents, copyrights or other intellectual property rights, protect trade secrets, determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or defend against claims of infringement. Such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources.\nPrepayments of our debt investments by our portfolio companies could adversely impact our results of operations and reduce our return on equity.\nWe will be subject to the risk that the investments we make in our portfolio companies may be repaid prior to maturity; most of our SBA loans do not carry prepayment penalties. When this occurs, we will generally reinvest these proceeds in temporary investments or repay outstanding debt, depending on future investment in new portfolio companies. Temporary investments will typically have substantially lower yields than the debt being prepaid and we could experience significant delays in reinvesting these amounts. Any future investment in a new portfolio company may also be at lower yields than the debt that was repaid. As a result, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected if one or more of our portfolio companies elect to prepay amounts owed to us. Additionally, prepayments could negatively impact our return on equity, which could result in a decline in the market price of our securities.\nWe may not realize gains from our equity investments.\nCertain investments that we may make in the future include warrants or other equity securities. Investments in equity securities involve a number of significant risks, including the risk of further dilution as a result of additional issuances, inability to access additional capital and failure to pay current distributions. Investments in preferred securities involve special risks, such as the risk of deferred distributions, credit risk, illiquidity and limited voting rights. In addition, we may from time to time make non-control, equity investments in portfolio companies. Our goal is ultimately to realize gains upon our disposition of such equity interests. However, the equity interests we receive may not appreciate in value and, in fact, may decline in value. Accordingly, we may not be able to realize gains from our equity interests, and any gains that we do realize on the disposition of any equity interests may not be sufficient to offset any other losses we experience.\nWe also may be unable to realize any value if a portfolio company does not have a liquidity event, such as a sale of the business, recapitalization or public offering, which would allow us to sell the underlying equity interests. We will often seek puts or similar rights to give us the right to sell our equity securities back to the portfolio company issuer. We may be unable to exercise these puts rights for the consideration provided in our investment documents if the issuer is in financial distress.\nAn increase in non-accrual assets would reduce our income and increase our expenses.\nIf our level of non-accrual assets in our SBA lending business rises in the future, it could adversely affect our investment income and earnings. Non-accrual assets are primarily loans on which borrowers are not making their required payments. Non-accrual assets also include loans that have been restructured to permit the borrower to have smaller payments and real estate that has been acquired through foreclosure of unpaid loans. To the extent that our financial assets are non-accrual, we will have less cash available for lending and other activities.\nIf the assets securing the loans that we make decrease in value, then we may lack sufficient collateral to cover losses.\nTo attempt to mitigate credit risks, we will typically take a security interest in the available assets of our portfolio companies. There is no assurance that we will obtain or properly perfect our liens. There is a risk that the collateral securing our loans may decrease in value over time, may be difficult to sell in a timely manner, may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value based upon the success of the business and market conditions, including as a result of the inability of a portfolio company to raise additional capital. In some circumstances, our lien could be subordinated to claims of other creditors. Consequently, the fact that a loan is secured does not guarantee that we will receive principal and interest payments according to the loan\u2019s terms, or that we will be able to collect on the loan should we be forced to enforce our remedies.\nIn addition, because we may invest in technology-related companies, a substantial portion of the assets securing our investment may be in the form of intellectual property, if any, inventory and equipment and, to a lesser extent, cash and accounts receivable. Intellectual property, if any, that is securing our loan could lose value if, among other things, the company\u2019s rights to the intellectual property are challenged or if the company\u2019s license to the intellectual property is revoked or expires, the technology fails to achieve its intended results or a new technology makes the intellectual property functionally obsolete. Inventory may not be adequate to secure our loan if our valuation of the inventory at the time that we made the loan was not accurate or if there is a reduction in the demand for the inventory.\nSimilarly, any equipment securing our loan may not provide us with the anticipated security if there are changes in technology or advances in new equipment that render the particular equipment obsolete or of limited value, or if the company fails to adequately maintain or repair the equipment. Any one or more of the preceding factors could materially impair our ability to recover principal in a foreclosure.\nThe Company is a Guarantor on a number of credit facilities entered into by certain of its subsidiaries and controlled portfolio companies\nAs discussed further herein, the Company is a guarantor on credit facilities entered into by NSBF, NBL, NMS and NBC with various lenders. If any of these borrowers default on these lines of credit, we would be required to make payments under the guarantees, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may expose ourselves to risks as we engage in hedging transactions.\nIn the second half of 2021, the Company began using derivatives to hedge interest rate exposure on specific fixed rate loans originated by the Company or its portfolio companies until such fixed rate loans are sold or securitized. We may continue to enter into such hedging transactions in an effort to mitigate our exposure to adverse fluctuations in interest rates and we may increase our floating rate investments to position the portfolio for rate increases. However, we cannot assure you that such transactions will be successful in mitigating our exposure to interest rate risk or if we will continue to enter into such interest rate hedges. Hedging transactions may also limit our ability to participate in the benefits of lower interest rates with respect to our portfolio investment. Moreover, as we engage in hedging transactions, we expose ourselves to certain risks associated with such transactions. We may utilize instruments such as forward contracts, currency options and interest rate swaps, caps, collars and floors to seek to hedge against fluctuations in the relative values of certain of our portfolio positions from changes in market interest rates. Hedging against a decline in the values of our portfolio positions does not eliminate the possibility of fluctuations in the values of such positions or prevent losses if the values of such positions decline. However, such hedging can establish other positions designed to gain from those same developments, thereby offsetting the decline in the value of such portfolio positions. Such hedging transactions may also limit the opportunity for gain if the values of the underlying portfolio positions increase. It may not be possible to hedge against an exchange rate or interest rate fluctuation that is so generally anticipated that we are not able to enter into a hedging transaction at an acceptable price. Moreover, for a variety of reasons, we may not seek to establish a perfect correlation between such hedging instruments and the portfolio holdings being hedged. Any such imperfect correlation may prevent us from achieving the intended hedge and expose us to risk of loss. In addition, it may not be possible to hedge fully or perfectly against interest rate fluctuations affecting the value of securities in our portfolio.\nOur ability to enter into transactions involving derivatives and financial commitment transactions may be limited.\nIn November 2020, the SEC adopted new rules regarding the ability of a BDC (or a registered investment company) to use derivatives and other transactions that create future payment or delivery obligations. BDCs that use derivatives would be subject to a value-at-risk leverage limit, certain other derivatives risk management program and testing requirements and requirements related to board reporting. These new requirements would apply unless the BDC qualified as a \u201climited derivatives user,\u201d as defined in the SEC\u2019s adopted rules. A BDC that enters into reverse repurchase agreements or similar financing transactions would need to aggregate the amount of indebtedness associated with the reverse repurchase agreements or similar financing transactions could either (i) comply with the asset coverage requirements of the Section 18 of the 1940 Act when engaging in reverse repurchase agreements or (ii) choose to treat such agreements as derivative transactions under the adopted rule. Under the adopted rule, a BDC may enter into an unfunded commitment agreement that is not a derivatives transaction, such as an agreement to provide financing to a portfolio company, if the BDC has a reasonable belief, at the time it enters into such an agreement, that it will have sufficient cash and cash equivalents to meet its obligations with respect to all of its unfunded commitment agreements, in each case as it becomes due. If the BDC cannot meet this test, it is required to treat unfunded commitments as a derivatives transaction subject to the requirements of the rule. Collectively, these requirements may limit our ability to use derivatives and/or enter into certain other financial contracts. In June 2021, the Company adopted a Policy and Procedure for Use of Derivatives which it believes conforms to the new SEC rules.\nTo the extent we borrow money to finance our investments, changes in interest rates will affect our cost of capital and net\ninvestment income.\nTo the extent we borrow money to finance investments, our net investment income will depend, in part, upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we invest those funds. As a result, we can offer no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income in the event we borrow money to finance our investments. In periods of rising interest rates, our cost of funds would increase, which could reduce our net investment income. We expect that our long-term fixed-rate investments will be financed primarily with equity and/or long-term debt. We may use interest rate risk management techniques in an effort to limit our exposure to interest rate fluctuations. Such techniques may include various interest rate hedging activities to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act. If we do not implement these techniques properly, we could experience losses on our hedging positions, which could be material. In addition, depending on the frequency and magnitude of rising interest rates, these interest rate increases could negatively impact premiums received on the sale of guaranteed SBA loans, and further, could increase prepayment speeds on outstanding SBA loans, potentially negatively impacting the Company\u2019s financial results.\nWe cannot predict how new tax legislation will affect us, our investments, or our stockholders, and any such legislation could adversely affect our business.\nLegislative or other actions relating to taxes could have a negative effect on us. The rules dealing with U.S. federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the Internal Revenue Service and the U.S. Treasury Department. The Biden Administration has proposed significant changes to the existing U.S. tax rules, and there are a number of proposals in Congress that would similarly modify the existing U.S. tax rules. The likelihood of any such legislation being enacted is uncertain, but new legislation and any U.S. Treasury regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions interpreting such legislation could significantly and negatively affect our ability to qualify for tax treatment as a RIC or the U.S. federal income tax consequences to us and our investors of such qualification, or could have other adverse consequences. Investors are urged to consult with their tax advisor regarding tax legislative, regulatory, or administrative developments and proposals and their potential effect on an investment in our common stock.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR CONTROLLED PORTFOLIO COMPANIES - NEWTEK MERCHANT SOLUTIONS (NMS)\nWe could be adversely affected if either of NMS\u2019 two bank sponsorships is terminated.\nBecause NMS is not a bank, it is unable to belong to and directly access the Visa\u00ae and MasterCard\u00ae bankcard associations. The Visa\u00ae and MasterCard\u00ae operating regulations require NMS to be sponsored by a bank in order to process bankcard transactions. A bank sponsorship is an agreement under which a financial institution that has a membership with MasterCard\u00ae, Visa\u00ae or American Express sponsors an independent sales organization, like NMS, that markets credit card processing services to merchants who accept credit cards as a form of payment, gains access to the Visa\u00ae, MasterCard\u00ae, and American Express networks. NMS is currently sponsored by two banks. If either of the sponsorships is terminated, and NMS is not able to secure or transfer the respective merchant portfolio to a new bank sponsor or sponsors, the business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the electronic payment processing business could be materially adversely affected. If both the sponsorships are terminated and NMS is unable to secure a bank sponsor for the merchant portfolios, it will not be able to process bankcard transactions for the affected portfolios. Consequently, the loss of both of NMS\u2019 sponsorships would have a material adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, NMS\u2019 agreements with sponsoring banks gives the sponsoring banks substantial discretion in approving certain elements of its business practices, including its solicitation, application and qualification procedures for merchants, the terms of their agreements with merchants, the processing fees that they charge, their customer service levels and its use of independent sales organizations and independent sales agents. We cannot guarantee that NMS\u2019 sponsoring banks\u2019 actions under these agreements would not be detrimental to us.\nOther service providers, some of whom are NMS\u2019 competitors, are necessary for the conduct of NMS\u2019 business. The termination by service providers of these arrangements with NMS or their failure to perform these services efficiently and effectively may adversely affect NMS\u2019 relationships with the merchants whose accounts it serves and may cause those merchants to terminate their processing agreements with NMS.\nIf NMS or its processors or bank sponsors fail to adhere to the standards of the Visa\u00ae and MasterCard\u00ae bankcard associations, its registrations with these associations could be terminated and it could be required to stop providing payment processing services for Visa\u00ae and MasterCard\u00ae.\nSubstantially all of the transactions NMS processes involve Visa\u00ae or MasterCard\u00ae. If NMS, its bank sponsors or its processors fail to comply with the applicable requirements of the Visa\u00ae and MasterCard\u00ae bankcard associations, Visa\u00ae or MasterCard\u00ae could suspend or terminate its registration. The termination of NMS\u2019 registration or any changes in the Visa\u00ae or MasterCard\u00ae rules that would impair its registration could require it to stop providing payment processing services, which would have a material adverse effect on its business and could be detrimental to us.\nOn occasion, NMS experiences increases in interchange and sponsorship fees. If it cannot pass along these increases to its merchants, its profit margins will be reduced.\nNMS pays interchange fees or assessments to bankcard associations for each transaction it processes using their credit, debit and gift cards. From time to time, the bankcard associations increase the interchange fees that they charge processors and the sponsoring banks, which generally pass on such increases to NMS. From time to time, the sponsoring banks increase their fees as well. If NMS is not able to pass these fee increases along to merchants through corresponding increases in its processing fees, its profit margins in this line of business will be reduced.\nUnauthorized disclosure of merchant or cardholder data, whether through breach of our computer systems or otherwise, could expose us to liability and business losses.\nThrough NMS, we collect and store sensitive data about merchants and cardholders, and we maintain a database of cardholder data relating to specific transactions, including payment, card numbers and cardholder addresses, in order to process the transactions and for fraud prevention and other internal processes. If anyone penetrates our network security or otherwise misappropriates sensitive merchant or cardholder data, we could be subject to liability or business interruption. While we subject these systems to periodic independent testing and review, we cannot guarantee that our systems will not be penetrated in the future. If a breach of our system occurs, we may be subject to liability, including claims for unauthorized purchases with misappropriated card information, impersonation or other similar fraud claims. Similar risks exist with regard to the storage and transmission of such data by our processors. In the event of any such a breach, we may also be subject to a class action lawsuit. SMBs are less prepared for the complexities of safeguarding cardholder data than their larger counterparts. In the event of noncompliance by a customer of card industry rules, we could face fines from payment card networks. There can be no assurance that we would be able to recover any such fines from such customer.\nNMS is liable if its processing merchants refuse or cannot reimburse charge-backs resolved in favor of their customers.\nIf a billing dispute between a merchant and a cardholder is not ultimately resolved in favor of the merchant, the disputed transaction is \u201ccharged back\u201d to the merchant\u2019s bank and credited to the account of the cardholder. If NMS or its processing banks are unable to collect the charge-back from the merchant\u2019s account, or if the merchant refuses or is financially unable due to bankruptcy or other reasons to reimburse the merchant\u2019s bank for the charge-back, NMS must bear the loss for the amount of the refund paid to the cardholder\u2019s bank. Most of NMS\u2019 merchants deliver products or services when purchased, so a contingent liability for charge-backs is unlikely to arise, and credits are issued on returned items. However, some of its merchants do not provide services until sometime after a purchase, which increases the potential for contingent liability and future charge-backs. NMS and the sponsoring bank can require that merchants maintain cash reserves under its control to cover charge-back liabilities but such reserves may not be sufficient to cover the liability or may not even be available to them in the event of a bankruptcy or other legal action.\nNMS has potential liability for customer or merchant fraud.\nCredit card fraud occurs when a merchant\u2019s customer uses a stolen card (or a stolen card number in a card-not-present transaction) to purchase merchandise or services. In a traditional card-present transaction, if the merchant swipes the card, receives authorization for the transaction from the card issuing bank and verifies the signature on the back of the card against the paper receipt signed by the customer, the card issuing bank remains liable for any loss. In a fraudulent card-not-present transaction, even if the merchant receives authorization for the transaction, the merchant is liable for any loss arising from the transaction. Many NMS customers are small and transact a substantial percentage of their sales over the Internet or by telephone or mail orders. Because their sales are card-not-present transactions, these merchants are more vulnerable to customer fraud than larger merchants, and NMS could experience charge-backs arising from cardholder fraud more frequently with these merchants.\nMerchant fraud occurs when a merchant, rather than a customer, knowingly uses a stolen or counterfeit card or card number to record a false sales transaction or intentionally fails to deliver the merchandise or services sold in an otherwise valid transaction. Anytime a merchant is unable to satisfy a charge-back, NMS is ultimately responsible for that charge-back unless it has required that a cash reserve be established. We cannot assure that the systems and procedures NMS has established to detect and reduce the impact of merchant fraud are or will be effective. Failure to effectively manage risk and prevent fraud could increase NMS charge-back liability and adversely affect its results of operations.\nNMS payment processing systems may fail due to factors beyond its control, which could interrupt its business or cause it to lose business and likely increase costs.\nNMS depends on the uninterrupted operations of our computer network systems, software and our processors\u2019 data centers. Defects in these systems or damage to them due to factors beyond its control could cause severe disruption to NMS\u2019 business and other material adverse effects on its payment processing businesses.\nThe electronic payment processing business is undergoing very rapid technological changes which may make it difficult or impossible for NMS to compete effectively.\nThe introduction of new technologies, primarily mobile payment capabilities, and the entry into the payment processing market of new competitors, Apple, Inc., for example, could dramatically change the competitive environment and require significant changes and costs for NMS to remain competitive. There is no assurance that NMS will have the capability to stay competitive with such changes.\nNMS and others in the payment processing industry have come under increasing pressures from various regulatory agencies seeking to use the leverage of the payment processing business to limit or modify the practices of merchants which could lead to increased costs.\nVarious agencies, particularly the Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d), have within the past few years attempted to pressure merchants to discontinue or modify various sales or other practices. As a part of the payment processing industry, processors such as NMS could experience pressure and/or litigation aimed at restricting access to credit card sales by such merchants. These efforts could cause an increase in the cost to NMS of doing business or otherwise make its business less profitable and may subject NMS to assess penalties for not taking actions deemed sufficiently aggressive to limit such practices. As a result of a litigation brought by the FTC in October 2012, NMS voluntarily entered into, and is presently operating under, a permanent injunction with respect to certain of its business practices.\nIncreased regulatory focus on the payments industry may result in costly new compliance burdens on NMS\u2019 clients and on NMS itself, leading to increased costs and decreased payments volume and revenues.\nRegulation of the payments industry has increased significantly in recent years. Complying with these and other regulations increases costs and can reduce revenue opportunities. Similarly, the impact of such regulations on clients may reduce the volume of payments processed. Moreover, such regulations can limit the types of products and services that are offered. Any of these occurrences can materially and adversely affect NMS\u2019 business, prospects for future growth, financial condition and results of operations.\nExamples include:\n\u2022Data Protection and Information Security. Aspects of NMS\u2019 operations and business are subject to privacy and data protection regulation. NMS\u2019 financial institution clients are subject to similar requirements under the guidelines issued by the federal banking agencies. In addition, many individual states have enacted legislation requiring consumer notification in the event of a security breach.\n\u2022Anti-Money Laundering and Anti-Terrorism Financing. The U.S.A. PATRIOT Act requires NMS to maintain an anti-money laundering program. Sanctions imposed by the U.S. Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC, restrict NMS from dealing with certain parties considered to be connected with money laundering, terrorism or narcotics. NMS has controls in place designed to ensure OFAC compliance, but if those controls should fail, it could be subject to penalties, reputational damage and loss of business.\n\u2022Money Transfer Regulations. As NMS expands its product offerings, it may become subject to money transfer regulations, increasing regulatory oversight and costs of compliance.\n\u2022Formal Investigation. If NMS is suspected of violating government statutes, such as the Federal Trade Commission Act or the Telemarketing and Consumer Fraud and Abuse Prevention Act, governmental agencies may formally investigate NMS. As a result of such a formal investigation, criminal or civil charges could be filed against NMS and it could be required to pay significant fines or penalties in connection with such investigation or other governmental investigations. Any criminal or civil charges by a governmental agency, including any fines or penalties, could materially harm NMS\u2019 business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Currently, NMS is operating under an order for injunctive relief it voluntarily entered into with the Federal Trade Commission.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR CONTROLLED PORTFOLIO COMPANIES - NEWTEK TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS (NTS)\nNTS operates in a highly competitive industry in which technological change can be rapid.\nThe information technology business and its related technology involve a broad range of rapidly changing technologies. NTS equipment and the technologies on which it is based may not remain competitive over time, and others may develop superior technologies that render its products non-competitive, without significant additional capital expenditures. Some of NTS\u2019 competitors are significantly larger and have substantially greater market presence as well as greater financial, technical, operational, marketing and other resources and experience than NTS. In the event that such a competitor expends significant sales and marketing resources in one or several markets, NTS may not be able to compete successfully in such markets. We believe that competition will continue to increase, placing downward pressure on prices. Such pressure could adversely affect NTS gross margins if it is not able to reduce its costs commensurate with such price reductions. There can be no assurances that NTS will remain competitive.\nNTS\u2019 technology solutions business depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of its computer and communications hardware systems and infrastructure.\nDespite precautions taken by NTS against possible failure of its systems, interruptions could result from natural disasters, power loss, the inability to acquire fuel for its backup generators, telecommunications failure, terrorist attacks and similar events. NTS also leases telecommunications lines from local, regional and national carriers whose service may be interrupted. NTS\u2019 business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed by any damage or failure that interrupts or delays its operations. There can be no assurance that NTS\u2019 insurance will cover all of the losses or compensate NTS for the possible loss of clients occurring during any period that NTS is unable to provide service.\nNTS\u2019 inability to maintain the integrity of its infrastructure and the privacy of confidential information would materially affect its business.\nThe NTS infrastructure is potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, viruses or similar problems. If its security measures are circumvented, it could jeopardize the security of confidential information stored on NTS\u2019 systems, misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions in NTS\u2019 operations. We may be required to make significant additional investments and efforts to protect against or remedy security breaches. Security breaches that result in access to confidential information could damage our reputation and expose us to a risk of loss or liability. The security services that NTS offers in connection with customers\u2019 networks cannot assure complete protection from computer viruses, break-ins and other disruptive problems. The occurrence of these problems may result in claims against NTS or us or liability on our part. These claims, regardless of their ultimate outcome, could result in costly litigation and could harm our business and reputation and impair NTS\u2019 ability to attract and retain customers.\nNTS could be adversely affected by information security breaches or cyber security attacks.\nNTS\u2019 web and cloud services involve the storage and transmission of our customers\u2019, employees\u2019, and portfolio companies\u2019 proprietary information. NTS\u2019 business relies on its digital technologies, computer and email systems, software, and networks to conduct its operations. NTS\u2019 technologies, systems and networks may become the target of criminal cyber-attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of confidential, proprietary and other information of NTS or third parties with whom NTS deals, or otherwise disrupt our or our customers\u2019 or other third parties\u2019 business operations. It is critical to NTS\u2019 business strategy that its facilities and infrastructure remain secure and are perceived by the marketplace to be secure. Although NTS believes it employs appropriate security technologies, NTS cannot guarantee that the security technologies (including data encryption processes, intrusion detection systems) it employs or, the comprehensive risk assessments it conducts, or its other internal control procedures will assure the security of its customers\u2019 data. If NTS\u2019 security measures are breached as a result of third-party action, employee error or\notherwise, and as a result, its customers\u2019 data becomes available to unauthorized parties, NTS and our other portfolio companies could incur liability and its reputation would be damaged, which could lead to the loss of current and potential customers. In addition, NTS will be required to expend significant capital and other resources to detect, remedy, protect against or alleviate breaches of its network and security, and it may not be able to remedy these problems in a timely manner, or at all. Because techniques used by outsiders to obtain unauthorized network access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, NTS may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. For example, in early 2018 following an unauthorized third party misappropriating three of NTS\u2019 domain names, NTS\u2019 management and forensic investigators determined that attackers compromised a portion of its shared webhosting system, and may have acquired certain customer information limited to its shared webhosting customers, and/or gained access to certain of its shared webhosting servers. In response, NTS took a range of steps designed to further secure its systems, enhance its security protections, enhance access controls, and prevent future unauthorized activity. For more information on risks relating to cybersecurity, see \u201cRisks Related to Cybersecurity.\u201d\nNTS\u2019 business depends on Microsoft Corporation and others for the licenses to use software as well as other intellectual property in the managed technology solutions business.\nNTS\u2019 managed technology business is built on technological platforms relying on the Microsoft Windows\u00ae products and other intellectual property that NTS currently licenses. As a result, if NTS is unable to continue to have the benefit of those licensing arrangements or if the products upon which its platform is built become obsolete, its business could be materially and adversely affected.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR CONTROLLED PORTFOLIO COMPANIES - NEWTEK INSURANCE AGENCY (NIA)\nNIA depends on third parties, particularly property and casualty insurance companies, to supply the products marketed by its agents.\nNIA contracts with property and casualty insurance companies typically provide that the contracts can be terminated by the supplier without cause. NIA\u2019s inability to enter into satisfactory arrangements with these suppliers or the loss of these relationships for any reason would adversely affect the results of its insurance business. Also, NIA\u2019s inability to obtain these products at competitive prices could make it difficult for it to compete with larger and better capitalized providers of such insurance services.\nIf NIA fails to comply with government regulations, its insurance agency business would be adversely affected.\nNIA insurance agency business is subject to comprehensive regulation in the various states in which it conducts business. NIA\u2019s success will depend in part upon its ability to satisfy these regulations and to obtain and maintain all required licenses and permits. NIA\u2019s failure to comply with any statutes and regulations could have a material adverse effect on it. Furthermore, the adoption of additional statutes and regulations, changes in the interpretation and enforcement of current statutes and regulations could have a material adverse effect on it.\nNIA does not have any control over the commissions it earns on the sale of insurance products which are based on premiums and commission rates set by insurers and the conditions prevalent in the insurance market.\nNIA earns commissions on the sale of insurance products. Commission rates and premiums can change based on the prevailing economic and competitive factors that affect insurance underwriters. In addition, the insurance industry has been characterized by periods of intense price competition due to excessive underwriting capacity and periods of favorable premium levels due to shortages of capacity. We cannot predict the timing or extent of future changes in commission rates or premiums or the effect any of these changes will have on the operations of NIA.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR CONTROLLED PORTFOLIO COMPANIES - NEWTEK PAYROLL AND BENEFIT SOLUTIONS (NPS)\nUnauthorized disclosure of employee data, whether through a cyber-security breach of our computer systems or otherwise, could expose NPS to liability and business losses.\nNPS collects and stores sensitive data about individuals in order to process the transactions and for other internal processes. If anyone penetrates its network security or the security of the third-party payroll processing platform in utilizes, or otherwise misappropriates sensitive individual data, NPS could be subject to liability or business interruption. NPS is subject to laws and rules issued by different agencies concerning safeguarding and maintaining the confidentiality of this information. Its activities have been, and will continue to be, subject to an increasing risk of cyber-attacks, the nature of which is continually evolving. Cyber-security risks include unauthorized access to privileged and sensitive customer information, including passwords and account information of NPS\u2019 customers. While it subjects its data systems to periodic independent testing and review, NPS cannot guarantee that its systems or the systems of the third-party payroll processing platform in utilizes will not be penetrated in the future. Experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate NPS\u2019 network security or the security of its third-party payroll processing platform, and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information, create system disruptions, or cause shutdowns. As a result, NPS\u2019 customers\u2019 information may be lost, disclosed, accessed or taken without its customers\u2019 consent. If a breach of these systems occurs, NPS may be subject to liability, including claims for impersonation or other similar fraud claims. In the event of any such breach, NPS may also be subject to a class action lawsuit. Any significant violations of data privacy could result in the loss of business, litigation and regulatory investigations and penalties that could damage NPS\u2019 reputation, and the growth of its business could be adversely affected. For more information on risks relating to cybersecurity, see \u201cRisks Related to Cybersecurity.\u201d\nNPS is subject to risks surrounding Automated Clearing House (\u201cACH\u201d) payments.\nCredit risk in ACH payments arises when a party to a contract fails to deposit funds required to settle the contract. This can occur if a client of NPS suffers losses, enters into bankruptcy or defrauds NPS. In such an event, NPS could bear the financial burden of settling the customer\u2019s contract.\nNPS\u2019 systems may be subject to disruptions that could adversely affect its business and reputation.\nNPS\u2019 payroll business relies heavily on its payroll, financial, accounting and other data processing systems. If any of these systems or any of the vendors which supply them fails to operate properly or becomes disabled even for a brief period of time, NPS could suffer financial loss, a disruption of its business, liability to clients, regulatory intervention or damage to its reputation. NPS has disaster recovery plans in place to protect its businesses against natural disasters, security breaches, military or terrorist actions, power or communication failures or similar events. Despite NPS\u2019 preparations, its disaster recovery plans may not be successful in preventing the loss of client data, service interruptions, and disruptions to its operations or damage to its important facilities.\nIf NPS fails to adapt its technology to meet client needs and preferences, the demand for its services may diminish.\nNPS operates in industries that are subject to rapid technological advances and changing client needs and preferences. In order to remain competitive and responsive to client demands, NPS continually upgrades, enhances and expands its existing solutions and services. If NPS fails to respond successfully to technological challenges, the demand for its services may diminish.\nNPS could incur unreimbursed costs or damages due to delays in processing inherent in the banking system.\nNPS generally determines the availability of customer (employer) funds prior to making payments to employees or taxing authorities, and such employer funds are generally transferred in to its accounts prior to making payments out. Due to the structure of the banking system however, there are times when NPS may make payroll or tax payments and not immediately receive the funds to do so from the employer. There can be no assurance that the procedures NPS has in place to prevent these occurrences or mitigate the damages will be sufficient to prevent loss to its business. In addition, NPS could incur unreimbursed costs or damages due to delays in processing customer payrolls or payroll taxes in a timely manner.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR CONTROLLED PORTFOLIO COMPANIES - NEWTEK BUSINESS CREDIT SOLUTIONS (NBC)\nAn unexpected level of defaults in NBC\u2019s accounts receivables or inventory portfolios would reduce its income and increase its expenses.\nIf NBC\u2019s level of non-accrual assets in its receivable financing or inventory financing business rises in the future, it could adversely affect its revenue, earnings and cash flow. Non-accrual assets primarily consist of receivables for which the customer has not made timely payment. In certain situations, NBC may restructure the receivable to permit such a customer to have smaller payments over a longer period of time. Such a restructuring or non-payment by a receivables or inventory customer will result in lower revenue and less cash available for NBC\u2019 operational activities.\nNBC\u2019s reserve for credit losses may not be sufficient to cover unexpected losses.\nNBC\u2019s business depends on the behavior of its customers. In addition to its credit practices and procedures, NBC maintains a reserve for credit losses on its accounts receivable and inventory portfolios, which it has judged to be adequate given the receivables it purchases. NBC periodically reviews its reserve for adequacy considering current economic conditions and trends, charge-off experience and levels of non-accrual assets, and adjusts its reserve accordingly. However, because of recent unstable economic conditions, its reserves may prove inadequate, which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations.\nNBC depends on outside financing to support its receivables financing and inventory financing business.\nNBC\u2019s receivables and inventory financing business depends on outside financing to support its acquisition of receivables. Termination of the credit lines for any reason would have a material adverse effect on its business, including but not limited to, the liquidation of its receivables portfolios to pay down the lines. If funds from such sale were insufficient to completely pay down the line of credit, NBC\u2019s would be responsible for any short fall. We are a guarantor on the Sterling Receivable and Inventory Facility at NBC. Maximum borrowings under the Sterling Receivable and Inventory Facility are $35.0 million. The Sterling Receivable and Inventory Facility matures in August 2022 and automatically renews annually. At December 31, 2021, total principal owed by NBC was $7.6 million.\nWe have guaranteed NBC\u2019s obligations under this facility. If NBC defaults on this line of credit, we would be required to make payments under the guarantee, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, if NBC loses this line of credit and NBC is unable to renew or replace this line of credit, it would materially impact the business of NBC and have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations.\nLEGAL PROCEEDINGS - PORTFOLIO COMPANIES\nOur portfolio companies may, from time to time, be involved in various legal matters, which may have an adverse effect on their operations and/or financial condition.\nFrom time to time, we may be subject to legal actions as well as various regulatory, governmental and law enforcement inquiries, investigations and subpoenas. In any such claims or actions, demands for substantial monetary damages may be asserted against our portfolio companies and may result in financial liability for us or an adverse effect on our reputation among investors. We may be unable to accurately estimate our portfolio companies\u2019 exposure to litigation risk. In regulatory enforcement matters, claims for disgorgement, the imposition of penalties, and the imposition of other remedial sanctions against our portfolio companies are possible, and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nFor example, the Company closed on its $5.4 million investment in ADR Partners, LLC dba banc-serv Partners, LLC (\u201cBSP\u201d) in June 2016. Subsequently, as previously disclosed, the Company invested $1.7 million in additional capital and recorded $7.1 million in unrealized losses on the BSP investment to write down the fair value of the investment to $0.0 by June 30, 2019. The BSP investment resulted in protracted litigation with Kerri Agee, the former owner and President of BSP, who filed for bankruptcy and was indicted in 2019 for, and convicted in 2021 of, defrauding the SBA. The Agee litigation concluded with Newtek Business Services Holdco 5, Inc. (\u201cHoldco 5\u201d), a Company subsidiary, obtaining a nondischargeable judgment against Agee in the amount of $6.2 million in January 2022. Holdco 5 intends to vigorously pursue all of its rights relating to this matter, though there can be no assurances of the possibility of recovering some or substantially all of the assets referred to in the judgement. HoldCo 5 has not recorded any gain contingency relating to this litigation.\nAdditionally, as a result of a litigation brought by the FTC in October 2012, NMS voluntarily entered into, and is presently operating under, a permanent injunction with respect to certain of its business practices.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR CAPCO BUSINESS\nThe Capco programs and the tax credits they provide are created by state legislation and implemented through regulation, and such laws and rules are subject to possible action to repeal or retroactively revise the programs for political, economic or other reasons. Such an attempted repeal or revision would create substantial difficulty for the Capco programs and could, if ultimately successful, cause us material financial harm.\nThe tax credits associated with the Capco programs and provided to our Capcos\u2019 investors are to be utilized by the investors over a period of time, which is typically ten years. Much can change during such a period and it is possible that one or more states may revise or eliminate the tax credits. Any such revision or repeal could have a material adverse economic impact on our Capcos, either directly or as a result of the Capco\u2019s insurer\u2019s actions. Any such final state action that jeopardizes the tax credits could result in the provider of our Capco insurance assuming partial or full control of the particular Capco in order to minimize its liability under the Capco insurance policies issued to our investors.\nBecause our Capcos are subject to requirements under state law, a failure of any of them to meet these requirements could subject the Capco and our shareholders to the loss of one or more Capcos.\nDespite the fact that we have met all applicable minimum requirements of the Capco programs in which we still participate, each Capco remains subject to state regulation until it has invested 100% of its funds and otherwise remains in full legal compliance. There can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to do so. A major regulatory violation, while not fatal to our Capco business, would materially increase the cost of operating the Capcos.\nWe know of no other publicly-held company that sponsors and operates Capcos as a part of its business. As such, there are, to our knowledge, no other companies against which investors may compare our Capco business and its operations, results of operations and financial and accounting structures.\nIn the absence of any meaningful peer group comparisons for our Capco business, investors may have a difficult time understanding and judging the strength of our business. This, in turn, may have a depressing effect on the value of our stock.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR SECURITIES\nAs of December 31, 2021, our CEO beneficially owns and has shared voting power over approximately 4.8% of our common stock, and may be able to exercise significant influence over the outcome of most shareholder actions.\nBecause of his ownership of and shared voting power over our stock, Barry Sloane, our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President, may be able to exercise significant influence over actions requiring shareholder approval, including the election of directors, the adoption of amendments to the certificate of incorporation, approval of stock incentive plans and approval of major transactions such as a merger or sale of assets. This could delay or prevent a change in control of the Company, deprive our shareholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a change in control and have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock.\nOur common stock price may be volatile and may decrease substantially.\nThe trading price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially. The price of our common stock may be higher or lower depending on many factors, some of which are beyond our control and may not be directly related to our operating performance. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;\n\u2022investor demand for our stock;\n\u2022significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of securities of BDCs or other companies in our sector, which are not necessarily related to the operating performance of these companies;\n\u2022changes in regulatory policies or tax guidelines with respect to RICs, BDCs, or SBLCs;\n\u2022failure to qualify as a RIC, or the loss of RIC status;\n\u2022any shortfall in revenue or net income or any increase in losses from levels expected by investors or securities analysts;\n\u2022changes, or perceived changes, in the value of our portfolio investments;\n\u2022departures of key Company personnel;\n\u2022operating performance of companies comparable to us; or\n\u2022general economic conditions and trends and other external factors.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company. Due to the potential volatility of our stock price once a market for our stock is established, we may become the target of securities litigation in the future. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources from our business.\nFuture issuances of our common stock or other securities, including preferred shares, may dilute the per share book value of our common stock or have other adverse consequences to our common shareholders.\nOur Board has the authority, without the action or vote of our shareholders, to issue all or part of the approximately 175,841,306 authorized but unissued shares of our common stock. Our business strategy relies upon investments in and acquisitions of businesses using the resources available to us, including our common stock. Additionally, we anticipate granting additional options or restricted stock awards to our employees and directors in the future. Absent exemptive relief, a BDC generally may not issue restricted stock to its directors, officers and employees. In May 2016, the SEC issued an order granting the Company\u2019s request for exemptive relief to allow us to amend our equity compensation plan and make such grants and awards, subject to shareholder approval. We may also issue additional securities, through public or private offerings, in order to raise capital. Future issuances of our common stock will dilute the percentage of ownership interest of current shareholders and could decrease the per share book value of our common stock. In addition, option holders may exercise their options at a time when we would otherwise be able to obtain additional equity capital on more favorable terms. In July 2016, our shareholders approved the amendments to our equity compensation plan, and certain restricted stock awards granted thereunder.\nWe may also issue additional securities, through public or private offerings, in order to raise capital. Future issuances of our common stock will dilute the percentage of ownership interest of current shareholders and could decrease the per share book value of our common stock. In addition, option holders may exercise their options at a time when we would otherwise be able to obtain additional equity capital on more favorable terms.\nPursuant to our amended and restated charter, our Board is authorized to classify any unissued shares of stock and reclassify any previously classified but unissued shares of stock of any class or series from time to time, into one or more classes or series of stock, including preferred stock. If we issue preferred stock, the preferred stock would rank \u201csenior\u201d to common stock in our capital structure, preferred shareholders would have separate voting rights on certain matters and might have other rights, preferences, or privileges more favorable than those of our common shareholders, and the issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for holders of our common stock or otherwise be in your best interest. We will not generally be able to issue and sell our common stock at a price below net asset value per share. We may, however, sell our common stock, or warrants, options or rights to acquire our common stock, at a price below the then current net asset value per share of our common stock if our Board determines that such sale is in our best interests and in the best interests of our shareholders, and our shareholders approve such sale. In any such case, the price at which our securities are to be issued and sold may not be less than a price that, in the determination of our Board, closely approximates the market value of such securities (less any distributing commission or discount). If we raise additional funds by issuing more common stock or senior securities convertible into, or exchangeable for, our common stock, then the percentage ownership of our shareholders at that time will decrease, and shareholders may experience dilution.\nOur shareholders may experience dilution upon the repurchase of common shares.\nThe Company has instituted in the past, and may institute in the future, programs that may allow the Company to repurchase the Company\u2019s outstanding common shares on the open market. Under such programs, purchases generally may be made at management\u2019s discretion from time to time in open-market transactions, in accordance with all applicable securities laws and regulations, which may have a dilutive effect on current shareholders. Most recently, on December 17, 2018, the Company announced that its Board approved a share repurchase program under which the Company was able to repurchase up to 300,000 of the Company\u2019s outstanding common shares on the open market. The program terminated on June 18, 2019, was extended on June 21, 2019 and terminated on December 18, 2019.\nDilution may occur under repurchase programs if the Company repurchases shares of its common stock at prices that are below the Company\u2019s net asset value per share. This may cause a proportionately smaller increase in our shareholders' interest in our earnings and assets and their voting interest in us than the decrease in our assets resulting from such repurchase. As a result of any such dilution, our market price per share may decline. The actual dilutive effect will depend on the number of shares of common stock that could be so repurchased, the price and the timing of any repurchases under any such program.\nThe authorization and issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred shares could have an anti-takeover effect detrimental to the interests of our shareholders.\nOur certificate of incorporation allows our Board to issue preferred shares with rights and preferences set by the Board without further shareholder approval. The issuance of these \u201cblank check\u201d preferred shares could have an anti-takeover effect detrimental to the interests of our shareholders. For example, in the event of a hostile takeover attempt, it may be possible for management and the Board to impede the attempt by issuing the preferred shares, thereby diluting or impairing the voting power of the other outstanding common shares and increasing the potential costs to acquire control of us. Our Board has the right to issue any new shares, including preferred shares, without first offering them to the holders of common shares, as they have no preemptive rights. The Company does not currently intend to issue preferred shares.\nOur business and operation could be negatively affected if we become subject to any securities litigation or shareholder activism, which could cause us to incur significant expense, hinder execution of investment strategy and impact our stock price.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company. Stockholder activism, which could take many forms or arise in a variety of situations, has been increasing in the BDC space recently. While we are currently not subject to any securities litigation or shareholder activism, due to the potential volatility of our stock price and for a variety of other reasons, we may in the future become the target of securities litigation or shareholder activism. Securities litigation and shareholder activism, including potential proxy contests, could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s and our board of directors\u2019 attention and resources from our business. Additionally, such securities litigation and shareholder activism could give rise to perceived uncertainties as to our future, adversely affect our relationships with service providers and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel. Also, we may be required to incur significant legal fees and other expenses related to any securities litigation and activist shareholder matters. Further, our stock price could be subject to significant fluctuation or otherwise be adversely affected by the events, risks and uncertainties of any securities litigation and shareholder activism.\nProvisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law and of our charter and bylaws could deter takeover attempts and have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock.\nThe Maryland General Corporation Law and our charter and bylaws contain provisions that may discourage, delay or make more difficult a change in control of Newtek or the removal of our directors. We are subject to the Maryland Business Combination Act, subject to any applicable requirements of the 1940 Act. Our Board has adopted a resolution exempting from the Business Combination Act any business combination between us and any other person, subject to prior approval of such business combination by our Board, including approval by a majority of our independent directors. If the resolution exempting business combinations is repealed or our Board does not approve a business combination, the Business Combination Act may discourage third parties from trying to acquire control of us and increase the difficulty of consummating such an offer. Our bylaws exempt from the Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act acquisitions of our stock by any person. If we amend our Bylaws to repeal the exemption from the Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act, the Maryland Control Shares Acquisition Act may make it more difficult for a third party to obtain control of us and increase the difficulty of consummating such a transaction.\nThe SEC staff has rescinded its position that, under the 1940 Act, an investment company may not avail itself of the Maryland Control Share Act. As a result, we may amend our bylaws to be subject to the Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act only if our Board determines that it would be in our best interest.\nWe have also adopted measures that may make it difficult for a third party to obtain control of us, including provisions of our charter classifying our Board in three classes serving staggered three-year terms and authorizing our Board to classify or reclassify shares of our stock in one or more classes or series, to cause the issuance of additional shares of our stock, to amend our charter without shareholder approval and to increase or decrease the number of shares of stock that we have authority to issue. These provisions, as well as other provisions of our charter and bylaws, may delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might otherwise be in the best interests of our shareholders.\nSales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nAll of the common stock held by our executive officers and directors, represents approximately 1,367,000 shares, or approximately 6% of our total outstanding shares as of December 31, 2021. Such shares are generally freely tradable in the public market. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock, or the availability of such common stock for sale, could adversely affect the prevailing market prices for our common stock. If this occurs and continues, it could impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of securities should we desire to do so.\nIf we issue preferred stock, the net asset value and market value of our common stock will likely become more volatile.\nWe cannot assure you that the issuance of preferred stock would result in a higher yield or return to the holders of our common stock. The issuance of preferred stock would likely cause the net asset value and market value of the common stock to become more volatile. If the dividend rate on the preferred stock were to approach the net rate of return on our investment portfolio, the benefit of leverage to the holders of the common stock would be reduced. If the dividend rate on the preferred stock were to exceed the net rate of return on our portfolio, the leverage would result in a lower rate of return to the holders of common stock than if we had not issued preferred stock. Any decline in the net asset value of our investments would be borne entirely by the holders of common stock. Therefore, if the market value of our portfolio were to decline, the leverage would result in a greater decrease in net asset value to the holders of common stock than if we were not leveraged through the issuance of preferred stock. This greater net asset value decrease would also tend to cause a greater decline in the market price for the common stock. We might be in danger of failing to maintain the required asset coverage of the preferred stock or of losing our ratings, if any, on the preferred stock or, in an extreme case, our current investment income might not be sufficient to meet the dividend requirements on the preferred stock. To counteract such an event, we might need to liquidate investments to fund a redemption of some or all of the preferred stock. In addition, we would pay (and the holders of common stock would bear) all costs and expenses relating to the issuance and ongoing maintenance of the preferred stock, including higher advisory fees if our total return exceeds the dividend rate on the preferred stock. Holders of preferred stock may have different interests than holders of common stock and may at times have disproportionate influence over our affairs.\nStockholders may incur dilution if we sell shares of our common stock in one or more offerings at prices below the then current net asset value per share of our common stock or issue securities to subscribe to, convert to or purchase shares of our common stock.\nThe 1940 Act prohibits us from selling shares of our common stock at a price below the current net asset value per share of such stock, with certain exceptions. One such exception is prior shareholder approval of issuances below net asset value provided that our Board makes certain determinations. At an August 3, 2021 special meeting of shareholders, our shareholders authorized us to sell shares of our common stock until the earlier of our 2022 annual meeting of shareholders or August 2, 2022, at a price below its then current net asset value per share subject to certain conditions (including that the cumulative number of shares sold does not exceed 20% of its then outstanding common stock immediately prior to each such sale). Any decision to sell shares of our common stock below the then current net asset value per share of our common stock or securities to subscribe to, convert to, or purchase shares of our common stock would be subject to the determination by our Board that such issuance is in our and our shareholders\u2019 best interests.\nIf we were to sell shares of our common stock below net asset value per share, such sales would result in an immediate dilution to the net asset value per share. This dilution would occur as a result of the sale of shares at a price below the then current net asset value per share of our common stock and a proportionately greater decrease in a shareholder\u2019s interest in our earnings and assets and voting interest in us than the increase in our assets resulting from such issuance. In addition, if we issue securities to subscribe to, convert to or purchase shares of common stock, the exercise or conversion of such securities would increase the number of outstanding shares of our common stock. Any such exercise would be dilutive on the voting power of existing\nshareholders, and could be dilutive with regard to dividends and our net asset value, and other economic aspects of the common stock. Because the number of shares of common stock that could be so issued and the timing of any issuance is not currently known, the actual dilutive effect cannot be predicted; however, the example below illustrates the effect of dilution to existing shareholders resulting from the sale of common stock at prices below the net asset value of such shares.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR NOTES\nThe 2024 Notes, the 2025 Notes and the 2026 Notes, together, the \u201cNotes,\u201d are unsecured and therefore are effectively subordinated to any secured indebtedness we have outstanding or may incur in the future.\nIn July 2019, February 2021 and May 2021, we issued $63.25 million, $5.0 million and $10.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Notes, respectively. In December 2021, we redeemed $40.0 million in aggregate principal of the 2024 Notes. In January 2021, we issued $115.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2026 Notes. In November 2020, we issued $5.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes and in January 2021 we issued an additional $10.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes. The Notes are not secured by any of our assets or any of the assets of our subsidiaries. As a result, the Notes are effectively subordinated to any secured indebtedness we or our subsidiaries have outstanding or may incur in the future (or any indebtedness that is initially unsecured to which we subsequently grant security). In any liquidation, dissolution, bankruptcy or other similar proceeding, the holders of any of our existing or future secured indebtedness and the existing or future secured indebtedness of our subsidiaries may assert rights against the assets pledged to secure that indebtedness to receive full payment of their indebtedness before the assets may be used to pay other creditors, including the holders of the Notes.\nThe Notes are structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries.\nThe Notes are obligations exclusively of the Company and not of any of our subsidiaries. None of our subsidiaries is a guarantor of the Notes and the Notes are not required to be guaranteed by any subsidiaries we may acquire or create in the future. Any assets of our subsidiaries will not be directly available to satisfy the claims of our creditors, including holders of the Notes.\nExcept to the extent we are a creditor with recognized claims against our subsidiaries, all claims of creditors (including trade creditors) and holders of preferred stock, if any, of our subsidiaries will have priority over our equity interests in such subsidiaries (and therefore the claims of our creditors, including holders of the Notes) with respect to the assets of such subsidiaries. Even if we are recognized as a creditor of one or more of our subsidiaries, our claims would still be effectively subordinated to any security interests in the assets of any such subsidiary and to any indebtedness or other liabilities of any such subsidiary senior to our claims. Consequently, the Notes are structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of any of our subsidiaries and any subsidiaries that we may in the future acquire or establish as financing vehicles or otherwise.\nThe indenture under which the Notes were issued contains limited protection for holders of the Notes.\nThe indentures under which the Notes were issued offers limited protection to holders of the Notes. The terms of the indentures and the Notes do not restrict our or any of our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to engage in, or otherwise be a party to, a variety of corporate transactions, circumstances or events that could have a material adverse impact on your investment in the Notes. In particular, the terms of the indentures and the Notes do not place any restrictions on our or our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to:\n\u2022issue securities or otherwise incur additional indebtedness or other obligations, including (1) any indebtedness or other obligations that would be equal in right of payment to the Notes, (2) any indebtedness or other obligations that would be secured and therefore rank effectively senior in right of payment to the Notes, (3) indebtedness of ours that is guaranteed by one or more of our subsidiaries and which therefore is structurally senior to the Notes and (4) securities, indebtedness or obligations issued or incurred by our subsidiaries that would be senior to our equity interests in our subsidiaries and therefore rank structurally senior to the Notes with respect to the assets of our subsidiaries, in each case other than an incurrence of indebtedness or other obligation that would cause a violation of Section 18(a)(1)(A) as modified by Section 61(a)(1) of the 1940 Act or any successor provisions, but giving effect to any exemptive relief granted to us by the SEC. Currently, these provisions generally prohibit us from making additional borrowings, including through the issuance of additional debt or the sale of additional debt securities, unless our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, equals at least 150% after such borrowings;\n\u2022pay dividends on, or purchase or redeem or make any payments in respect of, capital stock or other securities ranking junior in right of payment to the Notes, including subordinated indebtedness, in each case other than dividends, purchases, redemptions or payments that would cause a violation of Section 18(a)(1)(B) as modified by Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act, or any successor provisions, giving effect to (i) any exemptive relief granted to us by the SEC and (ii) no-action relief granted by the SEC to another BDC (or to the Company if it determines to seek such similar no-action or other relief) permitting the BDC to declare any cash dividend or distribution notwithstanding the prohibition contained in Section 18(a)(1)(B) as modified by Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act in order to maintain the BDC\u2019s status as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code (these provisions generally prohibit us from declaring any cash dividend or distribution upon any class of our capital stock, or purchasing any such capital stock if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is below 150% at the time of the declaration of the dividend or distribution or the purchase and after deducting the amount of such dividend, distribution or purchase);\n\u2022sell assets (other than certain limited restrictions on our ability to consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets);\n\u2022enter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022create liens (including liens on the shares of our subsidiaries) or enter into sale and leaseback transactions;\n\u2022make investments; or\n\u2022create restrictions on the payment of dividends or other amounts to us from our subsidiaries.\nIn addition, the indentures do not require us to offer to purchase the Notes in connection with a change of control, asset sale or any other event. Furthermore, the terms of the indentures and the Notes do not protect holders of the Notes in the event that we experience changes (including significant adverse changes) in our financial condition, results of operations or credit ratings, as they do not require that we or our subsidiaries adhere to any financial tests or ratios or specified levels of net worth, revenues, income, cash flow or liquidity. Our ability to recapitalize, incur additional debt and take a number of other actions that are not limited by the terms of the Notes may have important consequences for holders of the Notes, including making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes or negatively affecting the trading value of the Notes.\nOther debt we issue or incur in the future could contain more protections for its holders than the indentures and the Notes, including additional covenants and events of default. The issuance or incurrence of any such debt with incremental protections could affect the market for and trading levels and prices of the Notes.\nIf we default on our obligations to pay other indebtedness that we may incur in the future, we may not be able to make payments on the Notes.\nIn the future, we may enter into agreements to incur additional indebtedness, including a secured credit facility. A default under such agreements to which we may be a party that is not waived by the required lenders or holders, and the remedies sought by the holders of such indebtedness could make us unable to pay principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes and substantially decrease the market value of the Notes. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow and are otherwise unable to obtain funds necessary to meet required payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest on such future additional indebtedness, or if we otherwise fail to comply with the various covenants, including financial and operating covenants, in the instruments governing such future additional indebtedness, we could be in default under the terms of the agreements governing such indebtedness. In the event of such default, the holders of such indebtedness could elect to declare all the funds borrowed thereunder to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest, the lenders of other debt we may incur in the future could elect to terminate their commitments, cease making further loans and institute foreclosure proceedings against our assets, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. If we are unable to repay debt, lenders having secured obligations could proceed against the collateral securing the debt. Because any future credit facilities likely will have customary cross-default provisions, if the indebtedness under any future credit facility is accelerated, we may be unable to repay or finance the amounts due.\nWe may choose to redeem the Notes when prevailing interest rates are relatively low.\nWe may choose to redeem the remaining 2024 Notes outstanding and 2026 Notes, especially if prevailing interest rates are lower than the interest rates on the 2024 Notes or 2026 Notes. In addition, we may choose to redeem the 2025 Notes at any time at our option. If prevailing rates are lower at the time of redemption, holders of the Notes may not be able to reinvest the redemption proceeds in a comparable security at an effective interest rate as high as the interest rate on the Notes being redeemed. Our redemption right also may adversely impact your ability to sell the Notes as the optional redemption date or period approaches.\nOn March 22, 2018, the Company redeemed all $40.25 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2021 Notes on the redemption date at 100% of their principal amount ($25 per Note), plus the accrued and unpaid interest thereon from December 31, 2017, through, but excluding, the Redemption Date.\nOn August 29, 2019, the Company redeemed all $8.324 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2022 Notes on the redemption date at 100% of their principal amount ($25 per Note), plus the accrued and unpaid interest thereon from July 1, 2019, through, but excluding, the redemption date.\nOn February 22, 2021, the Company redeemed all $57.5 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2023 Notes on the redemption date at 100% of their principal amount ($25 per Note), plus the accrued and unpaid interest thereon from December 31, 2020 through, but excluding, the redemption date.\nOn December 29, 2021, the Company partially redeemed $40.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the $78.25 million of 2024 Notes outstanding at 100% of their principal amount ($25 per Note), plus the accrued and unpaid interest thereon from November 1, 2021 through, but excluding, the redemption date.\nThe trading market or market value of our publicly traded debt securities may fluctuate.\nThe 2024 and 2026 Notes are new issues of debt securities listed on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbols \u201cNEWTL\u201d and \u201cNEWTZ,\u201d respectively. Although the Notes are listed on Nasdaq, we cannot assure you that a trading market for our publicly issued debt securities will be maintained. In addition to our creditworthiness, many factors may materially adversely affect the trading market for, and market value of, our publicly issued debt securities. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022the time remaining to the maturity of these debt instruments;\n\u2022the outstanding principal amount of debt securities with terms identical to these debt securities;\n\u2022the ratings assigned by the national statistical rating agencies;\n\u2022the general economic environment;\n\u2022the supply of debt securities trading in the secondary market, if any;\n\u2022the level, direction and volatility of market interest rates generally; and\n\u2022market rates of interest higher or lower than rates borne by the debt securities.\nYou should be aware that there may be a limited number of buyers should holders of the Notes decide to sell the securities. This too may materially adversely affect the market value of the debt securities of the trading market for the debt securities.\nRISKS RELATED TO CYBERSECURITY\nWe could be adversely affected by information security breaches or cyber security attacks.\nOur business operations and our portfolio companies\u2019 business operations rely upon secure information technology systems for data processing, storage and reporting. Despite security and controls design, implementation and updating, such information technology systems could become subject to cyber-attacks. Network, system, application and data breaches could result in operational disruptions or information misappropriation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, our business operations and our portfolio companies\u2019 business operations involve the storage and transmission of Newtek, portfolio company, customer and employee proprietary information. Our businesses rely on our digital technologies, computer and email systems, software, and networks to conduct operations. Our technologies, systems and networks may become the target of criminal cyber-attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of confidential, proprietary and other information of us, our portfolio companies, or third parties with whom we and our portfolio companies deal, or otherwise disrupt our or our customers\u2019 or other third parties\u2019 business operations. It is critical to our business strategy that our facilities and infrastructure remain secure and are perceived by the marketplace to be secure. Although we believe we and our IT providers employ appropriate security technologies (including data encryption processes, intrusion detection systems), and conduct comprehensive risk assessments and other internal control procedures to assure the security of our and our customers\u2019 data, we cannot guarantee that these measures will be sufficient for this purpose. If our and our IT provider\u2019s security measures are breached as a result of third-party action, employee error or otherwise, and as a result our or our customers\u2019 data becomes available to unauthorized parties, we could incur liability and our reputation would be damaged, which could lead to the loss of current and potential customers. If we experience any breaches of our network security or sabotage, we might be required to expend significant capital and other resources to detect, remedy, protect against or alleviate these and related problems, and we may not be able to remedy these problems in a timely manner, or at all. Because techniques used by outsiders to obtain unauthorized network access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. For example, in early 2018, an unauthorized third-party misappropriated three of NTS\u2019 domain names. NTS\u2019 management and forensic investigators determined that attackers compromised a portion of NTS\u2019 shared webhosting system, and may have acquired certain customer information limited to its shared webhosting customers, and/or gained access to certain of its shared webhosting servers. In response, NTS has taken a range of steps designed to further secure its systems, enhance its security protections, enhance access controls, and prevent future unauthorized activity.\nAs cyber threats continue to evolve, we and our portfolio companies may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. Although we have insurance in place that covers such incidents, the cost of a breach or cyber-attack could well exceed any such insurance coverage.\nThe failure in cyber-security systems, as well as the occurrence of events unanticipated in our disaster recovery systems and management continuity planning could impair our ability to conduct business effectively.\nThe occurrence of a disaster, such as a cyber-attack against us or against a third-party that has access to our data or networks, a natural catastrophe, an industrial accident, failure of our disaster recovery systems, or consequential employee error, could have an adverse effect on our ability to communicate or conduct business, negatively impacting our operations and financial condition. This adverse effect can become particularly acute if those events affect our electronic data processing, transmission, storage, and retrieval systems, or impact the availability, integrity, or confidentiality of our data.\nWe and our portfolio companies depend heavily upon computer systems to perform necessary business functions. Despite our implementation of a variety of security measures, our computer systems, networks, and data, like those of other companies, could be subject to cyber-attacks and unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction, such as from physical and electronic break-ins or unauthorized tampering. If one or more of these events occurs, it could potentially jeopardize the confidential, proprietary, and other information processed, stored in, and transmitted through our computer systems and networks. Such an attack could cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations, which could result in financial losses, litigation, regulatory penalties, client dissatisfaction or loss, reputational damage, and increased costs associated with mitigation of damages and remediation. If unauthorized parties gain access to such information and technology systems, they may be able to steal, publish, delete or modify private and sensitive information, including nonpublic personal information related to stockholders (and their beneficial owners) and material nonpublic information. The systems we have implemented to manage risks relating to these types of events could prove to be inadequate and, if compromised, could become inoperable for extended periods of time, cease to function properly or fail to adequately secure private information. Breaches such as those involving covertly introduced malware, impersonation of authorized users and industrial or other espionage may not be identified even with sophisticated prevention and detection systems, potentially resulting in further harm and preventing them from being addressed appropriately. The failure of these systems or of disaster recovery plans for any reason could cause significant interruptions in our and our portfolio companies\u2019 operations and result in a failure to maintain the security, confidentiality or privacy of sensitive data, including personal information relating to stockholders, material nonpublic information and other sensitive information in our possession.\nA disaster or a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our business, including a disruption involving electronic communications or other services used by us or third parties with whom we conduct business, or directly affecting our headquarters, could have a material adverse impact on our ability to continue to operate our business without interruption. Our disaster recovery programs may not be sufficient to mitigate the harm that may result from such a disaster or disruption. In addition, insurance and other safeguards might only partially reimburse us for our losses, if at all.\nThird parties with which we do business may also be sources of cybersecurity or other technological risk. We outsource certain functions and these relationships allow for the storage and processing of our information, as well as client, counterparty, employee, and borrower information. While we engage in actions to reduce our exposure resulting from outsourcing, ongoing threats may result in unauthorized access, loss, exposure, destruction, or other cybersecurity incident that affects our data, resulting in increased costs and other consequences as described above.\nIn addition, cybersecurity has become a top priority for regulators around the world, and some jurisdictions have enacted laws requiring companies to notify individuals of data security breaches involving certain types of personal data. If we fail to comply with the relevant laws and regulations, we could suffer financial losses, a disruption of our businesses, liability to investors, regulatory intervention or reputational damage.\nWe and our service providers continue to be impacted by government actions in response to the global COVID-19 pandemic, which are obstructing the regular functioning of business workforces (including requiring employees to work from external locations and their homes). Policies of extended periods of remote working, whether by us or by our service providers, could strain technology resources, introduce operational risks and otherwise heighten the risks described above. Remote working environments may be less secure and more susceptible to hacking attacks, including phishing and social engineering attempts that seek to exploit the COVID-19 pandemic. Accordingly, the risks described above are heightened under current conditions.\nWe and our portfolio companies are subject to risks associated with \u201cphishing\u201d and other cyber-attack.\nOur business and the business of our portfolio companies relies upon secure information technology systems for data processing, storage and reporting. Despite careful security and controls design, implementation and updating, ours and our portfolio companies\u2019 information technology systems could become subject to cyber-attacks. Cyber-attacks include, but are not limited to, gaining unauthorized access to digital systems (e.g., through \u201chacking\u201d, malicious software coding, social engineering or \u201cphishing\u201d attempts) for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption. Cyber-attacks may also be carried out in a manner that does not require gaining unauthorized access, such as causing denial-of service attacks on websites (i.e., efforts to make network services unavailable to intended users). Our employees have been and expect to continue to be the target of fraudulent calls, emails and other forms of activities. The result of these incidents may include disrupted operations, misstated or unreliable financial data, liability for stolen information, misappropriation of assets, increased cybersecurity protection and insurance costs, litigation and damage to our business relationships, regulatory fines or penalties, or other adverse effects on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures and to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures arising from operational and security risks related to cyber-attacks.\nOur and our service providers\u2019 increased use of mobile and cloud technologies could heighten the risk of a cyber-attack as well as other operational risks, as certain aspects of the security of such technologies may be complex, unpredictable or beyond their control. Our and other service providers\u2019 reliance on mobile or cloud technology or any failure by mobile technology and cloud service providers to adequately safeguard their systems and prevent cyber-attacks could disrupt their operations and result in misappropriation, corruption or loss of personal, confidential or proprietary information. In addition, there is a risk that encryption and other protective measures against cyber-attacks may be circumvented, particularly to the extent that new computing technologies increase the speed and computing power available.\nAdditionally, remote working environments may be less secure and more susceptible to cyber-attacks, including phishing and social engineering attempts that seek to exploit the COVID-19 pandemic. Accordingly, the risks associated with cyber-attacks are heightened under current conditions.\nGENERAL RISK FACTORS\nWe may experience fluctuations in our quarterly and annual results.\nWe may experience fluctuations in our quarterly and annual operating results due to a number of factors, including our ability or inability to make investments in companies that meet our investment criteria, the interest rate payable on the debt securities we acquire, the default rate of such securities, the level of portfolio dividend and fee income, the level of our expenses, variations in and the timing of the recognition of realized and unrealized gains or losses, the degree to which we encounter competition in our markets and general economic conditions. As a result of these factors, results for any period should not be relied upon as being indicative of performance in future periods.\nGovernment intervention in the credit markets could adversely affect our business.\nThe central banks and, in particular, the U.S. Federal Reserve, have taken unprecedented steps since the financial crises of 2008-2009 and the COVID-19 global pandemic. It is impossible to predict if, how, and to what extent the United States and other governments would further intervene in the credit markets. Such intervention is often prompted by politically sensitive issues involving family homes, student loans, real estate speculation, credit card receivables, pandemics, etc., and could, as a result, be contrary to what we would predict from an \u201ceconomically rational\u201d perspective.\nOn the other hand, recent governmental intervention could mean that the willingness of governmental bodies to take additional extraordinary action is diminished. As a result, in the event of near-term major market disruptions, like those caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, there might be only limited additional government intervention, resulting in correspondingly greater market dislocation and materially greater market risk.\nChanges in laws or regulations governing our operations may adversely affect our business or cause us to alter our business strategy.\nWe and our portfolio companies are subject to regulation by laws at the local, state, and federal levels. These laws and regulations, as well as their interpretation, could change from time to time, including as the result of interpretive guidance or other directives from the U.S. President and others in the executive branch, and new laws, regulations and interpretations could also come into effect. For example, the current U.S. presidential administration could support an enhanced regulatory agenda that imposes greater costs on all sectors and on financial services companies in particular. Any such new or changed laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, and political uncertainty could increase regulatory uncertainty in the near term.\nChanges to the laws and regulations governing our permitted investments may require a change to our investment strategy. Such changes could differ materially from our strategies and plans as set forth in this report and may shift our investment focus from the areas of expertise of our Adviser. Thus, any such changes, if they occur, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and the value of your investment in us.\nTerrorist attacks, acts of war, global health emergencies, or natural disasters may affect any market for our securities, impact the businesses in which we invest and harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nTerrorist acts, acts of war, global health emergencies or natural disasters may disrupt our operations, as well as the operations of the businesses in which we invest. Such acts have created, and continue to create, economic and political uncertainties and have contributed to global economic instability. Future terrorist activities, military or security operations, global health emergencies or natural disasters could further weaken the domestic/global economies and create additional uncertainties, which may negatively impact the businesses in which we invest directly or indirectly and, in turn, could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. Losses from terrorist attacks, global health emergencies and natural disasters are generally uninsurable.\nWe are highly dependent on information systems and systems failures could significantly disrupt our business, which may, in turn, negatively affect the market price of our securities and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders.\nOur business is highly dependent on our communications and information systems. Certain of these systems are provided to us by third-party service providers. Any failure or interruption of such systems, including as a result of the termination of an agreement with any such third party service provider, could cause delays or other problems in our activities. This, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and negatively affect the market price of our securities and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders.\nWe are subject to risks related to corporate social responsibility.\nOur business faces increasing public scrutiny related to environmental, social and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) activities. We risk damage to our brand and reputation if we fail to act responsibly in a number of areas, such as environmental stewardship, corporate governance and transparency and considering ESG factors in our investment processes. Adverse incidents with respect to ESG activities could impact the value of our brand, the cost of our operations and relationships with investors, all of which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Additionally, new regulatory initiatives related to ESG could adversely affect our business.\nThe effect of global climate change may impact the operations of our portfolio companies.\nThere may be evidence of global climate change. Climate change creates physical and financial risk and some of our portfolio companies may be adversely affected by climate change. For example, the needs of customers of energy companies vary with weather conditions, primarily temperature and humidity. To the extent weather conditions are affected by climate change, energy use could increase or decrease depending on the duration and magnitude of any changes. Increases in the cost of energy could adversely affect the cost of operations of our portfolio companies if the use of energy products or services is material to their business. A decrease in energy use due to weather changes may affect some of our portfolio companies\u2019 financial condition, through decreased revenues. Extreme weather conditions in general require more system backup, adding to costs, and can contribute to increased system stresses, including service interruptions.\nIn December 2015 the United Nations, of which the U.S. is a member, adopted a climate accord (the \"Paris Agreement\") with the long-term goal of limiting global warming and the short-term goal of significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
