{"cik": "1588972", "company": "Recro Pharma, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-09", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nThe following risk factors and other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we presently deem less significant may also impair our business operations. Please see page [1] of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of some of the forward-looking statements that are qualified by these risk factors. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Finances and Capital Requirements\nWe have incurred net losses since inception. We expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future and may never achieve or maintain profitability.\nTo date, we have focused primarily on developing our proprietary product candidates. We have incurred significant pre-tax losses in each year since our inception in November 2007, including pre-tax losses of approximately $31.3 million and $12.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As of December 31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $61.3 million.\nWe have financed our operations through the sale of debt and equity securities, a $50.0 million credit facility with OrbiMed Royalty Opportunities, II, LP, or OrbiMed, and revenue generated by our CDMO division. We have used revenue generated by our CDMO division primarily to fund operations at our CDMO division, to make payments under our credit facility and to partially fund our research and development and pre-commercialization activities. We believe that our CDMO division revenue will continue to contribute cash for general corporate purposes that may, to some extent, reduce the amount of external capital needed to fund development operations.\nThe size of our future net losses and our ability to achieve profitability will depend, in part, on the rate of future expenditures and our ability to generate additional revenues from sales of our product candidates. To date, none of our product candidates have been commercialized, and revenues generated by our CDMO division do not cover our costs and may never be sufficient to achieve profitability. Our ability to generate future revenues from product sales depends heavily on our success in:\n\u2022\ncompleting the clinical development of our product candidates;\n\u2022\nobtaining regulatory approval for our product candidates;\n\u2022\nlaunching and commercializing our product candidates;\n\u2022\nobtaining and maintaining patent protection for our product candidates; and\n\u2022\nour ability to generate increased revenue from our CDMO division.\nWe expect to continue to incur substantial and increased expenses as we continue our clinical and pre-commercialization activities for injectable meloxicam, and expand our research and development activities and advance our clinical programs. Even if one or more of our product candidates is approved for commercial sale, we anticipate incurring significant costs associated with commercializing any approved product candidate. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with pharmaceutical product development and commercialization, we are unable to predict the timing or amount of increased expenses, and when, or if, we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability.\nIf our product candidates are not successfully developed or commercialized, or if revenues are insufficient following marketing approval, we will not achieve profitability and our business may fail. Even if we successfully obtain regulatory approval to market our product candidates in the United States, our revenues are also dependent upon the size of the markets outside of the United States, as well as our ability to obtain market approval and achieve commercial success outside of the United States.\nAs a result of the foregoing, we expect to continue to incur significant and increasing losses from operations for the foreseeable future. Even if we are able to generate revenues from the sale of our products, we may not become profitable and may need to obtain additional funding to continue operations.\nWe have a limited operating history, which may make it difficult to predict our future performance or evaluate our business and prospects.\nWe were incorporated in 2007. Since inception, our operations have been primarily limited to developing our technology and undertaking non-clinical studies and clinical trials for our product candidates. We have not yet obtained regulatory approval for any of our product candidates. In addition, our CDMO division was acquired in April 2015, and our experience operating such business is limited. Consequently, we have a very limited amount of information to use in evaluating the potential future success or viability of our business and any such evaluation of our business and prospects may not be accurate.\nIf we fail to obtain sufficient additional financing, we would be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development and related pre-commercialization programs or to significantly scale back or discontinue our manufacturing business.\nDeveloping pharmaceutical products, including conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials, is expensive. We expect our research and development expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing clinical and pre-commercialization activities,\nparticularly as we advance our clinical programs. In addition, maintaining a cGMP pharmaceutical manufacturing facility is expensive. While our CDMO division generates revenue, that revenue alone is not sufficient to support our product development operations. We will need to raise additional funds to support our future product development operations. In addition, we may also need to obtain additional financing if the capital requirements for operating and maintaining our manufacturing facility exceed our current expectations. Such financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.\nWe expect our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our current operations over the next 12 months. However, changing circumstances beyond our control may cause us to consume capital more rapidly than we currently anticipate. For example, our clinical trials may encounter technical, enrollment or other difficulties that could increase our development costs more than we expect. We will need to raise additional funding to make milestone payments due to Alkermes upon submission and/or approval of the NDA for injectable meloxicam, to commercialize injectable meloxicam, if approved by the FDA, and to develop our other product candidates.\nSecuring additional financing may divert our management from our day-to-day activities, which may adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates or to develop and maintain customer relationships. In addition, we cannot guarantee that future financing will be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when required or on acceptable terms, we may be required to:\n\u2022\ncurtail the development programs for our product candidates or significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development or commercialization of our product candidates;\n\u2022\nseek collaboration partners for our product candidates at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable or on terms that are less favorable than might otherwise be available;\n\u2022\nrelinquish or license, on unfavorable terms, our rights to technologies or product candidates that we otherwise would seek to develop or commercialize ourselves; or\n\u2022\nsignificantly scale back or discontinue our CDMO division.\nAny of the above could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and prospects.\nWe may sell additional equity or debt securities to fund our operations, which would result in dilution to our shareholders and may impose restrictions on our business.\nWe may seek additional capital through a combination of private and public equity offerings, debt financings, strategic partnerships and alliances and licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, existing ownership interests will be diluted, and the terms of such financings may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of existing shareholders. Debt financings may be coupled with an equity component, such as warrants to purchase shares, which could also result in dilution of our existing shareholders\u2019 ownership. If we raise additional funds through strategic partnerships and alliances and licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our product candidates, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.\nOur operating results may fluctuate significantly.\nOur operating results may be subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations. Our operating results will be affected by numerous factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe timing and amount of development and net sales milestones, royalties and earn-out payments payable by us under our existing license agreements and acquisition agreements;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the revenues generated by our CDMO division;\n\u2022\nvariations in the level of expenses related to our development programs;\n\u2022\nthe success of our clinical trials through all phases of clinical development;\n\u2022\nany delays in regulatory review and approval of product candidates in clinical development;\n\u2022\npotential side effects of our future products that could delay or prevent commercialization or cause an approved drug to be taken off the market;\n\u2022\nchanges in the fair values of our warrants and contingent consideration liabilities;\n\u2022\nany intellectual property infringement lawsuit in which we may become involved;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain and maintain patent protection;\n\u2022\nthe success of our pre-commercialization activities;\n\u2022\nour ability to establish an effective sales and marketing infrastructure;\n\u2022\nour dependency on third parties to supply and manufacture our product candidates and delivery devices;\n\u2022\ncompetition from existing products or new products that may emerge;\n\u2022\nregulatory developments affecting our product candidates, which are not limited to but could include the imposition of a REMS program as a condition of approval;\n\u2022\nour execution of any additional collaborative, licensing or similar arrangements, and the timing of payments we may make or receive under these arrangements;\n\u2022\nour acquisition or in-licensing of new products or product candidates; and\n\u2022\nthe level of market acceptance for any approved product candidates and underlying demand for that product and wholesalers\u2019 buying patterns.\nDue to the various factors mentioned above, and others, the results of any prior quarterly period should not be relied upon as an indication of our future operating performance. If our quarterly operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. Furthermore, any quarterly fluctuations in our operating results may, in turn, cause the price of our stock to fluctuate substantially.\nIn connection with the Gainesville Transaction, we incurred significant indebtedness, which could adversely affect our business.\nPrior to our acquisition from Alkermes of certain assets, including the worldwide rights to injectable meloxicam and the development, formulation and manufacturing business that comprised our CDMO division, which we refer to herein as the Gainesville Transaction in April 2015, we had no outstanding indebtedness. Contemporaneously with the closing of the Gainesville Transaction, we entered into a $50.0 million credit agreement with OrbiMed. As of December 31, 2016, we had an outstanding balance under the credit agreement of $27.3 million. The credit agreement provides for certain mandatory prepayment events, including a quarterly excess cash flow prepayment requirement at OrbiMed\u2019s request, based on the terms of the credit facility. As of December 31, 2016, we have paid $22.7 million of the outstanding principal on our senior secured term loan from free cash flow generated by our CDMO division.\nOur indebtedness could have important consequences to our shareholders. For example, it:\n\u2022\nrequires us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, development activity, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nincreases our vulnerability to adverse general economic or industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimits our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or the industries in which we operate;\n\u2022\nmakes us more vulnerable to increases in interest rates, as borrowings under our senior secured credit facility are at variable rates;\n\u2022\nlimits our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital or other purposes;\n\u2022\nplaces us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less indebtedness; and\n\u2022\nprohibits us from making intercompany cash transfers without the consent of OrbiMed.\nAny of the above listed factors could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our credit agreement with OrbiMed also contains certain financial and other covenants, including a minimum liquidity requirement and minimum revenue targets, maximum leverage ratios and includes limitations on, among other things, additional indebtedness, paying dividends in certain circumstances, acquisitions and certain investments. Any failure to comply with the terms, covenants and conditions of the term loan may result in an event of default under such agreement, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nChanges in tax laws and unanticipated tax liabilities could adversely affect our effective income tax rate and ability to achieve profitability.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States, and certain foreign jurisdictions. Our effective income tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by a number of factors including changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws. We regularly assess all of these matters to determine the adequacy of our tax provision which is subject to discretion. If our assessments are incorrect, it could have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition. There can be no assurance that income tax laws and administrative policies with respect to the income tax consequences generally applicable to us or to our subsidiaries will not be changed in a manner which adversely affects our shareholders.\nRisks Related to Clinical Development and Regulatory Approval\nWe are substantially dependent on the success of our lead product candidate injectable meloxicam, which is in a later stage of development than our other product candidates. To the extent regulatory approval of injectable meloxicam is delayed or not granted, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected and the price of our common stock may decline.\nWe currently have no product candidates approved for sale, and we may never be able to develop marketable products. We are focusing a significant portion of our activities and resources on our lead product candidate, injectable meloxicam, and we believe our prospects are highly dependent on, and a significant portion of the value of our company relates to, our ability to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval for, and successfully commercialize injectable meloxicam. The regulatory approval of injectable meloxicam is subject to many risks, including the risks discussed in other risk factors, and injectable meloxicam may not receive marketing approval from any regulatory agency. If the results or timing of regulatory filings, the regulatory process, regulatory developments, clinical trials or preclinical studies, or other activities, actions or decisions related to injectable meloxicam do not meet our or others\u2019 expectations, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly.\nWe have recently completed two Phase III clinical trials for IV meloxicam. Overall we expect to enroll a total of approximately 1,100 patients in our Phase III program. To complete this program, we await final visits for more than 700 patients enrolled following a variety of surgical procedures in our additional safety study of IV meloxicam. Assuming we continue to observe a favorable safety profile in the safety study, we anticipate filing a new drug application, or NDA, for IV meloxicam with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in the summer of 2017. We cannot be certain that the NDA will be accepted for filing and review by the FDA, or ultimately be approved. Although we have discussed our clinical development plans with the FDA, the agency may ultimately determine that our Phase III clinical trials are not sufficient for regulatory approval or that our NDA is not otherwise complete. The FDA may also audit one or more of our manufacturing facilities or clinical trial sites, and if any site reveals anomalies or does not otherwise pass inspection, the FDA could delay or reject our NDA. In either case, our development of IV meloxicam may be delayed and we may incur additional costs and be required to devote additional resources to address the FDA\u2019s concerns. If the FDA requires us to conduct additional clinical trials or studies or requires our manufacturer to improve or change its practices, our timeline for commercialization of IV meloxicam will be delayed and we will incur additional costs. Further, there can be no assurance that we will complete the other clinical and non-clinical studies or address manufacturing issues in a manner that is acceptable to the FDA. In addition, we plan to conduct Phase IIIB clinical trials for IV meloxicam, and those trials could fail or produce results that are adverse or inconclusive.\nAny delay or setback in the development or regulatory approval of injectable meloxicam could adversely affect our business and cause our stock price to decline. Should our on-going injectable meloxicam clinical development fail to be completed in a timely manner or at all, or be sufficient to support regulatory approval, we may be forced to rely on our other product candidates, which are at an earlier development stage and will require additional time and resources to obtain regulatory approval and proceed with commercialization. We cannot assure you that our on-going clinical development for injectable meloxicam will be completed in a timely manner, or at all, or that we will be able to obtain approval for injectable meloxicam from the FDA.\nEven if the FDA grants approval of injectable meloxicam, the terms of the approval may limit its commercial potential.\nEven if injectable meloxicam were to successfully obtain approval from the FDA, any such approval might significantly limit the approved indications for use, including more limited patient populations, require that precautions, contraindications or warnings be included on the product labeling, including black box warnings, require expensive and time-consuming post-approval clinical studies, REMS, or surveillance as conditions of approval, or, through the product label, the approval may limit the claims that we may make, which may impede the successful commercialization of our product candidates. If the approval of injectable meloxicam contains significant limitations, our ability to market to our full target market will be reduced and our ability to realize the full market potential of injectable meloxicam will be harmed and we may have to discontinue the commercialization of injectable meloxicam or limit our sales and marketing efforts, which in turn could limit our ability to achieve profitability.\nOur development and commercialization strategy for injectable meloxicam depends, in part, on published scientific literature and the FDA's prior findings regarding the safety and efficacy of approved products containing meloxicam based on data not developed by us, but upon which the FDA may rely in reviewing our NDA.\nSection 505(b)(2) of the FDCA permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from investigations that were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted. The FDA interprets Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA, for purposes of approving an NDA, to permit the applicant to rely, in part, upon published literature or the FDA's previous findings of safety and efficacy for an approved product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional clinical trials or measurements to support any deviation from the previously approved product. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all or some of the label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant. The label, however, may require all or some of the limitations, contraindications, warnings or precautions included in the reference product's label, including a black box warning, or may require additional limitations, contraindications, warnings or precautions. We plan to submit an NDA for injectable meloxicam under Section 505(b)(2) and as such the NDA will rely, in part, on the FDA's previous findings of safety and efficacy from investigations for approved products containing meloxicam and published scientific literature for which we have not received a right of reference. Even though we may be able to take advantage of Section 505(b)(2) to support potential U.S. approval for injectable meloxicam, the FDA may require us to perform additional clinical trials or measurements to support approval. In addition, notwithstanding the approval of many products by the FDA pursuant to Section 505(b)(2), over the last few years some pharmaceutical companies and others have objected to the FDA's interpretation of Section 505(b)(2). If the FDA changes its interpretation of Section 505(b)(2), or if the FDA's interpretation is successfully challenged in court, this could delay or even prevent the FDA from approving any Section 505(b)(2) NDAs that we submit. Such a result could require us to conduct additional testing and costly clinical trials, which could substantially delay or prevent the approval and launch of our product candidates, including injectable meloxicam.\nClinical development is a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome, and results of earlier studies and trials may not be predictive of future trial results. Clinical failure can occur at any stage of clinical development.\nClinical trials are expensive, can take many years to complete and have highly uncertain outcomes. Failure can occur at any time during the clinical trial process as a result of inadequate performance of a drug, inadequate adherence by patients or investigators to clinical trial protocols, or other factors. New drugs in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy traits despite having progressed through earlier clinical trials. A number of companies in the biopharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials as a result of a lack of efficacy or adverse safety profiles, despite promising results in earlier trials. Our clinical trials may not be successful or may be more expensive or time-consuming than we currently expect. If clinical trials for any of our product candidates fail to demonstrate safety or efficacy to the satisfaction of the FDA or the equivalent regulatory authorities in other countries, the FDA or the equivalent regulatory authorities in other countries will not approve that drug and we would not be able to commercialize it, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nDelays in clinical trials are common and have many causes, and any delay could result in increased costs to us and jeopardize or delay our ability to obtain regulatory approval and commence product sales.\nWe may experience delays in clinical trials of our product candidates or the time required to complete clinical trials for our product candidates may be longer than anticipated. Our planned clinical trials may not begin on time, have an effective design, enroll a sufficient number of patients, or be completed on schedule, if at all. Our clinical trials can be delayed for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\ninability to raise funding necessary to initiate or continue a trial;\n\u2022\ndelays in obtaining regulatory approval to commence a trial;\n\u2022\ndelays in reaching agreement with the FDA or the equivalent regulatory authorities in other countries on final trial design or the scope of the development program;\n\u2022\nimposition of a clinical hold following an inspection of our clinical trial operations or trial sites by the FDA or the equivalent regulatory authorities in other countries;\n\u2022\ndelays in reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective CROs and clinical trial sites;\n\u2022\ndelays in obtaining required IRB approval at each site;\n\u2022\ndelays in recruiting suitable patients to participate in a trial;\n\u2022\ndelays in having patients complete participation in a trial or return for post-treatment follow-up;\n\u2022\nclinical sites dropping out of a trial to the detriment of enrollment;\n\u2022\ntime required to add new clinical sites; or\n\u2022\ndelays by our contract manufacturers to produce and deliver a sufficient supply of clinical trial materials.\nIf clinical trials for our product candidates are delayed for any of the above reasons or other reasons, our development costs may increase, our approval process could be delayed and our ability to commercialize our product candidates could be materially harmed, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur product candidates may cause adverse events or other safety concerns or have other properties that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval or limit the scope of any approved label or market acceptance.\nAEs caused by our product candidates could cause us, other reviewing entities, clinical study sites or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical studies and could result in the denial of regulatory approval. Clinical studies conducted with IV meloxicam and our other product candidates have generated some AEs, and in some cases SAEs, as those terms are defined by the FDA in its regulations, and AEs or SAEs could be generated during the course of our on-going safety study and planned Phase IIIB clinical trials. Our ability to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates may be adversely impacted by these AEs, SAEs or other safety concerns. Further, if our products cause serious or unexpected side effects after receiving market approval, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may withdraw their approval of the product or impose restrictions on its distribution in a form of a modified REMS;\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements, such as warnings or contraindications;\n\u2022\nwe may be required to change the way the product is administered or conduct additional clinical studies;\n\u2022\nwe could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients; and/or\n\u2022\nour reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected product candidate and could substantially increase the costs of commercializing our product candidates.\nThe regulatory approval processes of the FDA are lengthy, time consuming and inherently unpredictable, and if we are ultimately unable to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, our business will be substantially harmed.\nThe time required to obtain approval by the FDA is unpredictable but typically takes many years following the commencement of clinical trials and depends upon numerous factors, including the substantial discretion of the regulatory authorities. In addition, approval policies, regulations, or the type and amount of clinical data necessary to gain approval may change during the course of a product candidate\u2019s clinical development and may vary among jurisdictions. We have not obtained regulatory approval for any product candidate, and it is possible that none of our existing product candidates or any product candidates we may seek to develop in the future will ever obtain regulatory approval.\nOur product candidates could fail to receive regulatory approval for many reasons, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe FDA may not accept our NDA filing;\n\u2022\nthe FDA may disagree with the design, scope or implementation of our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA that a product candidate is safe and effective for its proposed indication;\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to demonstrate that a product candidate\u2019s clinical and other benefits outweigh its safety risks;\n\u2022\nthe FDA may disagree with our interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe data collected from clinical trials of our product candidates may not be sufficient to support the submission of an NDA;\n\u2022\nthe FDA may fail to approve the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with which we contract for clinical and commercial supplies; and\n\u2022\nthe approval policies or regulations of the FDA may change significantly in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient for approval.\nWe have not previously submitted an NDA or any similar drug approval filing to the FDA or any comparable foreign authority for any product candidate, and we cannot be certain that any of our product candidates will receive regulatory approval. If we do not receive regulatory approval for our product candidates, we may not be able to continue our operations. Even if we successfully obtain regulatory approval to market one or more of our product candidates, our revenue will be dependent, to a significant extent, upon the size of the markets in the territories for which we gain regulatory approval. If the markets for patients or indications that we are targeting are not as significant as we estimate, we may not generate significant revenue from sales of such products, if approved.\nEven if we obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, we will still face extensive regulatory requirements and our products may face future regulatory difficulties.\nEven if we obtain regulatory approval in the United States or in other countries, the FDA and state regulatory authorities and the equivalent regulatory authorities in other countries may still impose significant restrictions on the indicated uses or marketing of our product candidates, or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly post-approval studies or post-marketing surveillance. Our product candidates will also be subject to ongoing FDA requirements governing the labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, safety surveillance, advertising, promotion, record-keeping and reporting of safety and other post-marketing information. The holder of an approved NDA is obligated to monitor and report AEs and any failure of a product to meet the specifications in the NDA. The holder of an approved NDA must also submit new or supplemental applications and obtain FDA approval for certain changes to the approved product, product labeling or manufacturing process. Advertising and promotional materials must comply with FDA rules and are subject to FDA review, in addition to other potentially applicable federal and state laws. The applicable regulations in countries outside the United States grant similar powers to the competent authorities and impose similar obligations on companies.\nIn addition, manufacturers of drug products and their facilities are subject to payment of substantial user fees and continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities, including equivalent regulatory authorities in other countries, for compliance with cGMP regulations and adherence to commitments made in the NDA or the application for marketing authorization. If we, or a regulatory authority, discover previously unknown problems with a product, such as AEs of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with a facility where the product is manufactured, a regulatory authority may impose restrictions relative to that product or the manufacturing facility, including requiring recall or withdrawal of the product from the market, suspension of manufacturing, or other FDA action or other action by the equivalent regulatory authorities in other countries.\nIf we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements following approval of any of our product candidates, a regulatory authority may:\n\u2022\nissue a warning letter asserting that we are in violation of the law;\n\u2022\nseek an injunction or impose civil or criminal penalties or monetary fines;\n\u2022\nsuspend, modify or withdraw regulatory approval;\n\u2022\nsuspend any ongoing clinical trials;\n\u2022\nrefuse to approve a pending NDA or a pending application for marketing authorization or supplements to an NDA or to an application for marketing authorization submitted by us;\n\u2022\nseize our product candidate; and/or\n\u2022\nrefuse to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts.\nIn addition, if we commercialize our product candidates, we will be subject to a variety of additional regulatory risks. In particular, upon commercialization of our product candidates, our relationships with health care providers and third-party payors in the United States and elsewhere will be subject to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to significant civil, criminal and administrative sanctions including penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, contractual damages, reputational harm and diminished profits and future earnings.\nThese laws and regulations related to our commercialization efforts are described in greater detail in the section above under \u201cGovernment Regulation\u201d entitled \u201cOther Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements.\u201d Many of these laws are vigorously\nenforced both through government investigations and enforcement actions and, in the case of the federal civil False Claims Act, through lawsuits brought by private whistleblowers. In recent years, pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been investigated or prosecuted under these laws for a wide range of alleged improper promotional and marketing activities, such as: allegedly providing free trips, free goods, sham consulting fees and grants and other monetary benefits to prescribers; reporting to pricing services inflated average wholesale prices that were then used by federal programs to set reimbursement rates; engaging in off-label promotion that caused claims to be submitted to Medicaid for non-covered, off-label uses; providing inappropriate patient and product support services, and submitting inflated best price information to the Medicaid Rebate Program to reduce liability for Medicaid rebates. We will make every effort to structure our relationships and business operations to comply with all applicable laws, including structuring our activities to comply with any available statutory exceptions or regulatory safe harbors. However, because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the exceptions and safe harbors, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of these laws. Even if we are not found to have violated the law, responding to whistleblower lawsuits, government investigations or enforcement actions, defending any claims raised, and entering into settlement agreements would be expensive and time-consuming, and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial condition, and business operations.\nAny government investigation of alleged violations of law could require us to expend significant time and resources in response and could generate negative publicity in addition to the aforementioned potential regulatory actions. The occurrence of any event or penalty described above may inhibit our ability to commercialize our products and generate revenues which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nInjectable meloxicam and our other product candidates, if approved, may require REMS, which may significantly increase our costs.\nOur product candidates, if approved, may require REMS. The REMS may include requirements for special labeling or medication guides for patients, special communication plans to health care professionals and restrictions on distribution and use. We cannot predict the specific scope or magnitude of REMS to be required as part of the FDA\u2019s approval of injectable meloxicam or our other product candidates. Depending on the extent of the REMS requirements, our costs to commercialize injectable meloxicam or our other product candidates may increase significantly and distribution restrictions could limit sales. Similar obstacles may arise in countries outside of the United States.\nEven if we obtain FDA approval for injectable meloxicam or our other product candidates in the United States, we may never obtain approval for or commercialize our products outside of the United States, which would limit our ability to realize their full market potential.\nIn order to market any products outside of the United States, we must establish and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding quality, safety and efficacy. Clinical trials conducted in one country may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other countries, and regulatory approval in one country does not mean that regulatory approval will be obtained in any other country. Approval processes vary among countries and can involve additional product testing and validation and additional administrative review periods. Seeking foreign regulatory approval could result in difficulties and costs for us and require additional non-clinical studies or clinical trials, which could be costly and time consuming. Regulatory requirements can vary widely from country to country and could delay or prevent the introduction of our products in those countries. While our management has experience in obtaining foreign regulatory approvals, we do not have any product candidates approved for sale in any jurisdiction, including international markets, and we, as a company, do not have experience in obtaining regulatory approval in international markets. If we fail to comply with regulatory requirements in international markets or to obtain and maintain required approvals, or if regulatory approval in international markets is delayed, our target market will be reduced and our ability to realize the full market potential of our products will be adversely affected.\nFor example, in the European Union, similarly to the U.S., both marketing authorization holders and manufacturers of medicinal products are subject to comprehensive regulatory oversight by the EMA and the competent authorities of the individual European Union member states both before and after grant of the manufacturing and Marketing Authorizations. This includes control of compliance with cGMP rules, which govern quality control of the manufacturing process and require documentation policies and procedures. We and our third-party manufacturers are required to ensure that all of our processes, methods, and equipment are compliant with cGMP. Failure by us or by any of our third-party partners, including suppliers, manufacturers, and distributors to comply with European Union laws and the related national laws of individual European Union member states governing the conduct of clinical trials, manufacturing approval, marketing authorization of medicinal products, both before and after grant of marketing authorization, and marketing of such products following grant of authorization may result in administrative, civil, or criminal penalties. These penalties could include delays in or refusal to authorize the conduct of clinical trials or to grant Marketing Authorization, product withdrawals and recalls, product seizures, suspension, or variation of the marketing authorization, total or\npartial suspension of production, distribution, manufacturing, or clinical trials, operating restrictions, injunctions, suspension of licenses, fines, and criminal penalties.\nRisks Related to Our Reliance on Third Parties\nWe rely on limited sources of supply for our product candidates, and any disruption in the chain of supply may cause delay in developing and commercializing our product candidates.\nAlkermes is currently our sole supplier of bulk injectable meloxicam formulation, and we intend to enter into an agreement with a contract manufacturer for the provision of sterile fill and finish services. Currently, Alkermes is the only established supplier of bulk injectable meloxicam formulation. Although the supply agreement that we have with Alkermes allow us to qualify and purchase from an alternative supplier in certain circumstances, it would be time-consuming and expensive for us to do so, and there can be no assurance that an alternative supplier could be found. The number of potential manufacturers that have the necessary equipment, expertise and governmental licenses to produce our product candidates is limited.\nOur reliance on a limited number of vendors and, in particular, Alkermes, as our single manufacturer of injectable meloxicam, exposes us to risks which could delay FDA approval of our product candidates and commercialization of our products, result in higher costs, or deprive us of potential product revenues. These contract manufacturers may encounter difficulties in achieving the volume of production needed to satisfy clinical or commercial demand, may experience technical issues that impact quality or compliance with applicable and strictly enforced regulations governing the manufacture of pharmaceutical products, may experience shortages of qualified personnel to adequately staff production operations or may increase prices for our product candidates which could impact our ability to effectively compete on price terms. Our contract manufacturers could also default on their agreements with us to meet our requirements for commercialization of injectable meloxicam or our other product candidates.\nOur reliance on third parties reduces our control over our product candidate development and commercialization activities but does not relieve us of our responsibility to ensure compliance with all required legal, regulatory and scientific standards. The FDA and other equivalent regulatory authorities in other countries require that our product candidates and any products that we may eventually commercialize be manufactured according to cGMP and similar foreign standards. Any failure by our third-party manufacturer to comply with cGMP or failure to scale up manufacturing processes, including any failure to deliver sufficient quantities of product candidates in a timely manner, could lead to a delay in, or failure to obtain, regulatory approval of any of our product candidates. In addition, such failure could be the basis for the FDA or equivalent regulatory authorities in other countries to issue a warning or untitled letter, withdraw approvals for product candidates previously granted to us, or take other regulatory or legal action, including recall or seizure, total or partial suspension of production, suspension of ongoing clinical trials, refusal to approve pending applications or supplemental applications, detention or product, refusal to permit the import or export of products, injunction, imposing civil penalties or pursuing criminal prosecution.\nManufacturing issues may arise that could increase product and regulatory approval costs or delay commercialization.\nAs we scale up manufacturing of injectable meloxicam and our other product candidates and conduct required stability testing, product-packaging, equipment and process-related issues may require refinement or resolution in order to proceed with our planned clinical trials and to obtain regulatory approval for commercial marketing. We may identify issues in our product or delivery devices, which could result in increased scrutiny by regulatory authorities, delays in our clinical program and regulatory approvals, increases in our operating expenses, or failure to obtain or maintain approval for our products.\nWe use third parties to assist with conducting, supervising and monitoring portions of our clinical studies, and if those third parties perform in an unsatisfactory manner, it may harm our business.\nWe use third parties to provide certain manufacturing and operational support and for assistance with clinical trials, data management and statistical support. While we have agreements governing their activities, we have limited influence over certain of these third parties\u2019 actual performance. We have previously relied upon such third parties and plan to continue to use third parties to assist with monitoring and managing data for our ongoing clinical programs for injectable meloxicam and our other product candidates, as well as the execution of nonclinical studies. We control only certain aspects of our third parties\u2019 activities. Nevertheless, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our studies is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol, and legal, regulatory and scientific standards, and our use of third parties does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities.\nWe and our contractors are required to comply with cGCPs, which are regulations and guidelines enforced by the FDA and equivalent regulatory authorities in other countries for all of our product candidates in clinical development. The FDA and the equivalent regulatory authorities in other countries enforce these cGCPs through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and clinical trial sites. If we or our contractors fail to comply with applicable cGCPs, the clinical data generated in our\nclinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. In addition, our clinical trials for injectable meloxicam and our other product candidates will require a sufficiently large number of test subjects to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of each product candidate. Accordingly, if our contractors fail to comply with these regulations or fail to recruit a sufficient number of patients, we may be required to repeat the clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process.\nThese contractors may also have relationships with other commercial entities, including our competitors, for whom they may also be conducting clinical studies, or other drug development activities that could harm our competitive position. We face the risk of potential unauthorized disclosure or misappropriation of our intellectual property by our contractors, which may allow our potential competitors to access our proprietary technology. If our contractors do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or fail to meet expected deadlines for items within their purview, or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they oversee is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements or for any other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for, or successfully commercialize injectable meloxicam or our other product candidates. As a result, our financial results and the commercial prospects for injectable meloxicam and any future product candidates that we develop would be harmed, our costs could increase, and our ability to generate revenues could be delayed.\nRisks Related to Commercialization of Our Product Candidates\nIf we are unable to successfully commercialize injectable meloxicam, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected and the price of our common stock may decline.\nEven if we receive regulatory approval from the FDA for the labeling that we request, our ability to successfully commercialize injectable meloxicam will depend on many factors, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe results of our proposed Phase IIIB clinical trials;\n\u2022\nour ability to manufacture commercial quantities of injectable meloxicam at reasonable cost and with sufficient speed to meet commercial demand;\n\u2022\nour ability to build a sales and marketing organization to market injectable meloxicam;\n\u2022\nour success in educating physicians, patients and caregivers about the benefits, administration and use of injectable meloxicam;\n\u2022\nthe availability, perceived advantages, relative cost, relative safety and relative efficacy of competing products;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully defend any challenges to our intellectual property relating to injectable meloxicam;\n\u2022\nthe availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement for injectable meloxicam;\n\u2022\nour ability to contract with specialty pharmaceutical distributors on acceptable terms;\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of our marketing campaigns;\n\u2022\nour effective use of promotional resources;\n\u2022\nour success in obtaining formulary approvals; and\n\u2022\na continued acceptable profile for injectable meloxicam.\nMany of these matters are beyond our control and are subject to other risks described elsewhere in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section. Accordingly, we cannot assure that we will be able to successfully commercialize or generate revenue from injectable meloxicam, even if we receive regulatory approval. If we cannot do so, or are significantly delayed in doing so, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected and the price of our common stock may decline.\nThe commercial success of injectable meloxicam and our other product candidates will depend upon the acceptance of these products by the medical community, including physicians, patients and health care payors.\nPhysicians may not prescribe any of our product candidates if approved by the FDA, in which case we would not generate the revenues we anticipate. The degree of market acceptance of any of our product candidates will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\ndemonstration of clinical safety and efficacy;\n\u2022\nthe prevalence and severity of any AEs;\n\u2022\nthe clinical indications for which each of our product candidates are approved, including any potential additional restrictions placed on each product candidate in connection with its approval;\n\u2022\nlimitations or warnings contained in the FDA-approved label for each product candidate;\n\u2022\nthe results of our proposed Phase IIIB clinical trials;\n\u2022\nrelative convenience and ease of administration of our product candidates;\n\u2022\nprevalence of the condition for which each product candidate is approved;\n\u2022\navailability of alternative treatments and perceived advantages of our product candidates over such alternative treatments;\n\u2022\npricing and cost-effectiveness;\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of our or any future collaborators\u2019 sales and marketing strategies;\n\u2022\nour ability to convince hospitals to include injectable meloxicam and our other product candidates on their list of authorized products, referred to as formulary approval;\n\u2022\nconsolidation among healthcare providers, which increases the impact of the loss of any relationship;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain and maintain sufficient third-party coverage or reimbursement; and\n\u2022\nthe willingness of patients to pay out-of-pocket in the absence of third-party coverage.\nIf injectable meloxicam or any of our other product candidates are approved, but does not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, patients and health care payors, we may not generate sufficient revenue and we may not become or remain profitable. Similar obstacles may arise in other countries.\nIf we are unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell injectable meloxicam or our other product candidates, we may be unable to generate any revenue for injectable meloxicam or our other product candidates.\nWe currently have a limited organization for the sales, marketing and distribution of injectable meloxicam or our other product candidates, and the cost of continuing to establish, expand and maintain such an organization may exceed the cost-effectiveness of doing so. In order to market any products that may be approved, we must build our sales, marketing, managerial and other non-technical capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services. We intend to enter into strategic partnerships with third parties to commercialize our product candidates outside of the United States. We will also consider the option to enter into strategic partnerships for certain product candidates in the United States.\nTo date, we have not entered into any strategic partnerships for any of our product candidates. We face significant competition in seeking appropriate strategic partners, and these strategic partnerships can be intricate and time consuming to negotiate and document. We may not be able to negotiate strategic partnerships on acceptable terms, or at all. We are unable to predict when, if ever, we will enter into any strategic partnerships because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with establishing strategic partnerships.\nOur strategy for injectable meloxicam is to develop a specialty sales force and/or collaborate with third parties to promote the product to healthcare professionals and third-party payors in the United States. Our future collaboration partners, if any, may not dedicate sufficient resources to the commercialization of our product candidates or may otherwise fail in their commercialization due to factors beyond our control. If we are unable to establish effective collaborations to enable the sale of our product candidates to healthcare professionals and in geographic regions, including the United States, that will not be covered by our own marketing and sales force, or if our potential future collaboration partners do not successfully commercialize our product candidates, our ability to generate revenues from product sales will be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to negotiate a strategic partnership or obtain additional financial resources for our other product candidates, we may be forced to curtail the development of them, delay potential commercialization, reduce the scope of our sales or marketing activities or undertake development or commercialization activities at our own expense. In addition, without a partnership, we will bear all the risk related to the development of these other product candidates. If we elect to increase our expenditures to fund development or commercialization activities ourselves, we will need to obtain additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we do not have sufficient funds, we will not be able to bring our other product candidates to market or generate product revenue.\nWe are subject to intense competition and, if we are unable to compete effectively, our product candidates may not reach their commercial potential.\nThe market for our product candidates is characterized by intense competition and rapid technological advances. If our product candidates obtain FDA approval, they will compete with a number of existing and future pharmaceuticals and drug delivery devices developed, manufactured and marketed by others. We will compete against fully integrated pharmaceutical companies and smaller companies that are collaborating with larger pharmaceutical companies, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations.\nIn the post-operative pain relief setting, we believe patients are prescribed injectable acetaminophen, NSAIDs, sodium channel blockers and opioids, depending on the severity of pain. Specifically, acetaminophen, NSAIDs and sodium channel blockers, we believe, are prescribed for mild to moderate pain relief, whereas we believe opioids are prescribed for moderate to severe pain relief. While we will compete with all of these compounds in the post-operative pain setting, we believe injectable meloxicam will be prescribed for moderate to severe pain, competing with opioids and other non-opioid pain treatments. There are a number of pharmaceutical companies that currently market therapeutics in the pain relief area, including Johnson & Johnson, Purdue Pharma, L.P., Mallinckrodt plc, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Inc., Depomed, Inc. and Pacira Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Purdue is the primary competitor in the manufacture, marketing and commercialization of opioid therapeutics. Mallinckrodt commercializes an injectable formulation of acetaminophen. Pacira commercializes an intraoperative formulation of bupivacaine, a sodium channel blocker. Additionally, companies such as Adynxx, Inc., AcelRx Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Durect Corporation, Heron Therapeutics, Inc., Trevena, Inc. and Cara Therapeutics, Inc. are currently developing post-operative pain therapeutics that could compete with us in the future.\nMore established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their greater size, cash flows and institutional experience. Compared to us, many of our competitors may have significantly greater financial, technical and human resources. As a result of these factors, our competitors may have an advantage in marketing their approved products and may obtain regulatory approval of their product candidates before we are able to, which may limit our ability to develop or commercialize our product candidates. Our competitors may also develop drugs that are safer, more effective, more widely used and less expensive than ours, and may also be more successful than us in manufacturing and marketing their products. These advantages could materially impact our ability to develop and commercialize injectable meloxicam and our other product candidates successfully.\nMergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller and early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These third parties compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, management and commercial personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and subject registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.\nWe anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new drugs enter the market and additional technologies become available in the pain management and relief space. Finally, the development of different methods for the treatment of acute pain following surgery could render injectable meloxicam non-competitive or obsolete. These and other risks may materially adversely affect our ability to attain or sustain profitable operations.\nHospital formulary approval and reimbursement may not be available for injectable meloxicam and our other product candidates, which could make it difficult for us to sell our products profitably.\nFailure to obtain timely hospital formulary approval will limit our commercial success. Obtaining hospital formulary approval can be an expensive and time consuming process. We cannot be certain if and when we will obtain the formulary approval to allow us to sell our products into our target markets.\nFurthermore, market acceptance and sales of injectable meloxicam or any future product candidates that we develop, will depend on reimbursement policies and may be affected by future healthcare reform measures. Government authorities and third-party payors, such as private health insurers, hospitals and health maintenance organizations, decide which drugs they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. We cannot be sure that reimbursement will be available for injectable meloxicam or any future\nproduct candidates. Also, reimbursement amounts may reduce the demand for, or the price of, our products. If reimbursement is not available, or is available only to limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize injectable meloxicam or any future product candidates that we develop.\nThe availability of numerous generic pain medications may impact the reimbursement available for meloxicam from some third-party payors. We expect to experience pricing pressures in connection with the sale of injectable meloxicam and any other product candidates that we develop, due to the trend toward managed healthcare and the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations. If we fail to successfully secure and maintain reimbursement coverage for our products, or are significantly delayed in doing so, we will have difficulty achieving market acceptance of our products and our business will be harmed.\nIf we obtain approval to commercialize our products outside of the United States, a variety of risks associated with international operations could materially adversely affect our business.\nIf our product candidates are approved for commercialization, we intend to enter into agreements with third parties to market injectable meloxicam or other product candidates outside the United States and Canada. We expect that we will be subject to additional risks related to entering into international business relationships, including:\n\u2022\ndifferent regulatory requirements for drug approvals in foreign countries;\n\u2022\nreduced protection for intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers and regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\neconomic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets;\n\u2022\ncompliance with tax, employment, immigration and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad;\n\u2022\nforeign taxes, including withholding of payroll taxes;\n\u2022\nforeign currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenues, and other obligations incident to doing business in another country;\n\u2022\nworkforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the United States;\n\u2022\nproduction shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad; and\n\u2022\nbusiness interruptions resulting from geopolitical actions, including war and terrorism, or natural disasters including earthquakes, typhoons, floods and fires.\nThe realization of any of these risks would negatively affect our ability to attain or sustain profitability.\nEven if we are able to commercialize any of our product candidates, these products may become subject to unfavorable pricing regulations, third-party reimbursement practices or healthcare reform initiatives, which could harm our business.\nThe regulations that govern marketing approvals, pricing and reimbursement for new drug products vary widely from country to country. Current and future legislation may significantly change the approval requirements in ways that could involve additional costs and cause delays in obtaining approvals. Some countries require approval of the sale price of a drug before it can be marketed. In many countries, the pricing review period begins after marketing or product licensing approval is granted. In some foreign markets, prescription pharmaceutical pricing remains subject to continuing governmental control even after initial approval is granted. As a result, we might obtain marketing approval for a product in a particular country, but then be subject to price regulations that delay our commercial launch of the product, possibly for lengthy time periods, which could negatively impact the revenues we are able to generate from the sale of the product in that particular country. Adverse pricing limitations may hinder our ability to recoup our investment in one or more product candidates even if our product candidates obtain marketing approval.\nOur ability to commercialize any products successfully also will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available in a timely manner from government third-party payors, including governmental healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations. Government authorities and other third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, determine which medications they will cover and establish reimbursement levels. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA approved products for a particular indication. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved.\nA primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government healthcare programs and other third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy, and have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications. Increasingly, third-party payors are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. Further, if our proposed Phase IIIB clinical trials for IV meloxicam do not show improved outcomes relative to the current standard of care, obtaining payor coverage for IV meloxicam, once approved, could become more difficult in the future. We cannot be sure that coverage and reimbursement will be available promptly or at all for any product that we commercialize and, if reimbursement is available, what the level of reimbursement will be. Moreover, eligibility for coverage and reimbursement does not imply that any drug will be paid for in all cases. Limited coverage may impact the demand for, or the price of, any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval. If coverage and reimbursement are not available or reimbursement is available only to limited levels, we may not successfully commercialize any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval.\nPayors also are increasingly considering new metrics as the basis for reimbursement rates, such as ASP, AMP and actual acquisition cost. The existing data for reimbursement based on these metrics is relatively limited, although certain states have begun to survey acquisition cost data for the purpose of setting Medicaid reimbursement rates. CMS, surveys and publishes retail community pharmacy acquisition cost information in the form of NADAC files to provide state Medicaid agencies with a basis of comparison for their own reimbursement and pricing methodologies and rates. It may be difficult to project the impact of these evolving reimbursement mechanics on the willingness of payors to cover our products for which we receive regulatory approval.\nIf we successfully commercialize any of our products, we may participate in the Medicaid Drug Rebate program, the Public Health Service\u2019s 340B drug pricing program, the FSS pricing program established by Section 603 of the VHCA, and the TRICARE program. These programs are described in greater detail in the section above under \u201cGovernment Regulation\u201d entitled \u201cThird Party Payor Coverage and Reimbursement.\u201d The requirements under the 340B, FSS, and TRICARE programs could reduce the revenue we may generate from any products that are commercialized in the future and could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nThere may be significant delays in obtaining coverage and reimbursement for newly approved drugs, and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the drug is approved by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Moreover, eligibility for coverage and reimbursement does not imply that a drug will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs, including research, development, manufacture, sale and distribution. Interim reimbursement levels for new drugs, if applicable, may also not be sufficient to cover our costs and may only be temporary. Reimbursement rates may vary according to the use of the drug and the clinical setting in which it is used, may be based on reimbursement levels already set for lower cost drugs and may be incorporated into existing payments for other services. Net prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States. Limited coverage may impact the demand for, or the price of, any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval. Third-party payors also may seek additional clinical evidence, including expensive pharmacoeconomic studies beyond the data required to obtain marketing approval, demonstrating clinical benefits and value in specific patient populations, before covering our products for those patients. If reimbursement is available only for limited indications, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval. Our inability to promptly obtain coverage and profitable reimbursement rates from both government-funded and private payors for any approved products that we develop could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, our ability to raise capital needed to commercialize products and our overall financial condition.\nChanges in healthcare law and implementing regulations, including those based on recently enacted and future legislation, as well as changes in healthcare policy, may increase the difficulty and cost for us to commercialize our product candidates and affect the prices we may obtain.\nThe United States and many foreign jurisdictions have enacted or proposed legislative and regulatory changes affecting the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of our product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to profitably sell any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval. The United States government, state legislatures and foreign governments also have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs.\nIn recent years, Congress has considered reductions in Medicare reimbursement levels for drugs administered by physicians. CMS also has authority to revise reimbursement rates and to implement coverage restrictions for some drugs. Cost reduction initiatives and changes in coverage implemented through legislation or regulation could decrease utilization of and reimbursement for any approved products, which in turn would affect the price we can receive for those products. While Medicare regulations apply only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting\ntheir own reimbursement rates. Therefore, any reduction in reimbursement that results from federal legislation or regulation may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors.\nIn March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the Affordable Care Act). This law substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts the pharmaceutical industry. The Affordable Care Act is intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against healthcare fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers, and impose additional health policy reforms. Among other things, the Affordable Care Act expanded manufacturers\u2019 rebate liability under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program by increasing the minimum Medicaid rebate for both branded and generic drugs, expanded the 340B program, and revised the definition of AMP. The legislation also extended Medicaid drug rebates, previously due only on fee-for-service Medicaid utilization, to include the utilization of Medicaid managed care organizations as well and created an alternative rebate formula for certain new formulations of certain existing products that is intended to increase the amount of rebates due on those drugs. On February 1, 2016, CMS issued final regulations to implement the changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate program under the Affordable Care Act. These regulations became effective on April 1, 2016. Moreover, legislative changes to the Affordable Care Act remain possible and appear likely in the 115th United States Congress and under the Trump Administration, which could include changes that, among other things, decrease the number of individuals with health coverage or allow the federal government to negotiate drug prices directly with pharmaceutical manufacturers. We expect that changes to the Affordable Care Act, the Medicare and Medicaid programs, changes allowing the federal government to directly negotiate drug prices, and changes stemming from other healthcare reform measures, especially with regard to healthcare access, financing or other legislation in individual states, could have a material adverse effect on our industry generally and on our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates, if approved.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. For example, beginning April 1, 2013, Medicare payments for all items and services, including drugs and biologics, were reduced by 2% under the sequestration (i.e., automatic spending reductions) required by the Budget Control Act of 2011, as amended by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012. Subsequent legislation extended the 2% reduction, on average, to 2025. Continuation of sequestration or enactment of other reductions in Medicare reimbursement for drugs could affect our ability to achieve a profit on any candidate products that are approved for marketing.\nWe expect that the Affordable Care Act, as well as other healthcare reform measures that have and may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product and could seriously harm our future revenues. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare, Medicaid, or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our products.\nIf we are able to successfully commercialize any of our product candidates and if we participate in the Medicaid drug rebate program or other governmental pricing programs, failure to comply with reporting and payment obligations under these programs could result in additional reimbursement requirements, penalties, sanctions and fines which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nThe Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and other governmental pricing programs require participating manufacturers to report pricing data to the government. Pricing calculations vary among products and programs and include average manufacturer price and best price for the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, average sales price for certain categories of drugs that are paid under Part B of the Medicare program, and non-federal average manufacturer price for the FSS pricing program. If we successfully commercialize any of our product candidates and participate in such governmental pricing programs, we will be liable for errors associated with our submission of pricing data. That liability could be significant. For example, if we are found to have knowingly submitted false average manufacturer price, average sales price, best price, or non-federal average manufacturer price information to the government, we may be liable for civil monetary penalties in the amount of $178,156 per item of false information. If we are found to have made a misrepresentation in the reporting of average sales price, the statute provides for civil monetary penalties of up to $12,856 for each misrepresentation for each day in which the misrepresentation was applied. Our failure to submit monthly/quarterly average manufacturer price, average sales price, and best price, and quarterly/annual non-federal average manufacturer price data on a timely basis could result in a civil monetary penalty of $17,816 per day for each day the information is late beyond the due date. Such failure also could be grounds for other sanctions, such as termination from the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.\nRisks Related to Our CDMO Division\nRevenues from our development, formulation and manufacturing business are dependent on a small number of commercial partners, and the loss of one of these partners, or a decline in their orders, may adversely affect our business.\nOur CDMO division is dependent on our relationships with a small number of commercial partners, with our four largest customers (Novartis AG, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Inc., Pernix Therapeutics, Inc. and Lannett Company, Inc.) having generated 97% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016, of which one customer generated 45% of our revenue under two separate customer agreements, and another customer generated 36% of our revenue under one customer agreement. Our contracts with our commercial partners are for a short term, generally one year. If any one or more of these commercial partners fails to renew their contract, significantly reduces their purchasing volume or experiences financial difficulties such as bankruptcy, our revenues could be adversely affected. We are actively seeking to develop new customer relationships but there can be no guarantee that we will be able to expand our customer base.\nOur royalty, profit sharing and manufacturing revenues from this business also depend on the ability of our commercial partners to effectively market and sell their products to their customers. A commercial partner may choose to devote its efforts to its other products or reduce or fail to devote the necessary resources to provide effective sales and marketing support of the products we manufacture and supply. Our commercial partners face competition from other pharmaceutical companies for sales of products to end users. Competition from sellers of generic drugs is a major challenge for our commercial partners, and the loss or expiration of intellectual property rights for the products we manufacture can have a significant adverse effect on their sales volume. This and any other significant reduction, delay or cancellation of orders from our commercial partners could adversely affect our revenues.\nIn addition, the financial covenants in our credit agreement with OrbiMed include minimum revenue targets for our CDMO division, and any significant reduction, delay or cancellation of orders from our commercial partners may cause us to fail to meet such targets, which may result in an event of default under the credit agreement with OrbiMed and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nWe are subject to risks related to large-scale commercial manufacturing.\nManufacturing pharmaceuticals, especially in large quantities, is complex. The products we manufacture for our commercial partners require several manufacturing steps and may involve complex techniques to assure quality and sufficient quantity. Our manufactured products must be made consistently and in compliance with a clearly defined manufacturing process. Slight deviations anywhere in the manufacturing process, including obtaining materials, equipment malfunctions, filling, labeling, packaging, storage, shipping, regulatory compliance, quality control and testing, some of which all pharmaceutical manufacturing companies experience from time to time, may result in lot failures, delay in the release of lots, product recalls or spoilage. Success rates can vary dramatically at different stages of the manufacturing process, which can lower yields and increase costs.\nIn addition, we rely on a limited number of suppliers to provide the raw materials needed for the manufacture of these products. We may experience deviations in the manufacturing process or interruptions in our supply chain that may take significant time and resources to resolve and, if unresolved, may affect manufacturing output and/or cause us to fail to satisfy customer orders or contractual commitments or result in litigation or regulatory action.\nOur manufacturing facility also requires specialized personnel and is expensive to operate and maintain. Any suspension of the sale of products of our commercial partners to be manufactured in our facility may cause operating losses as we continue to operate the facility and retain specialized personnel. In addition, any interruption in manufacturing could result in delays in meeting our contractual obligations and could damage our relationships with our commercial partners, including the loss of manufacturing and supply rights.\nOur development and formulation services projects are typically for a shorter term than our manufacturing projects, and any failure by us to maintain a high volume of development and formulation services projects, including due to lower than expected success rates of the products for which we provide services, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur pharmaceutical development services business contracts are generally shorter in term than our manufacturing contracts and typically require us to provide development services within a designated scope. Since our development and formulation services focus on products that are still in developmental stages, their viability depends on the ability of such products to reach their respective subsequent development phases. In many cases, such products do not reach subsequent development phases and, as a result, the profitability of the related pharmaceutical development service project may be limited. Even if a customer wishes to proceed with a project, the product we are developing on such customer\u2019s behalf may fail to receive necessary regulatory approval or may have its development hindered by other factors, such as the development of a competing product.\nIf we are unable to continue to obtain new projects from existing and new customers, our development and formulation services business could be adversely affected. Furthermore, although our development and formulation services business acts as a pipeline for our manufacturing services business, we cannot predict the conversion rate of our development and formulation services projects to commercial manufacturing services projects, or how successful we will be in winning new projects that lead to a viable product. As such, an increase in the turnover rate of our development and formulation services projects may negatively affect our manufacturing services business at a later time. In addition, the discontinuation of a project as a result of our failure to satisfy a customer\u2019s requirements may also affect our ability to obtain future projects from such customer, as well as from new customers. Any failure by us to maintain a high volume of development and formulation services projects could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we fail to meet the stringent requirements of governmental regulation in the manufacture of pharmaceutical products, we could incur substantial costs and a reduction in revenues.\nWe are required to maintain compliance with cGMP, and our manufacturing facility is subject to inspections by the FDA and other global regulators to confirm such compliance. Changes of suppliers or modifications of methods of manufacturing may require amending our application(s) to the FDA and acceptance of the change by the FDA prior to release of our manufactured products. Because we produce multiple products at our manufacturing facility, there are increased risks associated with cGMP compliance. Our inability to demonstrate ongoing cGMP compliance could require us to engage in lengthy and expensive remediation efforts, withdraw or recall products and/or interrupt commercial supply of any products. Any delay, interruption or other issue that arises in the manufacture, fill/finish, packaging, or storage of any drug product as a result of a failure of our facility to pass any regulatory agency inspection or maintain cGMP compliance could significantly impair our relationships with our commercial partners, which would substantially harm our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition. Any finding of non-compliance could also increase our costs and cause us to lose revenue from manufactured products, which could be seriously detrimental to our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition.\nAdditionally, our manufacturing activities are subject to the Controlled Substances Act and the regulations of the DEA. Accordingly, we must adhere to a number of requirements with respect to controlled substances, including registration, recordkeeping and reporting requirements; labeling and packaging requirements; security controls, procurement and manufacturing quotas; and certain restrictions on refills. Failure to maintain compliance with applicable requirements can result in enforcement action that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. The DEA may seek civil penalties, refuse to renew necessary registrations or initiate proceedings to revoke those registrations. In certain circumstances, violations could result in criminal proceedings.\nWe may not be able to successfully offer new services.\nIn order to successfully compete, we will need to offer and develop new services. Without the timely introduction of enhanced or new services, our services and capabilities may become obsolete over time, in which case, our revenues and operating results would suffer. The related development costs may require a substantial investment before we can determine their commercial viability, and we may not have the financial resources to fund such initiatives.\nIn addition, the success of enhanced or new services will depend on several factors, including but not limited to our ability to:\n\u2022\nproperly anticipate and satisfy customer needs, including increasing demand for lower cost services;\n\u2022\nenhance, innovate, develop and manufacture new offerings in an economical and timely manner;\n\u2022\ndifferentiate our offerings from competitors\u2019 offerings;\n\u2022\nmeet quality requirements, authorization requirements, and other regulatory requirements of government agencies;\n\u2022\nobtain valid and enforceable intellectual property rights; and\n\u2022\navoid infringing the proprietary rights of third parties.\nEven if we were to succeed in creating enhanced or new services, those services may not result in commercially successful offerings or may not produce revenues in excess of the costs of development and capital investment and may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences or by technologies or features offered by our competitors. In addition, innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace due to, among other things, entrenched patterns of clinical practice, the need for regulatory clearance and uncertainty over market access or government or third-party reimbursement.\nTechnological change may cause our offerings to become obsolete over time. A decrease in our customers\u2019 purchases of our offerings could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe healthcare industry is characterized by rapid technological change. Demand for our services may change in ways that we may not anticipate because of evolving industry standards or as a result of evolving customer needs that are increasingly sophisticated and varied or because of the introduction by competitors of new services and technologies. In addition, we require capital and resources to support the maintenance and improvement of our facilities, including replacing or repairing aging production equipment and updating overall facility master plans. If we are unable to maintain and improve our facilities, we may experience unscheduled equipment downtime and unpredicted machinery failure and become unable to supply our customers with products or services which may affect business continuity. Any such incident or disruption in business continuity could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be adversely affected by natural disasters or other events that disrupt our business operations, and our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not adequately protect us from a serious disaster.\nOur manufacturing facility is located in Gainesville, Georgia, where natural disasters or similar events, like blizzards, tornadoes, fires, floods or explosions or large-scale accidents or power outages, could severely disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition. If a disaster, power outage or other event occurred that prevented us from using all or a significant portion of our Gainesville facility, damaged critical infrastructure, such as manufacturing resource planning and enterprise quality systems, or otherwise disrupted operations at that location, it may be difficult or, in certain cases, impossible for us to continue our development, formulation and manufacturing business for a substantial period of time.\nCurrently, we maintain insurance coverage against damage to our property and equipment, and to cover business interruption expenses, in an amount we believe is sufficient for our development, formulation and manufacturing operations. However, there can be no assurance that such insurance will continue to be available on acceptable terms or that such insurance will provide adequate protection against actual losses. Even if we maintain adequate insurance coverage, claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations and on our ability to obtain suitable, adequate or cost-effective insurance in the future.\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations and Industry\nOur future success depends on our ability to retain and have the full attention of our key executives as well as to attract, retain and motivate other qualified personnel.\nWe are highly dependent on the principal members of our executive team and, in particular, the services of Gerri A. Henwood, our President and Chief Executive Officer, the loss of whose services would adversely impact the achievement of our objectives. We have entered into employment agreements with each of our executive officers. Recruiting and retaining qualified employees for our business, including scientific and technical personnel, will also be critical to our success. There is currently a shortage of skilled executives in our industry, which is likely to continue. As a result, competition for skilled personnel is intense and the turnover rate can be high. We may not be able to attract and retain personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical companies for individuals with similar skill sets. In addition, failure to succeed in clinical studies may make it more challenging to recruit and retain qualified personnel. The inability to recruit or loss of the services of any executive or key employee could impede the progress of our research, development and commercialization objectives.\nWe will need to grow the size of our organization, and we may experience difficulties in managing this growth.\nAs our development and commercialization strategies develop, we will need additional managerial, operational, sales, marketing, financial and other resources. Our management, personnel and systems currently in place may not be adequate to support this future growth. We may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations, which may result in weaknesses in our infrastructure, give rise to operational mistakes, loss of business opportunities, loss of employees and reduced productivity among remaining employees. Future growth could require significant capital expenditures and may divert financial resources from other projects, such as the development of our existing or future product candidates. Future growth would impose significant added responsibilities on members of management, including:\n\u2022\nmanaging the commercialization of any FDA-approved product candidates;\n\u2022\noverseeing our ongoing clinical trials effectively;\n\u2022\nidentifying, recruiting, maintaining, motivating and integrating additional employees, including any sales and marketing personnel engaged in connection with the commercialization of any approved product;\n\u2022\nmanaging our internal development efforts effectively while complying with our contractual obligations to licensors, licensees, contractors and other third parties;\n\u2022\nimproving our managerial, development, operational and financial systems and procedures; and\n\u2022\nexpanding our facilities.\nAs our operations expand, we will need to manage additional relationships with various strategic collaborators, suppliers and other third parties. Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize our product candidates and to compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to manage any future growth effectively. To that end, we must be able to manage our development efforts and clinical trials effectively and hire, train and integrate additional management, administrative and sales and marketing personnel. We may not be able to accomplish these tasks, and our failure to accomplish any of them could prevent us from successfully growing our company.\nWe may acquire other assets or businesses, or form collaborations or make investments in other companies or technologies, that could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, dilute our shareholders\u2019 ownership, increase our debt or cause us to incur significant expense.\nAs part of our business strategy, we may pursue acquisitions of assets, including preclinical, clinical or commercial stage products or product candidates, businesses or strategic alliances and collaborations, to expand our existing technologies and operations. We may not identify or complete these transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, or at all, and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of any such transaction, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates, and if we make any acquisitions, we may not be able to integrate these acquisitions successfully into our existing business and we may incur additional debt or assume unknown or contingent liabilities in connection therewith. Integration of an acquired company or assets may also disrupt ongoing operations, require the hiring of additional personnel and the implementation of additional internal systems and infrastructure, especially the acquisition of commercial assets, and require management resources that would otherwise focus on developing our existing business. While we have successfully integrated the assets that we purchased in the Gainesville Transaction into our infrastructure, we cannot assure that the experience would be the same for future acquisitions. We may not be able to find suitable strategic alliance or collaborators or identify other investment opportunities, and we may experience losses related to any such investments.\nTo finance any acquisitions or collaborations, we may choose to issue debt or shares of our common or preferred stock as consideration. Any such issuance of shares would dilute the ownership of our shareholders. If the price of our common stock is low or volatile, we may not be able to acquire other assets or companies or fund a transaction using our stock as consideration. Alternatively, it may be necessary for us to raise additional funds for acquisitions through public or private financings. Additional funds may not be available on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.\nOur employees, partners, independent contractors, principal investigators, consultants, vendors and contract research organizations may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements.\nWe are exposed to the risk that our employees, partners, independent contractors, principal investigators, consultants, vendors and CROs may engage in fraudulent or other illegal activity with respect to our business. Misconduct by these employees could include intentional, reckless and/or negligent conduct or unauthorized activity that violates: (1) FDA or DEA regulations, including those laws requiring the reporting of true, complete and accurate information to the FDA; (2) manufacturing standards; (3) federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations; or (4) laws that require the true, complete and accurate reporting of financial information or data. Activities subject to these laws also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, or illegal misappropriation of drug product, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. Any incidents or any other conduct that leads to an employee receiving an FDA debarment could result in a loss of business from our partners and severe reputational harm. We have adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, but it is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe must comply with environmental and health and safety laws and regulations, which can be expensive and restrict how we do business.\nIn connection with our CDMO division, we are subject to federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations and policies concerning the environment and the health and safety of our employees. Although we believe that we have complied with the applicable laws, regulations and policies in all material respects and have not been required to correct any material noncompliance, we may be required to incur significant costs to comply with environmental and health and safety regulations in the future. Current or future laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.\nIn addition, our business conducted by our CDMO division involves the use, generation and disposal of hazardous materials, including chemicals, solvents, agents and biohazardous materials. As a result, we are subject to federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations and policies governing the use, generation, manufacture, storage, air emission, effluent discharge, handling and disposal of certain materials, biological specimens and wastes. Although we believe that our safety procedures for storing, handling and disposing of such materials comply with the standards prescribed by those regulations, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. We currently contract with third parties to dispose of these substances that we generate, and we rely on these third parties to properly dispose of these substances in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. If these third parties do not properly dispose of these substances in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, we may be subject to legal action by governmental agencies or private parties for improper disposal of these substances. The costs of defending such actions and the potential liability resulting from such actions are often very large. In the event we are subject to such legal action or we otherwise fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations governing the use, generation and disposal of hazardous materials and chemicals, we could be held liable for any damages that result, and any such liability could exceed our resources.\nAlthough we maintain workers\u2019 compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees, including those resulting from the use of hazardous materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities.\nWe face potential product liability claims, and, if successful claims are brought against us, we may incur substantial liability.\nThe use of our product candidates in clinical studies and the sale of any products for which we obtain marketing approval exposes us to the risk of product liability claims. In addition, our CDMO division exposes us to potential toxic tort and other types of product liability claims that are inherent in the manufacture of pharmaceutical products. Product liability claims might be brought against us by consumers, health care providers, pharmaceutical companies or others selling or otherwise coming into contact with our products. If we cannot successfully defend against product liability claims, we could incur substantial liability and costs. In addition, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in:\n\u2022\nimpairment of our business reputation and negative media attention;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of clinical study participants;\n\u2022\ntermination of clinical trial sites;\n\u2022\ncosts due to related litigation;\n\u2022\ndistraction of management\u2019s attention from our primary business;\n\u2022\ndecreased demand for our manufacturing services or loss of any of our commercial partners;\n\u2022\nsubstantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants;\n\u2022\nthe inability to commercialize our product candidates;\n\u2022\ndecreased demand for our product candidates, if approved for commercial sale; and/or\n\u2022\nincreased scrutiny and potential investigation by, among others, the FDA, the Department of Justice, the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, State Attorneys General, members of Congress and the public.\nOur current product liability insurance coverage of $15.0 million may not be sufficient to reimburse us for any expenses or losses we may suffer. Moreover, insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive and, in the future, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to liability. If and when we obtain marketing approval for our product candidates, we intend to expand our insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial products; however, we may be unable to obtain product liability insurance on commercially reasonable terms or in adequate amounts.\nOn occasion, large judgments have been awarded in class action lawsuits based on drugs that had unanticipated AEs. A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us could cause our stock price to decline and, if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could adversely affect our results of operations and business.\nWe incur increased costs and demands upon our management as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public companies, which could harm our operating results.\nWe are a public company and, as such, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses, including costs associated with public company reporting requirements. We incur costs associated with current corporate governance requirements, including certain of the requirements under Section 404 and other provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as rules implemented by the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, and the NASDAQ Capital Market, the stock exchange on which our common stock is listed. If we fail to comply with current corporate governance requirements, our business may be negatively affected, including by having our common stock delisted from the NASDAQ Capital Market.\nThe expenses incurred by public companies for reporting and corporate governance purposes have increased dramatically in recent years. We expect these rules and regulations to continue to substantially increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time-consuming and costly. We are unable to currently estimate these costs with any degree of certainty. We also expect that these rules and regulations may make it difficult and expensive for us to continue to maintain director and officer liability insurance, and if we are able to maintain such insurance, we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage available to privately-held companies. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our board of directors, or the board, or as our executive officers.\nThe security of our information technology systems may be compromised, and confidential information, including non-public personal information that we maintain, could be improperly disclosed.\nOur information technology systems may be vulnerable to physical or electronic intrusions, computer viruses or other attacks. As part of our business, we maintain large amounts of confidential information, including non-public personal information on patients and our employees. Breaches in security could result in the loss or misuse of this information, which could, in turn, result in potential regulatory actions or litigation, including material claims for damages, interruption to our operations, damage to our reputation or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. Although we believe we have appropriate information security policies and systems in place in order to prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of confidential information, including non-public personal information, there can be no assurance that such use or disclosure will not occur.\nIf we fail to comply with data protection laws and regulations, we could be subject to government enforcement actions (which could include civil or criminal penalties), private litigation and/or adverse publicity, which could negatively affect our operating results and business.\nWe are subject to data protection laws and regulations (i.e., laws and regulations that address privacy and data security). In the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including state data breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws (e.g., Section 5 of the FTC Act and HIPAA), govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information. Failure to comply with data protection laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions and create liability for us (which could include civil and/or criminal penalties), private litigation and/or adverse publicity that could negatively affect our operating results and business.\nOur business and operations would suffer in the event of system failures.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. Such an event could cause interruption of our operations. For example, the loss of data from completed or ongoing clinical trials for our product candidates could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of or damage to our data, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and the development of our product candidates could be delayed.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nWe own or license numerous pending patent applications and issued patents in the United States. If our pending patent applications fail to issue or if our issued patents expire or are successfully opposed, invalidated, or rendered unenforceable, our business will be adversely affected.\nOur commercial success will depend in part on obtaining and maintaining patent protection for our product candidates, as well as successfully defending our current and future patents against third-party challenges. To protect our proprietary technology, we intend to rely on patents, and we may also rely on other intellectual property protections, including trade secrets, nondisclosure agreements and confidentiality provisions.\nThere can be no assurance that our pending patent applications will result in issued patents. As of December 31, 2016, we own patents and patent applications for injectable meloxicam that cover compositions, including compositions produced using NanoCrystal\u00ae technology, method of making and method of treating. These issued patents expire in 2022 in the United States. We also in-license from Alkermes, on a perpetual royalty-free basis, composition and methods of making patent and patent applications (specifically directed to the prevention of flake like substances) which expire in 2030. As of December 31, 2016, we own five patents relating to Zohydro-ER\u00ae, which have expiration dates of November 1, 2019, November 1, 2019, September 12, 2034, September 12, 2034 and September 12, 2034. We also own Canadian patent applications that are still pending relating to the same technology, which we license to our commercial partner, Paladin Labs Inc., in Canada. As of December 31, 2016, we are the owner of record of four issued U.S. patents related to Fado and eight issued foreign patents to Dex. As of December 31, 2016, we are also the owner of record and are prosecuting three U.S. non-provisional patent applications and 39 foreign national patent applications related to either Dex or Fado. In addition, we have recently received ownership from Orion of one issued U.S. patent and 49 granted foreign patents (including numerous European Patent Office member and extension states as well as Eurasian members) related to a pro-drug of Fado. The patent applications that we have filed and have not yet been granted may fail to result in issued patents in the United States or in foreign countries. Even if the patents do successfully issue, third parties may challenge the patents or the inventorship thereof, which can lead to an issued patent being found invalid, unenforceable or can otherwise alter the ownership of the patents.\nThe issuance of any patent is not a certainty. Unless and until our pending applications issue, their protective scope is impossible to determine. It is impossible to predict whether or how many of these applications will result in issued patents and patents that issue may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. Such challenges may result in loss of patent exclusivity or freedom to operate or in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, in whole or in part, which may limit our ability to prevent others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our technology and products. In addition, upon expiration of a patent, we may be limited in our ability to prevent others from using or commercializing subject matter covered by the expired patents. As a result, our owned and licensed patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours. The composition of matter patents for Dex and Fado are licensed from Orion. The composition of matter patent for Dex expired in January 2014, and the composition of matter patent for Fado expired in October 2016. The composition of matter patent for a single pro-drug of Fado will expire in April 2025. If no additional patent protection is obtained, these patent expirations will impact our ability to prevent third parties from marketing generic equivalents.\nThe patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, including us, generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions and has in recent years been the subject of much litigation. In addition, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. For example, European patent law restricts the patentability of methods of treatment of the human body more than United States law does. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after the first filing, or in some case at all. Therefore, we cannot know with certainty whether we were the first to make the inventions claimed in our owned or licensed patents or pending patent applications, or that we were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patent rights are highly uncertain. Our pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued which protect our technology or products, in whole or in part, or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of patents or narrow the scope of patent protection.\nPatent reform legislation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of patent applications and the enforcement or defense of issued patents. On September 16, 2011, the Leahy Smith America Invents Act, or the Leahy Smith Act, was signed into law. The Leahy Smith Act includes a number of significant changes to United States patent law. These include provisions that affect the way patent applications are prosecuted and may also affect patent litigation. The United States Patent Office continues to develop and implement new regulations and procedures to govern administration of the Leahy Smith Act, and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the Leahy Smith Act, and in particular, the first to file provisions, only became effective on March 16, 2013. Accordingly, it is not clear what, if any, impact the Leahy Smith Act will have on the operation of our\nbusiness. However, the Leahy Smith Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patent, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nWe do not own worldwide rights to all of our product candidates or the exclusive rights to all formulations.\nWe own worldwide rights to injectable meloxicam. We have an exclusive license from Orion for the development and, subsequent to approval, the commercialization of Dex-IN for use in the treatment of pain in humans the licensed dosage forms, but specifically excluding delivery vehicles for administration by injection or infusion, in the Territory. Orion retains the rights to develop and commercialize Dex for all uses and indications other than pain in humans and for use in combination products in that field, and we have granted Orion a license to use our clinical trial data, patents and know-how for such purpose; provided, however that Orion cannot undertake development activities in the United States, Australia or South Africa with respect to treatment of pain in humans in any licensed dosage form until four years after our first product is granted regulatory approval in the United States. It is possible, therefore, that Orion may develop and commercialize competing products in the territories retained by it and/or combination products for Dex in the Territory. We are unaware of any such programs at Orion at this time. We have a right of first refusal to commercialize any such product developed by Orion in the Territory. However, there is no guarantee that we would have the resources to exercise this right or, if we did, that we would be able to reach mutually agreeable terms with Orion.\nLitigation involving patents, patent applications and other proprietary rights is expensive and time consuming. If we are involved in such litigation, it could cause delays in bringing our product candidates to market and interfere with our business.\nOur commercial success depends in part on not infringing patents and proprietary rights of third parties. Although we are not currently aware of litigation or other proceedings or third-party claims of intellectual property infringement related to our product candidates, the pharmaceutical industry is characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights.\nAs we enter our target markets, it is possible that competitors or other third parties will claim that our products and/or processes infringe their intellectual property rights. These third parties may have obtained and may in the future obtain patents covering products or processes that are similar to, or may include compositions or methods that encompass our technology, allowing them to claim that the use of our technologies infringes these patents. If such third-party patent is listed in the Orange Book, we would be required to file a certification, known as a Paragraph IV certification, that we are not infringing the patent, or that the patent is invalid. The third-party would then have 45 days to file a patent infringement lawsuit against us, and if so brought, we could be subject to a stay of up to 30 months (unless before that time the patent expires or is judged to be invalid or not infringed), in which we would be unable to have our 505(b)(2) application approved.\nIn a patent infringement claim against us, we may assert, as a defense, that we do not infringe the relevant patent claims, that the patent is invalid or both. The strength of our defenses will depend on the patents asserted, the interpretation of these patents and/or our ability to invalidate the asserted patents. However, we could be unsuccessful in advancing non-infringement and/or invalidity arguments in our defense. In the United States, issued patents enjoy a presumption of validity, and the party challenging the validity of a patent claim must present clear and convincing evidence of invalidity, which is a high burden of proof. Conversely, the patent owner need only prove infringement by a preponderance of the evidence, which is a low burden of proof.\nIf we were found by a court to have infringed a valid patent claim, we could be prevented from using the patented technology or be required to pay the owner of the patent for the right to license the patented technology. If we decide to pursue a license to one or more of these patents, we may not be able to obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, or the license we obtain may require us to pay substantial royalties or grant cross licenses to our patent rights. For example, if the relevant patent is owned by a competitor, that competitor may choose not to license patent rights to us. If we decide to develop alternative technology, we may not be able to do so in a timely or cost-effective manner, if at all.\nIn addition, because patent applications can take years to issue and are often afforded confidentiality for some period of time, there may currently be pending applications, unknown to us, that later result in issued patents that could cover one or more of our products.\nIt is possible that we may in the future receive, particularly as a public company, communications from competitors and other companies alleging that we may be infringing their patents, trade secrets or other intellectual property rights, offering licenses to such intellectual property or threatening litigation. In addition to patent infringement claims, third parties may assert copyright, trademark or other proprietary rights against us. We may need to expend considerable resources to counter such claims and may not be able to be successful in our defense. Our business may suffer if a finding of infringement is established.\nGeneric competitors can challenge the U.S. patents protecting our product candidates by filing an ANDA or an NDA for a generic or a modified version of our product candidates and negatively affect our competitive position.\nSeparate and apart from the protection provided under the U.S. patent laws, drug candidates may be subject to the provisions of the Hatch-Waxman Act, which may provide drug candidates with either a three- or five-year period of marketing exclusivity following receipt of FDA approval. The Hatch-Waxman Act prohibits the FDA from accepting the filing of an ANDA application (for a generic product) or a 505(b)(2) NDA (for a modified version of the product) for three years for active drug ingredients previously approved by the FDA or for five years for active drug ingredients not previously approved by the FDA.\nThere is an exception, however, for newly approved molecules that allows competitors to challenge a patent beginning four years into the five-year exclusivity period by alleging that one or more of the patents listed in the FDA\u2019s list of approved drug products are invalid, unenforceable and/or not infringed and submitting an ANDA for a generic version of a drug candidate. This patent challenge is commonly known as a Paragraph IV certification. Within the past several years, the generic industry has aggressively pursued approvals of generic versions of innovator drugs at the earliest possible point in time.\nIf a generic company is able to successfully challenge the patents covering drug candidates by obtaining FDA approval for an ANDA, the generic company may choose to launch a generic version of a drug candidate. Any launch of a generic version of our drug candidates prior to the expiration of patent protection will have a material adverse effect on our revenues and our results of operations.\nWe and our commercial partners have been involved in Paragraph IV litigation in the United States involving our patents in respect of Zohydro ER\u00ae. These litigations have been, and any other Paragraph IV litigation may be, expensive, distracting to management and protracted. We and our commercial partners have been successful or have settled our Paragraph IV litigation to date, but any future Paragraph IV litigation could result in new or additional generic competition to Zohydro ER\u00ae. The introduction of a generic version of Zohydro ER\u00ae could cause a reduction in product revenue for our manufacturing business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. In addition, we are currently involved in an interference in front of the United States Patent and Trademark Office with another party, which involves a patent application relating to Zohydro ER\u00ae, for which we and the other party each received an adverse decision with regard to the interference claims. The other party has appealed their interference claims to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, and we intend to vigorously defend the prior decision of the United States Patent and Trademark Office. The interference could result in the issuance of a patent that could limit our freedom to operate in respect to Zohydro ER\u00ae, which could also cause a reduction in product revenue for our manufacturing business and have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nIt is difficult and costly to protect our proprietary rights, and we may not be able to ensure their protection.\nThe patent positions of pharmaceutical companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles remain unresolved. No consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in pharmaceutical patents has emerged in the United States to date. The pharmaceutical patent situation outside of the United States is even more uncertain. Changes in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property. Accordingly, we cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in the patents that may be issued from the applications we currently or may in the future own or license from third parties. Further, if any patent license we obtain is deemed invalid and/or unenforceable, it could impact our ability to commercialize or partner our technology.\nThe degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain, and we cannot ensure that:\n\u2022\nwe were the first to make the inventions covered by each of our pending patent applications;\n\u2022\nwe were the first to file patent applications for these inventions;\n\u2022\nothers will not independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies;\n\u2022\nan individual or party will not challenge inventorship, that if successful, could have an adverse effect on our business;\n\u2022\nany patents issued to us or our collaborators will provide a basis for commercially viable products, will provide us with any competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties; or\n\u2022\nthe patents of others will not have an adverse effect on our business.\nIf we do not adequately protect our proprietary rights, competitors may be able to use our technologies and erode or negate any competitive advantage we may possess, which could materially harm our business, negatively affect our position in the marketplace, limit our ability to commercialize our product candidates and delay or render impossible our achievement of profitability.\nWe may be unable to adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information.\nIn the future, we may rely on trade secrets to protect our proprietary know-how and technological advances, especially where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. We rely in part on confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information. These agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. In addition, others may independently discover our trade secrets and proprietary information. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights. Failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could enable competitors to use our proprietary information to develop products that compete with our products or cause additional, material adverse effects upon our competitive business position.\nPeriodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees and various other governmental fees on patents and/or applications will be due to be paid to the United States Patent and Trademark Office and various foreign governmental patent agencies in several stages over the lifetime of the patents and/or applications.\nWe have systems in place to remind us to pay periodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees and various other patent and application fees, and we employ an outside law firm to pay these fees. The USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. We employ an outside law firm and other professionals to help us comply, and in many cases, an inadvertent lapse can be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules. However, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. If this occurs, our competitors may be able to enter the market, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may not be able to enforce our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nThe laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in certain foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of some countries, particularly developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, especially those relating to life sciences. This could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or the misappropriation of our other intellectual property rights. For example, many foreign countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner must grant licenses to third parties. In addition, many countries limit the enforceability of patents against third parties, including government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, patents may provide limited or no benefit.\nProceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business. Accordingly, our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights in such countries may be inadequate. In addition, changes in the law and legal decisions by courts in the United States and foreign countries may affect our ability to obtain adequate protection for our technology and the enforcement of intellectual property.\nWe have not yet registered our trademarks, and failure to secure those registrations could adversely affect our business.\nWe have not registered our Recro trademark in the United States or the other potential markets for our products. It is possible that when we do file for such registrations one or more of the applications could be subject to opposition or cancellation after the marks are registered. The registrations, if they become effective, will be subject to use and maintenance requirements. It is also possible that there are names or symbols other than \u201cRecro Pharma\u201d and \u201cRecro Gainesville\u201d that may be protectable marks for which we have not sought registration, and failure to secure those registrations could adversely affect our business. Opposition or cancellation proceedings may be filed against our future trademark registrations and the trademarks may not survive such proceedings.\nOur ability to manufacture products for our commercial partners may be impaired if any of our manufacturing activities, or the activities of third parties involved in our manufacture and supply chain, are found to infringe patents of others.\nOur ability to continue to manufacture Ritalin LA\u00ae, Focalin XR\u00ae, Verelan PM\u00ae, generic Verapamil and Zohydro ER\u00ae for our commercial partners, to utilize third parties to supply raw materials or other products, or to perform fill/finish services or other steps in our manufacture and supply chain, depends on our and their ability to operate without infringing the patents and other intellectual property rights of others. Other parties may allege that our manufacturing activities, or the activities of third parties involved in our manufacturing and supply chain, infringe patents or other intellectual property rights. A judicial decision in favor of one or more\nparties making such allegations could preclude the manufacture of the products to which those intellectual property rights apply, which could materially harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nRisks Relating to Our Securities\nIf securities or industry analysts do not continue to publish research or reports, or if they publish unfavorable research or reports, about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us, our business, our market or our competitors. We currently have limited research coverage by securities and industry analysts. If additional securities or industry analysts do not commence coverage of our company, the trading price for our stock could be negatively impacted. In the event we obtain securities or industry analyst coverage, if one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases to cover us or fails to regularly publish reports on us, interest in our stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nWe have never paid dividends on our common stock and do not intend to do so for the foreseeable future.\nWe have never paid dividends on our common stock and we do not anticipate that we will pay any dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, any return on an investment in our common stock will be realized, if at all, only when shareholders sell their shares. In addition, our failure to pay dividends may make our stock less attractive to investors, adversely impacting trading volume and price.\nThe concentration of our capital stock ownership with our directors and their affiliated entities and our executive officers will limit shareholders\u2019 abilities to influence certain corporate matters.\nOur directors and their affiliated entities, and our executive officers, beneficially own, in the aggregate, approximately 17.3% of our outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2016. As a result, these shareholders are collectively able to influence matters requiring approval of our shareholders, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions, such as mergers, consolidations or the sale of all or substantially all of our assets. Such influence may delay, prevent or deter a change in control of our company, even when such a change may be in the best interests of some shareholders, impede a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving us, or could deprive our shareholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of our company or our assets and might adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock.\nThe market price and trading volume of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile, which could result in rapid and substantial losses for our shareholders.\nThe market price for our common stock has been volatile and may continue to fluctuate or may decline significantly in the future. An active, liquid and orderly market for our common stock may not be sustained, which could depress the trading price of our common stock or cause it to continue to be highly volatile or subject to wide fluctuations. Some of the factors that could negatively affect our share price or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of our common stock include, among other things:\n\u2022\nFDA, state or international regulatory actions, including actions on regulatory applications for any of our product candidates;\n\u2022\nlegislative or regulatory changes;\n\u2022\njudicial pronouncements interpreting laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nchanges in government programs;\n\u2022\nannouncements of new products, services or technologies, commercial relationships, acquisitions or other events by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nmarket conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in stock market prices and trading volumes of similar companies;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting principles;\n\u2022\nlitigation or public concern about the safety of our product candidates or similar product candidates;\n\u2022\nsales of large blocks of our common stock, including sales by our executive officers, directors and significant shareholders; and\n\u2022\nactions by institutional shareholders.\nThese broad market and industry factors may decrease the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. The stock market in general has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations, including recently. In addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and decreases in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources.\nThe JOBS Act allows us to postpone the date by which we must comply with certain laws and regulations and to reduce the amount of information provided in reports filed with the SEC. We cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (1) the beginning of the first fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering, or January 1, 2020, (2) the beginning of the first fiscal year after our annual gross revenue is $1.0 billion or more, (3) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities and (4) as of the end of any fiscal year in which the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeded $700 million as of the end of the second quarter of that fiscal year.\nFor as long as we remain an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation and financial statements in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote to approve executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. In addition, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, for complying with new or revised accounting standards. An emerging growth company can therefore delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.\nWe cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on some of these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. Our reduced disclosure may make it more difficult for investors and securities analysts to evaluate us and may result in less investor confidence.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could cause our stock price to fall.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that these sales might occur, could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. We are unable to predict the effect that sales may have on the prevailing market price of our common stock.\nCertain holders of our securities are entitled to rights with respect to the registration of their shares under the Securities Act. Registration of these shares under the Securities Act would result in the shares becoming freely tradable without restriction under the Securities Act. Any sales of shares by these shareholders could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nIf we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired, which could harm our operating results, our ability to operate our business and investors\u2019 views of us.\nEnsuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place so that we can produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and time-consuming effort that will need to be frequently evaluated. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires public companies to conduct an annual review and evaluation of their internal controls and attestations of the effectiveness of internal controls by independent auditors (the latter requirement does not apply to smaller reporting companies-we qualify as a smaller reporting company). Our failure to maintain the effectiveness of our internal controls in accordance with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our business. We could lose\ninvestor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nOur disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud.\nOur disclosure controls and procedures are designed to reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. We believe that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.\nThese inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by an unauthorized override of the controls. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in our control system, misstatements or insufficient disclosures due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nSome provisions of our charter documents and Pennsylvania law may have anti-takeover effects that could discourage an acquisition of us by others, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our shareholders, and may prevent attempts by our shareholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our articles of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire us or increase the cost of acquiring us, even if doing so would benefit our shareholders, or remove our current management. These include provisions that:\n\u2022\ndivide our board of directors into three classes with staggered three-year terms;\n\u2022\nprovide that a special meeting of shareholders may be called only by a majority of our board of directors;\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice procedures with respect to shareholder proposals to be brought before a shareholder meeting and the nomination of candidates for election as directors, other than nominations made by or at the direction of the board of directors or a committee of the board of director;\n\u2022\nprovide that shareholders may only act at a duly organized meeting; and\n\u2022\nprovide that members of our board of directors may be removed from office by our shareholders only for cause by the affirmative vote of 75% of the total voting power of all shares entitled to vote generally in the election of directors.\nThese provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our shareholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for shareholders to replace members of our board of directors, who are responsible for appointing the members of our management. Because we are incorporated in Pennsylvania, we are governed by the provisions of the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law of 1988, which may discourage, delay or prevent someone from acquiring us or merging with us whether or not it is desired by or beneficial to our shareholders. Under Pennsylvania law, a corporation may not, in general, engage in a business combination with any holder of 20% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for five years or, among other things, the board of directors has approved the transaction. Any provision of our articles of incorporation or bylaws or Pennsylvania law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our shareholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.", "PERMNO": 14550, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "REPH"}
