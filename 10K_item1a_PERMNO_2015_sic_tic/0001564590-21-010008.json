{"cik": "884219", "company": "VIAD CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-02", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur operations and financial results are subject to known and unknown risks. As a result, past financial performance and historical trends may not be reliable indicators of our future performance.\nMacroeconomic Risks\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and related responsive actions have adversely affected our financial condition, liquidity, and cash flow, and may continue to do so in the future. The COVID-19 pandemic forced the cancellation of many of our events and the temporary closure of substantially all of our attractions, hotels, and other operations. The substantial reduction in our operations has and will result in near-term losses and negative cash flow from operations. The full impact of the pandemic on our longer-term operational and financial performance is highly uncertain and will depend on future developments that we cannot predict, including the duration and spread of the pandemic, any future resurgences of COVID-19, and related social-distancing orders, travel restrictions, and/or government limitations on group gatherings. Our GES business depends on exhibitions, conferences, and other live events and the size of marketing expenditures relating to those events. The continuation of government orders prohibiting large group gatherings will continue to significantly and adversely affect our revenue and results of operations. Even if exhibitions or other live events do occur, we also could suffer from reduced spending for our services because many exhibitors\u2019 marketing budgets are partly discretionary and are frequently among the first expenditures reduced when economic conditions deteriorate, and people may be unwilling to attend large group events.\nIn addition, the attractions and hospitality operations within our Pursuit business may be subject to government closure orders designed to limit the spread of COVID-19, which adversely affects our profitability and cash flow. Future revenue from our Pursuit operations will depend on any further spread of the virus, our ability to keep our operations open, the willingness of people to travel to our locations, and the amount of disposable income that consumers have available for travel and vacations, which decreases during periods of weak general economic conditions. Both our GES and Pursuit businesses may also experience increased costs in order to supply our customers or guests with personal protection equipment, conduct comprehensive cleaning regimens, and other measures that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, guests, and/or event participants. Even with additional personal protection measures in place, there can be no assurance that employees, customers, guests, and/or event participants will not contract COVID-19. Any such occurrence could result in litigation, legal costs, and reputational risk. The potential adverse COVID-19 impacts to our businesses could have a correspondingly negative effect on our overall liquidity. Our revolving credit facility contains a minimum liquidity requirement that requires us to maintain a minimum level of cash and cash equivalents plus available debt capacity. If we are unable to maintain compliance with this minimum liquidity requirement, our lenders may exercise remedies against us, including the acceleration of our outstanding indebtedness. A prolonged recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic or a resurgence in cases of COVID-19 could further materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur businesses will face new challenges presented by the ramifications of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to the direct economic impacts of the pandemic, it is clear that as our businesses recover, they will be operating in new environments in light of societal, regulatory, and industry changes that have occurred since March 2020. Our ability to adjust to these changes and deliver expected business results may be hampered by ongoing uncertainty presented by the pandemic in terms of proper safety protocols, social norms, and a potential of uneven demand for our services. In addition, our ability to deliver such services and otherwise execute against our recovery and growth strategies may be impacted by the extreme reduction of our workforce over the past year and the resulting loss of knowledge of and experience in our businesses. Moreover, our go-forward strategy includes a heightened use of temporary employees in the delivery of our services, and while those employees will likely include those who were previously employed by us on a full-time basis, the level of execution may not be consistent with previous performance. Taken together, our ability to anticipate and adjust to these changes and new conditions may lead to additional costs, which may materially and adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nWe are vulnerable to deterioration in general economic conditions. Our business is particularly sensitive to fluctuations in general economic conditions in the U.S. and other global markets in which we operate, including as a result of the economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The success of our GES business largely depends on the number of exhibitions or other live events held, the size of marketing expenditures at those events, and on the strength of particular industries that support those events. The number and size of exhibitions generally decrease when the economy weakens, which our business has experienced due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We also could suffer from reduced spending for our services because many live event marketing budgets are partly discretionary and are frequently among the first expenditures reduced when economic conditions deteriorate. In addition, revenue from our Pursuit operations depends largely on the amount of disposable income that consumers have available for travel and vacations, which decreases during periods of weak general economic conditions. As a result, any deterioration in general economic conditions could further materially and adversely affect our business, product sales, financial condition, and results of operations.\nTravel industry disruptions, particularly those affecting the hotel and airline industries, could adversely affect our business. Our business depends largely on the ability and willingness of people, whether exhibitors, event attendees, tourists, or others, to travel. Factors adversely affecting the travel industry, and particularly the airline and hotel industries, generally also adversely affect our business and results of operations. Factors that could adversely affect the travel industry include high or rising fuel prices, increased security and passport requirements, weather conditions, health epidemics and pandemics, airline accidents, acts of terrorism, and international political instability and hostilities. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic and social distancing orders resulted in severe global travel restrictions, mandatory shutdowns of event venues, hotels, attractions and other operations, and limitations on large gatherings of people. These circumstances had severe effects on our businesses. The occurrence of additional disruptions, a prolonged recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic or a spike or resurgence in cases of COVID-19, or other unexpected events that affect the availability and pricing of air travel and accommodations, could further materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nTransportation disruptions and increases in transportation costs could adversely affect our business and results of operations. GES relies on independent transportation carriers to send materials and exhibits to and from exhibition, warehouse, and customer facilities. If our customers and suppliers are unable to secure the services of those independent transportation carriers at favorable rates, it could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. In addition, disruption of transportation services due to weather-related problems, labor strikes, lockouts, or other events could adversely affect our ability to supply services to customers and could cause the cancellation of exhibitions, which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nNatural disasters, weather conditions, accidents, and other catastrophic events could negatively affect our business. The occurrence of catastrophic events ranging from natural disasters (such as hurricanes, fires, floods, and earthquakes), acts of war or terrorism, accidents involving our travel offerings or experiences, the effects of climate change, including any impact of global warming, or the prospect of these events could disrupt our business. Changes in climates may increase the frequency and intensity of adverse weather patterns and make certain destinations less desirable.\nSuch catastrophic events have, and could have, an adverse impact on Pursuit, which is heavily dependent on the ability and willingness of its guests to travel and/or visit our attractions. Pursuit guests tend to delay or postpone vacations if natural conditions differ from those that typically prevail at competing lodges, resorts, and attractions, and catastrophic events and heightened travel security measures instituted in response to such events could impede the guests\u2019 ability to travel, and interrupt our business operations, including damaging our properties. For example, the accident on July 18, 2020, at Pursuit\u2019s Columbia Icefield attraction, which involved one of our off-road Ice Explorers and resulted in three fatalities and other serious injuries, may have a negative impact on our reputation and traveler willingness to visit that attraction in the future. We continue to support the victims and their families, and we are fully cooperating with applicable regulatory authorities to investigate the accident. This accident has affected the results of operations of Pursuit, and future developments relating to that incident could continue to impact us negatively.\nSuch catastrophic events could also have a negative impact on GES, causing a cancellation of exhibitions and other events held in public venues or disrupt the services we provide to our customers at convention centers, exhibition halls, hotels, and other public venues. Such events could also have a negative impact on GES\u2019 production facilities, preventing us from timely completing exhibit fabrication and other projects for customers. In addition, unfavorable media attention, or negative publicity, in the wake of any catastrophic event or accident could damage our reputation or reduce the demand for our services. If the conditions arising from such events persist or worsen, they could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nStrategic, Business, and Operational Risks\nCompleted acquisitions may not perform as anticipated or be integrated as planned. We regularly evaluate and pursue opportunities to acquire businesses that complement, enhance, or expand our current business, or offer growth opportunities. Our acquired businesses might not meet our financial and non-financial expectations or yield anticipated benefits. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to conform controls, policies and procedures, and business cultures; consolidate and streamline operations and infrastructures; identify and eliminate redundant and underperforming operations and assets; manage inefficiencies associated with the integration of operations; and retain the acquired business\u2019s key personnel and customers. Moreover, our acquisition activity may subject us to new regulatory requirements, distract our senior management and employees, and expose us to unknown liabilities or contingencies that we may fail to identify prior to closing. If we are forced to make changes to our business strategy or if external conditions adversely affect our business operations, including the duration and impact of COVID-19, we may be required to record additional future impairment charges, as we did in the first and second quarters of 2020. Additionally, we may borrow funds to finance strategic acquisitions. Debt leverage resulting from future acquisitions would reduce our debt capacity, increase our interest expense, and limit our ability to capitalize on future business opportunities. Such borrowings may also be subject to fluctuations in interest rates. Any of these risks could materially and adversely affect our business, product and service sales, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe depend on our large exhibition event clients to renew their service contracts and on our exclusive right to provide those services. GES has a number of large exhibition event organizers and large customer accounts. If any of these large clients do not renew their service contracts, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nMoreover, when event organizers hire GES as the official services contractor, they usually also grant GES an exclusive right to perform material handling, electrical, rigging, and other services at the exhibition facility. However, some exhibition facilities have taken certain steps to in-source certain event services (either by performing the services themselves or by hiring a separate service provider) as a result of conditions generally affecting their industry, such as an increased supply of or reduced demand for exhibition space. If exhibition facilities choose to in-source certain event services, GES will lose the ability to provide certain event services, and our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe operate in highly competitive and dynamic industries. Competition in the Live Events markets is driven by price and service quality, among other factors. To the extent competitors seek to gain or retain market presence through aggressive underpricing strategies, we may be required to lower our prices and rates to avoid the loss of related business. Moreover, customer consolidations and other actions have caused downward pricing pressure for our products and services and could affect our ability to negotiate favorable terms with our customers. If we are unable to anticipate and respond as effectively as our competitors to changing business conditions, including new technologies and business models, we could lose market share. Our inability to meet the challenges presented by the competitive and dynamic environment of our industry could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nNew capital projects may not be commercially successful. From time to time, we pursue capital projects, such as our current construction of FlyOver Las Vegas, FlyOver Canada Toronto, the Sky Lagoon, and other efforts to upgrade some of our Pursuit offerings, in order to enhance and expand our business. Capital projects are subject to a number of risks, including unanticipated delays, cost overruns, and the failure to achieve established financial and strategic goals, as well as additional project-specific risks. For example, we recently had to delay FlyOver Canada Toronto due to poor market conditions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and a need to preserve capital. Some of our other capital projects, such as Sky Lagoon and FlyOver Las Vegas, have also been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Although Sky Lagoon and FlyOver Las Vegas are on track to open in 2021, and FlyOver Canada Toronto\u2019s opening is planned for 2023, these attractions may be further delayed by market conditions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. A prolonged delay in these capital projects, or our failure to accurately predict the revenue or profit that will be generated from these projects, could prevent them from performing in accordance with our commercial expectations and could materially and adversely affect our future success, business, and results of operations.\nThe seasonality of our business makes us particularly sensitive to adverse events during peak periods. The peak activity for our Pursuit business is during the summer months, as the vast majority of Pursuit\u2019s revenue is earned in the second and third quarters. Our GES exhibition and event activity varies significantly because it is based on the frequency and timing of shows, many of which are not held each year, and which may shift between quarters. If adverse events or conditions occur during these peak periods, such as the COVID-19 pandemic or natural disasters such as forest fires, our results of operations could continue to be materially and adversely affected.\nLiabilities relating to prior and discontinued operations may adversely affect our results of operations. We and our predecessors have a corporate history spanning decades and involving diverse businesses. Some of those businesses owned properties and used raw materials that have been, and may continue to be, subject to litigation. Moreover, some of the raw materials used and the waste produced by those businesses have been and are the subject of U.S. federal and state environmental regulations, including laws enacted under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or its state law counterparts. In addition, we may incur other liabilities resulting from indemnification claims involving previously sold properties and subsidiaries, or obligations under defined benefit plans or other employee plans, as well as claims from past operations of predecessors or their subsidiaries. Although we believe we have adequate reserves and sufficient insurance coverage to cover those potential liabilities, future events or proceedings could render our reserves or insurance protections inadequate, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nShow rotation affects our profitability and makes comparisons between periods difficult. GES results are largely dependent upon the frequency, timing, and location of exhibitions and events. Some large exhibitions are not held annually (they may be held once every two, three, or four years) or may be held at different times of the year from when they were previously held. In addition, the same exhibition may change locations from year to year resulting in lower margins if the exhibition shifts to a higher-cost location. Any of these factors could cause our results of operations to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter or from year to year, making periodic comparisons difficult.\nWe are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations. We have operations outside of the U.S. primarily in Canada, the United Kingdom, Iceland, the Netherlands, and Germany. During 2020 and 2019, GES EMEA, GES Canada, and Pursuit\u2019s international operations accounted for approximately 30% and 33% of our consolidated revenue, respectively, and 36% and 66% of our segment operating income and loss, respectively. Consequently, a significant portion of our business is exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations. We do not currently hedge equity risk arising from the translation of non-U.S. denominated assets and liabilities. Our financial results and capital ratios are sensitive to movements in currency exchange rates because a large portion of our assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses must be translated into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. The unrealized gains or losses resulting from the currency translation are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We also have certain loans in currencies other than the entity\u2019s functional currency, which results in gains or losses as exchange rates\nfluctuate. As a result, significant fluctuations in currency exchange rates could result in material changes to the net equity position we report in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and could adversely affect our results of operations.\nChanges affecting the availability of the London Inter-bank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) and the Canadian Dollar Offered Rate (\u201cCDOR\u201d) or increases in interest rates may have consequences for us that cannot yet be reasonably predicted. We have outstanding debt with variable interest rates based on LIBOR and CDOR. Borrowings under the 2018 Credit Facility are indexed to the prime rate or LIBOR, plus appropriate spreads tied to our leverage ratio. The LIBOR benchmark has been the subject of national, international, and other regulatory guidance and proposals to reform. In July 2017, the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (the authority that regulates LIBOR) announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. These reforms may cause LIBOR to perform differently than in the past and LIBOR may ultimately cease to exist after 2021.\nHowever, on November 30, 2020, the ICE Benchmark Administration, the administrator of LIBOR, announced plans to consult on ceasing publication of U.S. dollar LIBOR tenors on December 31, 2021 for only the one-week and two-month U.S. dollar LIBOR tenors, and on June 30, 2023 for all other U.S. dollar LIBOR tenors. In 2017, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee announced that the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d), a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by Treasury securities, as its preferred alternative to LIBOR. In November 2020, Refinitiv, the administrator of the CDOR, announced that it will abandon the six-month and 12-month CDOR tenors effective May 17, 2021. All other CDOR tenors will be available for the foreseeable future. The Canadian Alternative Reference Rate Committee is promoting the use of the Canadian Overnight Repo Rate Average (\u201cCORRA\u201d) as the preferred alternative to the CDOR. Our 2018 Credit Facility includes a method for determining an alternative or successor rate of interest that gives consideration to the new prevailing market convention. The alternative rate could affect our debt and debt payments. At this time, it is not possible to predict the effect of any changes to LIBOR or CDOR, any phase out of LIBOR or CDOR or any establishment of alternative benchmark rates. Any new benchmark rate will likely not replicate LIBOR or CDOR exactly, which could impact our contracts which terminate after 2021. There is uncertainty about how applicable law, the courts, or the Company will address the replacement of LIBOR or CDOR with alternative rates. When U.S. LIBOR ceases to exist after June 30, 2023, the interest rates under our revolving credit facility and the discount rates we apply to finance lease obligations will be based on the alternative rate, which may result in higher interest rates and debt obligations. In addition, any increases to our benchmark interest rates could have an uncertain impact on our cost of funds and our access to the capital markets, which could impact our results of operations and cash flows. Uncertainty as to the nature of such potential changes may also adversely affect the trading market for our securities.\nLabor and Employment Risks\nOur business is relationship driven. Our GES business is heavily focused on client relationships, and, specifically, on having close collaboration and interaction with our clients. To be successful, our account teams must be able to understand clients\u2019 desires and expectations in order to provide top-quality service. If we are unable to maintain our client relationships, including due to the loss of key members of our account teams, we could also lose customers and our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur participation in multi-employer pension plans could substantially increase our pension costs. We sponsor a number of defined benefit plans for our U.S. and Canada-based employees. In addition, we are obligated to contribute to multi-employer pension plans under collective bargaining agreements covering our union-represented employees. We contributed $8.6 million in 2020, $27.3 million in 2019, and $26.4 million in 2018 to those multi-employer pension plans. Third-party boards of trustees manage these multi-employer plans. Based upon the information we receive from plan administrators, we believe that several of those multi-employer plans are underfunded. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 requires us to reduce the underfunded status over defined time periods. Moreover, we would be required to make additional payments of our proportionate share of a plan\u2019s unfunded vested liabilities if a plan terminates, or other contributing employers withdraw, due to insolvency or other reasons, or if we voluntarily withdraw from a plan. In 2019, we withdrew from the underfunded Central States Pension Plan and accordingly, we recorded a charge of $15.5 million, which represents the estimated present value of future contributions we will be required to make as a result of the union\u2019s withdrawal. At this time, we do not anticipate triggering any significant withdrawal from any other multi-employer pension plan to which we currently contribute. However, significant plan contribution increases could materially and adversely affect our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Refer to Note 18 - Pension and Postretirement Benefits of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this 2020 Form 10-K) for further information.\nUnion-represented labor increases our risk of higher labor costs and work stoppages. Significant portions of our employees are unionized. We have approximately 100 collective bargaining agreements, and we are required to renegotiate approximately one-third of those each year. If we increase wages or benefits as a result of labor negotiations, either our operating margins will suffer, or we could increase the cost of our services to our customers, which could lead those customers to turn to other vendors with lower prices. Either event could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nAdditionally, if we are unable to reach an agreement with a union during the collective bargaining process, the union may strike or carry out other types of work stoppages. If that happens, we might be unable to find substitute workers with the necessary skills to perform many of the services, or we may incur additional costs to do so, both of which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nCybersecurity and Data Privacy Risks\nWe are vulnerable to cybersecurity attacks and threats. We regularly collect and process credit, financial, and other personal and confidential information from individuals and entities who attend or participate in events and exhibitions that we produce, or who visit our attractions and other offerings. In addition, our devices, servers, computer systems, and business systems are vulnerable to cybersecurity risk, including cyberattacks, or we may be the target of email scams that attempt to acquire personal information and company assets. Despite our efforts to protect ourselves with insurance, and create security barriers to such threats, including regularly reviewing our systems for vulnerabilities and continually updating our protections, we might not be able to entirely mitigate these risks. Our failure to effectively prevent, detect, and recover from the increasing number and sophistication of information security threats could lead to business interruptions, delays or loss of critical data, misuse, modification, or destruction of information, including trade secrets and confidential business information, reputational damage, and third-party claims, any of which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nLaws and regulations relating to the handling of personal data are evolving and could result in increased costs, legal claims, or fines. We store and process the personally identifiable information of our customers, employees, and third parties with whom we have business relationships. The legal requirements restricting the way we store, collect, handle, and transfer personal data continue to evolve, and there are an increasing number of authorities issuing privacy laws and regulations. These data privacy laws and regulations are subject to differing interpretations, creating uncertainty and inconsistency across jurisdictions. Our compliance with these myriad requirements could involve making changes in our services, business practices, or internal systems, any of which could increase our costs, lower revenue, or reduce efficiency. Our failure to comply with existing or new rules could result in significant penalties or orders to stop the alleged noncompliant activity, litigation, adverse publicity, or could cause our customers to lose trust in our services. In addition, if the third parties we work with violate applicable laws, contractual obligations, or suffer a security breach, those violations could also put us in breach of our obligations under privacy laws and regulations. In addition, the costs of maintaining adequate protection, including insurance protection against such threats, as they develop in the future (or as legal requirements related to data security increase) are expected to increase and could be material. Any of these risks could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 19721, "SIC": 7389, "TIC": "VVI"}
