{"cik": "775368", "company": "ALLEGHANY CORP /DE", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-23", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nOur operating businesses and investments are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below, which could have a material and adverse effect on our businesses, results of operations or financial condition. Our businesses may also be materially and adversely affected by risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial.\nRisk Factors Related to our Business\nWe expect that the impact of the Pandemic will continue to materially affect our businesses, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. The global spread of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and mitigation efforts by governments to attempt to control its spread have significantly impacted and may continue to significantly impact the global economy and our results of operations. We began to experience a negative impact on our results of operations arising from the Pandemic in the first quarter of 2020 and that impact continued throughout 2020 and, to a lesser extent 2021. Widespread vaccine rollouts in the U.S. occurred in early 2021 and are continuing; however, new variants of the virus have emerged which may continue to negatively affect our results of operations in future periods, including in 2022. The duration and extent of the impact of the Pandemic on our business depends on future developments that cannot be accurately predicted at this time, such as the severity and transmission rate of the virus, the extent and effectiveness of containment actions, the rollout of vaccinations, the spread of variant strains of COVID-19 and the impact of these and other factors on our employees, customers, suppliers and vendors. Given the scope and magnitude of the Pandemic, all of its direct and indirect consequences are not yet known and may not emerge for some time. The ongoing Pandemic presents risks and uncertainties to our operating businesses and investments, which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, including the following:\n\u2022Estimated Loss Reserves. The anticipated and unknown risks related to the Pandemic may cause additional uncertainty in the process of estimating loss reserves of our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries. For example, the behavior of claimants and policyholders may change in unexpected ways (such as an increase in the number of fraudulent claims), we may see an increase in the number of claims for certain product lines, the disruption to the court system may impact the timing and amounts of claims settlements and the actions taken by governmental bodies, both legislative and regulatory, in reaction to the Pandemic and their related impacts are hard to predict. As a result, our estimated reserves may change.\n\u2022Regulations, Orders and Proposed Legislation. Federal, state and local government actions to address and contain the impact of the Pandemic may adversely affect us. For example, we are subject to legislative and/or regulatory action that seeks to retroactively mandate coverage for losses that policies of our reinsurance and insurance company subsidiaries were not designed or priced to cover. In 2020, legislators in several states proposed legislation to require insurers to cover business interruption claims irrespective of terms, exclusions or other conditions included in the policies that would otherwise preclude coverage. Regulatory restrictions or requirements could also impact pricing, risk selection and our rights and obligations with respect to our policies and insureds, including our ability to cancel policies or our right to collect premiums. Several state regulators have issued orders requiring insurers to issue premium refunds as a result of changed patterns of behavior during the Pandemic, and regulators in other states could take similar actions.\n\u2022Heightened Cybersecurity Risks. Having shifted to remote working arrangements in many of our locations, we face a heightened risk of cybersecurity attacks or data security incidents and are more dependent on internet and telecommunications access and capabilities. See Part I, Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors Related to our Business\u201d of this Form 10-K for additional information.\n\u2022Investments in Debt Securities, Equity Securities and Other Invested Assets. The fair value of our investments in debt, equity securities and certain other invested assets fluctuates depending on general economic and market conditions. For example, in early 2020, the Pandemic disrupted global economic activity and caused financial markets to drop sharply, and the fair value of our equity securities depreciated considerably. As general economic and market conditions stabilized during the Pandemic, the fair value of our equity securities recovered in 2021. However, despite the ongoing vaccination campaign, the risk that existing vaccines may not be effective against variant COVID-19 strains and the lasting effects of the Pandemic could result in elevated volatility of economic activity and financial markets for the foreseeable future. By extension, the value of our investment portfolio would remain volatile. Prospectively, the sensitivity of the value of our investment portfolio relative to changes in broader financial markets can be approximated by the market beta of our equity holdings and the effective duration of our debt securities. As of December 31, 2021, the market beta and effective duration of our equity and debt securities were 1.0 and 4.5 years, respectively.\n\u2022Heightened Risks of Downgrades, Impairments and Defaults. We are subject to the risk that the issuers of debt securities we own or borrowers on commercial mortgage loans we have invested in may become less creditworthy or default on principal and interest payments they owe us. The longer and more severe the negative impact of the Pandemic, the more at risk our portfolio of investments in debt securities and commercial mortgage loans would be to credit downgrades, impairments and defaults. Exposures to industries and sectors most impacted by the Pandemic, including, related supply chain disruptions, are at heightened risk of downgrades and other adverse credit events. These include all forms of exposures to hospitality, travel, retail, manufacturing, energy and consumer finance.\nThe Pandemic\u2019s duration cannot be predicted. An emergence of new variant COVID-19 strains that are resistant to current initiatives could once again trigger declines in our equity securities portfolio, additional credit-related realized and unrealized losses on our debt securities and commercial mortgage portfolios, additional credit losses on our reinsurance recoverables and other receivables, further losses from event cancellation and other coverages from our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries, negative impact to revenues and earnings of certain Alleghany Capital subsidiaries, loss of personnel as a result of federal, state or local vaccine mandates and difficulties in hiring replacement personnel, and impairment of certain Alleghany Capital subsidiary goodwill and intangible assets. As a result of any one or a combination of the risks identified above, the Pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nThe reserves for loss and LAE of our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries are estimates and may not be adequate, which would require our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries to establish additional reserves. Gross reserves for loss and LAE reported on our balance sheet as of December 31, 2021 were approximately $14.4 billion. These loss and LAE reserves reflect management\u2019s best estimates of the cost of settling all claims and related expenses with respect to insured events that have occurred. Reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability, but rather an estimate of what management expects the ultimate settlement and claims administration will cost for events that have occurred, whether known or unknown. These reserve estimates, which generally involve actuarial projections, are based on management\u2019s assessment of facts and circumstances currently known and assumptions about anticipated loss emergence patterns, including expected future trends in claims severity and frequency, inflation, court resolutions and judicial interpretations, reinsurance coverage, legislative changes and other factors.\nThe inherent uncertainties of estimating reserves are greater for certain types of liabilities, where long periods of time elapse before a definitive determination of liability is made and settlement is reached. Our liabilities for loss and LAE can generally be categorized into two distinct groups, short-tail business and long-tail business. Short-tail business refers to lines of business, such as property, for which losses are usually known and paid relatively soon after the loss actually occurs. Long-tail business describes lines of business for which specific losses may not be known and reported for some period and losses take much longer to emerge. Given the time frame over which long-tail exposures are ultimately settled, there is greater uncertainty and volatility in these lines than in short-tail lines of business. Our long-tail coverages consist of most casualty lines of business including professional liability, directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability, general liability, umbrella/excess liability and certain workers\u2019 compensation exposures. Some factors that contribute to the uncertainty and volatility of long-tail casualty business, and thus require a significant degree of judgment in the reserving process, include the inherent uncertainty as to the length of reporting and payment development patterns, the possibility of judicial interpretations or legislative changes that might impact future loss experience relative to prior loss experience and the potential lack of comparability of the underlying data used in performing loss reserve analyses. In general, reinsurance business for any particular line of business is longer-tailed and, by its nature, losses are more difficult to estimate than they are for comparable insurance business.\nIn periods with increased economic volatility, it becomes more difficult to accurately predict claims costs. It is especially difficult to estimate the impact of inflation on loss reserves given the current economic environment and related government actions. Reserve estimates are continually refined in an ongoing process as experience develops and further claims are reported and settled. Adjustments to reserves are reflected in the results of the periods in which the adjustments are made. Because setting reserves is inherently uncertain, our current reserves could prove to be too low or too high in light of subsequent events. Should our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries need to increase or decrease their reserves, our pre-tax income for the period would decrease or increase, respectively, by a corresponding amount. Although current reserves reflect our best estimate of the costs of settling claims, we cannot assure you that our reserve estimates will not change, perhaps by a material amount, in the future.\nBecause our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries are property and casualty reinsurers and insurers, we face losses related to natural and man-made catastrophes. Property and casualty reinsurers and insurers are subject to claims arising out of catastrophes that may have a significant effect on their results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. Catastrophe losses, or the absence thereof, have historically had a significant impact on our results. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Overview\u201d contained in Item 7 of this Form 10-K.\nNatural or man-made catastrophes can be caused by various events, including hurricanes, other windstorms, earthquakes, floods, wildfires, pandemics, as well as terrorist activities. The frequency and severity of catastrophes in any short period of time are inherently unpredictable. The extent of gross losses related to a catastrophe event is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event, potentially mitigated by any reinsurance coverage purchased by our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries. Most catastrophes are restricted to limited geographic areas; however, hurricanes, other windstorms, earthquakes and floods may produce significant damage when those areas are heavily populated. It is therefore possible that a catastrophic event or multiple catastrophic events could produce significant losses and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWith respect to terrorism, to the extent that reinsurers have excluded coverage for certain terrorist acts or have priced this coverage at rates that make purchasing such coverage uneconomic, our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries will not have reinsurance protection and are exposed to potential losses as a result of any acts of terrorism. To the extent an act of terrorism is certified by the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, we may be covered under the Terrorism Act. This coverage under the Terrorism Act does not apply to reinsurers. Information regarding the Terrorism Act and its impact on our insurance subsidiaries can be found on page 34 of this Form 10-K.\nIn general, TransRe does not provide coverage for certified acts of terrorism, as defined by the Terrorism Act, but it is nonetheless exposed to potential losses related to both certified and uncertified acts of terrorism in the U.S. or elsewhere, such as from terrorism-specific treaty coverages offered to ceding companies or terrorism risk pools outside of the U.S. on a limited basis, and with respect to other lines of business from the assumption of terrorism risk in marine, aviation and other casualty treaties. Although TransRe assumes such terrorism risk after careful underwriting consideration and, in many cases, with limitations, a major terrorist event could have a material adverse impact on TransRe and us.\nFinally, other catastrophes, such as an outbreak of a pandemic disease or a marine or aviation disaster, could also have a materially adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nClimate change, as well as increasing regulation in the area of climate change, may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Changing weather patterns and climatic conditions have added to the unpredictability, severity and potentially the frequency of natural disasters and weather events, such as hurricanes, tornado activity, other windstorms, floods and wildfires, in certain parts of the world and created additional uncertainty as to future, longer-term trends and exposures. Although the loss experience of catastrophe reinsurers and insurers has historically been characterized as low frequency, there is a growing consensus today that climate change may be increasing the frequency and severity of extreme weather events and, in recent years, the frequency of major catastrophes appears to have increased, and may continue to increase in the future.\nLonger-term natural catastrophe trends due to climate change have been associated with extreme weather events linked to rising temperatures, and include effects on global weather patterns, greenhouse gases, sea, land and air temperatures, sea levels, rain and snow. Our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries take measures to mitigate the impact of such events by considering these risks in their underwriting and pricing decisions, including their management of aggregate exposure levels and through the purchase of reinsurance. To the extent climate change increases the frequency and severity of such natural disasters and weather events, our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries, particularly TransRe and RSUI, may face increased claims, particularly with respect to properties located in coastal areas. Increases in insured losses, particularly if those losses exceed the expectations of our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries, could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nFurther, claims for catastrophic events, or an unusual frequency of smaller losses in a particular period could have a material adverse effect on our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries\u2019 ability to write new business if they are not able to adequately assess and reserve for the increased frequency and severity of catastrophes resulting from these environmental factors.\nAdditionally, catastrophic events and the effects of climate change could result in increased credit exposure to reinsurers and other counterparties we, and our subsidiaries, transact business with, declines in the value of investments we hold and significant disruptions to our physical infrastructure, systems and operations. Climate change-related risks may also specifically adversely impact the value of the securities that we hold.\nChanges in security asset prices may impact the value of our fixed income, real estate and commercial mortgage investments, resulting in realized or unrealized losses on our invested assets. These risks can include, but are not limited to: (i) changes in supply/demand characteristics for fossil fuels (e.g., coal, oil, natural gas); (ii) advances in low-carbon technology and renewable energy development; and (iii) effects of extreme weather events on the physical and operational exposure of industries and issuers, and the transition that these companies make towards addressing climate risk in their own businesses.\nHowever, we cannot predict how legal, regulatory and/or social responses to concerns around global climate change may impact our business. We attempt to manage our exposure to such events through the use of underwriting controls, risk models, and the purchase of third-party reinsurance. Underwriting controls can include more restrictive underwriting criteria such as higher premiums and deductibles, or losses retained, and more specifically excluded policy risks. There can be no assurance that our reinsurance coverage and other measures taken will be sufficient to mitigate losses resulting from one or more climate change impacted catastrophic events. As a result, the occurrence of one or more catastrophic events and the continuation and worsening of recent trends could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nSignificant competitive pressures may prevent our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries from retaining existing business or writing new business at adequate rates. Our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries compete with a large number of other companies in their selected lines of business. They compete, and will continue to compete, with major U.S. and non-U.S. reinsurers and insurers, other regional companies, mutual companies, specialty insurance companies, underwriting agencies, government-owned or subsidized facilities, European underwriting syndicates and diversified financial services companies. Many competitors have considerably more financial resources, greater experience and may offer more products or services than our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries. Except for regulatory considerations, there are virtually no barriers to entry into the reinsurance and insurance industry.\nAdditionally, the reinsurance and insurance industry continues to consolidate and, accordingly, competition for customers will continue to increase. As a result, our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries may incur greater customer retention and acquisition expense, which would affect the profitability of existing and new business. Further, as the industry continues to consolidate, reinsurance and insurance companies that merge could have increased market size and capital resources with which to negotiate price reductions and retain more risk, decreasing pricing and demand for reinsurance.\nCompetition in the businesses of our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries is based on many factors, including the perceived financial strength of a company, premiums charged, other terms and conditions offered, services provided, commissions paid to producers, ratings assigned by independent rating agencies, speed of claims payment and reputation and experience in the lines to be written. Such competition could cause the supply or demand for insurance to change, which could affect the ability of our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries to price their products at adequate rates. If our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries are unable to retain existing business or write new business at adequate rates, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nIn addition to competition from the reinsurance industry, TransRe faces competition from the capital markets, as well as some traditional reinsurers, which from time to time produce alternative products or reinsurance vehicles (such as collateralized reinsurance, reinsurance securitizations, catastrophe bonds and various derivatives, such as swaps and sidecars) that may compete with certain types of reinsurance, such as property catastrophe. Hedge funds may also provide reinsurance and retrocessional protections through captive companies or other alternative transactions on a fully collateralized basis for property and energy catastrophe business. Over time, these initiatives could significantly affect supply, pricing and competition in the reinsurance industry.\nOur results may fluctuate as a result of many factors, including cyclical changes in the reinsurance and insurance industries. Historically, the performance of the property and casualty reinsurance and insurance industries has tended to fluctuate in cyclical periods of price competition and excess underwriting capacity, followed by periods of high premium rates and shortages of underwriting capacity. Although an individual reinsurance and insurance company\u2019s performance is dependent on its own specific business characteristics, the profitability of most property and casualty reinsurance and insurance companies tends to follow this market cycle. Further, this cyclical market pattern can be more pronounced in the reinsurance market in which TransRe competes and in the excess and surplus market in which RSUI primarily competes than in the standard insurance market. In addition, compared with historical cyclical periods, a cycle of increased price competition and excess underwriting capacity may continue for a prolonged period of time as new and existing reinsurance and insurance market participants and products continue to enter the reinsurance and insurance markets. Unfavorable market conditions may affect the ability of our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries to write business at rates they consider appropriate relative to the risk assumed. If we cannot write business at appropriate rates, our business would be significantly and adversely affected.\nWhen premium rates are high and there is a shortage of capacity in the standard insurance market, growth in the excess and surplus market can be significantly more rapid than growth in the standard insurance market. Similarly, when there is price competition and excess underwriting capacity in the standard insurance market, many customers that were previously driven into the excess and surplus market may return to the standard insurance market, exacerbating the effects of price competition.\nDemand for reinsurance is influenced significantly by underwriting and investment results in both the standard insurance and the excess and surplus markets and market conditions. The supply of reinsurance is related to prevailing prices, the levels of insured losses and the levels of reinsurance industry surplus, among other factors, that, in turn, may fluctuate in response to changes in rates of return on investments being earned in the reinsurance industry. In addition, the supply of reinsurance is affected by a reinsurer\u2019s confidence in its ability to accurately assess the probability of expected underwriting outcomes, particularly with respect to catastrophe losses.\nSince cyclicality is due in large part to the collective actions of insurers, reinsurers and general economic conditions and the occurrence of unpredictable events, we cannot predict the timing or duration of changes in the market cycle. These cyclical patterns cause our revenues and net earnings to fluctuate. In addition, our results may fluctuate as a result of changes in economic, legal, political and social factors, among others.\nWe cannot guarantee that the reinsurers used by our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries will pay in a timely fashion, if at all, and, as a result, we could experience losses even if reinsured. As part of their overall risk and capacity management strategy, our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries purchase reinsurance by transferring or ceding part of the risk that they have underwritten to a reinsurance company in exchange for part of the premium received by our subsidiaries in connection with that risk. Although reinsurance makes the reinsurer liable to our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries to the extent the risk is transferred or ceded to the reinsurer, our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries remain liable for amounts not paid by a reinsurer. Reinsurers may not pay the reinsurance recoverables that they owe to our subsidiaries or they may not pay these recoverables on a timely basis. This risk may increase significantly if these reinsurers experience financial difficulties as a result of catastrophes, investment losses or other events. Accordingly, we bear credit risk with respect to our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries\u2019 reinsurers, and if they fail to pay, our financial results would be adversely affected. As of December 31, 2021, reinsurance recoverables reported on our balance sheet were $2.2 billion.\nIf market conditions cause reinsurance to be more costly or unavailable, our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries may be required to bear increased risks or reduce the level of their underwriting commitments. As part of their overall risk management strategy, our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries purchase reinsurance for certain amounts of risk underwritten by them, including catastrophe risks. The reinsurance programs purchased by our subsidiaries are generally subject to annual renewal. Market conditions beyond their control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection they purchase, which may affect the level of their business written and thus their profitability. If our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries are unable to renew their expiring facilities or to obtain new reinsurance facilities, which could result as the number of companies offering reinsurance coverage declines due to industry consolidation, either their net exposures on future policies or reinsurance contracts would increase, which could increase the volatility of their results or, if they are unwilling or unable to bear an increase in net exposures, they would have to reduce the level of their underwriting commitments, especially catastrophe-exposed risks, which may reduce their revenues and net earnings. In certain reinsurance contracts, a cedant, to the extent it exhausts its original coverage under a reinsurance contract during a single coverage period (typically a single twelve-month period), can pay a reinsurance reinstatement premium to restore coverage during such coverage period. If our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries exhaust their original and, if applicable, reinstated coverage under their third-party reinsurance contracts during a single coverage period, they will not have any reinsurance coverage available for losses incurred as a result of additional loss events during that coverage period. The exhaustion of such reinsurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on the profitability of our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries in any given period and on our results of operations.\nTransRe and RSUI attempt to manage their exposure to catastrophe risk partially through the use of catastrophe modeling software. The failure of this software to accurately gauge the catastrophe-exposed risks they write could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. As part of their approach to managing catastrophe risk, TransRe and RSUI use a number of tools, including third-party catastrophe modeling software, to help evaluate potential losses. TransRe and RSUI use modeled loss scenarios and internal analyses to set their level of risk retention and help structure their reinsurance programs. Modeled loss estimates, however, have not always accurately predicted their ultimate losses with respect to catastrophe events. Accordingly, TransRe and RSUI periodically review their catastrophe exposure management approach, which may result in the implementation of new monitoring tools and a revision of their underwriting guidelines and procedures. However, these efforts may not be successful in sufficiently mitigating risk exposures and losses resulting from future catastrophes.\nOur reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries are rated by rating agencies and a decline in these ratings could affect the standings of these units in the reinsurance and insurance industries and cause their premium volume and earnings to decrease. Ratings continue to be an important factor in establishing the competitive positions of reinsurance and insurance companies. Some of our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries are rated by A.M. Best, S&P and/or Moody\u2019s, which we\ncollectively refer to as the \u201cRating Agencies.\u201d The Rating Agencies\u2019 financial strength ratings reflect their opinions of a reinsurance or an insurance company\u2019s financial strength, operating performance, strategic position and ability to meet its obligations to policyholders, and are neither an evaluation directed to investors of a security nor a recommendation to buy, sell or hold a security. These ratings are subject to periodic review, and we cannot assure you that any of our reinsurance or insurance companies will be able to retain their current ratings. The Rating Agencies may change their methodology or requirements for determining ratings, or they may become more conservative in assigning ratings. The Rating Agencies could also increase capital requirements for our reinsurance or insurance subsidiaries, thereby reducing deployable capital at such subsidiary or at the parent level. If the ratings of our reinsurance or insurance companies are reduced from their current levels by the Rating Agencies, their competitive positions could suffer and it would be more difficult for them to market their products. A significant downgrade could result in a substantial loss of business as customers move to other companies with higher financial strength ratings.\nIn addition, in general, if the financial strength ratings of TransRe\u2019s operating subsidiaries from the Rating Agencies fall below A-, a significant portion of TransRe\u2019s operating subsidiaries\u2019 contracts that contain rating agency triggers would allow customers to elect to take a number of actions such as terminating the contracts on a run-off or cut-off basis, requiring TransRe\u2019s operating subsidiaries to post collateral for all or a portion of the obligations or requiring commutation under the contracts. Some of these contracts, however, contain dual triggers, such as requiring both a ratings downgrade below A- and a significant decline in the statutory surplus of TransRe\u2019s operating subsidiaries before such cancellation or collateralization rights would be exercisable. Contracts may contain one or both of the aforementioned contractual provisions, or certain other collateralization or cancellation triggers. Whether a ceding company would exercise any of these cancellation rights would depend on, among other factors, the reason and extent of such downgrade or surplus reduction, the prevailing market conditions and the pricing and availability of replacement reinsurance coverage. We cannot predict the extent to which these contractual rights would be exercised, if at all, or what effect such exercises would have on our financial condition or future operations, but such effect potentially could be materially adverse to us.\nTransRe may also enter into agreements with ceding companies that require it to provide collateral for its obligations, including where TransRe\u2019s obligations to these ceding companies exceed negotiated thresholds. These thresholds may vary depending on the ratings of TransRe\u2019s operating subsidiaries, and a ratings downgrade or a failure to achieve a certain rating may increase the amount of collateral TransRe is required to provide. An increase in the amount of collateral TransRe is obligated to provide to secure its obligations may have an adverse impact on, among other things, TransRe\u2019s ability to write additional reinsurance.\nA limited number of brokers account for a large portion of TransRe\u2019s premiums; the loss of all or a substantial portion of the business provided by them may have an adverse effect on us. The great majority of TransRe\u2019s premiums are written through brokers. Several large international brokers dominate the reinsurance brokerage industry, and TransRe derives a significant portion of its premiums from these brokers. Further, TransRe may become increasingly reliant on these brokers due to continued consolidation in the broker sector. The loss of all or a substantial portion of the business provided by these brokers could have a material adverse effect on us.\nDifficult and volatile conditions in the global capital and credit markets and in the overall economy could materially and adversely affect the results of our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries. Disruption and volatility in the global capital and credit markets and in the overall economy affects our businesses in a number of ways, including the following:\n\u2022disruption in the capital and credit markets may increase claims activity in our reinsurance business, such as directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability, errors and omissions liability and trade credit lines;\n\u2022volatility in the capital and credit markets makes it more difficult to access those markets, if necessary, to maintain or improve financial strength and credit ratings of our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries or to generate liquidity;\n\u2022disruption in the overall economy may reduce demand for reinsurance and insurance products; and\n\u2022increases in inflation could result in higher losses on reinsurance contracts, particularly in longer-tailed lines of business, increased operating costs and a decrease in the fair value of our investment portfolio.\nIt is difficult to predict when and how long these types of conditions may exist and how our markets, business and investments will be adversely affected. Accordingly, these conditions could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations in future periods.\nThe businesses of our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries are heavily regulated, and changes in regulation may limit their ability to pay dividends, reduce their profitability and limit their growth. Our reinsurance and insurance operating subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation and supervision in the jurisdictions in which they conduct business, both in the U.S. and other countries. This regulation is generally designed to protect the interests of policyholders and not necessarily the interests of insurers, their stockholders or other investors. The regulation relates to authorization for lines of business, capital and surplus requirements, investment limitations, underwriting limitations, transactions with affiliates, dividend limitations, changes\nin control, premium rates and a variety of other financial and non-financial components of a reinsurance or insurance company\u2019s business. Moreover, insurance laws and regulations, among other things: establish solvency requirements, including minimum reserves and capital and surplus requirements; limit the amount of dividends, tax distributions, intercompany loans and other payments our insurance subsidiaries can make without prior regulatory approval; and impose restrictions on the amount and type of investments we may hold. Regulatory and legislative authorities continue to implement enhanced or new regulatory requirements that may impact our reinsurance and insurance businesses. The application of these laws could affect our liquidity and ability to pay dividends, interest and other payments on securities, among other things.\nVirtually all states in which our insurance operating subsidiary companies conduct their business require them, together with other insurers licensed to do business in that state, to bear a portion of the loss suffered by some insureds as the result of impaired or insolvent insurance companies. In addition, in various states, our insurance operating subsidiary companies must participate in mandatory arrangements to provide various types of insurance coverage to individuals or other entities that otherwise are unable to purchase that coverage from private insurers. A few states require our insurance operating subsidiary companies to purchase reinsurance from a mandatory reinsurance fund. Such reinsurance funds can create a credit risk for insurers if not adequately funded by the state and, in some cases, the existence of a reinsurance fund could affect the prices charged for the policies issued by our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries. The effect of these and similar arrangements could reduce the profitability of our insurance operating subsidiaries in any given period or limit their ability to grow their business.\nIn recent years, the state insurance regulatory framework has come under increased scrutiny, and some state legislatures have considered or enacted laws that may alter or increase state authority to regulate insurance companies and insurance holding companies. Further, the NAIC and state insurance regulators are continually reexamining existing laws and regulations, specifically focusing on modifications to statutory accounting principles, credit for reinsurance laws, interpretations of existing laws and the development of new laws and regulations. The regulatory environment surrounding climate change and the related risks is becoming increasingly demanding. For instance, on November 15, 2021, the NYDFS issued final guidance that sets forth the regulator\u2019s detailed expectations for how New York domestic insurers should address and manage financial risks from climate change, which guidance applies to TRC and FAIRCO. In addition, on the federal level, the FIO has been instructed by President Biden\u2019s Executive Order on Climate-Related Financial Risk, dated May 20, 2021, to seek public comment on a series of questions that \u201cwill help inform FIO\u2019s assessment of climate-related financial risks for the insurance sector.\u201d The FIO\u2019s Request for Information notes that the FIO plans to \u201c...take a leadership role in analyzing how the insurance sector may help mitigate climate-related risks [and to that end, it] will engage with the insurance sector to assess how the sector may help achieve national climate-related goals, including mitigation, adaptation, and transition to a lower carbon economy.\u201d The comment period ended in November 2021. Further, the Dodd-Frank Act mandated significant changes to the regulation of U.S. insurance. These regulatory initiatives and regulations, and any proposed or future state or federal legislation or NAIC initiatives, if adopted, may be more restrictive on the ability of our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries to conduct business than current regulatory requirements or may result in higher compliance costs. Information regarding the impact of regulation and current regulatory changes on our reinsurance and insurance operating subsidiaries can be found on pages 38 through 44 of this Form 10-K.\nOur operations in jurisdictions outside the U.S. are subject to certain limitations and risks that are unique to foreign operations. Our international operations and assets held abroad are also subject to significant legal, market, operational, compliance and regulatory risks, including risks related to:\n\u2022economic, political and other developments in foreign countries;\n\u2022changes in foreign or U.S. laws and regulations;\n\u2022nationalization and changes in regulatory policy;\n\u2022unexpected financial restrictions that foreign governments may impose;\n\u2022the potential costs and difficulties in complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations; and\n\u2022the consequences of international hostilities and unrest.\nThe risks of such occurrences and their overall effect upon us vary from country to country and cannot be predicted. In addition, our results of operations and net unrealized currency translation gain or loss (a component of accumulated other comprehensive income) are subject to volatility as the value of the foreign currencies fluctuate relative to the U.S. dollar. Further, regulations governing technical reserves and remittance balances in some countries may hinder remittance of profits and repatriation of assets.\nIn addition, TransRe\u2019s international operations are also regulated in various jurisdictions with respect to licensing requirements, solvency, currency, amount and type of security deposits, amount and type of reserves, amount and type of local investments and other matters. The international and U.S. laws and regulations that are applicable to TransRe\u2019s international operations are complex and may increase the costs of regulatory compliance, limit or restrict TransRe\u2019s business or subject TransRe to regulatory actions or proceedings in the future. Although TransRe attempts to comply with all applicable laws and\nregulations and seek licenses to undertake various activities where appropriate, there can be no assurance that TransRe is, or will be, in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, or interpretations of these laws and regulations, at all times. In addition, it is TransRe\u2019s policy to continually monitor compliance with, and voluntarily report to appropriate regulatory authorities any potential violations of, all applicable laws and regulations where it is deemed appropriate, including anti-corruption and trade sanction laws, and any failure to comply with any such laws and regulations may subject TransRe to investigations, sanctions or other remedies, including fines, injunctions, increased scrutiny or oversight by regulatory authorities. The cost of compliance or the consequences of non-compliance, including reputational damage, could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations in future periods.\nOn January 16, 2016, following implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or the \u201cJCPOA,\u201d certain trade sanctions laws of the EU and the United Nations restricting dealings with Iran and Iranian entities were substantially eased, and the U.S. also provided relief for certain restrictions on individuals and entities outside of the U.S. On Implementation Day, the U.S. also authorized, under General License H, foreign companies owned or controlled by U.S. persons, such as TRL and TRESA, to engage in certain transactions involving Iran and Iranian entities. Pursuant to General License H and a specific license issued to TransRe, TRL and TRESA provided reinsurance coverage to non-Iranian cedants that had exposure to de minimis Iran-related risks that were permissible under General License H. On May 8, 2018, the U.S. announced it would cease participation in the JCPOA and reinstated the sanctions that were in effect prior to U.S. participation. Foreign companies owned or controlled by U.S. persons were given until November 5, 2018 to withdraw from any business dealings that were entered into under General License H and any additional authorizations, including general or specific licenses, granted by OFAC. Consequently, TRL and TRESA timely discontinued such coverage. As the failure to comply with trade sanctions prohibitions could subject TransRe to investigations, significant fines and other penalties, TransRe has implemented processes and procedures to comply with the reinstated trade sanctions laws of the U.S. Additionally, TransRe may be subject to penalties and fines in jurisdictions, such as the EU, that impose restrictions on compliance with unilateral extraterritorial trade sanctions by TransRe\u2019s non-U.S. subsidiaries, including those imposed against Iran and Cuba. The cost of compliance or the consequences of non-compliance with the trade sanctions laws of the U.S. and other jurisdictions, including reputational damage, could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.\nPrior to January 13, 2017, the U.S. maintained comprehensive sanctions against Sudan. On January 13, 2017, OFAC issued a general license authorizing all transactions previously prohibited by the Sudan Sanctions Regulations, which sanctions were then revoked on October 12, 2017. As a result, beginning January 13, 2017, sanctions exclusions clauses, which TransRe utilizes in its reinsurance contracts to exclude coverage of prohibited risks, no longer excluded coverage of Sudanese risks by TransRe, and TransRe was obliged under the language of its reinsurance contracts to provide coverage and pay valid claims occurring on or after that date on any covered Sudanese risks legally permissible. Despite the lifting of U.S. sanctions, Sudan remained on the U.S. list of State Sponsors of Terrorism until December 14, 2020, when that designation was rescinded. TransRe has no direct business with Sudanese cedants or any contracts with Sudanese entities. A small number of Sudanese-related risks are underwritten by non-Sudanese cedants for which TransRe provides coverage under reinsurance treaties and which are not, as a result of the lifting of U.S. sanctions, excluded under the sanctions exclusions in such treaties. The revenue associated with such reinsurance covering this small number of Sudanese-related risks is immaterial to both TransRe and Alleghany.\nWith regards to TransRe\u2019s operations within the EU, TRC operates within the EU as a Third Country Reinsurer under Solvency II through a third country branch in France and on a cross-border basis. Currently, TransRe continues to conduct business within the EU through a branch of TRC and TRESA with no significant impact on its operations. However, TransRe could be materially and adversely affected by rules adopted by a Member State relating to Third Country Reinsurers. For example, TRC may be required to post additional collateral in EU countries or may need to consider further restructuring its business in order to comply with the rules adopted in EU countries related to Third Country Reinsurers.\nAdditionally, as described above on page 43, various aspects of Solvency II are likely to change in the near future, due to the European Commission\u2019s review of certain aspects of the Directive, which culminated in its publication of a package of proposed legislative reforms on September 22, 2021. This review of Solvency II could affect the way in which TransRe\u2019s international group, including TRESA and TRC\u2019s EU branch operate and may have a negative impact on our results. For example, it may reduce TRESA and/or TRC\u2019s regulatory solvency position by increasing capital requirements or reducing eligible funds. Any changes to Solvency II could also materially impact the group, since Solvency II affects the calculation of the solvency of international groups which, like TransRe, conduct reinsurance and insurance operations both inside and outside of the EU.\nMore generally, uncertainty remains as to: (i) how the Solvency II regime will continue to be enforced; and (ii) the continued effectiveness of the coordination and cooperation of information sharing among supervisory bodies and regulators or the effect, if any, that these developments may have on TransRe\u2019s operations and financial condition.\nOther potential regulatory risks include the introduction of more complex and intensive regulatory reporting burdens, regulatory requirements that conflict with requirements in other jurisdictions, and shortages of skilled staff in critical areas such as the actuarial function, all of which may have a negative impact on the results of TRESA, TRC and the TransRe group. In\naddition, we could be required to undertake a significant amount of additional work if our compliance with the Solvency II regime ever came into question, which in turn may divert finite resources from other business related tasks.\nRegulatory uncertainty has increased as a result of the Brexit referendum which led to the U.K. leaving the EU on January 31, 2020. The Trade Agreement between the U.K. and the EU, which now governs the terms of their relationship, does not contain many substantive provisions relating to financial services. Similarly, it is not expected that the MOU relating to financial services that has been concluded by the U.K. and the EU will materially alter this position, if it is ever formally entered into by the parties. As a result, TRL has now lost its EEA financial services passport, which enabled it to operate across borders within the single EU market without obtaining any required local regulatory approval where insurers and cedants are located.\nIn addition, the U.K.\u2019s regulatory regime in terms of prudential regulation and governance could diverge, as the U.K. is now free to determine its own regulatory regime. As described above on page 44, the U.K.\u2019s HM Treasury has concluded a period of consultation on potential changes to certain rules that have largely been transposed from Solvency II, and will now work with the PRA to prepare a package of reforms for consultation in early 2022. We cannot currently predict what changes will be made to the U.K.\u2019s regulatory regime following the culmination of this process. We may have to review our underwriting platforms and incur additional regulatory and transactional costs as a result of any changes to the U.K\u2019s regulatory regime.\nAny such divergence may affect determinations of equivalence made by the U.K. and the EU in relation to the other\u2019s prudential regime. The U.K. has already declared the EU\u2019s Solvency II regime to be equivalent to its own. However, the EU may not make the same determination. It is not clear what the impact will be on TRL, TRESA and TRC if the EU does not determine the U.K. regulatory regime to be equivalent to its own regime. Further, even if equivalence is confirmed by the EU, either side may withdraw their respective declarations in the future.\nBrexit could have a broader adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The uncertainty surrounding the effect of Brexit, including the implementation and enforcement of a number of terms and conditions of the Trade Agreement and its relationship with the remaining members of the EU (including in relation to trade and services) post-Brexit has increased economic volatility and market uncertainty globally, including the volatility of currency exchange rates, interest rates and credit spreads. It has already led, and may continue to lead, to disruptions for the European and global financial markets, such as the decrease in the value of the British Pound and of market values of listed U.K. companies, in particular from the financial services and insurance sector.\nThe U.K. has also lost access to the global trade deals negotiated by the EU on behalf of its Member States, although many of those global trade deals have been replicated by the U.K. Any consequential decline in trade could affect the attractiveness of the U.K. as a global investment center and, as a result, could have a detrimental impact on U.K. growth.\nThe long-term effect of Brexit on the value of our investment portfolio at this time is uncertain and such volatility and uncertainty will likely continue even after the conclusion of negotiations pertaining to the Trade Agreement.\nIn Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador, India and the People\u2019s Republic of China, emerging markets where TransRe underwrites business on a cross-border basis, local regulations have recently been adopted that may operate to limit, restrict or increase the costs of TransRe\u2019s access to these markets. If this trend continues to spread to other jurisdictions, TransRe\u2019s ability to operate globally may be materially and adversely affected.\nThe loss of key personnel at our operating subsidiaries could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We rely upon the knowledge and talent of the employees of our operating subsidiaries to successfully conduct their business. Changes in local employment legislation, taxation and the approach of regulatory bodies to compensation practice within our operating jurisdictions may impact our ability to recruit and retain senior employees or the cost to us of doing so. We may experience a loss of personnel as a result of federal, state or local vaccine mandates as well as difficulties in hiring replacement personnel. A loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows in future periods. Our success has depended, and will continue to depend in substantial part, upon our ability to attract and retain key personnel at our operating subsidiaries. The loss of key services of any key personnel at our operating subsidiaries may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nErrors and misconduct by our employees, agents, intermediaries or representatives may be difficult to detect and prevent and could expose us to significant legal liability and reputational harm. Our employees and the employees of our subsidiaries could engage in misconduct that adversely affects our business. It is not always possible to detect or prevent employee error or misconduct, and the controls and procedures that we have in place to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases. Losses may result from, among other things, illegal acts, unethical behavior, fraud, errors, failure to document transactions properly, failure to obtain proper internal authorization, failure to comply with underwriting or other internal guidelines by our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries or failure to comply with regulatory requirements or our internal policies. We could be subject to litigation, regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation or financial position if employees were to engage or be accused of engaging in illegal or suspicious activities or failing to comply with internal guidelines and protocols. Misconduct by employees, or even unsubstantiated allegations, could result in a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws, which impose restrictions and may carry substantial penalties. Violations of these laws or allegations of such violations could adversely affect results of operations or financial condition. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions, including the U.K. Bribery Act that took effect in 2011, generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or other commercial advantage. Our policies and controls are designed to ensure compliance with these anti-bribery laws and regulations, which often carry substantial penalties. We cannot assure you that our internal control policies and procedures always will protect us from reckless or other inappropriate acts committed by our affiliates, employees, agents or other third parties with whom we do business. In such event, we could be exposed to civil penalties, criminal penalties and other sanctions, including fines or other punitive actions. In addition, such violations could damage our business and/or our reputation. Such criminal or civil sanctions, penalties, other sanctions and damage to our business or reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nWe are subject to risks related to our use of information technology. We rely on information technology in virtually all aspects of our business. Our subsidiaries depend on the proper functioning and availability of their information technology platforms, including communications and data processing systems, in operating their businesses and their access to and the integrity of the information stored on and processed by these platforms is a related risk. These systems consist of software programs that are integral to the efficient operation of the businesses of our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries, including programs for proprietary pricing and exposure management, processing payments and claims, filing and making changes to records and providing customer support. Our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries are also required to effect electronic transmissions with third parties including brokers, clients, vendors and others with whom they do business. In addition, certain of our subsidiaries provide to customers online applications or websites through the use of a portal. These customer-facing applications and websites may increase the risk of the cybersecurity incidents described below.\nWe develop and maintain a cybersecurity and data privacy governance framework, assessment process and trainings to identify and mitigate cyber security and data privacy risks, but the development and maintenance of this program is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. To date, we have not experienced any material impact to the business or operations resulting from cybersecurity attacks or failures or disruptions of information technology systems; however, it is not possible to protect against every potential power loss, telecommunications failure, cybersecurity attack or breach or similar event that may arise and we may be impacted by such incidents in the future. Moreover, the safeguards we use are subject to human implementation and maintenance and to other uncertainties. Any of these cyber incidents may result in a violation of applicable laws or regulations (including privacy and other laws), damage our reputation, cause a loss of customers and give rise to monetary fines and other penalties which could be significant. Such events could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nA significant disruption or failure of our information technology systems may have a significant impact on our operations, potentially resulting in service interruptions, security violations, regulatory compliance failures and other operational difficulties.\nIn addition, any attack perpetrated against our information systems, or those of our affiliates, vendors, or other similar third party systems, including through a system failure, security breach or disruption by malware, ransomware or other damage, could similarly impact our operations and result in loss or misuse of information, litigation and potential liability. Further, like other corporations, we have been subject to, and will continue to be subject to, attacks on our information systems and other vulnerabilities to data security incidents. These attacks and incidents have included, or may in the future include: unauthorized access, viruses, malware or other malicious code, ransomware, deceptive social engineering campaigns (also known as \u201cphishing\u201d or \u201cspoofing\u201d), loss or theft of assets, employee errors or malfeasance, third-party errors or malfeasance, as well as system failures and other security events.\nA natural or man-made disaster could cause significant business interruptions for certain of our subsidiaries that may adversely affect their results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. The operations of certain of our subsidiaries, and those of their suppliers and customers, may potentially suffer significant business interruptions due to the effects of natural disasters (such as earthquakes, tsunamis, severe storms or hurricanes, typhoons, floods, outbreaks of pandemic or contagious diseases, including the Pandemic) or man-made disasters (such as fires, explosions, acts of terrorism or war, security breaches, cyberattacks, and power and telecommunications failures). Such business interruptions could cause those subsidiaries and their businesses to suffer serious harm to their operations, financial condition and cash flows. While we regularly assess and take steps to improve our existing business continuation and crisis management plans, there can be no assurance that these plans or the insurance coverages we maintain would be effective in mitigating any negative effects on our operations in the event of a disaster or resulting business interruption, nor can we provide assurance that the business continuation and crisis management plans of the independent suppliers and customers on whom our subsidiaries rely for certain services and products would be effective in mitigating any negative effects on the provision of such services and products in the event of a disaster.\nThe costs of complying with, or our failure to comply with, U.S. and foreign laws related to privacy, data security and data protection, such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation, could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition and our reputation. The regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding and evolving. We are subject to numerous U.S. federal and state laws and non-U.S. regulations governing the protection of personal and confidential information of our clients or employees, including the NYDFS Cybersecurity Regulation, which mandates detailed cybersecurity standards for all institutions, including insurance entities, authorized by the NYDFS to operate in New York. Among the requirements are the maintenance of a cybersecurity program with governance controls, risk-based minimum data security standards for technology systems, cyber breach preparedness and response requirements, including reporting obligations, vendor oversight, training and program record keeping and certification obligations. The NYDFS Cybersecurity Regulation has increased our compliance costs, and the consequences of noncompliance could include regulatory enforcement actions and penalties, as well as reputation risk.\nLikewise, in October 2021, the FTC amended the Safeguards Rule, or the \"Amended Safeguards Rule,\" which applies to financial institutions throughout the U.S. pursuant to the GLBA. The Amended Safeguards Rule does not come fully into effect until October 2022. Many of the requirements are similar to the NYDFS Cybersecurity Regulation, but there are some differences that may impose increased operational burdens and compliance costs. The consequences of non-compliance could include FTC enforcement action and possible fines, as well as even more burdensome requirements on and changes to our data security practices, as well as reputational harm.\nThe NAIC adopted an Insurance Data Security Model Law, which would require licensed insurance entities to comply with detailed information security requirements. The NAIC model law is similar in many respects to the NYDFS Cybersecurity Regulation and the Amended Safeguards Rule. To date, the Insurance Data Security Model Law has been adopted by several states, including some of the states where our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries are domiciled. If the NAIC model law continues to be enacted in additional states, such enacted laws could be inconsistent between states or with existing laws and regulations, which could raise compliance costs or increase the risk of noncompliance, with the attendant risk of being subject to regulatory enforcement actions and penalties, as well as reputational harm. Any such events could potentially have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are also subject to California law, including the CCPA, which went into effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA established a privacy framework for covered businesses which collect and process the personal information of California consumers. It includes a broad definition of personal information, affords California residents certain individual rights of access and deletion regarding their personal data, and limits the \u201csale\u201d of such information, which is also broadly construed to include making personal information available to third parties for valuable consideration. The CCPA established potentially severe statutory damages for businesses that fail to implement reasonable security measures to protect against breaches of personal information, and includes a broad private right of action available to affected consumers. The CCPA excludes data subject to the GLBA, discussed above under \"Business - Regulation - U.S. Regulation\u201d; however, this is not an entity-wide exception. The breach of California consumers\u2019 personal data, to the extent it involves data not covered by GLBA, represents a significant risk of liability.\nMoreover, the legal landscape relating to data privacy and data protection is quickly evolving, which may increase operational and compliance costs associated with new or amended laws and regulations. For instance, since the CCPA was enacted in 2018, the California Attorney General has issued several draft implementing regulations, including following the CCPA coming into force in 2020. In November 2020, the California Privacy Rights Act, or the \"CPRA,\" was approved by California voters to amend the CCPA and to establish a new data protection authority, the California Privacy Protection Agency, authorized to promulgate new data protection regulations and to enforce the law. Additionally, Virginia and Colorado enacted data privacy laws in 2021 that will come into effect in January 2023 and July 2023, respectively. These laws track significant portions of existing laws, such as General Data Protection Regulation ((EU) 2016/679), or the \u201cGDPR,\u201d and CCPA, but include differences that may or may not increase our compliance burden. Adapting our business and practices to the CCPA, as amended by the CPRA, and any forthcoming regulations and other state laws, may be burdensome and could involve substantial additional or diverted resources.\nMore broadly, the GDPR, which regulates data protection for all individuals within the EU, including foreign companies processing data of EU residents, became effective on May 25, 2018 and applies to all of our subsidiaries operating in the EU. In the U.K., the Data Protection Act 2018 and the U.K. General Data Protection Regulation, which is the retained EU law version of the GDPR by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 and as amended by the Data Protection, Privacy and Electronic Communications (Amendments etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019, together \"U.K. GDPR,\u201d regulates data protection for all individuals within the U.K. and applies to all of our subsidiaries operating in the U.K. The GDPR and the U.K. GDPR set out a number of requirements that must be complied with when handling the personal data of such EU and U.K. based data subjects respectively including: the obligation to appoint data protection officers in certain circumstances; rights for individuals to be \u201cforgotten\u201d and rights to data portability; the principal of accountability and the obligation to make public notification of significant data breaches. The GDPR and the U.K. GDPR include restrictions on transfers outside the U.K. and the European Economic Area, or the \u201cEEA\u201d (which includes Switzerland) and the requirement to include specific data protection provisions in\nagreements with data processors. The GDPR and the U.K. GDPR enhance individuals\u2019 rights, introduces complex and far-reaching company obligations and increases penalties significantly in case of violation. The interpretation and application of data protection laws in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere are developing and are often uncertain and in flux, and any changes to the interpretation or application of the U.K. GDPR and the GDPR, and any resultant changes in U.K. or EU member states\u2019 national laws and regulations, may increase our compliance obligations and costs and may necessitate the review and implementation of policies and processes relating to our collection and use of data. It is possible that these laws or cybersecurity regulations may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data protection or security practices.\nAny person, including any of our employees, our subsidiaries\u2019 employees or those with whom we share such information, who negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to our client or employee data, or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data, could subject us to significant monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions, fines and/or criminal prosecution in one or more jurisdictions. For example, the GDPR and the U.K. GDPR include sanctions for non-compliance, which could result in a penalty of up to the higher of (a) \u20ac20 million; and (b) 4 percent of a company\u2019s global annual revenue for the preceding financial year for certain infringements, such as unlawful data transfer outside of the EEA or the U.K. Those monetary damages, penalties, regulatory or legal actions or defaults, or the damage to our businesses or reputation, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Third parties to whom we outsource certain functions are also subject to these risks, and their failure to adhere to these laws and regulations also could damage our businesses or reputation or result in regulatory intervention, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, a material data breach could result in negative publicity which could damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Although we have not experienced any material impact to the business or operations resulting from a material data breach, it is not possible to protect against every potential power loss, telecommunications failure, cybersecurity attack or breach or similar event that may arise and we may be impacted by such incidents in the future.\nThe impact of changes in current accounting practices and future pronouncements could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP, which is periodically revised by the FASB, and they are subject to the accounting-related rules and interpretations of the SEC. We are required to adopt new and revised accounting standards implemented by the FASB. Unanticipated developments in accounting practices may require us to incur considerable additional time and expenses to comply with such developments, particularly if we are required to prepare information relating to prior periods for comparative purposes or to apply the new requirements retroactively. Changes in accounting principles, practices and standards, particularly those that apply to insurance or reinsurance businesses, also may affect our calculation of net earnings, shareholders\u2019 equity and other financial statement line items. For a description of changes in accounting standards that are currently pending and, if known, our estimates of their expected impact, see Note 1(r) to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nRisk Factors Related to our Investments and Assets\nThe valuation of our investments includes methodologies, estimates and assumptions which are subject to differing interpretations or judgments; a change in interpretations or judgments could result in changes to investment valuations that may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. The vast majority of our investments are measured at fair value using methodologies, estimates and assumptions which are subject to differing interpretations or judgments. Financial instruments with quoted prices in active markets generally have more price observability and less judgment is used in measuring fair value. Conversely, financial instruments traded in other-than-active markets or that do not have quoted prices have less observability and are measured at fair value using valuation models or other pricing techniques that require more judgment. Investments recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheet are classified in a hierarchy for disclosure purposes consisting of three \u201clevels\u201d based on the observability of inputs available in the market used to measure the fair values.\nSecurities that are less liquid are more difficult to value and trade. During periods of market disruption, including periods of significantly rising or high interest rates, rapidly widening credit spreads or illiquidity, it may be difficult to value certain of the securities in our investment portfolio if trading becomes less frequent or market data becomes less observable. Certain asset classes in active markets with significant observable data may become illiquid due to changes in the financial environment. In such cases, valuing these securities may require more subjectivity and judgment. In addition, prices provided by third-party pricing services and broker quotes can vary widely even for the same security.\nAs such, valuations may include inputs and assumptions that are less observable or require greater estimation as well as valuation methods which are more sophisticated, thereby resulting in values which may be greater or less than the value at which the investments may be ultimately sold. Further, rapidly changing or strained credit and equity market conditions could materially impact the value of securities as reported within our consolidated financial statements and the period-to-period changes in value could vary significantly. Decreases in value may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nOur investments in debt and equity securities are subject to market fluctuations. As of December 31, 2021, our investments in debt securities were approximately $16.1 billion, or approximately 73.3 percent of our total investment portfolio, and our investments in equity securities had a fair value of approximately $3.7 billion, which represented approximately 16.8 percent of our investment portfolio. The fair value of these assets and the investment income from these assets fluctuate depending on general economic and market conditions.\nWith respect to our investments in debt securities, a rise in interest rates due to a rise in inflation and/or inflation expectations or other factors, would decrease unrealized gains and/or increase unrealized losses on our debt securities portfolio and potentially produce a net unrealized loss position, offset by our ability to earn higher rates of return on reinvested funds. Conversely, a decline in interest rates would increase unrealized gains and/or decrease unrealized losses on our debt securities portfolio, offset by lower rates of return on reinvested funds. Based upon the composition and duration of our investment portfolio as of December 31, 2021, a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate $713.1 million decrease in the fair value of our debt securities portfolio. In addition, some debt securities, such as mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities, carry prepayment risk, the risk that principal will be returned more rapidly or slowly than expected, as a result of interest rate fluctuations.\nWith respect to our investments in equity securities, we consider all of our equity securities to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net earnings. A significant reduction in the value of our investment portfolio could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nDefaults, downgrades or other events impairing the value of our debt securities portfolio may reduce our earnings. We are subject to the risk that the issuers of debt securities we own may default on principal and interest payments they owe us. The occurrence of a major economic downturn, acts of corporate malfeasance, widening risk spreads or other events that adversely affect the issuers of these debt securities could cause the value of our debt securities portfolio and our net earnings to decline and the default rate of the debt securities in our investment portfolio to increase. In addition, with economic uncertainty, the credit quality of issuers could be adversely affected and a ratings downgrade of the issuers of the debt securities we own could also cause the value of our debt securities portfolio and our net earnings to decrease. Any event reducing the value of these securities other than on a temporary basis could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We continually monitor the difference between cost and the estimated fair value of our investments in debt securities. If a decline in the value of a particular debt security is deemed to be temporary, we record the decline as an unrealized loss in stockholders\u2019 equity. Credit losses for available for sale securities are recorded through an allowance for credit losses. Changes in the allowance for credit losses are recorded for (or as a reversal of) credit losses on available for sale securities, which may be material to our operating results.\nChanges in foreign currency exchange rates could impact the value of our assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. A principal exposure to foreign currency risk is our obligation to settle claims denominated in foreign currencies in the subject foreign currencies. The possibility exists that we may incur foreign currency exchange gains or losses when we ultimately settle these claims. To mitigate this risk, we maintain investments denominated in certain foreign currencies in which the claims payments will be made. To the extent we do not seek to hedge our foreign currency risk or our hedges prove ineffective, the resulting impact of a movement in foreign currency exchange rates could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nIf any of our businesses do not perform well, we may be required to recognize an impairment of our assets, including goodwill or other intangible assets or to establish a valuation allowance against the deferred income tax asset, which could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. Goodwill represents the excess of the amount we paid to acquire subsidiaries and other businesses over the fair value of their net assets as of the date of acquisition. We test goodwill at least annually for impairment. Impairment testing is performed based upon estimates of the fair value of the operating subsidiary to which the goodwill relates. The fair value of the operating subsidiary is impacted by the performance of the business. The performance of our businesses may be adversely impacted by prolonged market declines. If we determine the goodwill has been impaired, we must write down the goodwill by the amount of the impairment, with a corresponding charge to net earnings. Such write-downs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position. A decrease in the expected future earnings of an operating subsidiary could lead to an impairment of some or all of the goodwill or other long-lived intangible assets associated with such operating subsidiaries in future periods.\nDeferred income tax represents the tax effect of the differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are assessed periodically by management to determine if they are recoverable. Factors in management\u2019s determination include the performance of the business including the ability to generate capital gains. If it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax asset will not be realized based on available information then a valuation allowance must be established with a corresponding charge to net earnings. Net earnings charges and reduced value of our net deferred tax assets could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position.\nDeterioration of financial market conditions could result in the impairment of long-lived intangible assets and the establishment of a valuation allowance on our deferred income tax assets.\nRisks Related to our Senior Notes and the Credit Agreement\nOur failure to comply with restrictive covenants contained in the indentures governing the Senior Notes (as defined on page 103 of this Form 10-K) or any other indebtedness, including indebtedness under our revolving credit facility and any future indebtedness, could trigger prepayment obligations, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The indentures governing the Senior Notes contain covenants that impose restrictions on Alleghany and TransRe with respect to, among other things, the incurrence of liens on the capital stock of certain of our subsidiaries. In addition, the indentures governing the Senior Notes contain certain other covenants, including covenants to timely pay principal and interest, and the Credit Agreement (as defined on page 101 of this Form 10-K) also requires us to comply with certain covenants. Our failure to comply with such covenants could result in an event of default under the indentures, under the Credit Agreement or under any other debt agreement we may enter into in the future, which could, if not cured or waived, result in us being required to repay the Senior Notes, the indebtedness under the Credit Agreement or any other future indebtedness. As a result, our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity could be adversely affected.\nTo service our debt, we will require a significant amount of cash, which may not be available to us. Our ability to make payments on, or repay or refinance, our debt, including the Senior Notes, will depend largely upon the future performance and use of our investment portfolio and our future operating performance, including the operating performance of our subsidiaries. Our future performance, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. In addition, our ability to borrow funds in the future will depend on the satisfaction of the covenants in the indentures governing the Senior Notes, in the Credit Agreement and in other debt agreements we may enter into in the future. Under the Credit Agreement, we also need to maintain certain financial ratios. We cannot assure you that our business, including the operating performance of our subsidiaries, will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under the Credit Agreement or from other sources in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt, including the Senior Notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs.", "PERMNO": 71271, "SIC": 6331, "TIC": "Y"}
