{"cik": "945983", "company": "Wayside Technology Group, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-04", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nInvestors should carefully consider the risk factors set forth below as well as the other information contained in this report. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or those currently viewed by us to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nChanges in the information technology industry and/or economic environment may reduce demand for the products and services we sell. Our results of operations are influenced by a variety of factors, including the condition of the IT industry, general economic conditions, shifts in demand for, or availability of, computer products and software and IT services and industry introductions of new products, upgrades or methods of distribution. The information technology products industry is characterized by abrupt changes in technology, rapid changes in customer preferences, short product life cycles and evolving industry standards. Net sales can be dependent on demand for specific product categories, and any change in demand for or supply of such products could have a material adverse effect on our net sales, and/or cause us to record write-downs of obsolete inventory, if we fail to react in a timely manner to such changes.\nWe rely on our suppliers for product availability, marketing funds, purchasing incentives and competitive products to sell. We acquire products for resale both directly from manufacturers and indirectly from distributors. The loss of a supplier could cause a disruption in the availability of products. Additionally, there is no assurance that as manufacturers continue to or increasingly sell directly to end users and through the distribution channel, that they will not limit or curtail the availability of their products to distributors/resellers like us. For example, resellers and software vendors may attempt to increase the volume of software products distributed electronically through ESD (Electronic Software Distribution) technology, through subscription services, and through on-line shopping services, and correspondingly, decrease the volume of products sold through us. Our inability to obtain a sufficient quantity of products, or an allocation of products from a manufacturer in a way that favors one of our competitors, or competing distribution channels, relative to us, could cause us to be unable to fill clients\u2019 orders in a timely manner, or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We also rely on our suppliers to provide funds for us to market their products, including through our on-line marketing efforts, and to provide purchasing incentives to us. If any of the suppliers that have historically provided these benefits to us decides to reduce such benefits, our expenses would increase, adversely affecting our results of operations.\nGeneral economic weakness may reduce our revenues and profits. Generally, economic downturns, may cause some of our current and potential customers to delay or reduce technology purchases, resulting in longer sales cycles, slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition. We may, therefore, experience a greater decline in demand for the products we sell, resulting in increased competition and pressure to reduce the cost of operations. Any benefits from cost reductions may take longer to realize and may not fully mitigate the impact of the reduced demand. In addition, weak financial and credit markets heighten the risk of customer bankruptcies and create a corresponding delay in collecting receivables from those customers and may also affect our vendors\u2019 ability to supply products, which could disrupt our operations. The realization of any or all these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nEconomic, political and market conditions can adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, including our revenue growth and profitability, which in turn could adversely affect our stock price. Our business is influenced by a range of factors that are beyond our control and that we have no comparative advantage in forecasting. Macroeconomic developments like evolving trade policies between the U.S. and international trade partners, or the occurrence of similar events in the U.S. or other countries that lead to uncertainty or instability in economic, political or market conditions could negatively affect our business, operating results, financial condition and\noutlook, which, in turn, could adversely affect our stock price. In addition, international, regional or domestic political unrest and the related potential impact on global stability, terrorist attacks and the potential for other hostilities in various parts of the world, potential public health crises (such as the coronavirus outbreak) and natural disasters continue to contribute to a climate of economic and political uncertainty that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, including our revenue growth and profitability.\nThe IT products and services industry is intensely competitive and actions of competitors, including manufacturers of products we sell, can negatively affect our business. Competition has been based primarily on price, product availability, speed of delivery, credit availability and quality and breadth of product lines and, increasingly, also is based on the ability to tailor specific solutions to client needs. We compete with manufacturers, including manufacturers of products we sell, as well as a large number and wide variety of marketers and resellers of IT products and services. In addition, manufacturers are increasing the volume of software products they distribute electronically directly to end-users and in the future, will likely pay lower referral fees for sales of certain software licensing agreements sold by us. Generally, pricing is very aggressive in the industry, and we expect pricing pressures to continue. There can be no assurance that we will be able to negotiate prices as favorable as those negotiated by our competitors or that we will be able to offset the effects of price reductions with an increase in the number of clients, higher net sales, cost reductions, or greater sales of services, which service sales typically are delivered at higher gross margins, or otherwise. Price reductions by our competitors that we either cannot or choose not to match could result in an erosion of our market share and/or reduced sales or, to the extent we match such reductions, could result in reduced operating margins, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe way software products are distributed and sold is changing, and new methods of distribution and sale may emerge or expand. Software vendors have sold, and may intensify their efforts to sell, their products directly to end-users. There can be no assurances that software developers and vendors will continue using distributors and resellers to the same extent they currently do. Future efforts by software developers and vendors to bypass third-party sales channels could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, resellers and software vendors may attempt to increase the volume of software products distributed electronically through ESD (Electronic Software Distribution) technology, through subscription services, and through on-line shopping services. Any of these competitive programs, if successful, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company\u2019s business and results of operations may be adversely affected if the terms and conditions of the Company\u2019s authorizations with its vendors were to be significantly modified or if certain products become unavailable to the Company.\nWe offer credit to our customers and, therefore, are subject to significant credit risk. We sell our products to a large and diverse customer base. We finance a significant portion of such sales through trade credit, typically by providing 30-75-day payment terms. In addition, we offer extended payment terms to certain customers for terms of 1-3 years. As a result, our business could be adversely affected in the event of a deterioration of the financial condition of our customers, resulting in the customers\u2019 inability to repay us. This risk may increase if there is a general economic downturn affecting a large number of our customers and in the event our customers do not adequately manage their business or properly disclose their financial condition. Also, several of our larger customers require greater than 30-day payment terms which could increase our credit risk and decrease our operating cash flow.\nWe face substantial competition from other companies. We compete in all areas of our business against local, regional, national, and international firms. Some of our current competitors have substantially greater capital resources and sales and distribution capabilities than we do. In response to competitive pressures from any of our current or future competitors, we may be required to lower selling prices in order to maintain or increase market share, and such measures could adversely affect our operating results. In addition, we face competition from vendors, which may choose to market their products directly to end-users, rather than through channel partners such as the Company, and this could adversely affect our future sales. Many competitors compete based principally on price and may have lower costs or accept lower selling prices than we do and, therefore, our gross margins may not be maintainable. Our gross margins have declined historically and may continue to decline in the future. Our competitors may offer better or different products and services\nthan we offer. In addition, we do not have guaranteed purchasing volume commitments from our customers and, therefore, our sales volume may be volatile.\nOur business is substantially dependent on a limited number of customers and vendors, and the loss or any change in the business habits of such key customers or vendors may have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. Because our standing arrangements and agreements with our customers and vendors typically contain no purchase or sale obligations and are terminable by either party upon several months or otherwise relatively short notice, we are subject to significant risks associated with the loss or change at any time in the business habits and financial condition of key customers or vendors. We have experienced the loss and changes in the business habits of key customer and vendor relationships in the past and expect to do so again in the future.\nSales of products purchased from our largest two vendors accounted for 39% of our 2019 purchases and sales from our largest five vendors generated approximately 54% of 2019 purchases. As is the case with many of our vendor and customer relationships, our contractual arrangements with these large vendors are terminable by either party upon several months\u2019 notice. If these contracts or our relationships with these vendors terminate for any reason, or if any of our other significant vendor relationships terminate for any reason, and we are not able to sell or procure a sufficient supply of those products from alternative sources, or at all, our financial position and results of operations would be adversely affected. Our vendors are subject to many if not all of the same (or similar) risks and uncertainties to which we are subject, as well as other risks and uncertainties, and we compete with others for their business. Accordingly, we are at a continual risk of loss of their business on account of a number of factors and forces, many of which are largely beyond our control.\nIn 2019, our two largest customers accounted for 42% of our net sales and our largest five customers accounted for 56% of our net sales. If any of our significant customer relationships terminate for any reason, and we are not able to replace those customers and associated revenues, our financial position and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nDisruptions in our information technology and voice and data networks could affect our ability to service our clients and cause us to incur additional expenses. We believe that our success to date has been, and future results of operations likely will be, dependent in large part upon our ability to provide prompt and efficient service to clients. Our ability to provide such services is dependent largely on the accuracy, quality and utilization of the information generated by our IT systems, which affect our ability to manage our sales, client service, distribution, inventories and accounting systems and the reliability of our voice and data networks.\nFailure to adequately maintain the security of our electronic and other confidential information could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We are dependent upon automated information technology processes. Privacy, security, and compliance concerns have continued to increase as technology has evolved to facilitate commerce and as cross-border commerce increases. As part of our normal business activities, we collect and store certain confidential information, including personal information of employees and information about partners and clients which may be entitled to protection under several regulatory regimes. In the course of normal and customary business practice, we may share some of this information with vendors who assist us with certain aspects of our business. Moreover, the success of our operations depends upon the secure transmission of confidential and personal data over public networks, including the use of cashless payments. Although we did not have any material cybersecurity breaches in 2019 and 2018, any failure on the part of us or our vendors to maintain the security of data we are required to protect, including via the penetration of our network security and the misappropriation of confidential and personal information, could result in business disruption, damage to our reputation, financial obligations to third parties, fines, penalties, regulatory proceedings and private litigation with potentially large costs, and also result in deterioration in our employees\u2019, partners\u2019 and clients\u2019 confidence in us and other competitive disadvantages, and thus could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on certain key personnel. Our future success will be largely dependent on the efforts of key management personnel for strategic and operational guidance as well as relationships with our key vendors and customers. We also believe that our future success will be largely dependent on our continued ability to attract and retain highly qualified management, sales, service, finance and technical personnel. We cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and retain such personnel. Further, we make a significant investment in the training of our sales account executives. Our\ninability to retain such personnel or to train them either rapidly enough to meet our expanding needs or in an effective manner for quickly changing market conditions could cause a decrease in the overall quality and efficiency of our sales staff, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf the Company fails to maintain an effective system of internal controls or discovers material weaknesses in its internal controls over financial reporting, it may not be able to report its financial results accurately or timely or detect fraud, which could have a material adverse effect on its business. An effective internal control environment is necessary for the Company to produce reliable financial reports and is an important part of its effort to prevent financial fraud. The Company is required to annually evaluate the effectiveness of the design and operation of its internal controls over financial reporting. Based on these evaluations, the Company may conclude that enhancements, modifications, or changes to internal controls are necessary or desirable. While management evaluates the effectiveness of the Company's internal controls on a regular basis, these controls may not always be effective. There are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of internal controls, including collusion, management override, and failure in human judgment. In addition, control procedures are designed to reduce rather than eliminate financial statement risk. If the Company fails to maintain an effective system of internal controls, or if management or the Company's independent registered public accounting firm discovers material weaknesses in the Company's internal controls, it may be unable to produce reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business. In addition, the Company may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the SEC or the NASDAQ. Any such actions could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of the Company's financial statements, which could cause the market price of its Common Stock to decline or limit the Company's access to capital.\nThe Company may be subject to intellectual property rights claims, which are costly to defend, could require payment of damages or licensing fees and could limit the company's ability to use certain technologies in the future. Certain of the Company's products and services include intellectual property owned primarily by the Company's\nthird-party suppliers. Substantial litigation and threats of litigation regarding intellectual property rights exist in the software and some service industries. From time to time, third parties (including certain companies in the business of acquiring patents not for the purpose of developing technology but with the intention of aggressively seeking licensing revenue from purported infringers) may assert patent, copyright and/or other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to the company's business. In some cases, depending on the nature of the claim, the company may be able to seek indemnification from its suppliers for itself and its customers against such claims, but there is no assurance that it will be successful in obtaining such indemnification or that the Company is fully protected against such claims. Any infringement claim brought against the company, regardless of the duration, outcome, or size of damage award, could result in substantial cost to the Company, divert management's attention and resources, be time consuming to defend, result in substantial damage awards, or cause product shipment delays.\nAdditionally, if an infringement claim is successful the Company may be required to pay damages or seek royalty or license arrangements, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms. The payment of any such damages or royalties may significantly increase the Company's operating expenses and harm the Company's operating results and financial condition. Also, royalty or license arrangements may not be available at all. The Company may have to stop selling certain products or using technologies, which could affect the Company's ability to compete effectively.\nWe may explore additional growth through acquisitions. As part of our growth strategy, we may pursue the acquisition of companies that either complement or expand our existing business. As a result, we regularly evaluate potential acquisition opportunities, which may be material in size and scope. In addition to those risks to which our business and the acquired businesses are generally subject, the acquisition of these businesses gives rise to transactional and transitional risks, and the risk that the anticipated benefits will not be realized.\nChanges in income tax and other regulatory legislation. We operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and make plans for our structure and operations based upon existing laws and anticipated future changes in the law. When new legislation is enacted with minimal advance notice, or when new interpretations or applications of existing laws are made, we may need to implement changes in our policies or structure. We are susceptible to unanticipated changes in legislation, especially relating to income and other taxes, import/export laws, hazardous materials and other laws related to trade, accounting and business activities. Such changes in legislation may have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe may be subject to litigation. We may be subject to legal claims or regulatory matters involving stockholder, consumer, antitrust, intellectual property and other issues. Litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings could occur. An unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages or other adverse effects. Were an unfavorable ruling to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our business, financial position and results of operations for the period in which the ruling occurred or future periods.\nOur business could be negatively affected as a result of the actions of activist shareholders. Publicly traded companies have increasingly become subject to campaigns by activist investors advocating corporate actions such as financial restructurings, increased borrowings, special dividends, stock repurchases or even sales of assets or entire companies to third parties or the activists themselves. Responding to proxy contests and other actions by activist shareholders can be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our operations and divert the attention of our Board of Directors and senior management from the pursuit of business strategies, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, perceived uncertainties as to our future direction as a result of shareholder activism or changes to the composition of the Board of Directors may lead to the perception of a change in the direction of the business, instability or lack of continuity. These uncertainties may be more acute or heightened when an activist seeks to change a majority of the Board of Directors or ultimately desires to acquire the Company. Additionally, actions by activist shareholders may be exploited by our competitors, cause concern to our current or potential customers, make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and may create adverse uncertainty for our employees.\nOn December 20, 2019, Simon F. Nynens nominated four individuals for election to our Board of Directors at the 2020 annual meeting of stockholders. Mr. Nynens previously served as the Chairman of the Board of Directors, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. According to publicly available filings made to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Mr. Nynens granted to Shepherd Kaplan Krochuk, LLC (\u201cSKK\u201d) an irrevocable proxy to vote his shares of our common stock in favor of any acquisition proposal by SKK, against any third-party acquisition and as directed by SKK with respect to the election of directors nominated by persons other than the Company. Prior to the entrance of Mr. Nynens into such agreement with SKK, the Company had received unsolicited acquisition proposals from SKK and North & Webster SSG, LLC (\u201cN&W\u201d and together with SKK, the \u201cN&W Group\u201d) jointly to acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company. The most recent unsolicited acquisition proposal from the N&W Group was received on December 10, 2019 and expired on its own terms on December 16, 2019.\nWhile the N&W Group\u2019s most recent proposal has expired, there can be no assurance that the N&W Group or another third party will not make another unsolicited acquisition proposal in the future and no assurance that if the four persons proposed by Mr. Nynens for election at our 2020 annual meeting are elected, they will not attempt to influence the Company\u2019s decision related to any future acquisition proposal made by the N&W Group or another third party.\nBy letter dated January 22, 2020, a shareholder of the Company demanded that the Board of Directors investigate and bring an action against Mr. Nynens for his breaches of certain restrictive covenants contained in the separation agreement he entered into with the Company on or about May 11, 2018. Following receipt of the shareholder demand, we filed a lawsuit on February 14, 2020, in the Superior Court of New Jersey Monmouth County, against Mr. Nynens and the N&W Group on the grounds that Mr. Nynens breached certain restrictive covenants in his separation agreement with the Company by seeking future employment with the Company and by sharing confidential information with the N&W Group, and that the N&W Group had tortiously induced Mr. Nynens to commit those breaches. In connection with the claims, we are seeking monetary damages, injunctive relief, and a declaratory judgment against Mr. Nynens and the N&W Group. We may choose to initiate, or may become subject to, other litigation as a result of continued or further stockholder activist campaigns, which could serve as a distraction to our Board of Directors and management and could require us to incur additional costs.\nOur quarterly financial results may fluctuate, which could lead to volatility in our stock price. Our revenue and operating results have fluctuated from quarter to quarter in the past and may continue to do so in the future. As a result, you should not rely on quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results as an indication of our future performance. Fluctuations in our revenue and operating results could negatively affect the trading price of our stock. In addition, our revenue and results of operations may, in the future, be below the expectations of analysts and investors, which could\ncause our stock price to decline. Factors that are likely to cause our revenue and operating results to fluctuate include the risk factors discussed throughout this section.\nThe elimination of LIBOR could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. The U. K.\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. The U.S. Federal Reserve has begun publishing a Secured Overnight Funding Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d), which is intended to replace U.S. dollar LIBOR. Plans for alternative reference rates for other currencies have also been announced. At this time, we cannot predict how markets will respond to these proposed alternative rates or the effect of any changes to LIBOR or the discontinuation of LIBOR. If LIBOR is no longer available or if our lenders have increased costs due to changes in LIBOR, we may experience potential increases in interest rates on our variable rate debt, which could adversely impact our interest expense, results of operations and cash flows.\nChanges in accounting rules, or the misapplication of current accounting rules, may adversely affect our future financial results. We prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. These accounting principles are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the SEC, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (\u201cAICPA\u201d) and various other bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting policies. Future periodic assessments required by current or new accounting standards may result in noncash charges and/or changes in presentation or disclosure. In addition, any change in accounting standards may influence our customers\u2019 decision to purchase from us or finance transactions with us, which could have a significant adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.\nWe are required to determine if we are the principal or agent in all transactions with our customers. The voluminous number of products and services we sell, and the manner in which they are bundled, are technologically complex. Mischaracterization of these products and services could result in misapplication of revenue recognition polices. We use estimates where necessary, such as allowance for doubtful accounts and product returns, which require judgment and are based on best available information. If we are unable to accurately estimate the cost of these services or the timeline for completion of contracts, the profitability of our contracts may be materially and adversely affected.\nThe inability to obtain financing on favorable terms will adversely impact our business, financial position and results of operations. Our business requires working capital to operate and to finance accounts receivable and product inventory that are not financed by trade creditors. We have historically relied upon cash generated from operations, revolving credit facilities and trade credit from our vendors to satisfy our capital needs and finance growth. As the financial markets change, the cost of acquiring financing and the methods of financing may change. Changes in our credit rating or other market factors may increase our interest expense or other costs of capital, or capital may not be available to us on competitive terms to fund our working capital needs.\nWe may not be able to continue to pay dividends on our Common Stock in the future, which could impair the value of our Common Stock. We have paid a quarterly dividend on our Common Stock since the first quarter of 2003. Any future declaration of dividends remains subject to further determination from time to time by our Board of Directors. Our ability to pay dividends in the future will depend on our financial results, liquidity and financial condition. There is no assurance that we will be able to pay dividends in the future, or if we are able to, that our Board of Directors will continue to declare dividends in the future, at current rates or at all. If we discontinue or reduce the amount or frequency of dividends, the value of our Common Stock may be impaired.\nRisks related to our Common Stock. The exercise of options or any other issuance of shares by us may dilute your ownership of our Common Stock. Our Common Stock is thinly traded, which may be exacerbated by our repurchases of our Common Stock. As a result of the thin trading market for our stock, its market price may fluctuate significantly more than the stock market as a whole or of the stock prices of similar companies. Without a larger float, our Common Stock will be less liquid than the stock of companies with broader public ownership, and, as a result, the trading prices for our Common Stock may be more volatile. Among other things, trading of a relatively small volume of our Common Stock may have a greater impact on the trading price of our stock than would be the case if our public float were larger.\nOur Common Stock is listed on The NASDAQ Global Market, and we therefore are subject to continued listing requirements, including requirements with respect to the market value and number of publicly-held shares, number of stockholders, minimum bid price, number of market makers and either (i) stockholders\u2019 equity or (ii) total market value of stock, total assets and total revenues. If we fail to satisfy one or more of the requirements, we may be delisted from The NASDAQ Global Market. If we do not qualify for listing on The NASDAQ Capital Market, and if we are not able to list our Common Stock on another exchange, our Common Stock could be quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board or on the \u201cpink sheets\u201d. As a result, we could face significant adverse consequences including, among others, a limited availability of market quotations for our securities and a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.", "PERMNO": 81893, "SIC": 5045, "TIC": "WSTG"}
