While we believe we have identified and\ndiscussed below the key risk factors affecting our business, there may be additional\nrisks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that\nwe currently deem to be immaterial that may adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition, results of operations, cash flows or share\nprice in the future.\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Market\nThe further spread of COVID-19 and its variants may adversely impact our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of\noperations in the short-term and for the foreseeable future.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic caused significant disruption to economic\nactivity and financial markets and adversely impacted our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations. Given the ongoing\nand dynamic nature of COVID-19 and its variants, the ultimate\neffects on the broader economy and the markets in which we serve are highly uncertain\nand difficult to predict. Future impacts to our\nbusiness and customers could be widespread and material, such as increased\nunemployment, supply-chain interruptions; declines in demand\nfor loans and other banking services and products; reduction in business activity\nand financial transactions; increased commercial property\nvacancy rates, declines in the value of loan collateral, including energy\nand real-estate collateral; declines in the credit quality of our loan\nportfolio; volatile performance of our investment securities portfolio;\nand overall economic and financial market instability.\nActions taken by governmental and regulatory authorities in response\nto the pandemic have impacted, and may continue to impact, the\nbanking and financial services industries. In March 2020, the Federal Reserve lowered\nthe Federal Funds rate, which may reduce our net\ninterest income and earnings. Additional regulation of the financial markets may be enacted in the future that could further\nimpact our\nbusiness.\nWe also participate in the Paycheck Protection Program, or\nPPP, a government lending program implemented to aid individuals\nand businesses. Since the inception of the PPP, many banks have been subject\nto litigation related to agent fees and application processing.\nAs a result of our ongoing and future participation in the PPP and similar government stimulus and relief programs,\nwe may experience\nlosses arising from fraud, litigation or regulatory action.\nAny of the factors discussed above, taken together or in combination with other events or\noccurrences that may not yet be known or\nanticipated, may materially and adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations. The further spread of the COVID-\n19 outbreak, as well as ongoing or new governmental, regulatory and\nprivate sector responses to the pandemic, may materially disrupt\nbanking and other economic activity in the areas in which we operate. The ultimate impacts of the pandemic\non our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations will depend on future developments\nand other factors that are highly uncertain and difficult to predict.\nA decline in general business and\neconomic conditions and any regulatory responses to such conditions\ncould have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, financial position, results\nof operations and growth prospects.\nOur business and operations, which primarily consist of lending\nmoney to clients in the form of loans and borrowing money from\nclients in the form of deposits, are sensitive to general economic conditions,\nparticularly in Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma, Texas and Arizona.\nUnfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions\nmay constrain our growth and profitability from our lending and deposit\noperations, lead to credit quality concerns related to borrower repayment\nability and collateral protection, and reduce demand for the\nproducts and services we offer. Our business is also significantly affected\nby monetary and other regulatory policies, which are influenced by\nmacroeconomic conditions and other factors beyond our control.\nUncertainty surrounding the federal fiscal policymaking process, the\nmedium and long-term fiscal outlook of the federal government and future\ntax rates are concerns for businesses, consumers and investors.\nAdverse economic conditions and governmental policy responses to such conditions\ncould have a material adverse effect on our business,\nfinancial position, results of operations, and growth prospects.\nOur profitability depends on interest rates generally, and we may be adversely\naffected by changes in market interest rates.\nOur profitability depends in substantial part on our net interest income,\nwhich depends on many factors that are partly or completely\noutside of our control, including competition, economic conditions and\nmonetary and fiscal policies. Changes in interest rates could affect\nour ability to originate loans and deposits, reduce the carrying value of\nassets on our balance sheet, reduce the value and marketability of loan\ncollateral, and create higher payment burdens for our borrowers (which may\nincrease potential for default). Sustained periods of low interest\nrates may cause us to experience net interest margin compression. The ratio of variable\n-\nto fixed-rate loans in our loan portfolio, the ratio of\nshort-term (maturing at a given time within 12 months) to long-term\nloans, and the ratio of our demand, money market and savings deposits\nto certificates of deposit (and their time periods) are the primary factors\naffecting the sensitivity of our net interest income to changes in\nmarket interest rates. Fluctuations in market rates and other market\ndisruptions are neither predictable nor controllable and may adversely\naffect our financial condition, earnings and results of operation.\nWe may not be able to implement aspects of our growth strategy, which\nmay adversely affect our ability to maintain our\nhistorical earnings trends.\nWe may not be able to sustain our growth at the rate we have enjoyed during\nthe past several years, which has been driven primarily\nby new market expansion, the strength of commercial and real estate lending\nin our market areas, and our ability to identify and attract high\ncaliber experienced banking talent. During the COVID-19 pandemic\nour growth was bolstered by government programs that may not\ncontinue, such as PPP loans issued in 2020 and 2021. A downturn in local economic market conditions, our failure to attract and retain high\nperforming personnel, and the inability to attract core funding and quality\nlending clients, among other factors, could limit our ability to grow\nas rapidly as we have in the past and may have a negative effect on our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to manage the risks associated with our anticipated growth\nand expansion through de novo branching,\nmergers and acquisitions, new lines of business, or new offerings\nof services, products or product enhancements.\nIf our business continues to grow as anticipated, we may become more susceptible\nto risks related to both general growth and specific\nareas of growth. Generally, risks are associated with attempting to maintain\neffective financial and operational controls as we grow, such as\nmaintaining appropriate loan underwriting and credit monitoring\nprocedures, maintaining an adequate allowance for loan losses, controlling\nconcentrations and complying with regulatory or accounting requirements. Such\nrisks may result in, among other effects, in increased loan\nlosses, reduced earnings, potential regulatory penalties and future restrictions\non growth. We may also be exposed to certain risks associated\nwith the specific components of our growth strategy, as discussed in more detail\nbelow.\nExpansion through De Novo Branching\n: Our growth strategy includes evaluating opportunities to grow\nthrough de novo branching.\nDe novo branching carries with it certain potential risks, including\nsignificant startup costs and anticipated initial operating losses; an\ninability to gain regulatory approval; an inability to hire or retain qualified\nsenior management to successfully operate the branch and\nintegrate our corporate culture; challenges associated with securing attractive\nlocations at a reasonable cost; poor market reception in\nlocations where we do not have a preexisting reputation; unfavorable\nlocal economic conditions; and the additional strain on management\nresources and internal systems and controls. Failure to adequately manage\nany of the foregoing risks could have an adverse effect on our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.\nMergers and Acquisitions\n: As part of our growth strategy, we may pursue mergers and acquisitions of banks and nonbank financial\nservices companies within or outside our principal market\nareas. Mergers and acquisitions involve numerous risks associated with entry\ninto\nnew markets or locations; integration and management of the combined entities;\ndiversion of financial and management resources from\nexisting operations; assumption of unanticipated problems, such\nnonperforming loans and latent liabilities; unanticipated costs; and potential\nfuture impairments to goodwill and other intangible assets. If we finance acquisitions\nby issuing convertible debt or equity securities, our\nexisting stockholders may be diluted, which could affect the market price of\nour common stock. As a condition to receiving regulatory\napproval, we may also be required to sell banking locations, which may not\nbe acceptable to us or may reduce the benefit of the acquisition.\nThe failure to obtain these regulatory approvals could impact our business plans and\nrestrict our growth. Any one or more of these factors\ncould materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nNew Lines of Business, Services, Products or Product Enhancements\n: From time to time, we may implement or acquire new lines\nof business or offer new services, products or product enhancements. There are\nsubstantial risks and uncertainties associated with developing,\nimplementing and marketing such offerings, including significant investment\nof financial and other resources, inability to accurately predict\nprice and profitability targets, failure to realize expected benefits, regulatory\ncompliance and shifting market preferences.\nThese risks could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial\ncondition.\nPhase-out of the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) and uncertainty\nrelating to alternative reference rates may\nadversely affect our results of operations.\nLIBOR is used extensively as a reference rate for various financial contracts,\nincluding adjustable-rate loans, asset-backed securities,\nand interest rate swaps. In July 2017, the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR,\nannounced that it intends\nto stop persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021,\nsuch date was later extended to June 30, 2023. Accordingly,\ncontinuation of LIBOR cannot be guaranteed after June 30, 2023 and\nalternative reference rates must be established.\nManagement is\ncurrently evaluating the impact of this transition as it relates to new and existing\ncontracts and customers. We will be required to implement\nsubstitute indices for the calculation of interest rates under our loan agreements\nand we are currently evaluating appropriate alternatives to\nLIBOR.\nImplementing the LIBOR phase-out will involve additional expense\nand may reduce the value of our LIBOR-based loans and\nsecurities and impact the availability and cost of hedging instruments and\nborrowings.\nIf we fail to successfully execute the transition, we\nmay be subject to disputes or litigation with clients over the appropriateness\nof substitute LIBOR indices. The ultimate impact of the LIBOR\nphase-out on the valuations, pricing and operation of our financial instruments\nis not yet known and difficult to predict and may adversely\naffect our results of operations. At December 31, 2021, $1.3 billion of our loans were tied to LIBOR.\nThe fair value of our investment securities can fluctuate due to factors outside\nof our control.\nAs of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the fair value of our debt securities portfolio\nwas approximately $746 million,\n$655 million, and $739 million, respectively. Factors beyond our control\ncan significantly influence the fair value of securities in our\nportfolio and may cause potential adverse changes to the fair value of these securities. These factors\ninclude, but are not limited to, rating\nagency actions, defaults by the issuer or with respect to the underlying securities, changes\nin market interest rates and instability in the capital\nmarkets. These and other factors could cause other-than-temporary impairments, realized or unrealized\nlosses in future periods and declines\nin other comprehensive income and the value of our common stock, any of which\ncould materially and adversely affect our business, results\nof operations, financial condition and prospects. Our inability to accurately predict\nthe future performance of an issuer or to efficiently\nrespond to changing market conditions could result in a decline in the value of our\ninvestment securities portfolio, which could have an\nadverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe could suffer material credit losses if we do not appropriately manage\nour credit risk.\nThere are risks inherent in making any loan, including risks inherent in dealing\nwith individual borrowers, risks of non-payment, risks\nresulting from uncertainties as to the future value of collateral and risks resulting\nfrom changes in economic and industry conditions. There is\nno assurance that our loan approval and credit risk monitoring procedures are or\nwill be adequate to reduce the inherent risks\nassociated with\nlending. Our credit administration personnel and our policies and procedures\nmay not adequately adapt to changes in economic or any other\nconditions affecting clients and the quality of our loan portfolio, including\nany impacts of the continuing COVID-19 outbreak. Any failure to\nmanage such credit risks may materially adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\nWe have credit exposure to the energy industry.\nWe have credit exposure to the energy industry in each of our primary markets\nand across the United States. A downturn or lack of\ngrowth in the energy industry and energy-related business could adversely\naffect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nProlonged or further pricing pressure on oil and gas could lead to increased\ncredit stress in our energy portfolio, increased losses associated\nwith our energy portfolio, increased utilization of our contractual obligations\nto extend credit, and weaker demand for energy lending. Such a\ndecline or general uncertainty resulting from continued volatility could\nhave other adverse impacts that are difficult to isolate or quantify, all\nof which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition\nand results of operations.\nA concentration in commercial real\nestate lending could cause our regulators to restrict our ability to\ngrow.\nAs a part of their regulatory oversight, the federal regulators have issued guidance on\nConcentrations in Commercial Real Estate\nLending, Sound Risk Management Practices (the \u201cCRE Concentration Guidance\u201d)\nwith respect to a financial institution\u2019s concentrations in\nCRE lending activities. Such guidance identifies certain concentration\nlevels that, if exceeded, will expose an institution to additional\nsupervisory analysis\nThe guidelines identify the following as preliminary indications of possible CRE\nconcentration risk: (i) the institution\u2019s\ntotal construction, land development and other land loans represent 100% or\nmore of total capital and reserves; or (ii) total CRE loans as\ndefined in the guidance, or Regulatory CRE, represent 300% or more\nof the institution\u2019s total capital and reserves, and the institution\u2019s\nRegulatory CRE has increased by 50% or more during the prior 36-month period. We believe\nthat the CRE Concentration Guidance is\napplicable to us. The FDIC or other federal regulators may become concerned\nabout our CRE loan portfolio, and they could limit our ability\nto grow by restricting approvals of new branches and other growth opportunities\nor by requiring us to raise additional capital, reduce our loan\nconcentrations or undertake other remedial actions.\nMany of our loans are to commercial borrowers, which have a higher\ndegree of risk than other types of loans.\nAs of December 31, 2021, approximately 83% of our loan portfolio\nrelated to commercial-based lending. Commercial purpose loans\nare often larger and involve greater risks than other types of lending. Repayment\nof these loans often depend on the successful operation or\ndevelopment of the property or business involved and are highly sensitive to\nadverse conditions in the real estate market or the general\neconomy.\nAccordingly, a downturn in the real estate market or the general economy could impair\nthe borrowers\u2019 ability to repay and\nheightens our risk related to commercial purpose loans, particularly CRE loans. Losses incurred\non a small number of commercial purpose\nloans could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition\nand results of operations due to the larger-than-average size of each\ncommercial purpose loan and collateral that is generally less readily-marketable.\nBecause a portion of our loan portfolio is comprised of real estate\nloans, negative changes in the economy affecting real\nestate values could impair the value of collateral securing our real estate\nloans and result in loan and other losses.\nAdverse changes affecting real estate values or operating cash flows of\nreal estate, particularly in the markets in which we operate,\ncould increase the credit risk associated with our loan portfolio, and\ncould result in losses that adversely affect credit quality and our financial\ncondition and results of operation. Market value of real estate can fluctuate\nsignificantly in a short period of time. Negative changes in the\neconomy affecting real estate values or operating cash flows in our market\nareas could significantly impair the value and marketability of\nproperty pledged loan collateral and may require us to increase our allowance\nfor loan losses, any of which could have a material adverse\nimpact on our business, results of operations and growth prospects.\nOur largest loan relationships make up a significant percentage of\nour total loan portfolio.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our 25 largest borrowing relationships totaled approximately\n$1 billion in total commitments (representing,\nin the aggregate, 21% of our total outstanding commitments as of December\n31, 2021). Our five largest borrowing relationships, based on\ntotal commitments, accounted for 7% of total commitments as of December\n31, 2021. This concentration of borrowers may expose us to\nmaterial losses if one or more of these relationships becomes delinquent or\nsuffers default. The allowance for loan losses may not be\nadequate to cover such losses, and any loss or increase in the allowance would negatively\naffect our earnings and capital. Even if these loans\nare adequately collateralized, an increase in classified assets could harm\nour reputation with our regulators and inhibit our ability to execute\nour business plan.\nA portion of our loan portfolio\nis comprised of participation and syndicated transaction interests, which\ncould have an\nadverse effect on our ability to monitor the lending relationships and lead\nto an increased risk of loss.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $97 million of purchased loan participations\nfrom other financial institutions and a combination of\nshared national credits and syndication interests purchased totaling $371\nmillion. Although we comply with our general underwriting criteria\non these loan participations and syndicated loans, these loans may have\na higher risk of loss than loans we originate and administer.\nIn such\ntransactions in which we are not the lead lender, we rely in part on the lead lender or\nthe agent, as the case may be, to monitor the\nperformance of the loan and provide information that we use to classify the loan\nand associated loan loss provisions. If our underwriting or\nmonitoring of these loans is not sufficient, our nonperforming loans may increase\nand our earnings may decrease.\nOur levels of nonperforming assets could increase, which would\nadversely affect our results of operations and financial\ncondition, and could result in losses in the future.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our nonperforming loans (which consist of nonaccrual\nloans, loans past due 90 days or more and still\naccruing interest and loans modified under troubled debt restructurings that are\nnot performing in accordance with their modified terms)\ntotaled $32 million and our nonperforming assets (which include\nnonperforming loans plus other real estate owned) totaled $33 million.\nHowever, we can give no assurance that our nonperforming assets will continue\nto remain at these levels and we may experience increases in\nnonperforming assets in the future. Nonperforming assets adversely affect\nour management resources, net income, risk profile and capital\nmaintenance levels, efficiency ratio and returns on assets and equity,\nany of which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and\nresults of operation.\nOur allowance may not be adequate to cover actual loan losses.\nA significant source of risk arises from the possibility that we could sustain losses due to loan defaults and nonperformance on\nloans.\nWe maintain an allowance in accordance with GAAP to provide for such defaults and other nonperformance. As of December 31, 2021, our\nallowance as a percentage of total loans was 1.37% and our allowance as a percentage\nof nonperforming loans was 185.19%. The amount of\nfuture losses is susceptible to changes in economic, operating and other\nconditions, including changes in interest rates and the continuing\nimpact of the COVID-19 pandemic, many of which are beyond our control.\nOur underwriting policies, adherence to credit monitoring\nprocesses and risk management systems and controls may not prevent unexpected\nlosses. Our allowance may not be adequate to cover actual\nloan losses. Moreover, any increase in our allowance will adversely affect our earnings\nby decreasing our net income.\nDetermining the appropriate level of allowance is an inherently difficult\nprocess based on numerous assumptions. In June 2016, the\nFinancial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU 2016-13,\nFinancial Instruments-Credit Losses\n, which significantly altered the way the\nallowance for credit losses is determined. The new Current Expected\nCredit Losses (\u201cCECL\u201d) model will become effective for us, on January\n1, 2022, the implementation date. Under the new CECL model, we will be required to use historical information,\ncurrent conditions and\nreasonable forecasts to estimate the expected loss over the life of the loan.\nSmaller commercial borrowers may have fewer resources, which\nmay impair their ability to repay loans.\nWe have many small- to medium-sized business customers, which frequently have\nsmaller market shares and fewer financial resources\n(in terms of capital or borrowing capacity) than larger entities.\nAccordingly, these businesses may be more vulnerable to economic\ndownturns, often need substantial additional capital to expand or compete,\nand may experience substantial volatility in operating results, any\nof which may impair a borrower\u2019s ability to repay a loan. If these or other borrowers\nare harmed by adverse business conditions, our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely\naffected.\nWe rely on our senior management team and may have difficulty\nidentifying, attracting and retaining necessary personnel,\nwhich may divert resources and limit our ability to execute our business\nstrategy and successfully grow our business.\nOur continued growth and successful operation of our business depends,\nin large part, on our ability to hire and retain highly qualified\nand motivated personnel at every level. Our senior management team has\nsignificant industry experience, and their knowledge and\nrelationships would be difficult to replace in the event of departure or retirement of\nsenior managers.\nWe must also hire and retain qualified\nbanking personnel to continue to grow our business. Competition\nfor senior executives and skilled personnel in the financial services and\nbanking industry is significant, and costs associated with incenting and retaining\nskilled personnel may be material and continue to increase.\nIf we are unable to hire and retain qualified personnel or successfully address management\nsuccession issues, we may be unable to\nsuccessfully execute our business strategy and manage our growth, which\ncould have a material adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition or results of operations.\nWe rely on short-term funding, which can be adversely affected by local and\ngeneral economic conditions.\nAs of December 31, 2021, approximately\n$4 billion, or 87%, of our deposits consisted of demand, savings, money market, and\ntransaction accounts (including negotiable order of withdrawal accounts). The\napproximately $1 billion remaining balance of deposits\nconsisted of certificates of deposit, of which approximately $538\nmillion, or 11% of our total deposits, was due to mature within one year.\nBased on our experience, we believe that our savings, money market and noninterest\n-bearing accounts are relatively stable sources of funds.\nOur ability to attract and maintain deposits, as well as our cost of funds, has been,\nand will continue to be significantly affected by general\neconomic conditions. In addition, as market interest rates rise, we will have\ncompetitive pressure to increase the rates we pay on deposits. If\nwe increase interest rates paid to retain deposits, our earnings may be adversely affected.\nOur largest deposit relationships currently make up a significant percentage\nof our deposits and the withdrawal of deposits\nby our largest depositors could force us to fund our business through\nmore expensive and less stable sources.\nAt December 31, 2021, our 30 largest depositors accounted for 29%\nof our total deposits and our five largest depositors accounted for\n10% of our total deposits. Withdrawals of deposits by any one of our largest depositors\nor by one of our related client groups could force us\nto rely more heavily on borrowings and other sources of funding to meet business and\nwithdrawal demands, adversely affecting our net\ninterest margin and results of operations. Such circumstances may require\nus raise deposit rates to attract new deposits and rely more heavily\non other funding sources that could be more expensive and less stable.\nUnder applicable regulations, if the Company was no longer\n\u201cwell-\ncapitalized,\u201d we would be required to obtain FDIC approval to accept\nbrokered deposits and could also be subject to a deposit rate cap\nprohibiting us from paying in excess of 75 basis points above national deposit rates.\nLiquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations and meet our\nobligations as they become due, and failure to\nmaintain sufficient liquidity could materially adversely affect our growth,\nbusiness, profitability and financial condition.\nLiquidity is essential to our business, sufficient levels of which are required\nto fund asset growth, serve client demand for loans, pay\nour debt obligations, and meet other cash commitments. Liquidity risk is the potential\nthat we will be unable to meet our obligations as they\ncome due because of an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate\nfunding without adverse conditions or consequences. Liquidity risk\ncan increase due to a number of factors, including an over-reliance on a particular\nsource of funding, market-wide phenomena such as market\ndislocation and major disasters, and a high concentration of large\ndepositors.\nThe Bank\u2019s primary funding source is client deposits. Other\nsources of funding may include advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank\n(\u201cFHLB\u201d), the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City (\u201cFRB\u201d),\nand our acquisition of brokered deposits, internet subscription certificates of deposit,\nand reciprocal deposits through the Intrafi Network.\nAlthough the Bank has historically been able to replace maturing deposits\nand advances as necessary, it might not be able to replace such\nfunds in the future. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of loans, securities and other sources could\nhave a\nsubstantial negative effect on liquidity. Any substantial, unexpected or prolonged change in the level or cost of\nliquidity could have a material\nadverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, and could\nimpair our ability to fund operations and meet our obligations as\nthey become due and could jeopardize our financial condition.\nOur historical growth rate and performance may not be indicative of\nour future growth or financial results and our ability to\ncontinue to grow is dependent upon our ability to effectively manage\nthe increases in scale of our operations.\nWe may not be able to sustain our historical rate of growth or grow our business at all. Additionally, we may not be able\nto maintain\nhistorical levels of expenses. Consequently, our historical results of operations\nwill not necessarily be indicative of our future operations.\nWe may not be able to maintain sufficient capital in the future, which\nmay adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity,\nresults of operations, and our ability to maintain regulatory compliance.\nOur business strategy calls for continued growth. We may need to raise additional capital in\nthe future to support our continued\ngrowth and to maintain our required regulatory capital levels. Our ability\nto raise additional capital depends on conditions in the capital\nmarkets, economic conditions, and a number of other factors, including investor\nperceptions regarding the banking industry, market\nconditions and governmental activities, our financial condition and performance,\nand competition with other financial institutions for capital\nsources. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to raise additional capital in the future\non acceptable terms, which may adversely affect our\nliquidity, growth strategy, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face strong competition from banks, credit unions, Financial\nTechnology Company (\u201cFinTech\u201d) and other financial\nservices providers that offer banking services, which may limit our ability\nto attract and retain banking clients.\nCompetition in the banking industry generally, and in our primary markets\nspecifically, is intense. Competitors include banks and\nother financial services providers, such as savings and loan institutions, brokerage\nfirms, credit unions, mortgage banks, and other financial\nintermediaries. In particular, we compete with larger national and\nregional financial institutions, whose greater resources afford them many\ncompetitive advantages.\nSuch resources may enable our competitors to achieve larger economies of\nscale; offer more services; spend more\non advertising and technological investments; offer better lending rates to clients;\nbetter diversify their loan portfolio; and have less\nvulnerability to downturns in local economies and real estate markets.\nIf we are unable to offer competitive products and services as quickly\nas our larger competitors, our business may be negatively affected. We also compete\nagainst community banks, credit unions and nonbank\nfinancial services companies with strong local ties to small- and\nmedium-sized businesses that we target, and we may be unable to attract and\nretain such clients as effectively as these smaller competitors.\nAdditionally, we face growing competition from so-called \u201conline\nbusinesses\u201d\nwith few or no physical locations, including financial technology companies,\nonline banks, lenders and consumer and commercial lending\nplatforms, and automated retirement and investment service providers.\nNew technology and other changes increasingly allow parties to\neffectuate online financial transactions with little to no involvement from\nbanks, including bill payment, funds transfers, and maintenance of\nfunds in brokerage accounts or mutual funds that would have historically been\nheld as bank deposits.\nThe process of eliminating banks as\nintermediaries, known as \u201cdisintermediation,\u201d could reduce our\nincome from fees and deposits.\nUltimately, we may be unable to compete\nsuccessfully against current and future competitors, which may reduce\nour revenue stream and prevent us from growing our loan and deposit\nportfolios, any of which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial\ncondition.\nOur risk management framework may not be effective in mitigating\nrisks or losses to us, and we may incur losses due to\nineffective risk management processes and strategies.\nOur risk management framework is comprised of various processes, systems and\nstrategies designed to manage our risk exposure,\nincluding credit, market, liquidity, interest rate, operational, reputation,\nbusiness, and compliance risks. Our framework also includes\nfinancial or other modeling methodologies that involve highly subjective\nmanagement assumptions and judgment. Our risk management\nframework may not be effective under all circumstances and may not\nadequately mitigate risks or losses, which could result in adverse\nregulatory consequences and unexpected losses and our business, financial\ncondition, results of operations or growth prospects could be\nmaterially and adversely affected. We may also be subject to potentially adverse regulatory consequences.\nWe are required to make significant judgments, assumptions and estimates\nin the preparation of our financial statements and\nour judgments, assumptions and estimates may not be accurate.\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity\nwith GAAP requires us to make judgments, assumptions\nand estimates that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial\nstatements and accompanying notes. Our critical accounting\npolicies, which are included in the section captioned \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion\nand Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations,\u201d describe those significant accounting policies and methods\nused in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements that\nwe consider \u201ccritical\u201d because they require judgments, assumptions, and estimates\nthat materially affect our consolidated financial statements\nand related disclosures. As a result, if future events or regulatory views concerning such analysis differ significantly\nfrom the judgments,\nassumptions, and estimates in our critical accounting policies, those events\nor assumptions could have a material impact on our consolidated\nfinancial statements and related disclosures, in each case resulting in our need\nto revise or restate prior period financial statements, cause\ndamage to our reputation and the price of our common stock and adversely\naffect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting,\nwe may not be able to report accurate and timely\nfinancial results, which may cause material harm to our business.\nOur management team is responsible for establishing and maintaining\nadequate internal control over financial reporting and for\nevaluating and reporting on that system of internal control. Our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting is a process designed to provide\nreasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting\nand the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in\naccordance with GAAP. As a public\ncompany, we are required to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and other rules that govern public\ncompanies. Unless we remain an EGC and elect additional transitional relief available\nto EGCs, our independent registered public accounting\nfirm may be required to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial\nreporting beginning as of that annual report on Form\n10-K. We will continue to periodically test and update, as necessary, our internal control\nsystems, including our financial reporting controls.\nOur actions, however, may not be sufficient to result in an effective internal\ncontrol environment, and any future failure to maintain effective\ninternal control over financial reporting could impair the reliability of our\nfinancial statements which in turn could harm our business, impair\ninvestor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and\nour access to the capital markets, cause the price of our\ncommon stock to decline and subject us to regulatory penalties.\nFailure to keep pace with technological change could adversely affect\nour business.\nAdvances and changes in technology could significantly affect our business, financial\ncondition, results of operations, and future\nprospects. The financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological\nchange with frequent introductions of new\ntechnology-driven products and services. Failure to successfully keep pace\nwith technological change affecting our industry could harm our\nability to compete effectively. Many of our competitors have substantially\ngreater resources to invest in technological improvements. We face\nmany challenges, including the increased demand to provide clients electronic\naccess to their accounts and the cost and implementation of\nsystems to perform electronic banking transactions. Our ability to compete\ndepends on our ability to continue to adapt technology on a timely\nand cost-effective basis to meet these demands. We may not be able to effectively or timely implement\nnew technology-driven products and\nservices or be successful in marketing these products and services to our clients. As these technologies are improved\nin the future, we may be\nrequired to make significant capital expenditures in order to remain competitive,\nwhich may increase our overall expenses and have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations\nand cash flows.\nWe are exposed to cybersecurity threats and potential security breaches,\nand our efforts to minimize or respond to such\nthreats may not be effective to prevent significant harm to the Company.\nWe conduct a portion of our business over the Internet. We rely heavily upon data processing,\nsoftware, communications and\ninformation systems from a number of third parties to conduct our business. Our\nbusiness involves the storage and transmission of clients\u2019\nproprietary information and security breaches could expose us to a risk of\nloss or misuse of such information, litigation and potential liability.\nOur operations are vulnerable to disruptions from human error, natural\ndisasters, power loss, computer viruses, spam attacks, denial of\nservice attacks, unauthorized access, and other unforeseen events. Undiscovered\ndata corruption could render our client information\ninaccurate. Third-party or internal systems and networks may fail to operate\nproperly or become disabled due to deliberate attacks or\nunintentional events. Security breaches and cyberattacks may cause\nsignificant increases in operating costs, including the costs of\ncompensating clients for any resulting losses they may incur and the\ncosts and capital expenditures required to correct the deficiencies in and\nstrengthen the security of data processing and storage systems.\nWhile we believe we are in compliance with all applicable privacy and data\nsecurity laws, an incident could put our client\nconfidential information at risk and expose us to significant liability. We\nhave been the target of data and cyber security attacks and\nmay\nexperience attacks in the future. While we have not experienced a material\ncyber-incident or security breach that has been successful in\ncompromising our data or systems to date, we can never be certain that all of our\nsystems are entirely free from vulnerability to breaches of\nsecurity or other technological difficulties or failures. The\nperpetual evolution of known cyber-threats requires us to devote significant\nresources to maintain, regularly update and backup our data security\nsystems and processes, as we may not be able to anticipate, or\neffectively implement preventative measures against, all cyber-attacks. A security breach or other cyber-incident could have an adverse\nimpact on, among other things, our revenue, ability to attract and maintain clients\nand our reputation. In addition, a security breach could also\nsubject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and expose us to civil litigation and\npossible financial liability, all of which could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operati\nons.\nWe rely on client, counterparty and third-party information, which subjects\nus to risks if that information is not accurate or\nis incomplete.\nIn deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with clients and\ncounterparties, we rely on information furnished\nto us by or on behalf of clients and counterparties, including financial statements and\nother financial information. We also rely on\nrepresentations of clients and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness\nof that information and, with respect to financial statements,\non reports of independent auditors. While we have a practice of seeking to independently verify\nclient information that we use in deciding\nwhether to extend credit or to agree to a loan modification, including employment,\nassets, income and credit score, not all client information\nis independently verified, and if any of the information that is independently verified\n(or any other information considered in the loan review\nprocess) is misrepresented and such misrepresentation is not detected prior\nto loan funding, the value of the loan may be significantly lower\nthan expected. Whether a misrepresentation is made by the applicant, another third party\nor one of our employees, we generally bear the risk\nof loss associated with the misrepresentation. We may not detect all misrepresented information\nin our approval process. Any such\nmisrepresented information could adversely affect our business, financial condition\nand results of operations.\nWe are subject to certain operating risks related to employee error and\nclient, employee and third-party misconduct, which\ncould harm our reputation and business.\nEmployee error or employee and client misconduct could subject us to financial\nlosses or regulatory sanctions and seriously harm our\nreputation. Misconduct by our employees could include hiding unauthorized\nactivities from us, improper or unauthorized activities on behalf\nof our clients or improper use of confidential information. It is not always possible to\nprevent employee error or misconduct, and the\nprecautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in\nall cases. Because the nature of the financial services business\ninvolves a high volume of transactions, certain errors may be repeated\nor compounded before they are discovered and successfully rectified.\nOur necessary dependence upon processing systems to record and process\ntransactions and our large transaction volume may further increase\nthe risk that employee errors, tampering or manipulation of those systems will result in\nlosses that are difficult to detect. Employee error or\nmisconduct could also subject us to financial claims. If our internal control\nsystems fail to prevent or detect an occurrence, it could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nFraudulent activity could damage our reputation, disrupt our businesses,\nincrease our costs and cause losses.\nAs a financial institution, we are inherently exposed to operational risk in the\nform of theft and other fraudulent activity by employees,\nclients and other third parties targeting us and our clients or data. Such activity\nmay take many forms, including check fraud, electronic fraud,\nwire fraud, phishing, social engineering, and other dishonest acts. Although the Company devotes substantial resources\nto maintaining\neffective policies and internal controls to identify and prevent such incidents,\ngiven the increasing sophistication of possible perpetrators, the\nCompany may experience financial losses or reputational harm as a result of\nfraud. In addition, we may be required to make significant\ncapital expenditures in order to modify and enhance our protective measures or\nto investigate and remediate fraudulent activity. Although we\nhave not experienced any material business or reputational harm as a result of fraudulent\nactivities in the past, the occurrence of fraudulent\nactivity could damage our reputation, disrupt our business, increase\nour costs and cause losses in the future.\nOur operations could be interrupted if our third-party service providers\nexperience difficulty, terminate their services or fail\nto comply with banking regulations.\nWe depend, to a significant extent, on a number of relationships with third-party\nservice providers. Specifically, we receive core\nsystems processing, essential web hosting and other internet systems, loan\nand deposit processing, and other processing services from\nthird-\nparty service providers. If these third-party service providers experience\nfinancial, operational or technological difficulties or terminate their\nservices and we are unable to replace them with other service providers, our\noperations could be interrupted. If an interruption were to\ncontinue for a significant period of time, our business, financial condition\nand results of operations could be adversely affected, perhaps\nmaterially. Even if we are able to replace our service providers, it may be at a higher cost to\nus, which could adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nWe follow a relationship-based operating model and negative public opinion\ncould damage our reputation and adversely\nimpact our earnings.\nReputation risk, or the risk to our business, earnings and capital from negative\npublic opinion, is inherent in our business. Negative\npublic opinion can result from our actual or alleged conduct in any number\nof activities, including lending practices, corporate governance\nand acquisitions, and from actions taken by government regulators and\ncommunity organizations in response to those activities. Negative\npublic opinion can adversely affect our ability to keep and attract clients and employees\nand can expose us to litigation and regulatory action\nand adversely affect our results of operations. Although we take steps to minimize reputation risk in dealing with our\nclients and\ncommunities, this risk will always be present given the nature of our business.\nIf third parties infringe upon our intellectual property or if we were\nto infringe upon the intellectual property of third parties,\nwe may expend significant resources enforcing or defending our rights or\nsuffer competitive injury.\nWe rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, trade secret laws, and confidentiality\nprovisions to establish and protect our\nintellectual property rights. If we fail to successfully maintain, protect and\nenforce our intellectual property rights, our competitive position\ncould suffer. Similarly, if we were to infringe on the intellectual property rights of\nothers, our competitive position could suffer. Third parties\nmay challenge, invalidate, circumvent, infringe or misappropriate our intellectual\nproperty, or such intellectual property may not be sufficient\nto permit us to take advantage of current market trends or otherwise to provide\ncompetitive advantages, which could result in costly redesign\nefforts, discontinuance of certain product or service offerings or other\ncompetitive harm.\nWe may also be required to spend significant resources to monitor and police our\nintellectual property rights. Some of our competitors\nmay independently develop similar technology, duplicate our products\nor services or design around our intellectual property, and in such\ncases we may not be able to assert our intellectual property rights against such parties.\nFurther, our contractual arrangements may not\neffectively prevent disclosure of our confidential information or provide\nan adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of our\nconfidential or proprietary information. We may have to litigate to enforce or determine\nthe scope and enforceability of our intellectual\nproperty rights, trade secrets and know-how, which could be time-consuming\nand expensive, could cause a diversion of resources and may\nnot prove successful. The loss of intellectual property protection or the inability\nto obtain rights with respect to third-party intellectual\nproperty could harm our business and ability to compete. In addition,\nbecause of the rapid pace of technological change in our industry,\naspects of our business and our products and services rely on technologies developed\nor licensed by third parties, and we may not be able to\nobtain or continue to obtain licenses and technologies from these third parties on reasonable\nterms or at all.\nWe may be exposed to risk of environmental liabilities or failure to comply with\nregulatory requirements with respect to\nproperties to which we take title.\nIn the course of our business, we may foreclose and take title to real estate, and\nthese properties could subject us to environmental\nliabilities and other federal, state or local regulatory requirements, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act. We do not know whether\nexisting requirements will change or whether compliance with future requirements\nwill involve significant expenditures. We may be held\nliable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage, personal\ninjury, investigation and clean-up costs incurred by these\nparties in connection with environmental contamination, or we may be\nrequired to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic substances, or\nchemical releases at a property. The costs associated with these investigation or remediation activities\ncould be substantial. In addition, if we\nare the owner or former owner of a contaminated site, we may be subject to claims\nand damages from third parties related to environmental\ncontamination emanating from the property. If we ever become subject\nto significant environmental liabilities or costs or fail to comply with\nregulatory requirements with respect to these properties, our business, financial\ncondition, liquidity and results of operations could be\nmaterially and adversely affected.\nThe costs and effects of litigation, investigations or similar matters,\nor adverse facts and developments related thereto, could\nmaterially affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe may be involved from time to time in a variety of litigation, investigations or\nsimilar matters arising out of our business. It is\ninherently difficult to assess the outcome of these matters, and we may\nnot prevail in proceedings or litigation.\nInsurance may not cover all\nsuch claims or losses, our indemnification rights may not be honored, and\nwe may suffer damage to our reputation, regardless of the merit or\neventual outcome of a claim.\nThe ultimate judgments or settlements in any litigation or investigation could\nhave a material adverse effect on\nour business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition,\npremiums for insurance covering the financial and banking sectors\nare\nrising. We may not be able to obtain appropriate types or levels of insurance in the future, nor may\nwe be able to obtain adequate replacement\npolicies with acceptable terms or at historic rates, if at all.\nFinancial counterparties expose the Company to risks.\nWe maintain correspondent bank relationships, manage certain loan\nparticipations, engage in securities transactions and engage in\nother activities with financial counterparties that are customary to our\nindustry. Many of these transactions expose us to counterparty credit,\nliquidity and/or reputational risk in the event of default by the counterparty,\nnegative publicity, and complaints about the counterparty or the\nfinancial services industry in general. Although we seek to manage these risks through internal controls and procedures,\nwe may experience\nloss or interruption of business, damage to our reputation, or incur\nadditional costs or liabilities as a result of unforeseen events with these\ncounterparties. Any financial cost, liability or reputational damage could have a material adverse effect on our business,\nwhich in turn, could\nhave a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nSevere weather, natural disasters, pandemics, and other external events could\nsignificantly impact our business.\nSevere weather, including tornadoes, droughts, hailstorms and\nother natural disasters, pandemics, such as the recent outbreak of\nCOVID-19, acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external events could have\na significant impact on our ability to conduct business.\nSuch events could affect the stability of our deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers\nto repay outstanding loans, impair the value of\ncollateral securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in\nloss of revenue or cause us to incur additional expenses. Operations in\nour markets could be disrupted by both the evacuation of large portions\nof the population as well as damage or lack of access to our banking\nand operation facilities. Other severe weather or natural disasters, pandemics,\nacts of war or terrorism or other adverse external events may\noccur in the future. Although management has established business continuity plans and procedures, the occurrence\nof any such events could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nRisks Relating to Our Regulatory Environment\nWe are subject to extensive regulation, which increases the cost and\nexpense of compliance and could limit or restrict our\nactivities, which in turn may adversely impact our earnings and ability\nto grow.\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment and are subject to regulation,\nsupervision and examination by a number of governmental\nregulatory agencies, including, with respect to the Bank, the FDIC and the OSBCK and,\nwith respect to the Company, the Federal Reserve.\nRegulations adopted by these agencies govern a comprehensive range\nof matters relating to ownership and control of our shares, our\nacquisition of other companies and businesses, permissible activities for us\nto engage in, maintenance of adequate capital levels, dividend\npayments and other aspects of our operations. Bank regulators possess broad authority\nto prevent or remedy unsafe or unsound practices or\nviolations of law. If, as a result of an examination, a banking agency determines\nthat an aspect of our operations were unsatisfactory, or that\nwe were, or our management was, in violation of any law or regulation, they may take\na number of different remedial actions as they deem\nappropriate. These actions include the power to enjoin \u2018\u2018unsafe or unsound\u2019\u2019 practices, to require affirmative action to correct any conditions\nresulting from any violation or practice, to issue an administrative order that\ncan be judicially enforced, to direct an increase in our capital, to\nrestrict our growth, to assess civil money penalties against us, our officers\nor directors, to fine or remove officers and directors and, if it is\nconcluded that such conditions cannot be corrected or there is an imminent\nrisk of loss to depositors, to terminate the Bank\u2019s FDIC deposit\ninsurance and place the Bank into receivership or conservatorship. Any regulatory action against us could\nhave a material adverse effect on\nour business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGovernment policy, legislation and regulation, particularly monetary\npolicy from the Federal Reserve, significantly affect economic\ngrowth and financial operations, including our distribution of credit, bank\nloans, investments, deposits, product offerings and disclosures,\ninterest rates and bankruptcy proceedings for consumer residential real\nestate mortgages. The laws and regulations applicable to the banking\nindustry could change at any time and we cannot predict the effects of these changes\non our business, profitability or growth strategy.\nIncreased regulation could increase our cost of compliance, adversely\naffect profitability and inhibit our ability to conduct business consistent\nwith historical performance. If we do not comply with governmental regulations,\nwe may be subject to fines, penalties, lawsuits or material\nrestrictions on our businesses and growth that may damage our reputation\nand adversely affect our business operations. Proposed legislative\nand regulatory actions may not occur within expected time frames, or at all, which\ncreates additional uncertainty for our business and\nindustry.\nAccordingly, legislative and regulatory actions taken now or in the future could\nhave a material adverse impact our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operation.\nMany of our expansion and growth plans require regulatory approvals,\nand failure to obtain them may restrict our growth.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we may expand our business by pursuing\nstrategic acquisitions of financial institutions, adding\nbranches and other complementary businesses. Generally, we must receive\nfederal and state regulatory approval before we can acquire an\nFDIC-insured depository institution or related business. In determining\nwhether to approve a proposed acquisition, federal and state banking\nregulators will consider, among other factors, the effect of the acquisition\non competition, our financial condition, our future prospects and\nthe impact of the proposal on U.S. financial stability. The regulators also review current\nand projected capital ratios, the competence,\nexperience and integrity of management and its record of compliance with laws and\nregulations, the convenience and needs of the\ncommunities to be served and the effectiveness of the acquiring institution\nin combating money laundering activities.\nThe Federal Reserve may require the Company to commit capital resources\nto support the Bank.\nAs a matter of policy, the Federal Reserve expects a bank holding company to act as a source\nof financial and managerial strength to\nits subsidiary banks.\nThe Federal Reserve may charge the bank holding company with engaging\nin unsafe and unsound practices for failure\nto adequately commit resources to a subsidiary bank. Accordingly, we may be required to make capital injections into\na troubled subsidiary\nbank, even if such contribution creates a detriment to the Company or its stockholders.\nIf we do not have sufficient resources on hand to fund\nthe capital injection, we may be required borrow funds or raise capital.\nAny such loans are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and\nto\ncertain indebtedness of the subsidiary bank. In the event of bankruptcy of\nthe bank holding company, claims based upon any commitments to\nfund capital injections are entitled to a priority of payment over claims made\nby general unsecured creditors, including holders of\nindebtedness. Thus, any borrowing incurred by the Company to make required capital\ninjections to the Bank are difficult and expensive, and\nwill adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and future\nprospects. Additionally, under the Financial Institutions Reform\nRecovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 (\u201cFIRREA\u201d), losses caused by a failing bank subsidiary might be charged\nto the capital of an affiliate\nbank. Moreover, any bank operating under the Company\u2019s common control\nmay also be required to contribute capital to a failing affiliate\nbank within the Company\u2019s control group. This is known as FIRREA\u2019s \u201ccross-guarantee\u201d\nprovision. The Company currently has one bank\nsubsidiary.\nThe Company and the Bank are subject to stringent capital requirements\nthat may limit our operations and potential growth.\nThe Company and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements.\nFailure to meet minimum capital requirements will\nresult in certain mandatory and discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken,\ncould have a direct material effect on our financial\nstatements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory\nframework for prompt corrective action, the Company and the\nBank must\nmeet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of our\nassets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet commitments as\ncalculated under these regulations. In order to be a \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d depository\ninstitution under prompt corrective action standards (but\nwithout taking into account the capital conservation buffer requirement described\nbelow), a bank must maintain a CET1 risk-based capital\nratio of 6.5% or more, a tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or more, a total\nrisk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or more and a leverage ratio\nof 5.0% or more (and is not subject to any order or written directive specifying\nany higher capital ratio). The failure to meet the established\ncapital requirements under the prompt corrective action framework could result\nin one or more of our regulators placing limitations or\nconditions on our activities, including our growth initiatives, or restricting\nthe commencement of new activities, and such failure could\nsubject us to a variety of enforcement remedies available to the federal\nregulatory authorities, including limiting our ability to pay dividends,\nissuing a directive to increase our capital and terminating the Bank\u2019s FDIC deposit insurance,\nwhich is critical to the continued operation of\nthe Bank.\nDue to the completed phase-in of a capital conservation buffer requirement,\nthe Company and the Bank must effectively maintain a\nCET1 capital ratio of 7.0% or more, a tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.5% or more,\na total risk-based capital ratio of 10.5% or more and, for\nthe Bank, a leverage ratio of 5.0% or more and for the Company, a leverage ratio\nof 4.0% or more. Many factors affect the calculation of our\nrisk-based assets and our ability to maintain the level of capital required to achieve acceptable\ncapital ratios, such as increases to our risk-\nweighted assets, loan impairments, loan losses exceeding the amount reserved\nfor such losses and other factors that decrease our capital,\nthereby reducing the level of the applicable ratios. Our failure to remain\nwell-capitalized could affect client and investor confidence, our\nability to grow, our costs of funds, the interest rates that we pay on deposits, FDIC insurance\ncosts, our ability to pay dividends on common\nstock, our ability to make acquisitions, and our business, results of operations\nand financial condition.\nHigher FDIC deposit insurance premiums and assessments could adversely\naffect our financial condition.\nOur deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the DIF and are subject\nto deposit insurance assessments to maintain deposit\ninsurance. As an FDIC-insured institution, we are required to pay quarterly deposit insurance premium assessments to the\nFDIC. Although\nwe cannot predict what the insurance assessment rates will be in the future, either a deterioration\nin our risk-based capital ratios or\nadjustments to the base assessment rates could have a material adverse impact\non our business, financial condition, results of operations and\ncash flows.\nWe face a risk of noncompliance and enforcement action with respect to\nthe Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money\nlaundering statutes and regulations.\nThe BSA, the PATRIOT Act and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and\nmaintain\nan effective anti-money laundering program and to file reports such as suspicious\nactivity reports and currency transaction reports. Violation\nof such requirements may result in significant civil money penalties imposed\nby federal banking agencies and Financial Crimes Enforcement\nNetwork, which agencies have recently engaged in coordinated enforcement\nefforts against banks and other financial services providers with\nthe U.S. Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d), the Drug Enforcement Administration and the IRS. We are also subject to increased\nscrutiny of\ncompliance with the rules enforced by the OFAC, which may require sanctions\nfor dealing with certain persons or countries. If the policies,\nprocedures and systems of our company, or any of our subsidiaries, are\ndeemed deficient, we would be subject to fines and regulatory\nactions, which may include restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and\nrequirements to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with\ncertain aspects of our business plan, including our acquisition plans.\nFailure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money\nlaundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences\nfor us. Any of these results could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations\nand growth prospects.\nRegulations relating to privacy, information security and data protection\ncould increase our costs, affect or limit how we\ncollect and use personal information and adversely affect our business\nopportunities.\nWe are subject to various privacy, information security and data protection laws, including\nrequirements concerning security breach\nnotification, and we could be negatively impacted by these laws. For example,\nour business is subject to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act which,\namong other things: (i) imposes certain limitations on our ability to share non-public\npersonal information about our clients with non-\naffiliated third parties; (ii) requires that we provide certain disclosures to clients about\nour information collection, sharing and security\npractices and afford clients the right to \u201copt out\u201d of any information sharing by us with\nnon-affiliated third parties (with certain exceptions);\nand (iii) requires that we develop, implement and maintain a written comprehensive\ninformation security program containing safeguards that\nare appropriate based on our size and complexity, the nature and scope of\nour activities and the sensitivity of client information we process,\nas well as plans for responding to data security breaches. Many state and federal\nbanking regulators, states and foreign countries have also\nenacted data security breach notification requirements with varying levels\nof individual, consumer, regulatory or law enforcement\nnotification in certain circumstances in the event of a security breach. Moreover,\nlegislators and regulators in the United States and other\ncountries are increasingly adopting or revising privacy, information security\nand data protection laws that potentially could have a significant\nimpact on our current and planned privacy, data protection and information\nsecurity-related practices, our collection, use, sharing, retention\nand safeguarding of client or employee information, and some of our current or\nplanned business activities. This could also increase our costs\nof compliance and business operations and could reduce income from certain\nbusiness initiatives. This includes increased privacy-related\nenforcement activity at the federal level by the Federal Trade Commission, as well as at the state level.\nCompliance with current or future privacy, data protection and information\nsecurity laws (including those regarding security breach\nnotification) affecting client or employee data to which we are subject could result\nin higher compliance and technology costs and could\nrestrict our ability to provide certain products and services, which could have\na material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions\nor results of operations. Our failure to comply with privacy, data protection and\ninformation security laws could result in potentially\nsignificant regulatory or governmental investigations or actions, litigation,\nfines, sanctions and damage to our reputation, which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of\noperations.\nWe face increased risk under the terms of the CRA\nas we accept additional deposits in new geographic markets.\nUnder the terms of the CRA, each appropriate federal bank regulatory\nagency is required, in connection with its examination of a\nbank, to assess such bank\u2019s record in assessing and meeting the credit needs of\nthe communities served by that bank, including low- and\nmoderate-income neighborhoods. During these examinations, the regulatory\nagency rates such bank\u2019s compliance with the CRA as\n\u201cOutstanding,\u201d \u201cSatisfactory,\u201d \u201cNeeds to Improve\u201d or \u201cSubstantial Noncompliance.\u201d\nThe Bank had a CRA rating of \u201cSatisfactory\u201d as of its\nmost recent CRA assessment. The regulatory agency\u2019s assessment of an institution\u2019s record is part of the regulatory agency\u2019s consideration\nof\napplications to acquire, merge or consolidate with another banking\ninstitution or its holding company, or to open or relocate a branch office.\nAs we accept additional deposits in new geographic markets, we will be required\nto maintain an acceptable CRA rating, which may be\ndifficult.\nWe are subject to numerous laws designed to protect consumers, including\nthe CRA and fair lending laws,\nand failure to\ncomply with these laws could lead to a wide variety of sanctions.\nThe CRA, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act and other fair lending laws and regulations impose\nnondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions. The U.S. Department\nof Justice and other federal agencies are responsible\nfor enforcing these laws and regulations. A successful regulatory challenge to an institution\u2019s performance under the CRA or fair lending\nlaws and regulations could result in a wide variety of sanctions, including damages\nand civil money penalties, injunctive relief, restrictions\non mergers and acquisitions activity, restrictions on expansion and restrictions\non entering new business lines. Private parties may also have\nthe ability to challenge an institution\u2019s performance under fair lending\nlaws in private class action litigation. Such actions could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations\nand future prospects. We may be subject to liability for\npotential violations of predatory lending laws, which could adversely impact\nour results of operations, financial condition and business.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock could be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile and could be subject\nto wide price fluctuations in response to various\nfactors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include, among other\nthings, actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly or\nannual results of operations; recommendations by securities analysts; operating\nperformance or fluctuations in the stock price performance of\nother companies that investors deem comparable to us; news reports relating\nto trends, concerns and other issues in the financial services\nindustry generally; conditions in the banking industry such as credit quality\nand monetary policies; domestic and international economic\nfactors unrelated to our performance; perceptions, general market conditions\nand, in particular, developments related to market conditions for\nthe financial services industry; loss of investor confidence in the market\nfor stocks; new technology used, or services offered, by competitors;\nloss of investor confidence and changes in government regulations. If any of\nthe foregoing occurs, it could cause our stock price to fall and\nmay expose us to lawsuits that, even if unsuccessful, could be costly to defend\nand be a distraction to management.\nKansas law and the provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws\nmay have an anti-takeover effect, and there are\nsubstantial regulatory limitations on changes of control of bank holding\ncompanies.\nKansas corporate law and provisions of our articles of incorporation and our bylaws\ncould make it more difficult for a third party to\nacquire us, even if doing so would be perceived to be beneficial by our stockholders.\nFurthermore, with certain limited exceptions, federal\nregulations prohibit a person or company or a group of persons deemed to be\n\u201cacting in concert\u201d from, directly or indirectly, acquiring more\nthan 10% (5% if the acquirer is a bank holding company) of any class of our voting\nstock or obtaining the ability to control in any manner the\nelection of a majority of our directors or otherwise direct the management\nor policies of our Company without prior notice or application to\nand the approval of the Federal Reserve. Accordingly, prospective investors need to be aware of and comply with\nthese requirements, if\napplicable, in connection with any purchase of shares of our common stock.\nCollectively, provisions of our articles of incorporation and\nbylaws and other statutory and regulatory provisions may delay, prevent or\ndeter a merger, acquisition, tender offer, proxy contest or other\ntransaction that might otherwise result in our stockholders receiving\na premium over the market price for their common stock. Moreover, the\ncombination of these provisions effectively inhibits certain business combinations,\nwhich, in turn, could adversely affect the market price of\nour common stock.\nFuture equity issuances could result in dilution, which could cause\nthe price of our shares of common stock to decline.\nWe are generally not restricted from issuing additional shares of stock, up\nto the 200,000,000 shares of voting common stock and\n5,000,000 shares of preferred stock authorized in our articles of incorporation.\nIn addition, we may issue additional shares of our common\nstock in the future pursuant to current or future equity compensation plans, upon\nconversions of preferred stock or debt, upon exercise of\nwarrants or in connection with future acquisitions or financings. If we choose to\nissue additional shares of our common stock, or securities\nconvertible into shares of our common stock, for any reason, the issuance would\nhave a dilutive effect on the holders of our common stock\nand could have a material negative effect on the market price of our common stock.\nWe may issue shares of preferred stock in the future, which could\nmake it difficult for another company to acquire us or\ncould otherwise adversely affect holders of our common stock.\nOur articles of incorporation authorize us to issue up to 5,000,000 shares\nof one or more series of preferred stock. Our Board of\nDirectors has the power to set the terms of any series of preferred stock that may\nbe issued, including voting rights, dividend rights,\nconversion rights, preferences over our voting common stock with respect\nto dividends or in the event of a dissolution, liquidation or winding\nup and other\nterms. If we issue preferred stock in the future that has preference over our common stock\nwith respect to payment of dividends\nor upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, the rights of the holders\nof our common stock or the market price of our common stock\ncould be adversely affected.\nOur dividend policy may change without notice, and our future ability\nto pay dividends is subject to restrictions.\nHolders of our common stock are entitled to receive only such dividends as our\nBoard of Directors may declare out of funds legally\navailable for such payments. The Federal Reserve has indicated that bank holding\ncompanies should carefully review their dividend policy in\nrelation to the organization\u2019s\noverall asset quality, current and\nprospective earnings, and capital level, composition and quality.\nFurthermore,\nthe Federal Reserve may prohibit payment of dividends that are deemed\nunsafe or unsound practice.\nAccordingly, any declaration and\npayment of dividends on our common stock will depend upon many factors,\nincluding our earnings and financial condition, liquidity and\ncapital requirements, the general economic and regulatory climate, our\nability to service any equity or debt obligations senior to our common\nstock, our capital management policies and strategic plans; our growth initiatives;\nand other factors deemed relevant by our Board of\nDirectors.\nAny such factor could adversely affect the amount of dividends, if any, paid to our\ncommon stockholders. If declared, dividends\nwill be payable to the holders of shares of our common stock on a pro rata basis in accordance\nwith their shares held. If preferred shares are\nissued, such shares may be entitled to priority over the common shares as to dividends.\nOther than the stock dividend provided to our\nstockholders pursuant to our two-for-one stock split in 2018, we have no history\nof paying dividends to holders of our common stock.\nWe are a bank holding company and our only source of cash, other\nthan further issuances of securities, is distributions from\nour wholly-owned subsidiaries.\nWe are a bank holding company with no material activities other than activities incidental\nto holding the common stock of the Bank.\nOur principal source of funds to pay distributions on our common\nstock and service any of our obligations, other than further issuances of\nsecurities, would be dividends received from our wholly-owned\nsubsidiaries. Furthermore, our wholly-owned subsidiaries are not obligated\nto pay dividends to us, and any dividends paid to us would depend on the earnings or\nfinancial condition of our wholly-owned subsidiaries\nand various business considerations. As is the case with all financial institutions, the profitability of our wholly-owned\nsubsidiaries is subject\nto the fluctuating cost and availability of money, changes in interest rates and economic\nconditions in general. In addition, various federal and\nstate statutes limit the amount of dividends that our wholly-owned subsidiaries\nmay pay to the Company without regulatory approval.\nAs an emerging growth company, or EGC, we utilize certain exemptions\nfrom disclosure requirements which could make our\nshares less attractive to investors and make it more difficult to compare\nour performance with other public companies.\nAs an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d, we may take advantage of certain exemptions from\nvarious reporting requirements including, but\nnot limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements\nof Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and\nreduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation.\nIn addition, as an emerging growth company we are not required to\ncomply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private\ncompanies are required to comply, and we have not opted out of this\nextended transition period. When a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates\nfor public or private companies, we can\nadopt\nthe new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may\nmake comparison of our\nfinancial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging\ngrowth company nor an emerging growth company which\nhas opted out of the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of\nthe potential differences in accounting standards used. If\nsome investors find our shares less attractive as a result of our reliance on\nthese exemptions, the trading prices of our shares may be lower\nthan they otherwise would be.", "PERMNO": 18895, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "CFB"}
