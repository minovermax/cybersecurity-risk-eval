{"cik": "1116132", "company": "TAPESTRY, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-08-13", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nYou should consider carefully all of the information set forth or incorporated by reference in this document and, in particular, the following risk factors associated with the business of the Company and forward-looking information in this document. Please also see \u201cSpecial Note on Forward-Looking Information\u201d at the beginning of this report. The risks described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also have an adverse effect on us. If any of the risks below actually occur, our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition could suffer.\nThe Covid-19 pandemic and resulting adverse economic conditions are and may continue to have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Covid-19 pandemic has impacted a significant majority of the regions in which we operate, disrupting operations, consumer spending and global supply chains and creating significant disruption and volatility of financial markets. The impacts of Covid-19 have and may continue to materially adversely impact our operations, cash flow and liquidity. In March 2020, the outbreak was labeled a global pandemic by the World Health Organization. National, state and local governments have responded to the Covid-19 pandemic in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, by declaring states of emergency, restricting people from gathering in groups or interacting within a certain physical distance (i.e., social distancing), requiring individuals to stay at home, and in most cases, ordering non-essential businesses to close or limit operations. The Company had temporarily closed the majority of its directly operated stores globally for some period of time to help reduce the spread of Covid-19. As of the end of the fiscal year, the vast majority of the Company\u2019s stores had been re-opened for either in-store or curb-side service. Many of the Company\u2019s wholesale partners also closed their bricks and mortar stores as required by government orders during the third and fourth fiscal quarter.\nThe global Covid-19 pandemic is continuing to evolve rapidly and the extent to which the pandemic ultimately impacts our results and our business - including unforeseen increased costs to our business - will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the ultimate duration, severity and sustained geographic spread of the virus, such as the possibility of a \"second wave\" of increased infections, and the success of actions to contain the virus or treat its impact, among others. While the full magnitude of the effects on our business is difficult to predict at this time, the Covid-19 pandemic has and is expected to continue to have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Although the ultimate severity and impact of the Covid-19 pandemic is uncertain at this time and depends on future events outside of our control, our business is expected to continue to be adversely impacted by several factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nThe potential economic effects of the pandemic, including a possible recession, increased unemployment and decreased consumer credit availability, may result in lower consumer confidence and decreased disposable income and discretionary spending levels, which may lead to reduced sales of our products. Unfavorable economic conditions, fears of becoming ill and sustained travel restrictions may also reduce consumers\u2019 willingness and ability to travel to major cities and vacation destinations in which the Company\u2019s stores are located. Furthermore, reduced discretionary spending may result in an excess of inventory throughout the industry, which could lead to increased pressure on our gross margin in the near term if the Company has to increase promotional activity above its normal levels to sell through its existing product.\n\u2022\nSocial distancing measures and general consumer behaviors due to the Covid-19 pandemic may continue to impact mall and store traffic even after stores return to normal operations, which may have a further negative impact on our business. Furthermore, declines in traffic beyond our current exceptions could result in additional impairment charges if expected future cash flows of the related asset group do not exceed the carrying value.\n\u2022\nThe Covid-19 pandemic has resulted in disruption to the financial markets and caused significant volatility and adverse impact on the value of our common stock. On March 30, 2020, we borrowed $700 million under our $900 million Revolving Credit Facility. If a significant number of our stores are required to close again or sales are lower than expected for an extended period of time, our liquidity may continue to be negatively impacted and we may need to draw additional funds from our Revolving Credit Facility or seek additional sources of financing, which may or may not be available. The Company is subject to additional requirements under the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility and its Senior Notes as described in \"We have incurred a substantial amount of indebtedness, which could restrict our ability to engage in additional transactions or incur additional indebtedness\" below.\n\u2022\nWhile we are making significant efforts to reduce our non-essential SG&A expenses, including but not limited to, through discussions with our landlords and other vendors to obtain rent and other relief, we may not be successful in these endeavors and may be subject to continued expenses and potential litigation or claims from such landlords and vendors.\n\u2022\nWe continue to sell products through our stores that have re-opened and through our e-commerce sites. The majority of our distribution centers remain open and operational through the date of this report; however, such distribution centers may be forced to close or limit operations due to governmental mandates, health and safety concerns, or illness or absence of a substantial number of distribution center employees. Our third party logistics providers may also experience delays in fulfilling our orders to our customers.\n\u2022\nWe source and manufacture our products on a global scale and may experience material temporary or long-term disruption in our supply chain, given the global reach of the Covid-19 pandemic. Travel restrictions, closures or disruptions of business and facilities or social, economic, political or labor instability in the affected areas may impact the operations of our raw material suppliers or manufacturing partners.\nThe successful execution of our Acceleration Program is key to the long-term success of our business.\nThe Company is undergoing a review of its business under the Acceleration Program. The guiding principle of this multi-year growth agenda is to better meet the needs of each of its brands' unique customers by (i) Sharpening our Focus on the Customer (ii) Leveraging Data and Leading with a Digital-First Mindset and (iii) Transforming into a Leaner and More Responsive Organization. The Company believes the successful execution of these priorities will fuel desire for the Coach, Kate Spade and Stuart Weitzman brands, driving accelerated revenue growth, higher gross margins and substantial operating leverage across Tapestry\u2019s portfolio.\nThe Acceleration Program reflects: (i) actions to streamline the Company's organization; (ii) select store closures as the Company optimizes its fleet (including store closure costs incurred as the Company exits certain regions in which it currently operates); and (iii) professional fees and compensation costs incurred as a result of the development and execution of the Company's comprehensive strategic initiatives aimed at increasing profitability.\nThe Company believes that long-term growth and increased profitability can be realized through its strategic growth efforts over time. However, there is no assurance that we will be able to implement such efforts in accordance with our plans, that such efforts will result in the intended or otherwise desirable outcomes or that such efforts, even if successfully implemented, will be effective in achieving long-term growth or increased profitability. Refer to Part II, Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" and Note 7, \"Restructuring Activities,\" for further information regarding the Acceleration Program. Further, recent or future changes in our executive leadership team may have an adverse effect on our ability to implement or to achieve favorable results under the Acceleration Program and/or result in further changes to our strategy.\nIf our execution of the initiatives under our Acceleration Program falls short, our business, financial condition and results of operation could be materially adversely affected.\nEconomic conditions could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and consumer purchases of luxury items.\nOur results can be impacted by a number of macroeconomic factors, including but not limited to consumer confidence and spending levels, tax rates, unemployment, consumer credit availability, raw materials costs, pandemics (such as the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic) and natural disasters, fuel and energy costs (including oil prices), global factory production, commercial real estate market conditions, credit market conditions and the level of customer traffic in malls and shopping centers. The Covid-19 pandemic has severely impacted and will likely continue to impact many of these factors.\nDemand for our products, and consumer spending in the premium handbag, footwear and accessories categories generally, is significantly impacted by trends in consumer confidence, general business conditions, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, the availability of consumer credit, and taxation. Consumer purchases of discretionary luxury items, such as the Company's products, tend to decline during recessionary periods or periods of sustained high unemployment, when disposable income is lower.\nUnfavorable economic conditions, as well as travel restrictions and potential changes in consumer behavior resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic, may also reduce consumers\u2019 willingness and ability to travel to major cities and vacation destinations in which our stores are located.\nWe face risks associated with operating in international markets.\nWe operate on a global basis, with approximately 42.8% of our net sales coming from operations outside of United States. While geographic diversity helps to reduce the Company\u2019s exposure to risks in any one country, we are subject to risks associated with international operations, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\npolitical or economic instability or changing macroeconomic conditions in our major markets, including the potential impact of (1) new policies that may be implemented by the U.S. or other jurisdictions, particularly with respect to tax and trade policies or (2) the United Kingdom (\"U.K.\") voting to leave the European Union (\"E.U.\"), commonly known as Brexit. On March 29, 2017, the U.K. triggered Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty formally starting a 2 year negotiation period with the E.U., which was subsequently extended to January 31, 2020. The U.K. officially terminated its membership of the E.U. on January 31, 2020 under the terms of a withdrawal agreement concluded between the U.K. and E.U. and is now a transition phase until December 31, 2020. During the transition phase, the U.K. will generally continue operating as if it were still a member of the E.U. Trade talks between the E.U. and U.K., to determine their future relationship, are still underway. If a trade deal is not reached by December 31, 2020, the U.K. can expect checks and tariffs on products going to and coming from the E.U. beginning on January 1, 2021. If a trade deal is not reached by December 31, 2020, the U.K. can expect checks and tariffs on products going to and coming from the E.U. beginning on January 1, 2021. Although the terms of the U.K.'s future relationship with the E.U. are still unknown, it is possible that there will be increased regulatory and legal complexities, including potentially divergent national laws and regulations between the U.K. and E.U. Brexit may also cause disruption and create uncertainty surrounding our business, including affecting our relationships with our existing and future customers, suppliers and employees and resulting in increased cost by way of new or elevated customs duties or financial implications from operational challenges;\n\u2022\npublic health crises, such as pandemics and epidemic diseases (including the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic);\n\u2022\nchanges to the U.S.'s participation in, withdrawal out of, renegotiation of certain international trade agreements or other major trade related issues including the non-renewal of expiring favorable tariffs granted to developing countries, tariff quotas, and retaliatory tariffs (including, but not limited to, the Trump Administration's tariffs on China and China's retaliatory tariffs on certain products from the U.S.), trade sanctions, new or onerous trade restrictions, embargoes and other stringent government controls;\n\u2022\nchanges in exchange rates for foreign currencies, which may adversely affect the retail prices of our products, result in decreased international consumer demand, or increase our supply costs in those markets, with a corresponding negative impact on our gross margin rates;\n\u2022\ncompliance with laws relating to foreign operations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and the U.K. Bribery Act, and other global anti-corruption laws, which in general concern the bribery of foreign public officials;\n\u2022\nchanges in tourist shopping patterns, particularly that of the Chinese consumer and as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic;\n\u2022\nnatural and other disasters;\n\u2022\npolitical and civil unrest, such as the recent protests in Hong Kong SAR, China and in the United States; and\n\u2022\nchanges in legal and regulatory requirements, including, but not limited to safeguard measures, anti-dumping duties, cargo restrictions to prevent terrorism, restrictions on the transfer of currency, climate change and other environmental legislation, product safety regulations or other charges or restrictions.\nOur business is subject to the risks inherent in global sourcing activities.\nAs a Company engaged in sourcing on a global scale, we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nimposition of additional duties, taxes and other charges on imports or exports;\n\u2022\nunavailability of, or significant fluctuations in the cost of, raw materials;\n\u2022\ncompliance by us and our independent manufacturers and suppliers with labor laws and other foreign governmental regulations;\n\u2022\nincreases in the cost of labor, fuel (including volatility in the price of oil), travel and transportation;\n\u2022\ncompliance with our Global Business Integrity Program;\n\u2022\ncompliance by our independent manufacturers and suppliers with our Supplier Code of Conduct and other applicable compliance policies;\n\u2022\ncompliance with U.S. laws regarding the identification and reporting on the use of \u201cconflict minerals\u201d sourced from the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the Company\u2019s products and the FCPA, U.K. Bribery Act and other global anti-corruption laws, as applicable;\n\u2022\ndisruptions or delays in shipments;\n\u2022\nloss or impairment of key manufacturing or distribution sites;\n\u2022\ninability to engage new independent manufacturers that meet the Company\u2019s cost-effective sourcing model;\n\u2022\nproduct quality issues;\n\u2022\npolitical unrest, including protests and other civil disruption;\n\u2022\npublic health crises, such as pandemic and epidemic diseases, and other unforeseen outbreaks;\n\u2022\nnatural disasters or other extreme weather events, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise;\n\u2022\nacts of war or terrorism and other external factors over which we have no control.\nWe are subject to labor laws governing relationships with employees, including minimum wage requirements, overtime, working conditions, and citizenship requirements. Compliance with these laws may lead to increased costs and operational complexity and may increase our exposure to governmental investigations or litigation.\nIn addition, we require our independent manufacturers and suppliers to operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, as well as our Supplier Code of Conduct and other compliance policies under our Global Business Integrity Program; however, we do not control these manufacturers or suppliers or their labor, environmental or other business practices. Copies of our Global Business Integrity Program documents, including our Global Operating Principles, Anti-Corruption Policy and Supplier Code of Conduct are available through our website, www.tapestry.com. The violation of labor, environmental or other laws by an independent manufacturer or supplier, or divergence of an independent manufacturer\u2019s or supplier\u2019s labor practices from those generally accepted as ethical or appropriate in the U.S., could interrupt or otherwise disrupt the shipment of our products, harm our trademarks or damage our reputation. The occurrence of any of these events could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are dependent on a limited number of distribution and sourcing centers. Our ability to meet the needs of our customers and our retail stores and e-commerce sites depends on the proper operation of these centers. If any of these centers were to shut down or otherwise become inoperable or inaccessible for any reason, including as a result of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, we could suffer a substantial loss of inventory and/or disruptions of deliveries to our retail and wholesale customers. While we have business continuity and contingency plans for our sourcing and distribution center sites, significant disruption of manufacturing or distribution for any of the above reasons could interrupt product supply, result in a substantial loss of inventory, increase our costs, disrupt deliveries to our customers and our retail stores, and, if not remedied in a timely manner, could have a material adverse impact on our business. Because our distribution centers include automated and computer controlled equipment, they are susceptible to risks including power interruptions, hardware and system failures, software viruses, and security breaches. We maintain a distribution center in Jacksonville, Florida, operated by Tapestry. To support our growth in mainland China and Europe, we established distribution centers in mainland China and the Netherlands, owned and operated by a third-party, allowing us to better manage the logistics in these regions while reducing costs. We also operate distribution centers, through third-parties, in Japan, parts of Greater China (Hong Kong SAR, Macao SAR and Taiwan), Singapore, Malaysia, the U.S., Spain, Italy, the U.K., Canada, Australia and South Korea. The warehousing of the Company's merchandise, store replenishment and processing direct-to-customer orders is handled by these centers and a prolonged disruption in any center\u2019s operation could materially adversely affect our business and operations.\nWe are subject to risks associated with leasing retail space subject to long-term and non-cancelable leases. We may be unable to renew leases at the end of their terms. If we close a leased retail space, we remain obligated under the applicable lease.\nWe do not own any of our retail store locations. We lease the majority of our stores under non-cancelable leases, which have historically had initial terms ranging from five and ten years, often with renewal options. We believe that the majority of the leases we enter into in the future will likely be non-cancelable. Generally, our leases are \u201cnet\u201d leases, which require us to pay our proportionate share of the cost of insurance, taxes, maintenance and utilities. We generally cannot cancel these leases at our option. In certain cases, as we have done in the past, we may determine that it is no longer economical to operate a retail store subject to a lease or we may seek to generally downsize, consolidate, reposition, relocate or close some of our real estate locations. In such cases, we may be required to negotiate a lease exit with the applicable landlord or remain obligated under the applicable lease for, among other things, payment of the base rent for the balance of the lease term. For example, in connection with the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and our Acceleration Program, we are in active negotiations with our landlords on certain store exits. In some instances, we may be unable to close an underperforming retail store due to continuous operation clauses in our lease agreements. In addition, as each of our leases expire, we may be unable to negotiate renewals, either on commercially acceptable terms or at all, which could cause us to close retail stores in desirable locations. Our inability to secure desirable retail space or favorable lease terms could impact our ability to grow. Likewise, our obligation to continue making lease payments in respect of leases for closed retail spaces could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, due to the volatile economic environment, it may be difficult to determine the fair market value of real estate properties when we are deciding whether to enter into leases or renew expiring leases. This may impact our ability to manage the\nprofitability of our store locations, or cause impairments of our lease right of use assets if market values decline, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nA decline in the volume of traffic to our stores could have a negative impact on our net sales.\nThe success of our retail stores located within malls and shopping centers may be impacted by (1) closures, operating restrictions and changes in consumer shopping behavior as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic; (2) the location of the store within the mall or shopping center; (3) surrounding tenants or vacancies; (4) increased competition in areas where malls or shopping centers are located; (5) the amount spent on advertising and promotion to attract consumers to the mall; and (6) a shift towards online shopping resulting in a decrease in mall traffic. Declines in consumer traffic could have a negative impact on our net sales and could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, declines in traffic could result in store impairment charges if expected future cash flows of the related asset group do not exceed the carrying value.\nThe growth of our business depends on the successful execution of our growth strategies, including our global omni-channel expansion efforts.\nOur growth depends on the continued success of existing products, as well as the successful design, introduction of new products and maintaining an appropriate rationalization of our assortment. Our ability to create new products and to sustain existing products is affected by whether we can successfully anticipate and respond to consumer preferences and fashion trends. The failure to develop and launch successful new products or to rationalize our assortment appropriately could hinder the growth of our business. Also, any delay in the development or launch of a new product could result in our company not being the first to bring product to market, which could compromise our competitive position.\nOur success and growth also depends on the continued development of our omni-channel presence for each of our brands globally, leaning into global digital opportunities for each brand, along with continued bricks and mortar expansion in select international regions, notably mainland China. Our brands may not be well-established or widely sold in some of these markets, and we may have limited experience operating directly or working with our partners there. In addition, some of these markets, either through bricks and mortar stores or digital channels, have different operational characteristics, including but not limited to employment and labor, privacy, transportation, logistics, real estate, environmental regulations and local reporting or legal requirements.\nFurthermore, consumer demand and behavior, as well as tastes and purchasing trends may differ in these countries, and as a result, sales of our product may not be successful, or the margins on those sales may not be in line with those we currently anticipate. Further, expanding in certain markets may have upfront investment costs that may not be accompanied by sufficient revenues to achieve typical or expected operational and financial performance and therefore may be dilutive to our brands in the short-term. We may also have to compete for talent in international regions as we expand our omni-channel presence.\nConsequently, if our global omni-channel expansion plans are unsuccessful, or we are unable to retain and/or attract key personnel, our business, financial condition and results of operation could be materially adversely affected.\nComputer system disruption and cyber security threats, including a privacy or data security breach, could damage our relationships with our customers, harm our reputation, expose us to litigation and adversely affect our business.\nWe depend on digital technologies for the successful operation of our business, including corporate email communications to and from employees, customers and stores, the design, manufacture and distribution of our finished goods, digital marketing efforts, collection and retention of customer data, employee information, the processing of credit card transactions, online e-commerce activities and our interaction with the public in the social media space. Since the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, the majority of our corporate employees and contractors have worked remotely for some time and many continue to do so, which has increased our dependence on digital technology during this period. The possibility of a cyber-attack on any one or all of these systems is a serious threat. The retail industry, in particular, has been the target of many recent cyber-attacks. As part of our business model, we collect, retain, and transmit confidential information over public networks. In addition to our own databases, we use third party service providers to store, process and transmit this information on our behalf. Although we contractually require these service providers to implement and use reasonable security measures, we cannot control third parties and cannot guarantee that a security breach will not occur in the future either at their location or within their systems. We also store all designs, goods specifications, projected sales and distribution plans for our finished products digitally. We have enterprise class and industry comparable security measures in place to protect both our physical facilities and digital systems from attacks. Despite these efforts, however, we may be vulnerable to targeted or random security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer malware, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors, or other similar events.\nAwareness and sensitivity to privacy breaches and cyber security threats by consumers, employees and lawmakers is at an all-time high. Any misappropriation of confidential or personal information gathered, stored or used by us, be it intentional or accidental, could have a material impact on the operation of our business, including severely damaging our reputation and our relationships with our customers, employees and investors. We may also incur significant costs implementing additional security measures to protect against new or enhanced data security or privacy threats, or to comply with current and new state, federal and international laws governing the unauthorized disclosure of confidential and personal information which are continuously being enacted and proposed such as the General Data Protection Regulation in the E.U. and the California Consumer Privacy Act in California, U.S.A., as well as increased cyber security protection costs such as organizational changes, Covid-19 employee and visitor health checks deploying additional personnel and protection technologies, training employees, engaging third party experts and consultants and lost revenues resulting from unauthorized use of proprietary information including our intellectual property. Lastly, we could face sizable fines, significant breach containment and notification costs and increased litigation as a result of cyber security breaches.\nIn addition, we have e-commerce sites in certain countries throughout the world, including the U.S., Canada, Japan, mainland China, several throughout Europe, Australia and South Korea and have plans for additional e-commerce sites in other parts of the world. Additionally, Tapestry has informational websites in various countries, as described in Item I, \"Business.\" Given the robust nature of our e-commerce presence and digital strategy, it is imperative that we and our e-commerce partners maintain uninterrupted operation of our: (i) computer hardware, (ii) software systems, (iii) customer marketing databases, and (iv) ability to email our current and potential customers. Despite our preventative efforts, our systems are vulnerable from time-to-time to damage, disruption or interruption from, among other things, physical damage, natural disasters, inadequate system capacity, system issues, security breaches, email blocking lists, computer malware or power outages. Any material disruptions in our e-commerce presence or information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face risks associated with potential changes to international trade agreements and the imposition of additional duties on importing our products.\nMost of our imported products are subject to duties, indirect taxes, quotas and non-tariff trade barriers that may limit the quantity of products that we may import into the U.S. and other countries or may impact the cost of such products. To maximize opportunities, we rely on free trade agreements and other supply chain initiatives and, as a result, we are subject to government regulations and restrictions with respect to our cross-border activity. In May 2019, the United States increased the tariff rate from 10% to 25% on $200 billion of imports of select product categories into the U.S. from China. On August 1, 2019, the Trump Administration announced that the U.S. plans to implement an additional tariff of 10% on the remaining $300 billion of products imported into the U.S. from China on September 1, 2019. However, in January 2020, the U.S. and China reached a phase one trade deal which reduced tariffs to 7.5% on some of the $300 billion of select imports without imposing any retaliatory tariffs on the rest of the products. While the trade deal remains effective, there is no guarantee that the agreement will be honored by either party, which could in turn adversely affect the profitability for these products and have an adverse effect on our business, financial conditions and results of operations as a result.\nOur business may be subject to increased costs due to excess inventories and a decline in profitability as a result of increasing pressure on margins if we misjudge the demand for our products.\nOur industry is subject to significant pricing pressure caused by many factors, including intense competition and a highly promotional environment, fragmentation in the retail industry, pressure from retailers to reduce the costs of products, and changes\nin consumer spending patterns. If we misjudge the market for our products or demand for our products are impacted by an unforeseen factor, such as the Covid-19 pandemic, we may be faced with significant excess inventories for some products and missed opportunities for other products. If that occurs, we may be forced to rely on destruction, donation, markdowns or promotional sales to dispose of excess, slow-moving inventory, which may negatively impact our gross margin, overall profitability and efficacy of our brands.\nIncreases in our costs, such as raw materials, labor or freight could negatively impact our gross margin. Labor costs at many of our manufacturers have been increasing significantly and, as the middle class in developing countries continues to grow, it is unlikely that such cost pressure will abate. Furthermore, the cost of transportation may fluctuate significantly if oil prices show volatility. We may not be able to offset such increases in raw materials, labor or transportation costs through pricing measures or other means.\nThe success of our business depends on our ability to retain the value of our brands and to respond to changing fashion and retail trends in a timely manner.\nTapestry, Inc. is a New York-based house of modern luxury lifestyle brands. Our Company and our brands are founded upon a consumer-led view of luxury that stands for inclusivity and approachability. Any misstep in product quality or design, executive leadership, customer service, marketing, unfavorable publicity or excessive product discounting could negatively affect the image of our brands with our customers. Furthermore, the product lines we have historically marketed and those that we plan to market in the future are becoming increasingly subject to rapidly changing fashion trends and consumer preferences, including the increasing shift to digital brand engagement and social media communication. If we do not anticipate and respond promptly to changing customer preferences and fashion trends in the design, production, and styling of our products, as well as create compelling marketing campaigns that appeal to our customers, our sales and results of operations may be negatively impacted. Our success also depends in part on our and our executive leadership team's ability to execute on our plans and strategies. Even if our products, marketing campaigns and retail environments do meet changing customer preferences and/or stay ahead of changing fashion trends, our brand image could become tarnished or undesirable in the minds of our customers or target markets, which could materially adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAs we outsource functions, we will become more dependent on the third parties performing these functions.\nAs part of our long-term strategy, we look for opportunities to cost effectively enhance capability of business services. While we believe we conduct appropriate due diligence before entering into agreements with these third parties, the failure of any of these third parties to provide the expected services, provide them on a timely basis or to provide them at the prices we expect could disrupt or harm our business. Any significant interruption in the operations of these service providers, over which we have no control, could also have an adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, we may be unable to provide these services or implement substitute arrangements on a timely and cost-effective basis on terms favorable to us.\nWe have incurred a substantial amount of indebtedness, which could restrict our ability to engage in additional transactions or incur additional indebtedness.\nAs of June 27, 2020, our consolidated indebtedness was approximately $2.3 billion. We also have the capacity to borrow an additional $200 million of additional indebtedness under our revolving credit facility, which may be used to finance our working capital needs, capital expenditures, permitted investments, share purchases, dividends and other general corporate purposes. This substantial level of indebtedness could have important consequences to our business including making it more difficult to satisfy our debt obligations, increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate and restricting us from pursuing certain business opportunities. In addition, the terms of our credit facility contain affirmative and negative covenants, including a leverage ratio, as well as limitations on our ability to incur debt, grant liens, engage in mergers and dispose of assets. On May 19, 2020, we entered into an amendment to our credit facility, which requires us to maintain available liquidity of $700 million through October 2, 2021, and waives compliance with our leverage ratio covenant through the date our compliance certificate is delivered for the fiscal quarter ending July 3, 2021 (the \u201cCovenant Relief Period\u201d). The amendment also provides that, if any two of Tapestry\u2019s three credit ratings are non-investment grade during the Covenant Relief Period, Tapestry\u2019s material domestic subsidiaries will guarantee the credit facility and be subject to liens on accounts receivable, inventory and intellectual property, in each case subject to customary exceptions. In addition to our standard covenants, the amendment also contains limitations on our ability to engage in share buybacks or issue cash dividends during the Covenant Relief Period, amongst other restrictions. An increased interest rate will also be applicable during the Covenant Relief Period when the Company\u2019s gross leverage ratio exceeds 4.0 to 1.0. In addition, it is possible that the interest rate payable on our 2022 and 2027 Senior Notes will be subject to adjustments from time to time if either Moody\u2019s or S&P or a substitute rating agency downgrades (or downgrades and subsequently upgrades) the credit rating assigned to the respective Senior Notes of such series. Refer to Note 13, \"Debt\", for additional information on the terms of our revolving credit facility and outstanding Senior Notes.\nThe consequences and limitations under our credit agreement and the amendment thereto and our other outstanding indebtedness could impede our ability to engage in future business opportunities or strategic acquisitions. In addition, a prolonged disruption in our business may impact our ability to satisfy the available liquidity requirement under the amendment to our credit facility and, beyond the term of the Covenant Relief Period, the leverage ratio covenant. Non-compliance with these terms would constitute an event of default under our credit facility, which may result in acceleration of payment to the lenders. In the event of an acceleration of payment to the lenders, this would result in a cross default of the Company\u2019s Senior Notes, causing the Company\u2019s outstanding borrowings to also become due and payable on demand.\nOur ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt obligations and to fund planned capital expenditures depends on our ability to generate cash from our operations. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control, including the financial impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on our business. We cannot guarantee that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from our operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to make payments of our debt, fund other liquidity needs and make planned capital expenditures. In addition, our ability to access the credit and capital markets in the future as a source of funding, and the borrowing costs associated with such financing, is dependent upon market conditions and our credit rating and outlook.\nOur success depends, in part, on attracting, developing and retaining qualified employees, including key personnel.\nThe ability to successfully execute against our goals is heavily dependent on attracting, developing and retaining qualified employees, including our senior management team. Competition in our industry to attract and retain these employees is intense and is influenced by our ability to offer competitive compensation and benefits, employee morale, our reputation, recruitment by other employers, perceived internal opportunities, non-competition and non-solicitation agreements and macro unemployment rates. Our operational efficiency initiatives as well as acquisitions and related integration activity may intensify this risk.\nWe depend on the guidance of our senior management team and other key employees who have significant experience and expertise in our industry and our operations. In recent years, we have experienced numerous changes to our senior leadership team. There can be no assurance that these individuals will remain with us or that we will be able to identify and attract suitable successors for these individuals. The loss of one or more of our key personnel or the direct or indirect consequences of results thereof, or any negative public perception with respect to these individuals or the loss of these individuals, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We do not maintain key-person or similar life insurance policies on any of senior management team or other key personnel.\nAcquisitions may not be successful in achieving intended benefits, cost savings and synergies and may disrupt current operations.\nOne component of our growth strategy historically has been acquisitions, such as our acquisition of Stuart Weitzman Holdings, LLC during fiscal 2015 and our acquisition of Kate Spade & Company during the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Although acquisitions are not currently contemplated in the Company's near term strategy, our management team has and, in the future, will consider growth strategies and expected synergies when considering any acquisition; however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable candidates or consummate these transactions on acceptable terms.\nThe integration process of any newly acquired company may be complex, costly and time-consuming. The potential difficulties of integrating the operations of an acquired business and realizing our expectations for an acquisition, including the benefits that may be realized, include, among other things:\n\u2022\nfailure of the business to perform as planned following the acquisition or achieve anticipated revenue or profitability targets;\n\u2022\ndelays, unexpected costs or difficulties in completing the integration of acquired companies or assets;\n\u2022\nhigher than expected costs, lower than expected cost savings or synergies and/or a need to allocate resources to manage unexpected operating difficulties;\n\u2022\ndifficulties assimilating the operations and personnel of acquired companies into our operations;\n\u2022\ndiversion of the attention and resources of management or other disruptions to current operations;\n\u2022\nthe impact on our or an acquired business\u2019 internal controls and compliance with the requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;\n\u2022\nunanticipated changes in applicable laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nunanticipated changes in the combined business due to potential divestitures or other requirements imposed by antitrust regulators;\n\u2022\nretaining key customers, suppliers and employees;\n\u2022\nretaining and obtaining required regulatory approvals, licenses and permits;\n\u2022\noperating risks inherent in the acquired business and our business;\n\u2022\nconsumers\u2019 failure to accept product offerings by us or our licensees;\n\u2022\nassumption of liabilities not identified in due diligence; and\n\u2022\nother unanticipated issues, expenses and liabilities.\nOur failure to successfully complete the integration of any acquired business and any adverse consequences associated with future acquisition activities, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nCompleted acquisitions may result in additional goodwill and/or an increase in other intangible assets on our balance sheet. We are required annually, or as facts and circumstances exist, to assess goodwill and other intangible assets to determine if impairment has occurred. If the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred, we are required to record a non-cash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible assets and the implied fair value of the goodwill or the fair value of other intangible assets in the period the determination is made. During fiscal 2020, the fair value of the Stuart Weitzman reporting unit and indefinite-lived brand intangible asset did not exceed the respective carrying values, resulting in goodwill impairment charges of $210.7 million and indefinite-lived brand impairment charges of $267.0 million. We cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any potential future impairment of assets. Should the value of goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired, there could be a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nSignificant competition in our industry could adversely affect our business.\nWe face intense competition in the product lines and markets in which we operate. Our competitors are European and American luxury brands, as well as private label retailers, including some of the Company's wholesale customers. There is a risk that our competitors may develop new products or product categories that are more popular with our customers. We may be unable to anticipate the timing and scale of such product introductions by competitors, which could harm our business. Our ability to compete also depends on the strength of our brand, whether we can attract and retain key talent, and our ability to protect our trademarks and design patents. A failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our growth and profitability.\nOur business is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nWe monitor our global foreign currency exposure. In order to minimize the impact on earnings related to foreign currency rate movements, we hedge our cross currency intercompany inventory transactions, as well as the Company\u2019s cross currency intercompany loan portfolio. We cannot ensure, however, that these hedges will fully offset the impact of foreign currency rate movements. Additionally, our international subsidiaries primarily use local currencies as the functional currency and translate their financial results from the local currency to U.S. dollars. If the U.S. dollar strengthens against these subsidiaries\u2019 foreign currencies, the translation of their foreign currency denominated transactions may decrease consolidated net sales and profitability. Our continued international expansion will increase our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. The majority of the Company's purchases and sales involving international parties, excluding international consumer sales, are denominated in U.S. dollars.\nAs a result of having operations outside of the U.S., we are also exposed to market risk from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Substantial changes in foreign currency exchange rates could cause our sales and profitability to be negatively impacted.\nOur stock price may periodically fluctuate based on the accuracy of our earnings guidance or other forward-looking statements regarding our financial performance, including our ability to return value to investors.\nOur business and long-range planning process is designed to maximize our long-term strength, growth, and profitability, and not to achieve an earnings target in any particular fiscal quarter. We believe that this longer-term focus is in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders. At the same time, however, we recognize that, when possible, it is helpful to provide investors with guidance as to our forecast of net sales, operating income, net interest expense, earnings per diluted share and other financial metrics or projections. We did not provide guidance in our earnings report for the third quarter of fiscal year 2020 due to uncertainty surrounding the financial impact of Covid-19 on our business. We have decided to continue to not provide guidance at this time and we do not have any responsibility to do so going forward or to update any of our forward-looking statements at such times or otherwise. In addition, any longer-term guidance that we provide is based on goals that we believe, at the time guidance is given, are reasonably attainable for growth and performance over a number of years. However, such long-range targets are more difficult to predict than our current quarter and fiscal year expectations. If, or when, we announce actual results that differ from those that have been predicted by us, outside investment analysts, or others, our stock price could be adversely affected. Investors who rely on these predictions when making investment decisions with respect to our securities do so at their own risk. We take no responsibility for any losses suffered as a result of such changes in our stock price.\nWe periodically return value to investors through payment of quarterly dividends and common stock repurchases. On March 26, 2020, we announced we were suspending our quarterly dividend payment, effective beginning the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, and stock repurchase program due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic. Investors may have an expectation that we will resume our dividend at a certain time and at certain levels and / or repurchase shares available under our common stock repurchase program. The market price of our securities could be adversely affected if our cash dividend rate or common stock repurchase activity differs\nfrom investors\u2019 expectations. Refer to \u201cIf we are unable to pay quarterly dividends at intended levels, our reputation and stock price may be harmed\u201d for additional discussion of our quarterly dividend.\nFailure to adequately protect our intellectual property and curb the sale of counterfeit merchandise could injure our brands and negatively affect sales.\nWe believe our trademarks, copyrights, patents, and other intellectual property rights are extremely important to our success and our competitive position. We devote significant resources to the registration and protection of our trademarks and to anti-counterfeiting efforts worldwide. In spite of our efforts, counterfeiting still occurs and if we are unsuccessful in challenging a third-party\u2019s rights related to trademark, copyright, or patent this could adversely affect our future sales, financial condition, and results of operations. We are aggressive in pursuing entities involved in the trafficking and sale of counterfeit merchandise through legal action or other appropriate measures. We cannot guarantee that the actions we have taken to curb counterfeiting and protect our intellectual property will be adequate to protect the brand and prevent counterfeiting in the future. Our trademark applications may fail to result in registered trademarks or provide the scope of coverage sought. Furthermore, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights are often met with defenses and counterclaims attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights. Unplanned increases in legal fees and other costs associated with defending our intellectual property rights could result in higher operating expenses. Finally, many countries\u2019 laws do not protect intellectual property rights to the same degree as U.S. laws.\nOur wholesale business could suffer as a result of consolidations, liquidations, restructurings and other ownership changes in the wholesale industry.\nOur wholesale business comprised approximately 9% of total net sales for fiscal 2020. The retail industry, including wholesale customers, has experienced financial difficulty leading to consolidations, reorganizations, restructuring, bankruptcies and ownership changes. In addition, the Covid-19 pandemic has resulted in reduced operations or the closure, temporarily or permanently, of many of our wholesale partners. This is likely to continue and could further decrease the number of, or concentrate the ownership of, wholesale stores that carry our and our licensees\u2019 products. Furthermore, a decision by the controlling owner of a group of stores or any other significant customer, whether motivated by competitive conditions, financial difficulties or otherwise, to decrease or eliminate the amount of merchandise purchased from us or our licensing partners could result in an adverse effect on the sales and profitability within this channel.\nAdditionally, certain of our wholesale customers, particularly those located in the U.S., have become highly promotional and have aggressively marked down their merchandise, which could negatively impact our brands or could affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nA delay, disruption in, failure of, or inability to upgrade our information technology systems precisely and efficiently could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations and cash flow.\nWe rely heavily on various information and other business systems to manage our operations, including management of our supply chain, point-of-sale processing in our brands\u2019 stores, our online businesses associated with each brand and various other processes. We are continually evaluating and implementing upgrades and changes to our systems.\nThe Company embarked on a multi-year ERP implementation in fiscal 2017, which was completed in fiscal 2020. Implementing new systems carries substantial risk, including failure to operate as designed, failure to properly integrate with other systems, potential loss of data or information, cost overruns, implementation delays and disruption of operations. Third-party vendors are also relied upon to design, program, maintain and service our ERP systems. Any failures of these vendors to properly deliver their services could similarly have a material effect on our business. In addition, any disruptions or malfunctions affecting our new ERP systems could lead to the inability to deliver the optimal level of merchandise to our brands' stores or customers in a timely manner and/or cause critical information upon which we rely to be delayed, defective, corrupted, inadequate or inaccessible. Furthermore, failure of the computer systems due to inadequate system capacity, computer viruses, human error, changes in programming, security breaches, system upgrades or migration of these services, as well as consumer privacy concerns and new global government regulations, individually or in accumulation, could have a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations and cash flow.\nFluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rate may result in volatility of our financial results and stock price.\nWe are subject to income taxes in many jurisdictions. We record tax expense based on our estimates of taxable income and required reserves for uncertain tax positions in multiple tax jurisdictions. At any one time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions. The results of these audits and negotiations with taxing authorities may result in a settlement which differs from our original estimate. As a result, we expect that throughout the year there could be ongoing variability in our quarterly tax rates as events occur and exposures are evaluated. In addition, our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted by changes in the mix and level of earnings. Further, proposed tax changes that may be enacted in the future could impact our current or future tax structure and effective tax rates.\nCurrent or future tax legislation may impact our tax structure and effective tax rates. On December 22, 2017, \u201cH.R.1,\u201d formerly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Legislation\u201d) was signed into law. The Tax Legislation, which became effective on January 1, 2018, significantly revised the U.S. tax code and required the Company to estimate the impact of the Tax Legislation for fiscal year 2019. On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (\u201cCARES Act\u201d) was signed into law in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. The CARES Act contains numerous income tax provisions, such as refundable payroll tax credits, deferral of the employer portion of certain payroll taxes, net operating loss carrybacks, modifications to net interest deduction limitations and technical corrections to tax depreciation methods for qualified improvement property. The Tax Legislation and the CARES Act require the Company to make significant judgments and estimates in the interpretation of the law and in the calculation of the provision for income taxes. However, additional guidance may be issued by the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d), the Department of the Treasury, or other governing body that may significantly differ from our interpretation of the law, which may result in a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, results of operations, or financial conditions.\nThe risks associated with climate change and other environmental impacts and increased focus by stakeholders on corporate responsibility issues, including those associated with climate change, could negatively affect our business and operations.\nOur business is susceptible to risks associated with climate change, including through disruption to our supply chain, potentially impacting the production and distribution of our products and availability and pricing of raw materials. Increased frequency and intensity of weather events (storms and floods) due to climate change could also lead to more frequent store closures and/or lost sales as customers prioritize basic needs. There is also increased focus from our stakeholders, including consumers, employees and investors, on corporate responsibility matters. Although we have announced our corporate responsibility strategy and 2025 Corporate Responsibility Goals, there can be no assurance that our stakeholders will agree with our strategy or that we will be successful in achieving our goals. Failure to implement our strategy or achieve our goals could damage our reputation, causing our investors or consumers to lose confidence in our Company and brands, and negatively impact our operations. Even if we are able to achieve our 2025 Corporate Responsibility Goals, our business will continue to remain subject to risks associated with climate change.\nOur operating results are subject to seasonal and quarterly fluctuations, which could adversely affect the market price of the Company's common stock.\nThe Company's results are typically affected by seasonal trends. We have historically realized, and expect to continue to realize, higher sales and operating income in the second quarter of our fiscal year. Poor sales in the Company's second fiscal quarter would have a material adverse effect on its full year operating results and result in higher inventories. In addition, fluctuations in net sales, operating income and operating cash flows of the Company in any fiscal quarter may be affected by the timing of wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales, including adverse weather conditions or other macroeconomic events, including the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.\nWe rely on our licensing partners to preserve the value of our licenses and the failure to maintain such partners could harm our business.\nOur brands currently have multi-year agreements with licensing partners for certain products. Refer to Item 1 - \u201cBusiness - Licensing\u201d for additional discussion of our key licensing arrangements. In the future, we may enter into additional licensing arrangements. The risks associated with our own products also apply to our licensed products as well as unique problems that our licensing partners may experience, including risks associated with each licensing partner\u2019s ability to obtain capital, manage its labor relations, maintain relationships with its suppliers, manage its credit and bankruptcy risks, and maintain customer relationships. While we maintain significant control over the products produced for us by our licensing partners, any of the foregoing risks, or the inability of any of our licensing partners to execute on the expected design and quality of the licensed products or otherwise exercise operational and financial control over its business, may result in loss of revenue and competitive harm to our operations in the product categories where we have entered into such licensing arrangements. Further, while we believe that we could replace our existing licensing partners if required, our inability to do so for any period of time could adversely affect our revenues and harm our business.\nWe also may decide not to renew our agreements with our licensing partners and bring certain categories in-house. We may face unexpected difficulties or costs in connection with any action to bring currently licensed categories in-house.\nWe have decided to suspend our quarterly dividend and stock repurchase program; there can be no assurance if, when and at what level our Board of Directors will authorize dividend payments or stock repurchases in the future.\nOn March 26, 2020, the Company announced that, due to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, Tapestry\u2019s quarterly dividend, beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020, along with the stock repurchase program would be suspended. While our Board of Directors intends to authorize dividends over the long-term and will re-evaluate when appropriate, there can be no assurance if, when and at what level our Board of Directors may resume making dividend payments. The Company is restricted from declaring cash dividends or repurchasing shares under the negative covenants associated with Amendment No. 1 to the Revolving Credit Facility during the Covenant Relief Period. The dividend program and the stock repurchase program each require the use of a\nportion of our cash flow. Our ability to begin to pay dividends and conduct stock repurchases in the future will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future. This ability may be subject to certain economic, financial, competitive and other factors that are beyond our control. Our Board of Directors may, at its discretion, decrease or entirely discontinue these programs at any time. Any failure to pay dividends or conduct stock repurchases, or conduct either program at expected levels, after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our reputation, investor confidence in us and negatively impact our stock price.\nProvisions in the Company's charter, bylaws and Maryland law may delay or prevent an acquisition of the Company by a third party.\nThe Company's charter, bylaws and Maryland law contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire the Company without the consent of our Board. The Company's charter permits a majority of its entire Board, without stockholder approval, to amend the charter to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares of stock or the number of shares of stock of any class or series that the Company has the authority to issue. In addition, the Company's Board may classify or reclassify any unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and may set the preferences, rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares. Although the Company's Board has no intention to do so at the present time, it could establish a class or series of preferred stock that could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for the Company's common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of the Company's stockholders.\nThe Company's bylaws can be amended by our Board or by the approval of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by our stockholders. The Company's bylaws provide that nominations of persons for election to the Company's Board and the proposal of business to be considered at an annual meeting of stockholders may be made only in the notice of the meeting, by the Company's Board or by a stockholder who is a stockholder of record as of the record date set by the Company's Board for purposes of determining stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, at the time of giving of notice by the stockholder pursuant to the Company's bylaws and at the time of the meeting, who is entitled to vote at the meeting in the election of each individual so nominated or on any such other business and has complied with the advance notice procedures of the Company's bylaws. Also, under Maryland law, business combinations, including mergers, consolidations, share exchanges, or, in circumstances specified in the statute, asset transfers or issuances or reclassifications of equity securities, between the Company and any interested stockholder, generally defined as any person who beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the Company's common stock, or any affiliate of an interested stockholder are prohibited for a five-year period, beginning on the most recent date such person became an interested stockholder. After this period, a combination of this type must be approved by two super-majority stockholder votes, unless common stockholders receive a minimum price, as defined under Maryland law, for their shares in the form of cash or other consideration in the same form as previously paid by the interested stockholder for its shares. The statute permits various exemptions from its provisions, including business combinations that are exempted by our Board prior to the time that the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder.", "PERMNO": 88661, "SIC": 3100, "TIC": "TPR"}
