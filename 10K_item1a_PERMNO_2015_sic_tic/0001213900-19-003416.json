{"cik": "1487843", "company": "Yangtze River Port & Logistics Ltd", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nMAJORITY OF OUR BUSINESS, ASSETS AND OPERATIONS ARE LOCATED IN THE PEOPLE\u2019S REPUBLIC OF CHINA.\nThe majority of our business, assets and operations are located in the People\u2019s Republic of China. The economy of the PRC differs from the economies of most developed countries in many respects. The economy of the PRC has been transitioning from a planned economy to a market-oriented economy. Although in recent years the PRC\u2019s government has implemented measures emphasizing the utilization of market forces for economic reform, the reduction of state ownership of productive assets and the establishment of sound corporate governance in business enterprises, a substantial portion of productive assets in the PRC is still owned by the PRC\u2019s government. In addition, the PRC\u2019s government continues to play a significant role in regulating industry by imposing industrial policies. The PRC\u2019s government exercises significant control over the PRC\u2019s economic growth through the allocation of resources, controlling payment of foreign currency-denominated obligations, setting monetary policy and providing preferential treatment to particular industries or companies. Some of these measures benefit the overall economy of the PRC, but may have a negative effect on us.\nACTIONS OF GOVERNMENT OR CHANGE OF POLICIES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nWe are at risk from significant and rapid change in the legal systems, regulatory controls, and practices in areas in which we operate. These affect a wide range of areas including the real estate development approval system, employment practices, transportation, cargo storage, logistics, financing and sale of the buildings; our property rights; data protection; environment, health and safety issues; macro-economic policies, central government directions and instructions, China\u2019s Five Year Plan, \u201cOne Belt One Road\u201d initiative; and accounting, taxation and stock exchange regulation. Accordingly, changes to, or violation of, these systems, controls or practices could increase costs and have material and adverse impacts on the reputation, performance and financial condition of our development and operation.\nIF WE NEED ADDITIONAL CAPITAL TO FUND OUR FUTURE OPERATIONS, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN SUFFICIENT CAPITAL AND MAY BE FORCED TO LIMIT THE SCOPE OF OUR OPERATIONS.\nIf adequate additional financing is not available on reasonable terms, we may not be able to undertake ongoing real estate construction or continue to develop and expand the services of our Logistics Center, which may as a result impact our cash flow and we would have to modify our business plans accordingly. We will not be able to fully implement our business plan unless the $1 billion funding (as described in the prospectus summary) is in place by 2021 and we do not have any definitive agreement nor letter of intent for such financing except for this offering. There is no assurance that additional financing will be available to us.\nIn connection with our growth strategies, we may experience increased capital needs and accordingly, we may not have sufficient capital to fund our future operations without additional capital investments. Our capital needs will depend on numerous factors, including (i) our profitability; (ii) the development of competitive projects undertaken by our competition; and (iii) the level of our investment in construction and development. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain capital in the future to meet our needs.\nIf we cannot obtain additional funding, we may be required to: (i) limit our operations and expansion; (ii) limit our marketing efforts; and (iii) decrease or eliminate capital expenditures. Such reductions could have a materially adverse effect on our business and our ability to compete.\nEven if we do find a source of additional capital, we may not be able to negotiate terms and conditions for receiving such additional capital that are favorable to us. Any future capital investments could dilute or otherwise materially and adversely affect the holdings or rights of our existing shareholders. In addition, new equity or convertible debt securities issued by us to obtain financing could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to the common stock offered hereof. We cannot give you any assurances that any additional financing will be available to us, or if available, will be on terms favorable to us.\nWE HAVE SUSTAINED SIGNIFICANT RECURRING OPERATING LOSSES AND EXPERIENCED NEGATIVE CASH FLOW FOR OPERATIONS SINCE INCEPTION.\nWe have sustained recurring losses and experienced negative cash flow from operations since inception. Since inception, we have focused on developing and implementing our business plan. As of December 31, 2018, we have generated cumulative losses of approximately $54,954,952 since inception, and we expect to continue to incur losses until 2020. We believe that our existing cash resources will not be sufficient to sustain operations during the next twelve months. We need to generate revenue and raise funding in order to sustain our operations and continue to implement our business plan. If we are unable to obtain additional funds when they are needed or if such funds cannot be obtained on terms acceptable to us, we would likely be unable to execute upon the business plan or pay expenses as they are incurred, which would have a material, adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The amount of future losses and when, if ever, we will achieve profitability are uncertain.\nWE BELIEVE THAT WE WILL DERIVE THE MAJORITY OF OUR REVENUE FROM SALES IN THE PRC AND ANY DOWNTURN IN THE CHINESE ECONOMY COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.\nThe majority of our revenues are expected to be generated from sales of our properties and services in the PRC and we anticipate that revenue from such sales will continue to represent the substantial portion of our total revenue in the near future. Our sales and earnings can also be affected by changes in the general economy. Our success is influenced by a number of economic factors which affect consumer income, such as employment levels, business conditions, interest rates, oil and gas prices and taxation rates. Adverse changes in these economic factors, among others, may restrict consumer spending, thereby negatively affecting our sales and profitability.\nWE ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE GOVERNMENT REGULATION THAT COULD CAUSE US TO INCUR SIGNIFICANT LIABILITIES OR RESTRICT OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES.\nRegulatory requirements could cause us to incur significant liabilities and operating expenses and could restrict our business activities. We are subject to statutes and rules regulating, among other things, certain developmental matters, building and site design, and matters concerning the protection of health and the environment. Our operating expenses may be increased by governmental regulations, such as building permit allocation ordinances and impact and other fees and taxes that may be imposed to defray the cost of providing certain governmental services and improvements. Any delay or refusal from government agencies to grant us necessary licenses, permits, and approvals could have an adverse effect on our operations or our ability to implement on business plans.\nOUR SALES WILL BE AFFECTED IF MORTGAGE FINANCING BECOMES MORE COSTLY OR OTHERWISE BECOMES LESS ATTRACTIVE.\nCertain purchasers of our properties are expected to rely on mortgages to finance their purchases. An increase in interest rates may significantly increase the cost of mortgage financing, thus affecting the affordability of our properties. The PRC\u2019s government and commercial banks may also increase the down payment requirement, impose other conditions or otherwise change the regulatory framework in a manner that would make mortgage financing unavailable or unattractive to potential property purchasers. If the availability or attractiveness of mortgage financing is reduced or limited, many of our prospective customers may not be able to purchase our properties and, as a result, our business, liquidity and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nTHE PRACTICE OF PRE-SELLING PROJECTS MAY EXPOSE US TO SUBSTANTIAL LIABILITIES.\nIt is common practice by property developers in China to pre-sell properties (while still under construction), which involves certain risks. For example, we may fail to complete a property development that may have been fully or partially pre-sold, which would leave us liable to purchasers of pre-sold units for losses suffered by them without adequate resources to pay the liability if funds have been used on the project. In addition, if a pre-sold property development is not completed on time, the purchasers of pre-sold units may be entitled to compensation for late delivery. If the delay extends beyond a certain period, the purchasers may be entitled to terminate the pre-sale agreement and pursue a claim for damages that exceeds the amount paid and our ability to recoup the resulting liability from future sales.\nWE ARE DEPENDENT ON THIRD-PARTY SUBCONTRACTORS, MANUFACTURERS, AND DISTRIBUTORS FOR ALL ARCHITECTURE, ENGINEERING AND CONSTRUCTION SERVICES, AND CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS. A DISCONTINUED SUPPLY OF SUCH SERVICES AND MATERIALS WILL ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROJECTS.\nWe are dependent on third-party subcontractors, manufacturers, and distributors for all architecture, engineering and construction services, and construction materials. A discontinued supply of such services and materials will adversely affect our construction projects and the success of the Company.\nWE MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY FLUCTUATIONS IN THE PRICE OF RAW MATERIALS AND SELLING PRICES OF OUR PROPERTIES.\nThe land and raw materials that are used in our projects have experienced significant price fluctuations in the past. There is no assurance that they will not be subject to future price fluctuations or pricing control. The land and raw materials that are used in our projects may experience price volatility caused by events such as market fluctuations or changes in governmental programs. The market price of land and raw materials may also experience significant upward adjustment, if, for instance, there is a material under-supply or over-demand in the market. These price changes may ultimately result in increases in the selling prices of our properties, and may, in turn, adversely affect our sales volume, sales, operating income, and net income.\nWE FACE INTENSE COMPETITION FROM OTHER REAL ESTATE DEVELOPERS AND/OR LOGISTICS COMPANIES.\nThe real estate and logistics industries in the PRC are both highly competitive. Many of our competitors are well capitalized and have greater financial, marketing, and other resources than we do. Some of our competitors also have larger land banks, greater economies of scale, broader name recognition, a longer track record, and more established relationships in certain markets. Competition among property developers may result in increased costs for the acquisition of land for development, increased costs for raw materials, shortages of skilled contractors, oversupply of properties, decrease in property prices in certain parts of the PRC, a slowdown in the rate at which new buildings are approved and/or reviewed by the relevant government authorities and an increase in administrative costs for hiring or retaining qualified personnel, any of which may adversely affect our business and financial condition. Furthermore, property developers that are better capitalized than we are may be more competitive in acquiring land through the auction process. If we cannot respond to changes in market conditions as promptly and effectively as our competitors or effectively compete for land acquisition through the auction systems and acquire other factors of production, our business and financial condition will be adversely affected.\nOVER-SUPPLY OF REAL ESTATE PROPERTIES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE AFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nMost of our assets consist of real estate properties within the premise of our Logistics Center. While our business will primarily revolve around the services provided by the Logistics Center, we expect to sell and/or lease properties to other businesses to generate revenue. Although we expect the value of our real estate properties to appreciate upon Yangluo Port\u2019s obtaining the approval of the \u201cFree Trade Zone\u201d status, risk of property over-supply is increasing in parts of China on a macro-level, where property investment, trading and speculation have become overly active. We are exposed to the risk that in the event of actual or perceived over-supply, property prices may fall drastically, and our revenue and profitability will be adversely affected. If we cannot sell or lease our properties at a favorable price, we may not have the necessary capital resources to fully execute our business plan and therefore our results of operations will be adversely affected.\nWE MAY NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT EXPERIENCE AS A COMPANY CONDUCTING STORAGE AND PROCESSING SERVICES, INFORMATION SERVICES AND LOGISTICS FINANCING, OR IN OTHER AREAS REQUIRED FOR THE SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR BUSINESS PLAN.\nWe may not have sufficient experience as a company in conducting storage and processing services, information services, logistics financing or other areas required for the successful implementation of our business plan. This may result in the Company experiencing difficulty in adequately operating and growing its business. If our operating or management abilities consistently perform below expectations, then our business is unlikely to thrive.\nWE ARE HEAVILY DEPENDENT UPON THE SERVICES OF EXPERIENCED PERSONNEL WHO POSSESS SKILLS THAT ARE VALUABLE IN OUR INDUSTRY, AND WE MAY HAVE TO ACTIVELY COMPETE FOR THEIR SERVICES.\nWe are heavily dependent upon our ability to attract, retain and motivate skilled personnel to serve our customers. Many of our personnel possess skills that would be valuable to all companies engaged in our industry. Consequently, we expect that we will have to actively compete for these employees. Some of our competitors may be able to pay our employees more than we are able to pay to retain them. Our ability to profitably operate is substantially dependent upon our ability to locate, hire, train and retain our personnel. There can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our current personnel, or that we will be able to attract and assimilate other personnel in the future. If we are unable to effectively obtain and maintain skilled personnel, the development and quality of our services could be materially impaired.\nDEFAULTING ON BANK LOANS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nWe plan to develop a full-service logistics center using the properties we have obtained land-use rights to. To finance the development, part of Company\u2019s properties held for development and land lots under development have been pledged as collateral for financial institution loans. As of December 31, 2018, we have an outstanding loan payable to China Construction Bank totaling $41,825,980. The loan has a maturity date of May 29, 2020. The loan is a floating rate loan whose rate (2018: 6% per annum and 2017: 6% per annum) is set at 5% above the over 5 years base borrowing rate stipulated by the People\u2019s Bank of China. The secured bank loan with China Construction Bank contains certain protective contractual provisions that limit our activities in order to protect the lender. The risk of default may increase in the event of an economic downturn or due to our failure to successfully execute our business plan. Defaulting on our bank loans could result in loss of our collateralized assets and cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWE HAVE LIMITED INSURANCE COVERAGE AGAINST DAMAGES OR LOSS WE MIGHT SUFFER.\nWe do not carry business interruption insurance and therefore any business disruption or natural disaster could result in substantial damages or losses to us. In addition, there are certain types of losses (such as losses from forces of nature) that are generally not insured because either they are uninsurable or insurance cannot be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. Should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur, our business could be materially adversely affected. If we were to suffer any losses or damages to our properties, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected.\nOUR OPERATING COMPANIES MUST COMPLY WITH ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION LAWS THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY.\nWe are required to comply with the environmental protection laws and regulations promulgated by the national and local governments of the PRC. Some of these regulations govern the level of fees payable to government entities providing environmental protection services and the prescribed standards relating to construction. Although construction technologies allow us to efficiently control the level of pollution resulting from our construction process, due to the nature of our business, wastes are unavoidably generated in the process. If we fail to comply with any of the environmental laws and regulations of the PRC, depending on the type and severity of the violation, we may be subject to, among other things, warnings from relevant authorities, imposition of fines, specific performance and/or criminal liability, forfeiture of profits made, or an order to close down our business operations and suspension of relevant permits.\nTHE OPERATING HISTORIES OF OUR OPERATING COMPANIES MAY NOT SERVE AS ADEQUATE BASES TO JUDGE OUR FUTURE PROSPECTS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nThe operating history of Wuhan Newport may not provide a meaningful basis for evaluating our business following consummation of the Second Share Exchange. We cannot guarantee that we can achieve profitability or that we will have net profit in the future. We will encounter risks and difficulties that companies at a similar stage of development frequently experience, including the potential failure to:\n\u25cf obtain sufficient working capital to support our development and construction;\n\u25cf manage our expanding operations and continue to meet customers\u2019 demands;\n\u25cf maintain adequate control of our expenses allowing us to realize anticipated income growth;\n\u25cf implement, adapt and modify our property development, sales, and business strategies as needed;\n\u25cf successfully integrate any future acquisitions; and\n\u25cf anticipate and adapt to changing conditions in the real estate industry resulting from changes in government regulations, mergers and acquisitions involving our competitors, technological developments and other significant competitive and market dynamics.\nIf we are not successful in addressing any or all of the foregoing risks, our business may be materially and adversely affected.\nWE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY EXECUTE OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nSince China is a large and diverse market, consumer trends and demands can vary significantly by region and Wuhan Newport\u2019s experience in the markets in which it currently operates may not be applicable in other parts of China. As a result, we may not be able to leverage Wuhan Newport\u2019s experience to fully execute our business strategy and plan. When we enter new markets, we may face intense competition from companies with greater experience or a more established presence in the targeted geographical areas or from other companies with similar business strategies. Therefore, we may not be able to adequately grow our sales due to intense competitive pressures and/or the substantial costs involved.\nOUR FAILURE TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE GROWTH MAY CAUSE A DISRUPTION OF OUR OPERATIONS RESULTING IN THE FAILURE TO GENERATE REVENUE AT THE LEVELS WE EXPECT.\nIn order to maximize potential growth in Wuhan Newport\u2019s current and potential markets, we believe that we must be able to sell our properties and obtain clients to use the services provided by our Logistics Center to ensure the sustainable development capability of the Company and to maintain our operations. This strategy may place a significant strain on our management and our operational, accounting, and information systems. We expect that we will need to continue to improve our financial controls, operating procedures, and management information systems. We will also need to effectively train, motivate, and manage our employees. Our failure to effectively manage our operations could prevent us from generating the revenues we expect and therefore have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations.\nWE MAY NEED ADDITIONAL EMPLOYEES TO MEET OUR OPERATIONAL NEEDS.\nOur future success also depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel. We may need to hire additional managers and employees with industry experience from time to time, and our success will be highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain skilled management personnel and other employees. There can be no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified personnel. Competition for skilled personnel in the real estate and logistics industries is significant. This competition may make it more difficult and expensive to attract, hire and retain qualified managers and employees.\nWE WILL INCUR SIGNIFICANT COSTS TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH UNITED STATES CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND ACCOUNTING REQUIREMENTS.\nWe will incur significant costs associated with our public company reporting requirements, costs associated with newly applicable corporate governance requirements, including requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and other rules implemented by the SEC. We expect all of these applicable rules and regulations to significantly increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time consuming and costly. We also expect that these applicable rules and regulations may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract or retain qualified individuals to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers. We cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs.\nWE HAVE IDENTIFIED MATERIAL WEAKNESSES IN OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WHICH HAVE RESULTED IN MATERIAL MISSTATEMENTS IN OUR PREVIOUSLY ISSUED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015.\nWe have concluded that there are material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, as we did not maintain effective controls over the selection and application of GAAP related to classification of capital transactions. Specifically, the members of our management team with the requisite level of accounting knowledge, experience and training commensurate with our financial reporting requirements did not analyze certain accounting issues at the level of detail required to ensure the proper application of GAAP in certain circumstances. These material weaknesses resulted in the restatement of our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our management concluded that the Company\u2019s previously issued financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 should no longer be relied upon. In light of the errors, management re-evaluated its assessment of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 and concluded each was ineffective as of December 31, 2015.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected and corrected on a timely basis.\nManagement identified the following material weaknesses in its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015:\n\u25cf Lack of adequate policies and procedures in internal audit function, which resulted in: (1) lack of communication between the internal audit department and the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors; (2) insufficient internal audit work to ensure that the Company\u2019s policies and procedures have been carried out as planned;\n\u25cf Lack of sufficient full-time accounting staff in our accounting department that have experience and knowledge in identifying and resolving complex accounting issues under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d); and\n\u25cf Lack of sufficient accounting personnel which would provide segregation of duties within our internal control procedures to support the accurate reporting of our financial results.\nIn addition to the above, management also identified the following material weaknesses in its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016:\n\u25cf Lack of sufficient full-time accounting staff in our accounting department that have experience and knowledge in identifying and resolving complex accounting issues under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d); The weakness resulted in the restatement of consolidated balance sheet and consolidated income statement to treat an extinguishment transaction between related entities as a capital transaction in the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, and such weakness had not been fully remediated as of December 31, 2016;\n\u25cf Lack of sufficient accounting personnel which would provide segregation of duties within our internal control procedures to support the accurate reporting of our financial results. The weakness resulted in the amendment and additions of the disclosure of real estate properties and land lots under development in the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, and such weakness had not been fully remediated as of December 31, 2016.\nAny actions we have taken or may take to address the material weaknesses we had for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016 are subject to continued management review supported by testing, as well as oversight by the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Although we believe that the steps we have taken sufficiently remediate the material weaknesses we had for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016, we cannot assure you that these material weaknesses will not occur in the future and that we will be able to remediate such weaknesses in a timely manner, which could impair our ability to accurately and timely report our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. If our remedial measures are again insufficient to address the material weaknesses, or if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting are discovered or occur in the future, our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and we could be required to further restate our financial results. In addition, if we are unable to successfully remediate the material weaknesses in our internal controls or if we are unable to produce accurate and timely financial statements, our stock price may be adversely affected and we may be unable to maintain compliance with applicable stock exchange listing requirements.\nOUR CERTIFICATES, PERMITS, AND LICENSES RELATED TO OUR OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO GOVERNMENTAL CONTROL AND RENEWAL, AND FAILURE TO OBTAIN OR RENEW SUCH CERTIFICATES, PERMITS, AND LICENSES WILL CAUSE ALL OR PART OF OUR OPERATIONS TO BE TERMINATED.\nOur operations require licenses, permits and, in some cases, renewals of these licenses and permits from various governmental authorities in the PRC. Our ability to obtain, maintain, or renew such licenses and permits on acceptable terms is subject to change, as are, among other things, the regulations and policies of applicable governmental authorities.\nIf our land use permits are revoked or suspended or we are unable to renew the permits for any reason, we cannot assure you that our business operations will not be stopped and, accordingly, our financial performance would be adversely affected.\nIF THE LEGALITY OR VALIDITY OF OUR LEASE OF THE COLLECTIVE-OWNED LAND USE RIGHTS IS CHALLENGED, THERE MAY BE DISRUPTION TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE LAND AND SUCH DISRUPTION COULD HAVE A MATERIALLY ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nWe leased collective-owned land use rights from the Chunfeng Villagers\u2019 Committees. The right to operate and manage such land is vested in the relevant local villagers\u2019 committee or rural collective leadership who are allowed to divide the land into parcels and contracts the rights to operate such parcels of land to individual farmer households or, subject to the approval of local governments and the requisite vote of the farmer households, to any entity or person outside that village or rural collective.\nAny change in law and the administrative system could render our lease unenforceable. According to the PRC Law on Land Administration, all lands in the PRC are either state-owned or collectively owned. Generally, lands in the urban areas of a city or town are state-owned, whereas lands in the rural areas of a city or town and all rural lands are, unless otherwise specified by law, collectively owned. When required, the state has the right to reclaim the collectively owned lands in accordance with law if such reclaim is beneficial to the public.\nAdditionally, the lease may subject to the preemptive rights of other farmers in the same village or rural collective. If the preemptive rights are not exercised within two months from the date on which we start using the parcels of land, it is very likely that the PRC courts will not enforce such preemptive rights.\nIf the legality or validity of our leases become subject to disputes or challenges, we may need to suspend at least part of our constructions on the respective land areas. We may incur costs and losses if we are required to remove our improvements, such as buildings and facilities that we have constructed or purchased. We could also lose our rights to use the land and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nOUR FACILITIES MAY BE AFFECTED BY FIRE OR NATURAL CALAMITIES. OUR OPERATIONS ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO THE RISK OF POWER OUTAGES, EQUIPMENT FAILURES OR LABOR DISTURBANCES AND OTHER BUSINESS INTERRUPTIONS. WE HAVE LIMITED INSURANCE COVERAGE AND DO NOT CARRY ANY BUSINESS INTERRUPTION INSURANCE.\nA fire, floods or other natural calamity may result in significant damage to our facilities. Our operations are subject to risks of various business interruptions, including power outages, equipment failures or disturbances from labor unrest. If we are unable to obtain timely replacements of damaged equipment, or if we are unable to find an acceptable general contractor to repair our facilities damaged by a catastrophic event, then major disruptions to our operations would result, which would have significant adverse effect on our operations and financial results. Our property insurance may not be sufficient to cover damages to our facilities, and we do not carry any business interruption insurance covering lost profits as a result of the disruption to our operations.\nRisks Relating to Doing Business in China\nTHE PROPOSED TARIFFS BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT AND THE POTENTIAL OF A TRADE WAR BETWEEN THE U.S. AND CHINA, AND ON A LARGER SCALE, INTERNATIONALLY, MAY DAMPEN GLOBAL GROWTH. IF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, IN THE FUTURE, SUBJECTS THE SERVICES THAT WE PROVIDE TO PROPOSED TARIFFS, OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND REVENUES MAY BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED.\nThe U.S. government has recently proposed, among other actions, imposing new or higher tariffs on specified products imported from China to penalize China for what it characterizes as unfair trade practices and China has responded by proposing new or higher tariffs on specified products imported from the United States. On April 3, 2018, the Office of the United States Trade Representative published a notice of determination and request for public comment under Section 301 under the Trade Act of 1974 (the \"Notice\") concerning the proposed imposition of an additional 25% tariff on specified products from China, which products comprise approximately US$50 billion in annual trade value for calendar year 2018. In response, China has proposed tariffs on a number of U.S. goods, on a much smaller scale, in the current time. Based on our analysis of the list of products set forth in the Notice, we expect that the proposed tariffs will not have a material direct impact on our business operations, as we are based in the PRC, and deliver services to customers exclusively located within the PRC market. However, the proposed tariffs may cause the depreciation of the RMB currency and a contraction of certain PRC industries that will likely be affected by the proposed tariffs. As such, we may have access to fewer business opportunities and our operation may be negatively impacted. In addition, future actions or escalations by either the United States or China that affect trade relations may cause global economic turmoil and potentially have a negative impact on our business and we cannot provide any assurances as to whether such actions will occur or the form that they may take.\nIF OUR LAND USE RIGHTS ARE REVOKED, WE WOULD HAVE NO OPERATIONAL CAPABILITIES.\nUnder the PRC law, land is owned by the state or rural collective economic organizations. The state issues to tenants the rights to use property. Use rights can be revoked and the tenants may be forced to vacate at any time when redevelopment of the land is in the public interest. The public interest rationale is interpreted quite broadly and the process of land appropriation may be less than transparent. If this happens, we may be forced to (i) delay the construction of commercial facilities or (ii) curtail or cease construction on that land. We relied on these land use rights as the cornerstone of our operations, and the loss of such rights would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operation.\nIN THE EVENT THE ACQUISITION OF WUHAN NEWPORT BY RICOFELIZ REQUIRES MOFCOM\u2019S APPROVAL AND WE ARE NOT ABLE TO OBTAIN SUCH APPROVAL, THE ACQUISITION MAY BE UNWOUND.\nOn August 8, 2006, the PRC Ministry of Commerce (\u201cMOFCOM\u201d), the State Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, the State Administration for Taxation, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, the China Securities Regulatory Commission and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange jointly promulgated the Provisions on the Acquisition of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors (the \u201cM&A Rules\u201d), as amended by the Ministry of Commerce of the PRC on June 22, 2009. The M&A Rules require that a merger and acquisition of a domestic company with a \u201crelated party relationship\u201d by a domestic company, enterprise or natural person in the name of an overseas company legitimately incorporated or controlled by the domestic company, enterprise or natural person shall be subject to examination and approval by MOFCOM. However, there is no definition or explanation of what constitutes a \u201crelated party relationship\u201d in the M&A Rules, and, as a result, we are uncertain as to the interpretation of the M&A Rules with regard to the existing relationship between Mr. Xiangyao Liu, Ricofeliz and Wuhan Newport at the moment immediately before the acquisition of Wuhan Newport by Ricofeliz. If such relationship is considered as a \u201crelated party relationship\u201d, the acquisition of Wuhan Newport by Ricofeliz, which has been approved by the local Wuhan Bureau of MOFCOM, may be subject to the approval of the national MOFCOM. Although M&A Rules have been effective since September 2006, we are not aware of any precedent for approval by MOFCOM of any related party acquisition conducted by PRC domestic individuals. Since there is no clear guidance under the M&A Rules, it is difficult to determine whether MOFCOM or other PRC regulatory agencies would consider such approval necessary and, if so, whether we would be able to obtain MOFCOM approval, or if we fail to obtain such approval, what would be the consequence of such failure. Failure to obtain MOFCOM\u2019s approval may result in regulatory actions or other sanctions (including administrative order to unwind the acquisition) from MOFCOM or other PRC regulatory agencies. These regulatory agencies may impose fines and penalties on our operations in the PRC, limit our operating privileges in the PRC, delay or restrict the repatriation of the proceeds from our financing, investment, or operating activities into the PRC, or take other actions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, reputation and prospects.\nLABOR LAWS IN THE PRC MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nOn June 29, 2007, the PRC\u2019s government promulgated the Labor Contract Law of the PRC, which became effective on January 1, 2008. The Labor Contract Law imposes greater liabilities on employers and significantly affects the cost of an employer\u2019s decision to reduce its workforce. Further, the law requires certain terminations be based upon seniority and not merit. In the event that we decide to significantly change or decrease our workforce, the Labor Contract Law could adversely affect our ability to enact such changes in a manner that is most advantageous to our business or in a timely and cost-effective manner, thus materially and adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operations.\nWE MAY BE EXPOSED TO LIABILITIES UNDER THE FOREIGN CORRUPT PRACTICES ACT AND CHINESE ANTI-CORRUPTION LAW.\nWe are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d), and other laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials and political parties by U.S. persons and issuers as defined by the statute for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We are also subject to Chinese anti-corruption laws, which strictly prohibit the payment of bribes to government officials. We have operations, agreements with third parties, and make sales in China, which may experience corruption. Our activities in China create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of the employees or consultants of our Company, because these parties are not always subject to our control. Our existing safeguards and any future improvements of anticorruption actions may prove to be less than effective, and the employees, consultants and/or distributors of our Company may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible. Violations of the FCPA or Chinese anti-corruption laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, and we may be subject to other liabilities, which could negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, the government may seek to hold our Company liable for successor liability FCPA violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire.\nUNCERTAINTIES WITH RESPECT TO THE PRC\u2019S LEGAL SYSTEM COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT US.\nWe conduct a substantial amount of our business through our subsidiary in China. Our operations in China are governed by PRC laws and regulations. Our PRC subsidiary is generally subject to laws and regulations applicable to foreign investments in China and, in particular, laws and regulations applicable to wholly foreign-owned enterprises. The PRC legal system is based on statutes. Prior court decisions may be cited for reference but have limited precedential value.\nSince 1979, PRC legislation and regulations have significantly enhanced the protections afforded to various forms of foreign investments in China. However, China has not developed a fully integrated legal system and recently enacted laws and regulations may not sufficiently cover all aspects of economic activities in China. In particular, because some of these laws and regulations are relatively new, and because of the limited volume of published decisions and their nonbinding nature, the interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations involve uncertainties. In addition, the PRC legal system is based in part on government policies and internal rules (some of which are not published on a timely basis or at all) that may have a retroactive effect. As a result, we may not be aware of our violation of these policies and rules until sometime after the violation. In addition, any litigation in China may be protracted and result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention.\nGOVERNMENTAL CONTROL OF CURRENCY CONVERSION MAY AFFECT THE VALUE OF YOUR INVESTMENT.\nThe PRC government imposes controls on the convertibility of the Renminbi, or \u201cRMB\u201d into foreign currencies and, in certain cases, the remittance of currency out of China. We receive some revenue and incur some expenses in U.S. dollars but incur other expenses primarily in RMB. Although our main business is based in mainland China or based in Hong Kong with Chinese operating subsidiaries, some of our business may require us to use U.S. dollars. We choose quotations based on price competitiveness.\nUnder our current corporate structure, our income is primarily derived from dividend payments from our PRC subsidiary. Shortages in the availability of foreign currency may restrict the ability of our PRC subsidiary to remit sufficient foreign currency to pay dividends or other payments to us, or otherwise satisfy their foreign currency denominated obligations. Under existing PRC foreign exchange regulations, payments of current account items, including profit distributions, interest payments and expenditures from trade-related transactions can be made in foreign currencies without prior approval from SAFE by complying with certain procedural requirements. However, approval from appropriate government authorities is required where RMB is to be converted into foreign currency and remitted out of China to pay capital expenses such as the repayment of loans denominated in foreign currencies. The PRC government may also, at its discretion, restrict access in the future to foreign currencies for current account transactions. If the foreign exchange control system prevents us from obtaining sufficient foreign currency to satisfy our currency demands, we may not be able to pay dividends in foreign currencies to our security-holders.\nWE ARE A HOLDING COMPANY AND WE RELY ON FUNDING FOR DIVIDEND PAYMENTS FROM OUR SUBSIDIARIES, WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS UNDER PRC LAWS.\nWe are a holding company incorporated in Nevada and we operate our core businesses through our subsidiary in the PRC. Therefore, the availability of funds for us to pay dividends to our shareholders and to service our indebtedness depends upon dividends received from such PRC subsidiary. If our subsidiary incurs debt or losses, its ability to pay dividends or other distributions to us may be impaired. As a result, our ability to pay dividends and to repay our indebtedness will be restricted. PRC laws require that dividends be paid only out of the after-tax profit of our PRC subsidiary calculated according to PRC accounting principles, which differ in many aspects from generally accepted accounting principles in other jurisdictions. PRC laws also require enterprises established in the PRC to set aside part of their after-tax profits as statutory reserves. These statutory reserves are not available for distribution as cash dividends. In addition, restrictive covenants in bank credit facilities or other agreements that we or our subsidiary may enter into in the future may also restrict the ability of our subsidiary to pay dividends to us. These restrictions on the availability of our funding may impact our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders and to service our indebtedness.\nOUR BUSINESS MAY BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF OUR PRC SUBSIDIARY DECLARES BANKRUPTCY OR BECOMES SUBJECT TO A DISSOLUTION OR LIQUIDATION PROCEEDING.\nThe Enterprise Bankruptcy Law of the PRC, or the Bankruptcy Law, came into effect on June 1, 2007. The Bankruptcy Law provides that an enterprise will be liquidated if the enterprise fails to settle its debts as and when they fall due and if the enterprise\u2019s assets are, or are demonstrably, insufficient to clear such debts.\nOur PRC subsidiary holds certain assets that are important to our business operations. If our PRC subsidiary undergoes a voluntary or involuntary liquidation proceeding, unrelated third-party creditors may claim rights to some or all of these assets, thereby hindering our ability to operate our business, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAccording to the SAFE\u2019s Notice of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange on Further Improving and Adjusting Foreign Exchange Administration Policies for Direct Investment, effective on December 17, 2012, and the Provisions for Administration of Foreign Exchange Relating to Inbound Direct Investment by Foreign Investors, effective May 13, 2013, if our PRC subsidiary undergoes a voluntary or involuntary liquidation proceeding, prior approval from the SAFE for remittance of foreign exchange to our shareholders abroad is no longer required, but we still need to conduct a registration process with the SAFE local branch. It is not clear whether \u201cregistration\u201d is a mere formality or involves the kind of substantive review process undertaken by SAFE and its relevant branches in the past.\nFLUCTUATIONS IN EXCHANGE RATES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND THE VALUE OF OUR SECURITIES.\nChanges in the value of the RMB against the U.S. dollar, Euro and other foreign currencies are affected by, among other things, changes in China\u2019s political and economic conditions. Any significant revaluation of the RMB may have a material adverse effect on our revenue and financial condition, and the value of, and any dividends payable on our shares in U.S. dollar terms. For example, to the extent that we need to convert U.S. dollars we receive from any capital raises into RMB for our operations, appreciation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar would have an adverse effect on the RMB amount we would receive from the conversion. Conversely, if we decide to convert our RMB into U.S. dollars for the purpose of paying dividends on our common stock or for other business purposes, appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the RMB would have a negative effect on the U.S. dollar amount available to us.\nSince July 2005, the RMB is no longer pegged to the U.S. dollar. Although the People\u2019s Bank of China regularly intervenes in the foreign exchange market to prevent significant short-term fluctuations in the exchange rate, the RMB may appreciate or depreciate significantly in value against the U.S. dollar in the medium to long term. Moreover, it is possible that in the future, PRC authorities may lift restrictions on fluctuations in the RMB exchange rate and lessen intervention in the foreign exchange market.\nVery limited hedging transactions are available in China to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations. To date, we have not entered into any hedging transactions. While we may enter into hedging transactions in the future, the availability and effectiveness of these transactions may be limited, and we may not be able to successfully hedge our exposure at all. In addition, our foreign currency exchange losses may be magnified by PRC exchange control regulations that restrict our ability to convert RMB into foreign currencies.\nIF WE BECOME DIRECTLY SUBJECT TO THE RECENT SCRUTINY, CRITICISM AND NEGATIVE PUBLICITY INVOLVING U.S.-LISTED CHINESE COMPANIES, WE MAY HAVE TO EXPEND SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO INVESTIGATE AND RESOLVE THE MATTER WHICH COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONSAND OUR REPUTATION AND COULD RESULT IN A LOSS OF YOUR INVESTMENT IN OUR SHARES, ESPECIALLY IF SUCH MATTER CANNOT BE ADDRESSED AND RESOLVED FAVORABLY.\nRecently, U.S. public companies that have substantially all of their operations in the PRC, have been the subject of intense scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity by investors, financial commentators and regulatory agencies, such as the SEC. Much of the scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity has centered around financial and accounting irregularities, a lack of effective internal controls over financial accounting, inadequate corporate governance policies or a lack of adherence thereto and, in some cases, allegations of fraud. As a result of the scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity, the publicly traded stock of many U.S. listed Chinese companies has sharply decreased in value and, in some cases, has become virtually worthless. Many of these companies are now subject to shareholder lawsuits and SEC enforcement actions and are conducting internal and external investigations into the allegations. It is not clear what effect this sector-wide scrutiny, criticism and negative publicity will have on our Company and our business. If we become the subject of any unfavorable allegations, whether such allegations are proven to be true or untrue, we will have to expend significant resources to investigate such allegations and/or defend the Company. This situation may be a major distraction to our management. If such allegations are not proven to be groundless, our Company and business operations will be severely hampered and your investment in our shares could be rendered worthless.\nCERTAIN POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS RELATING TO THE PRC COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR COMPANY.\nWhile the PRC\u2019s government has pursued economic reforms since its adoption of the open-door policy in 1978, a large portion of the PRC\u2019s economy is still operating under five-year plans and annual state plans. Through these plans and other economic measures, such as control on foreign exchange, taxation and restrictions on foreign participation in the domestic market of various industries, the PRC\u2019s government exerts considerable direct and indirect influence on the economy. Many of the economic reforms carried out by the PRC\u2019s government are unprecedented or experimental, and are expected to be refined and improved. Other political, economic and social factors can also lead to further readjustment of such reforms. This refining and readjustment process may not necessarily have a positive effect on our operations or future business development. Our operating results may be adversely affected by changes in the PRC\u2019s economic and social conditions as well as by changes in the policies of the PRC government, such as changes in laws and regulations (or the official interpretation thereof), measures which may be introduced to control inflation, changes in the interest rate or method of taxation, and the imposition of restrictions on currency conversion in addition to those described below.\nSINCE MOST OF OUR ASSETS ARE LOCATED IN PRC, ANY DIVIDENDS OF PROCEEDS FROM LIQUIDATION WILL BE SUBJECT TO THE APPROVAL OF THE RELEVANT CHINESE GOVERNMENT AGENCIES.\nOur operating assets are located inside the PRC. Under the laws governing Foreign Invested Enterprise (\u201cFIE\u201d) in the PRC, dividend distribution and liquidation are allowed but subject to special procedures under the relevant laws and rules. Any dividends of proceeds from liquidation will be paid through Wuhan Newport, our PRC subsidiary, which is subject to the decision of the Board of Directors and subject to foreign exchange rules governing such repatriation. Any liquidation of a FIE is subject to the relevant commerce authority\u2019s approval, registration in relevant Administration for Industry and Commerce and supervision as well as the foreign exchange control. Though the dividends of proceeds from liquidation can be remitted out of China to the investor after they have been approved by the commerce authority and SAFE, we cannot assure that we can always obtain such approvals. This may generate additional risk for our investors in case of dividend payment and liquidation.\nIT MAY BE DIFFICULT TO EFFECT SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF LEGAL JUDGMENTS UPON OUR COMPANY AND OUR OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS BECAUSE THEY RESIDE OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES.\nAs our operations are based in the PRC and a majority of our directors and officers reside in the PRC, service of process on the Company and such foreign directors and officers may be difficult to effect within the United States. Also, our main assets are located in the PRC and any judgment obtained in the United States against us may not be enforceable outside the United States.\nTHE CHINESE GOVERNMENT EXERTS SUBSTANTIAL INFLUENCE OVER THE MANNER IN WHICH WE MUST CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES.\nWe are dependent on our relationship with the local government in the provinces in which we operate our business. The Chinese government has exercised and continues to exercise substantial control over virtually every sector of the Chinese economy through regulation and state ownership. Our ability to operate in the PRC may be harmed by changes in its laws and regulations, including those relating to taxation, environmental regulations, land use rights, property and other matters. We believe that Wuhan Newport\u2019s operations in the PRC are in material compliance with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements. However, the central or local governments of these jurisdictions may impose new, stricter regulations or interpretations of existing regulations that would require additional expenditures and efforts on our part to ensure our compliance with such regulations or interpretations. Accordingly, government actions in the future, including any decision not to continue to support recent economic reforms and to return to a more centrally planned economy or regional or local variations in the implementation of economic policies, could have a significant effect on economic conditions in China or particular regions thereof, and could require us to divest ourselves of any interest we then hold in Chinese properties.\nFuture inflation in China may inhibit our ability to conduct business in the PRC. In recent years, the Chinese economy has experienced periods of rapid expansion and high rates of inflation. Rapid economic growth can lead to growth in the money supply and rising inflation. If prices for our properties rise at a rate that is insufficient to compensate for the rise in the costs of supplies, it may have an adverse effect on profitability. These factors have led to the adoption by Chinese government, from time to time, of various corrective measures designed to restrict the availability of credit or regulate growth and contain inflation. High inflation may in the future cause the Chinese government to impose controls on credit and/or prices, or to take other action, which could inhibit economic activity in China, and thereby harm the market for our products and services.\nOUR SALES AND OPERATING REVENUE COULD DECLINE DUE TO MACRO-ECONOMIC AND OTHER FACTORS OUTSIDE OF OUR CONTROL, SUCH AS CHANGES IN CLIENT CONFIDENCE AND DECLINES IN EMPLOYMENT LEVELS.\nThe real estate and logistics markets in the PRC are susceptible to fluctuations in economic conditions. Our business substantially depends on the prevailing economic conditions in the PRC. Changes in national and regional economic conditions, as well as local economic conditions where we conduct our operations, may result in more caution on the part of market participants and consequently fewer purchases. These economic uncertainties involve, among other things, conditions of supply and demand in local markets and changes in client confidence and income, employment levels, and government regulations. These risks and uncertainties could periodically have an adverse effect on consumer demand for and the pricing of our properties, which could cause our operating revenue to decline. A reduction in our revenue could in turn negatively affect the market price of our securities.\nLIMITATIONS ON CHINESE ECONOMIC MARKET REFORMS MAY DISCOURAGE FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN CHINESE BUSINESSES.\nThe value of investments in Chinese businesses could be adversely affected by political, economic and social uncertainties in China. The economic reforms introduced in China in recent years are regarded by China\u2019s national government as a way to introduce economic market forces into China. Given the overriding desire of the national government leadership to maintain stability in China amid rapid social and economic changes in the country, the economic market reforms of recent years could be slowed, or even reversed.\nPRC REGULATIONS RELATING TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF OFFSHORE SPECIAL PURPOSE COMPANIES BY PRC RESIDENTS MAY SUBJECT OUR PRC RESIDENT SHAREHOLDERS TO PENALTIES AND LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO INJECT CAPITAL INTO OUR PRC SUBSIDIARY, LIMIT OUR PRC SUBSIDIARY\u2019S ABILITY TO DISTRIBUTE PROFITS TO US, OR OTHERWISE ADVERSELY AFFECT US.\nThe SAFE promulgated the Notice on Relevant Issues Relating to Domestic Resident\u2019s Investment and Financing and Roundtrip Investment through Special Purpose Vehicles, or Notice 37, in July 2014 that requires PRC residents or entities to register with SAFE or its local branch in connection with their establishment or control of an offshore entity established for the purpose of overseas investment or financing. In addition, such PRC residents or entities must update their SAFE registrations when the offshore special purpose vehicle undergoes material events relating to material change of capitalization or structure of the PRC resident itself (such as capital increase, capital reduction, share transfer or exchange, merger or spin off).\nFAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE INDIVIDUAL FOREIGN EXCHANGE RULES RELATING TO THE OVERSEAS DIRECT INVESTMENT OR THE ENGAGEMENT IN THE ISSUANCE OR TRADING OF SECURITIES OVERSEAS BY OUR PRC RESIDENT STOCKHOLDERS MAY SUBJECT SUCH STOCKHOLDERS TO FINES OR OTHER LIABILITIES.\nOther than Notice 37, our ability to conduct foreign exchange activities in the PRC may be subject to the interpretation and enforcement of the Implementation Rules of the Administrative Measures for Individual Foreign Exchange promulgated by SAFE in January 2007 (as amended and supplemented, the \u201cIndividual Foreign Exchange Rules\u201d). Under the Individual Foreign Exchange Rules, any PRC individual seeking to make a direct investment overseas or engage in the issuance or trading of negotiable securities or derivatives overseas must make the appropriate registrations in accordance with SAFE provisions. PRC individuals who fail to make such registrations may be subject to warnings, fines or other liabilities.\nWe may not be fully informed of the identities of all our beneficial owners who are PRC residents. For example, because the investment in or trading of our shares will happen in an overseas public or secondary market where shares are often held with brokers in brokerage accounts, it is unlikely that we will know the identity of all of our beneficial owners who are PRC residents. Furthermore, we have no control over any of our future beneficial owners and we cannot assure you that such PRC residents will be able to complete the necessary approval and registration procedures required by the Individual Foreign Exchange Rules.\nIt is uncertain how the Individual Foreign Exchange Rules will be interpreted or enforced and whether such interpretation or enforcement will affect our ability to conduct foreign exchange transactions. Because of this uncertainty, we cannot be sure whether the failure by any of our PRC resident stockholders to make the required registration will subject our PRC subsidiaries to fines or legal sanctions on their operations, delay or restriction on repatriation of proceeds of any capital raise into the PRC, restriction on remittance of dividends or other punitive actions that would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nPRC REGULATIONS RELATING TO ACQUISITIONS OF PRC COMPANIES BY FOREIGN ENTITIES MAY LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO ACQUIRE PRC COMPANIES AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR ACQUISITION STRATEGY AS WELL AS OUR BUSINESS AND PROSPECTS.\nThe PRC State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or SAFE, issued a public notice in January 2005 concerning foreign exchange regulations on mergers and acquisitions in the PRC. The public notice states that if an offshore company controlled by PRC\u2019s residents intends to acquire a PRC company, such acquisition will be subject to strict examination by the relevant foreign exchange authorities. The public notice also states that the approval of the relevant foreign exchange authorities is required for any sale or transfer by the PRC\u2019s residents of a PRC company\u2019s assets or equity interests to foreign entities, such as us, for equity interests or assets of the foreign entities.\nIn April 2005, SAFE issued another public notice further explaining the January notice. In accordance with the April notice, if an acquisition of a PRC company by an offshore company controlled by PRC residents has been confirmed by a Foreign Investment Enterprise Certificate prior to the promulgation of the January notice, the PRC residents must each submit a registration form to the local SAFE branch with respect to their respective ownership interests in the offshore company, and must also file an amendment to such registration if the offshore company experiences material events, such as changes in the share capital, share transfer, mergers and acquisitions, spin-off transactions or use of assets in China to guarantee offshore obligations.\nOn May 31, 2007, SAFE issued another official notice known as \u201cCircular 106,\u201d which requires the owners of any Chinese company to obtain SAFE\u2019s approval before establishing any offshore holding company structure to facilitate foreign financing or subsequent acquisitions in China.\nIf we decide to acquire a company organized under the laws of the PRC, we cannot assure investors that we or the owners of such company, as the case may be, will be able to obtain the necessary approvals, filings and registrations for the acquisition. This may restrict our ability to implement our acquisition strategy and adversely affect our business and prospects.\nCAPITAL OUTFLOW POLICIES IN THE PRC MAY HAMPER OUR ABILITY TO REMIT INCOME TO THE UNITED STATES AND RESTRICTIONS ON CURRENCY EXCHANGE MAY LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO UTILIZE OUR REVENUES EFFECTIVELY.\nThe PRC\u2019s government imposes controls on the convertibility of the RMB into foreign currencies and, in certain cases, the remittance of currency out of the PRC. We receive all of our revenue in RMB. Under our current corporate structure, our U.S. holding company may rely on dividend payments from our PRC subsidiary to fund any cash and financing requirements we may have. Under existing PRC foreign exchange regulations, payments of current account items, including profit distributions, interest payments and trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, can be made in foreign currencies without prior approval from the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (\u201cSAFE\u201d) by complying with certain procedural requirements. Therefore, our PRC subsidiary is able to pay dividends in foreign currencies to us without prior approval from SAFE by complying with certain procedural requirements. However, approval from or registration with appropriate government authorities is required where RMB is to be converted into a foreign currency and remitted out of China to pay capital expenses such as the repayment of loans denominated in foreign currencies. This could affect the ability of our PRC subsidiary to obtain foreign exchange through debt or equity financings, including by means of loans or capital contributions from us. In the future, the PRC government may also, at its discretion, restrict access to foreign currencies for current account transactions. If the foreign exchange control system prevents us from obtaining sufficient foreign currencies to satisfy our foreign currency demands, we may not be able to pay dividends in foreign currencies to our stockholders.\nThe majority of our revenue would be and operating expenses are denominated in RMB. The PRC government imposes controls on the convertibility of the RMB into foreign currencies and, in certain cases, the remittance of currency out of the PRC. Pursuant to the Foreign Currency Administration Rules, promulgated on January 29, 1996 and amended on January 14, 1997, and various regulations issued by SAFE and other relevant PRC government authorities, RMB is freely convertible only to the extent of current account items, such as trade-related receipts and payments, interest and dividends. Capital account items, such as direct equity investments, loans and repatriation of investments, require the prior approval from SAFE or its local branch for conversion of RMB into a foreign currency such as U.S. dollars, and remittance of the foreign currency outside the PRC. Shortages in the availability of foreign currency may restrict the ability of our PRC subsidiary to remit sufficient foreign currency to pay dividends or other payments to us, or otherwise satisfy its foreign currency-denominated obligations. Currently, our PRC subsidiary and its affiliates may purchase foreign exchange for settlement of \u201ccurrent account transactions,\u201d including payment of dividends to us and payment of licensing fees and service fees to foreign licensors and service providers, without the approval of SAFE. However, approval from the SAFE or its local branch is required where RMB is to be converted into foreign currency and remitted out of China to pay capital expenses, such as the repayment of loans denominated in foreign currencies.\nBECAUSE OUR FUNDS ARE HELD IN BANKS THAT DO NOT PROVIDE INSURANCE, THE FAILURE OF ANY BANK IN WHICH WE DEPOSIT OUR FUNDS MAY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO OPERATE.\nBanks and other financial institutions in the PRC do not provide insurance for funds held on deposit. As a result, in the event of a bank failure, we may not have access to funds on deposit. Depending upon the amount of money we maintain in a bank that fails, our inability to have access to our cash may impair our operations, and, if we are not able to access funds to pay our suppliers, employees and other creditors, we may be unable to continue to operate.\nIF WE ARE UNABLE TO OBTAIN BUSINESS INSURANCE IN THE PRC, WE MAY NOT BE PROTECTED FROM RISKS THAT ARE CUSTOMARILY COVERED BY INSURANCE IN THE UNITED STATES.\nBusiness insurance is not readily available in the PRC. To the extent that we suffer a loss of a type that would normally be covered by insurance in the United States, such as general liability insurance, we would incur significant expenses in both defending any action and in paying any claims that result from a settlement or judgment. We have not obtained fire, casualty and theft insurance, and there is no insurance coverage for our furniture or buildings in China. Any losses incurred by us will have to be borne by us without any assistance, and we may not have sufficient capital to cover material damage to, or the loss of, our facilities due to fire, severe weather, flood or other causes, and such damage or loss may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, business and prospects.\nUNDER THE NEW ENTERPRISE INCOME TAX LAW, WE MAY BE CLASSIFIED AS A \u201cRESIDENT ENTERPRISE\u201d OF CHINA. SUCH CLASSIFICATION MAY RESULT IN UNFAVORABLE TAX CONSEQUENCES TO US AND OUR NON-PRC SHAREHOLDERS.\nChina passed a New Enterprise Income Tax Law, or the New EIT Law, which became effective on January 1, 2008. Under the New EIT Law, an enterprise established outside of China with de facto management bodies within China is considered a resident enterprise, meaning that it can be treated in a manner similar to a Chinese enterprise for enterprise income tax purposes. The implementing rules of the New EIT Law define de facto management as \u201csubstantial and overall management and control over the production and operations, personnel, accounting, and properties\u201d of the enterprise. In addition, a circular issued by the State Administration of Taxation on April 22, 2009 clarified that dividends and other income paid by such resident enterprises will be considered to be the PRC\u2019s source income and subject to the PRC\u2019s withholding tax. This recent circular also subjects such resident enterprises to various reporting requirements with the PRC\u2019s tax authorities.\nAlthough substantially all of our management is currently located in the PRC, it remains unclear whether the PRC\u2019s tax authorities would require or permit our overseas registered entities to be treated as PRC resident enterprises. We do not currently consider our company to be a PRC resident enterprise. However, if the PRC\u2019s tax authorities determine that we are a resident enterprise for the PRC\u2019s enterprise income tax purposes, a number of unfavorable PRC tax consequences may follow. First, we may be subject to the enterprise income tax at a rate of 25% on our worldwide taxable income as well as the PRC\u2019s enterprise income tax reporting obligations. This would also mean that income such as interest on offering proceeds and non-China source income would be subject to the PRC\u2019s enterprise income tax at a rate of 25%. Second, although under the New EIT Law and its implementing rules, dividends paid to us from our PRC subsidiary would qualify as tax-exempt income, we cannot guarantee that such dividends will not be subject to a 10% withholding tax, as the PRC authorities responsible for enforcing the withholding tax have not yet issued guidance with respect to the processing of outbound remittances to entities that are treated as resident enterprises for the PRC\u2019s enterprise income tax purposes. Finally, dividends paid to stockholders with respect to their shares of our common stock or any gains realized from transfer of such shares may generally be subject to the PRC\u2019s withholding taxes on such dividends or gains at a rate of 10% if the shareholders are deemed to be non-resident enterprises or at a rate of 20% if the shareholders are deemed to be non-resident individuals.\nPRICE INFLATION IN CHINA COULD AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IF WE ARE UNABLE TO PASS ALONG CONSTRUCTION PRICE INCREASES TO OUR CUSTOMERS.\nInflation in China has continued to rise over the last few years. Because our builders will purchase raw materials from suppliers in China, price inflation has caused an increase in the cost of construction. Price inflation may affect the results of our operations if we are unable to pass along the price increases to our customers. Similarly, the purchase and installation of equipment or furniture may increase as a result of these recent inflationary trends, which are expected to continue for the near future. Accordingly, inflation in China may weaken our competitiveness domestically and in international markets.\nWE MAY RELY PRINCIPALLY ON DIVIDENDS AND OTHER DISTRIBUTIONS OF EQUITY PAID BY OUR PRC SUBSIDIARY TO FUND ANY CASH AND FINANCING REQUIREMENTS WE MAY HAVE, AND ANY LIMITATION ON THE ABILITY OF OUR PRC SUBSIDIARY TO PAY DIVIDENDS TO US COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS.\nWe are a holding company, and we may rely principally on dividends and other distributions of equity paid by our PRC subsidiary for our cash and financing requirements, which include the funds necessary to pay dividends and other cash distributions to our stockholders and to service any debt we may incur. In the future, if our PRC subsidiary incurs debt on its own behalf, the instruments governing the debt may restrict its ability to pay dividends or make other distributions to us.\nUnder PRC laws and regulations, our PRC subsidiary, as a foreign-invested enterprise in the PRC, may pay dividends only out of accumulated profits as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. In addition, a foreign-invested enterprise is required to set aside at least 10% of its accumulated after-tax profits each year, if any, to fund certain statutory reserve funds, until the aggregate amount of such fund reaches 50% of its registered capital. At its discretion, it may allocate a portion of its after-tax profits based on PRC accounting standards to staff welfare and bonus funds. These reserve funds and staff welfare and bonus funds are not distributable as cash dividends.\nAny limitation on the ability of our PRC subsidiary to pay dividends or make other distributions to us could materially and adversely limit our ability to grow, make investments or acquisitions that could be beneficial to our business, pay dividends, or otherwise fund and conduct our business.\nTHE PRC GOVERNMENT MAY ISSUE FURTHER RESTRICTIVE MEASURES IN THE FUTURE.\nWe cannot assure you that the PRC\u2019s government will not issue further restrictive measures in the future. The PRC government\u2019s restrictive regulations and measures could increase our operating costs in adapting to these regulations and measures, limit our access to capital resources or even restrict our business operations, which could further adversely affect our business and prospects.\nOUR PRC SUBSIDIARY HAS TAKEN THE POSITION THAT IT IS COMPLIANT WITH THE TAXATION, ENVIRONMENTAL, EMPLOYMENT AND SOCIAL SECURITY RULES OF CHINA, AND IF THAT POSITION TURNS OUT TO BE WRONG, THEY MAY FACE PENALTIES IMPOSED BY THE PRC GOVERNMENT.\nWhile we believe our PRC subsidiary has been in compliance with PRC taxation, environmental, employment and social security rules during their operations in China, we have not obtained letters from the PRC government authorities confirming such compliance. If any PRC government authority takes the position that there is non-compliance with the taxation, environmental protection, employment and/or social security rules by our PRC subsidiary, they may be exposed to penalties from PRC government authorities, in which case the operation of our PRC subsidiary in question may be adversely affected.\nIF RELATIONS BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND CHINA WORSEN, OUR STOCK PRICE MAY DECREASE AND WE MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY ACCESSING THE U.S. CAPITAL MARKETS.\nAt various times during recent years, the United States and China have had disagreements over political and economic issues. Controversies may arise in the future between these two countries. Any political or trade conflicts between the United States and China could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and our ability to access U.S. capital markets.\nINTERPRETATION OF PRC LAWS AND REGULATIONS INVOLVES UNCERTAINTY.\nOur core business is conducted within China and is governed by PRC\u2019s laws and regulations. The PRC\u2019s legal system is based on written statutes, and prior court decisions can only be used as a reference. Since 1979, the PRC\u2019s government has promulgated laws and regulations in relation to economic matters such as foreign investment, corporate organization and governance, commerce, taxation and trade, with a view to developing a comprehensive system of commercial law, including laws relating to property ownership and development. However, due to the fact that these laws and regulations have not been fully developed, and because of the limited volume of published cases and the non-binding nature of prior court decisions, interpretation of PRC\u2019s laws and regulations involves a degree of uncertainty. Some of these laws may be changed without immediate publication or may be amended with retroactive effect. Depending on the government agency or how an application or case is presented to such agency, we may receive less favorable interpretations of laws and regulations than our competitors, particularly if a competitor has long been established in the locality of, and has developed a relationship with such agency. In addition, any litigation in China may be protracted and result in substantial costs and a diversion of resources and management attention. All of these uncertainties may cause difficulties in the enforcement of our land use rights, entitlements under our permits and other statutory and contractual rights and interests.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common stock\nTHE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK MAY BE VOLATILE OR MAY DECLINE REGARDLESS OF OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE, AND YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO RESELL YOUR SHARES AT OR ABOVE THE OFFERING PRICE.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u25cf actual or anticipated fluctuations in our revenue and other operating results;\n\u25cf the financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections or our failure to meet these projections;\n\u25cf actions of securities analysts who initiate or maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;\n\u25cf announcements by us or our competitors of significant products or features, technical innovations, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, or capital commitments;\n\u25cf price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market, including as a result of trends in the economy as a whole;\n\u25cf lawsuits threatened or filed against us; and\n\u25cf other events or factors, including those resulting from war or incidents of terrorism, or responses to these events.\nIn addition, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. Stock prices of many companies have fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. In the past, stockholders have filed securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. If we were to become involved in securities litigation, it could subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, and adversely affect our business.\nSHORT SELLERS OF OUR STOCK MAY BE MANIPULATIVE AND MAY DRIVE DOWN THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK.\nShort selling is the practice of selling securities that the seller does not own but rather has borrowed or intends to borrow from a third party with the intention of buying identical securities at a later date to return to the lender. A short seller hopes to profit from a decline in the value of the securities between the sale of the borrowed securities and the purchase of the replacement shares, as the short seller expects to pay less in that purchase than it received in the sale. As it is therefore in the short seller\u2019s interest for the price of the stock to decline, some short sellers publish, or arrange for the publication of, opinions or characterizations regarding the relevant issuer, its business prospects and similar matters calculated to or which may create negative market momentum, which may permit them to obtain profits for themselves as a result of selling the stock short. Issuers whose securities have historically had limited trading volumes and/or have been susceptible to relatively high volatility levels can be particularly vulnerable to such short seller attacks. On December 6, 2018, Hindenburg Research published a report that contained various false allegations against the Company, which has resulted in substantial short selling of the Company\u2019s common stock and driven down the market price of our common stock. As of February 27, 2019, the closing price of our common stock as reported on the NASDAQ Stock Market was $0.396, representing a decrease of $11.224 compared to $11.62, the closing price of our common stock as of December 4, 2018.\nAlthough we have timely responded to these false allegations and taken actions to protect our shareholders\u2019 interest, including filing a lawsuit against Hindenburg Research and its accomplices, we cannot assure you that such similar false, misleading and defamatory article will not be published again in the future. The publication of any such commentary regarding us in the future may bring about a temporary, or possibly long term, decline in the market price of our common stock. In the past, the publication of commentary regarding us by a disclosed short seller has been associated with the selling of shares of our common stock in the market on a large scale, resulting in a precipitous decline in the market price per share of our common stock. No assurances can be made that similar declines in the market price of our common stock will not occur in the future, in connection with such commentary by short sellers or otherwise\nWE DO NOT INTEND TO PAY DIVIDENDS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.\nWe currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and we do not expect to declare or pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, you may only receive a return on your investment in our common stock if the market price of our common stock increases.\nSHARES ELIGIBLE FOR FUTURE SALE MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK, AS THE FUTURE SALE OF A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK IN THE PUBLIC MARKETPLACE COULD REDUCE THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK.\nThe market price of our shares could decline as a result of sales of substantial amounts of our shares in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur. In addition, these factors could make it more difficult for us to raise funds through future offerings of our common stock.\nJASPER LAKE HOLDINGS LIMITED, OUR MAJORITY STOCKHOLDER, MAY HAVE SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE OVER THE OUTCOME OF MATTERS SUBMITTED TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS FOR APPROVAL, WHICH MAY PREVENT US FROM ENGAGING IN CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS.\nAs of March 1, 2019, Jasper Lake Holdings Limited beneficially owns 52.88% of our outstanding common stock. Mr. Xiangyao Liu, our CEO and President, has sole voting and dispositive power of Jasper Lake Holdings Limited. As a result, this majority stockholder may exercise significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the appointment of our directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions. This ownership and control may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a future change in control, impeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination that may be in the best interest of the Company.\nIF WE FAIL TO MAINTAIN AN EFFECTIVE SYSTEM OF INTERNAL CONTROLS, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ACCURATELY REPORT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS OR PREVENT FRAUD.\nThe SEC, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, adopted rules requiring every public company to include a management report on such company\u2019s internal controls over financial reporting in its annual report, which contains management\u2019s assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting.\nOur reporting obligations as a public company place a significant strain on our management and operational and financial resources and systems. Effective internal controls, particularly those related to revenue recognition, are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to prevent fraud. As a result, our failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting may result in the loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which in turn may harm our business and negatively impact the trading price of our stock. Furthermore, we anticipate that we will continue to incur considerable costs and use significant management time and other resources in an effort to comply with Section 404 and other requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\nTHERE IS A LIMITED MARKET FOR OUR COMMON STOCK, WHICH MAY MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR HOLDERS OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO SELL THEIR STOCK.\nOn August 18, 2017, the Company our common stock started trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol \u201cYRIV\u201d. There is a limited trading market for our common stock. Accordingly, there can be no assurance as to the liquidity of any markets that may develop for our common stock, the ability of holders of our common stock to sell our common stock, or the prices at which holders may be able to sell our common stock. Further, many brokerage firms will not process transactions involving low price stocks, especially those that come within the definition of a \u201cpenny stock.\u201d If we cease to be quoted, holders of our common stock may find it more difficult to dispose of, or to obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of our common stock, and the market value of our common stock would likely decline.\nWE MAY BE SUBJECT TO THE PENNY STOCK RULES WHICH WILL MAKE SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK MORE DIFFICULT TO SELL.\nWe may be subject now and in the future to the SEC\u2019s \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules if our shares of common stock sell below $5.00 per share. Penny stocks generally are equity securities with a price of less than $5.00. The penny stock rules require broker-dealers to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document prepared by the SEC which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer must also provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson, and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer\u2019s account. The bid and offer quotations, and the broker-dealer and salesperson compensation information must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to completing the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer\u2019s confirmation.\nIn addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction, the broker dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser\u2019s written agreement to the transaction. The penny stock rules are burdensome and may reduce purchases of any offerings and reduce the trading activity for shares of our common stock. As long as our shares of common stock are subject to the penny stock rules, the holders of such shares of common stock may find it more difficult to sell their securities.\nIF A MORE ACTIVE TRADING MARKET FOR OUR COMMON STOCK DEVELOPS, THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK IS LIKELY TO BE HIGHLY VOLATILE AND SUBJECT TO WIDE FLUCTUATIONS, AND HOLDERS OF OUR COMMON STOCK MAY BE UNABLE TO SELL THEIR SHARES AT OR ABOVE THE PRICE AT WHICH THEY WERE ACQUIRED.\nThe market price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a number of factors that are beyond our control, including:\n\u25cf quarterly variations in our revenues and operating expenses;\n\u25cf developments in the financial markets and worldwide economies;\n\u25cf announcements of innovations or new products or services by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf announcements by the PRC government relating to regulations that govern our industry;\n\u25cf significant sales of our common stock or other securities in the open market;\n\u25cf variations in interest rates;\n\u25cf changes in the market valuations of other comparable companies; and\n\u25cf changes in accounting principles.\nIn addition, the market for Chinese companies that went public in the U.S. through reverse mergers, such as ours, is currently extremely volatile primarily due to recent allegations and, in some instances, findings of fraud among some of these companies. If a stockholder were to file a class action suit against us following a period of volatility in the price of our securities, we would incur substantial legal fees and our management\u2019s attention and resources would be diverted from operating our business to responding to such litigation, which may harm our business and reputation.\nTHE RIGHTS OF THE HOLDERS OF OUR COMMON STOCK MAY BE IMPAIRED BY THE POTENTIAL ISSUANCE OF PREFERRED STOCK.\nOur Board of Directors has the right to create a new series of preferred stock. As a result, the Board of Directors may, without stockholder approval, issue preferred stock with voting, dividend, conversion, liquidation or other rights that may adversely affect the voting power and equity interest of the holders of our common stock. Although we have no present intention to issue any additional shares of preferred stock or to create any new series of preferred stock, we may issue such shares in the future.", "PERMNO": 16688, "SIC": 4400, "TIC": "YRIV"}
