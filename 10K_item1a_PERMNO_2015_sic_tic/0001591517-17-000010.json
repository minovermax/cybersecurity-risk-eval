{"cik": "1591517", "company": "Time Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-02-27", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nWe believe the risks described below are the principal risks that we face. Some of the risks relate to our business; others relate principally to the securities markets and ownership of our common stock. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made in this annual report on Form 10-K. While we believe we have identified and discussed below the material risks affecting our business, there may be additional risks and uncertainties that we do not presently know or that we do not currently believe to be material that may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations in the future.\nWe face significant competition across the media landscape, including from magazine publishers, digital publishers, social media platforms, search platforms, portals and digital marketing services, among others, which we expect will continue, and as a result we may not be able to maintain or improve our operating results.\nWe compete with other magazine publishers for market share and for the time and attention of consumers of print magazine content. The proliferation of choices available to consumers for information and entertainment has\nresulted in audience fragmentation and has negatively affected overall consumer demand for print magazines and intensified competition with other magazine publishers for share of print magazine readership.\nWe also compete with digital publishers and other forms of media, including, among others, social media platforms, search platforms, portals and digital marketing services. The competition we face has intensified as a result of the growing popularity of mobile devices, such as smartphones and social-media platforms, and the shift in consumer preference from print media to digital media for the delivery and consumption of content, including video content. Social media and other platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, Google and Yahoo! are successful in gathering national, local and entertainment news and information from multiple sources and attracting a broad readership base. News aggregation websites and customized news feeds (often free to users) may reduce our traffic levels by minimizing the need for the audience to visit our websites or use our digital applications directly. Given the ever-growing and rapidly changing number of digital media options available on the Internet, we may not be able to increase our online traffic sufficiently and retain or grow a base of frequent visitors to our websites and applications on mobile devices. In addition, the ever-growing and rapidly changing number of digital media options available on the Internet may lead to technologies and alternatives that we are not able to offer.\nThese new platforms have reduced the cost of producing and distributing content on a wide scale, allowing new free or low-priced digital content providers to compete with us and other magazine publishers. The ability of our paid print and digital content to compete successfully with free and low-priced digital content, including video content, depends on several factors, including our ability to differentiate and distinguish our content from free or low-priced digital content, as well as our ability to increase the value of paid subscriptions to our customers by offering a different, deeper and richer digital experience. If we are unable to distinguish our content from that of our competitors or adapt to new distribution methods, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe derive approximately half of our Revenues from advertising. The continuing shift in consumer preference from print media to digital media, as well as growing consumer engagement with digital media and social platforms, has introduced significant new competition for advertising. The proliferation of new platforms available to advertisers, combined with continuing strong competition from print platforms, has affected both the amount of advertising we are able to sell as well as the rates advertisers are willing to pay. Our ability to compete successfully for advertising also depends on our ability to drive scale, engage digital audiences and prove the value of our advertising and the effectiveness of our print and digital platforms, including the value of advertising adjacent to high quality content, and on our ability to use our brands to continue to offer advertisers unique, multi-platform advertising programs and franchises. If we are unable to demonstrate to advertisers the continuing value of our print and digital platforms or offer advertisers unique advertising programs tied to our brands, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe are exposed to risks associated with the current challenging conditions in the magazine publishing industry.\nWe have experienced declines in our Print and other advertising revenues and Circulation revenues due to challenging conditions in the magazine publishing industry. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, our Print and other advertising revenues declined 9%, 10% and 3%, respectively, as compared to the preceding year despite our having maintained or gained market share in advertising revenues in each of 2016, 2015, and 2014, and our Circulation revenues declined 9%, 5% and 3%, respectively, as compared to the preceding year. The challenging conditions and our declining revenues may limit our ability to invest in our brands and pursue new business strategies, including acquisitions, and make it more difficult to attract and retain talented employees and management. Moreover, while we have reduced our costs significantly in recent years to address these challenges, we will need to reduce costs further and such reductions are subject to risks. See \u201c-We may experience financial and strategic difficulties and delays or unexpected costs in completing our various restructuring plans and cost-saving initiatives, including not achieving the anticipated savings and benefits of these plans and initiatives.\u201d\nOur profits may be affected by our ability to respond to recent and future changes in technology and consumer behavior.\nTechnology used in the publishing industry continues to evolve rapidly, and advances in that technology have led to alternative methods for the delivery and consumption of content, including via mobile devices such as smartphones.\nThese technological developments have driven changes in consumer behavior, especially among younger demographics. Shifts to digital platforms present several challenges to our historical business model, which is based on the production and distribution of print magazines. In order to remain successful, we must continue to attract readers and advertisers to our print products while also continuing to adapt our business model to address changing consumer demand for digital content across a wide variety of devices and platforms.\nThis adaptation poses certain risks. First, advertising models and pricing for digital platforms may not be as economically attractive to us as in print magazines, and our ability to continue to package print and digital audiences for advertisers could change in the future. Second, it is unclear whether it will be economically feasible for us to grow paid digital circulation to scale. Further, our practice of offering certain content on our websites for free may reduce demand for our paid content. In addition, the increasing adoption of ad-blocking tools could negatively impact the revenues that we generate on our digital platforms.\nThe transition from print to digital platforms may also reduce the benefit of important economies of scale we have established in our print production and distribution operations. The scale of our print operations has allowed us to support significant vertical integration in our production, consumer marketing and retail distribution operations, among others, as well as to secure attractive terms with our third-party suppliers, all of which have provided us with significant economic and competitive advantages. As the size of our print operations declines, the advantages of the economies of scale in our print operations may also decline.\nAlso, the shift to digital distribution platforms, many of which are controlled by third parties, may lead to pricing restrictions, the loss of distribution control, further loss of a direct relationship with advertisers and consumers and greater susceptibility to technological problems or failures in third-party systems as compared to our existing print distribution operations. Further, we may be required to incur significant costs as we continue to acquire new expertise and infrastructure to accommodate the shift to digital platforms, including additional consumer software and digital and mobile content development expertise, and we may not be able to economically adapt existing print production and distribution assets to support our digital operations. If we are unable to successfully manage the transition to a greater emphasis on digital platforms, continue to negotiate mutually agreeable arrangements with digital distributors or otherwise respond to changes in technology and consumer behavior, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nIn addition, the advertising industry continues to experience a shift toward digital advertising. Because rates for digital advertising are generally lower than for traditional print advertising, our digital advertising revenue may not fully replace print advertising revenue lost as a result of the shift. Growing consumer reliance on mobile devices adds additional pressure, as advertising rates are generally lower on mobile devices than on personal computers. If we are unable to effectively grow digital advertising revenues through the development of advertising products that are compelling to both marketers and consumers, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to develop or acquire technologies that adequately serve changing consumer behaviors and support our evolving business needs, our business, financial condition and prospects may be adversely affected.\nIn order to respond to changing consumer behaviors, we need to invest in new technologies and platforms to deliver content and provide products and services where consumers demand it. If we fail to develop or acquire the necessary consumer-facing technologies or if the technologies we develop or acquire are not received favorably by consumers, our business, financial condition and prospects may be adversely affected. In addition, as our business evolves and we develop new revenue streams, we must develop or invest in new technology and infrastructure that satisfy the needs of the changing business. If we fail to do so, our business, financial condition and prospects may suffer. Further, if we fail to update our current technology and infrastructure to minimize the potential for business disruption, our business, financial condition and prospects may be adversely affected.\nWe are exposed to risks associated with weak economic conditions.\nWe have been adversely affected by weak economic conditions in the past and have experienced declines in our Advertising and Circulation revenues as a result. Factors that affect economic conditions include the rate of\nunemployment, the level of consumer confidence and changes in consumer spending habits. Because magazines are generally discretionary purchases for consumers, our Circulation revenues are sensitive to general economic conditions and economic cycles. Certain economic conditions such as general economic downturns, including periods of increased inflation, unemployment levels, tax rates, interest rates, gasoline and other energy prices or declining consumer confidence, negatively impact consumer spending. Reduced consumer spending or a shift in consumer spending patterns away from discretionary items will likely result in reduced demand for our products and may also require us to incur increased selling and marketing expenses.\nWe also face risks associated with the impact of weak economic conditions on third parties with which we do business, such as advertisers, suppliers, wholesale distributors, retailers and other parties. For example, if retailers file for reorganization under bankruptcy laws or otherwise experience negative effects on their businesses due to volatile or weak economic conditions, it could reduce the number of outlets for our magazines, which in turn could reduce the attractiveness of our magazines to advertisers. In addition, any financial instability of the wholesalers that distribute our print magazines to retailers could have various negative effects on us. See \u201c-We could face increased costs and business disruption from instability in our wholesaler distribution channels.\u201d\nWe derive substantial revenues from the sale of advertising, and a decrease in overall advertising expenditures could lead to a reduction in the amount of advertising that companies are willing to purchase from us and the price at which they purchase it. Expenditures by advertisers tend to be cyclical and have become less predictable in recent years, reflecting domestic and global economic conditions. If the economic prospects of advertisers or current economic conditions worsen, such conditions could alter current or prospective advertisers\u2019 spending priorities. In particular, advertisers in certain industries that are more susceptible to weakness in domestic and global economic conditions, such as beauty, fashion and retail and food, account for a significant portion of our Advertising revenues, and weakness in these industries could have a disproportionate negative impact on our Advertising revenues. Declines in consumer spending on advertisers\u2019 products due to weak economic conditions could also indirectly negatively impact our Advertising revenues, as advertisers may not perceive as much value from advertising if consumers are purchasing fewer of their products or services. Further, since the economic crisis of 2008-2010, advertisers have been less willing to commit funds upfront to advertising initiatives than in the past. As a result, our Advertising revenues are less predictable.\nIf we are unable to successfully develop and execute our strategic growth initiatives, or if they do not adequately address the challenges or opportunities we face, our business, financial condition and prospects may be adversely affected.\nOur success is dependent in part on our ability to identify, develop and execute appropriate strategic growth initiatives that will enable us to achieve sustainable growth in the long-term. The implementation of our strategic initiatives is subject to both the risks affecting our business generally and the inherent risks associated with implementing new strategies. These strategic initiatives may not be successful in generating revenues or improving operating profit and, if they are, they may take longer than anticipated. Activities of activist shareholders, including proxy contests or other efforts to change the board of directors, could also be a distraction to management in executing its plans, and may even cause us to change our strategic initiatives. As a result and depending on evolving conditions and opportunities, we may need to adjust our strategic initiatives and such changes could be substantial, including modifying or terminating one or more of such initiatives. Termination of such initiatives may require us to write down or write off the value of our investments in them. Transition and changes in our strategic initiatives may also create uncertainty in our employees, customers and partners that could adversely affect our business and revenues. In addition, we may incur higher than expected or unanticipated costs in implementing our strategic initiatives, attempting to attract revenue opportunities or changing our strategies. There is no assurance that the implementation of any strategic growth initiative will be successful, and we may not realize anticipated benefits at levels we project or at all, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and prospects.\nChanges to U.S. or international regulation or policies affecting our business or the businesses of our advertisers could cause us to incur additional costs or liabilities, negatively impact our revenues or disrupt our business practices.\nOur business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, regulations and policies. See Item 1, \u201cBusiness-Regulatory Matters\u201d for a description of the significant laws, regulations and policies affecting our business, including,\namong others, new data privacy laws in the E.U. We could incur substantial costs to comply with new laws, regulations or policies or substantial penalties or other liabilities if we fail to comply with them. Compliance with new laws, regulations or policies could also cause us to change or limit our business practices in a manner that is adverse to our business. In addition, if there are changes in laws, regulations or policies that provide protections that we rely on in conducting our business, they could subject us to greater risk of liability and could increase compliance costs or limit our ability to operate our business.\nOur business performance is also indirectly affected by the laws, regulations and policies that govern the businesses of our advertisers. For example, the pharmaceutical industry, which accounts for a significant portion of our Advertising revenues, is subject to regulations of the Food and Drug Administration in the United States requiring pharmaceutical advertisers to communicate certain disclosures to consumers about advertised pharmaceutical products, typically through the purchase of print media advertising. We face the risk that the Food and Drug Administration could change pharmaceutical marketing regulations in a way that is detrimental to the sale of advertising.\nAdditionally, changes in laws and regulations that currently allow us to retain customer credit card information and other customer data and to engage in certain forms of consumer marketing, such as automatic renewal of subscriptions for our magazines and negative option offers via direct mail, email, online or telephone solicitation, could have a negative impact on our Circulation revenues and adversely affect our financial condition and operating performance.\nOur results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of increases in postal rates, and our business and results of operations could be negatively affected by postal service changes.\nDue in large part to the current statutory requirement that the USPS make large annual payments to the Department of the Treasury to prefund the USPS\u2019 retiree health benefits fund, the USPS continues to report large net annual losses despite revenue gains and a leveling off in the volume of mail delivered. In 2015, the USPS introduced new service standards that slowed the delivery of periodical mail and resulted in a portion of our weekly magazines being delivered a day later. We cannot predict how the USPS will address its fiscal condition in the future, but changes to delivery, reduction in staff or additional closings of processing centers may lead to changes in our internal production schedules or other changes in order to continue to meet our subscribers\u2019 expectations.\nOther measures taken to reduce or eliminate the USPS' reported losses could include above-inflation (i.e., greater-than-CPI) increases in the rates of postage for periodicals mail and other market-dominant mail products that we use. Congress has been considering comprehensive postal reform legislation, some of which would remove or modify the current restrictions on rate increases. The PRC is likely to consider similar changes in its statutorily-mandated review of the current regulatory system that began in December 2016. Postage is a significant operating expense for us, and if increases in postal rates occur and we are not able to offset the increases, the results of our operations could be harmed.\nWe could face increased costs and business disruption from instability in our wholesaler distribution channels.\nWe operate a distribution network that relies on wholesalers to distribute our magazines to newsstands and other retail outlets. A small number of wholesalers are responsible for a substantial percentage of wholesale magazine distribution in the United States and the United Kingdom. We are experiencing significant declines in magazine sales at newsstands and other retail outlets. In light of these declines and the challenging industry conditions, there may be further consolidation among the wholesalers and one or more may become insolvent or unable to pay amounts due in a timely manner. For example, in June 2014, our then second-largest wholesaler of our publications filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, requiring us to transition the distribution of our products and increase our use of other distributors. (See Item 1, \"Business-How We Generate Revenues-Circulation-Newsstand Sales.\") Distribution channel disruptions can impede our ability to distribute magazines to the retail marketplace, which could, among other things, negatively affect the ability of certain magazines to meet the rate base established with advertisers. Disruption in the wholesaler channel, an increase in wholesale distribution costs or the failure of wholesalers to pay amounts due could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA significant increase in the price of paper or significant disruptions in our supply of paper or printing services would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nPaper represents a significant component of our total costs to produce print magazines. While the price of paper is currently close to a 10-year low after adjusting for inflation, paper prices have historically been volatile and may increase as a result of various factors, including:\n\u2022\na reduction in the number of suppliers due to restructurings, bankruptcies and consolidations;\n\u2022\ndeclining paper supply due to paper mill closures; and\n\u2022\nother factors that generally adversely impact supplier profitability, including increases in operating expenses caused by rising raw material and energy costs.\nIf paper prices increase significantly or we experience significant supply channel disruptions, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nIn addition, printing is a significant component in the production of our print magazines. While occasional disruptions in the services provided by our current printers can be addressed by shifting production to other suppliers, a prolonged interruption of services by either of our printers could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In this connection, in April 2016, our sole printing supplier in the U.K. announced a liquidation bankruptcy proceeding. In order to secure U.K.-based printing resources for our titles, we extended a loan to the purchaser of the printing site where our U.K. titles were printed and entered into a new printing agreement with that purchaser to print all our U.K. titles.\nWe have substantial indebtedness and the ability to incur significant additional indebtedness, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn connection with the Spin-Off, on April 29, 2014, we issued $700 million aggregate principal amount of 5.75% senior notes (the \"Senior Notes\"). On April 24, 2014, we also entered into senior credit facilities (the \"Senior Credit Facilities\") providing for a term loan (the \"Term Loan\") in an initial principal amount of $700 million and a $500 million revolving credit facility (the \"Revolving Credit Facility\"), of which up to $100 million is available for the issuance of letters of credit. As of December 31, 2016, the only utilization under the Revolving Credit Facility was letters of credit in the face amount of approximately $3 million. As of December 31, 2016, we had total consolidated indebtedness, net of discounts, of approximately $1.24 billion.\nIn November 2015, our Board of Directors authorized principal debt repayments and/or repurchases of up to $200 million on both the Term Loan and the Senior Notes. The authorization expires on December 31, 2017, subject to extension or earlier termination by the Board of Directors. The extent to which we repurchase or repay our debt, and the timing of such transactions, will depend upon a variety of factors, including market and industry conditions, regulatory requirements and other corporate considerations, as determined by us from time to time. The authorization may be suspended or discontinued at any time without notice. Of the up to $200 million for debt repayments and/or repurchases authorized by our Board of Directors, $75 million remained unused as of February 10, 2017.\nWe may incur additional borrowings from the financial institutions under the Revolving Credit Facility, subject to the satisfaction of customary borrowing conditions. Additionally, the terms of the Senior Notes and Senior Credit Facilities permit us to incur significant additional indebtedness, subject to obtaining commitments from lenders.\nOur level of indebtedness could have important consequences. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements or to carry out other aspects of our business;\n\u2022\nincrease our cost of borrowing;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements or to carry out other aspects of our business;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to make material acquisitions or take advantage of business opportunities that may arise;\n\u2022\nexpose us to fluctuations in interest rates, to the extent our borrowings bear variable rates of interest;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry; and\n\u2022\nplace us at a potential disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on and to refinance our indebtedness will depend on and be subject to our future financial and operating performance, which in turn is affected by general economic, financial, competitive, business and other factors beyond our control, including the availability of financing in the banking and capital markets. Our business may fail to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or we may be unable to efficiently repatriate the portion of our cash flow that is derived from our foreign operations or borrow funds in an amount sufficient to enable us to make payments on our debt, to refinance our debt, to pay dividends to our stockholders at the historical rate or at all or to fund our other liquidity needs. If we were unable to make payments on or refinance our debt or obtain new financing under these circumstances, we would have to consider other options, such as asset sales, equity issuances or negotiations with our lenders to restructure the applicable debt. The terms of our debt agreements and market or business conditions may limit our ability to take some or all of these actions. In addition, if we incur additional debt, the related risks described above could be exacerbated.\nThe terms of the credit agreement that governs the Senior Credit Facilities and the indenture that governs the Senior Notes restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to incur debt that we may need to fund initiatives in response to changes in our business, the industries in which we operate, the economy and governmental regulations.\nThe credit agreement that governs the Senior Credit Facilities and the indenture that governs the Senior Notes contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries and limit our ability to engage in actions that may be in our long-term best interests, including restrictions on our and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to:\n\u2022\nincur or guarantee additional indebtedness or sell disqualified or preferred stock;\n\u2022\npay dividends on, make distributions in respect of, repurchase or redeem, capital stock;\n\u2022\nmake investments or acquisitions;\n\u2022\nsell, transfer or otherwise dispose of assets out of the ordinary course of business, including restrictions on the use of proceeds of such sales;\n\u2022\ncreate liens;\n\u2022\nenter into sale/leaseback transactions;\n\u2022\nenter into agreements restricting the ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany transfers;\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our or our subsidiaries\u2019 assets;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nprepay, repurchase or redeem certain kinds of indebtedness;\n\u2022\nissue or sell stock of our subsidiaries; and\n\u2022\nsignificantly change the nature of our business.\nIn addition, the credit agreement that governs the Revolving Credit Facility has a financial covenant that requires us to maintain a consolidated secured net leverage ratio (as defined in the credit agreement that governs the Senior Credit Facilities) of 2.75x to 1.00x or less. Our ability to meet this financial covenant may be affected by events beyond our control.\nAs a result of all of these restrictions, we may be:\n\u2022\nlimited in how we conduct our business and pursue our strategy;\n\u2022\nunable to raise additional debt or equity financing to operate during general economic or business downturns; or\n\u2022\nunable to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities.\nA breach of the covenants under the indenture that governs the Senior Notes or under the credit agreement that governs the Senior Credit Facilities could result in an event of default under the applicable agreement. If such an event of default occurs, the lenders under the Senior Credit Facilities and holders of the Senior Notes, as applicable, would have the right to accelerate the repayment of such debt and the event of default or acceleration may result in the acceleration of the repayment of any other debt to which a cross-default or cross-acceleration provision applies. In addition, an event of default under the credit agreement that governs the Senior Credit Facilities would also permit the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility to terminate all other commitments to extend additional credit under the Revolving Credit Facility.\nFurthermore, if we were unable to repay the amounts due and payable under the Senior Credit Facilities, the lenders under the Senior Credit Facilities could proceed against the collateral that secures the indebtedness. In the event our creditors accelerate the repayment of our borrowings, we may not have sufficient assets to repay such indebtedness and we may not be able to access the capital markets to refinance such indebtedness on terms we find acceptable or at all.\nOur indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly or could prevent us from taking advantage of lower rates.\nAs discussed under \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources,\u201d a portion of our indebtedness consists of term loans and revolving credit facility borrowings with variable rates of interest that expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness will increase even though the amount borrowed remains the same, and our net income and cash flows will correspondingly decrease. Our Term Loan is subject to variable interest rates but includes a eurocurrency \"floor\" that is higher than the prevailing market rate. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in current interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately $5 million, and a hypothetical 200 basis point increase in interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately $12 million. We will be exposed to the risk of rising interest rates to the extent that we fund our operations with short-term or variable-rate borrowings. Even if we enter into interest rate swaps in the future in order to reduce future interest rate volatility, we may not elect to maintain such interest rate swaps with respect to any of our variable rate indebtedness, and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk. In addition, we have significant fixed rate indebtedness that includes prepayment penalties which could prevent us from taking advantage of any future decrease in interest rates that may otherwise be applicable to us.\nWe may need to raise additional capital, and we cannot be sure that additional financing will be available.\nWe will fund our ongoing working capital, capital expenditure and financing requirements through cash flows from operations, our Revolving Credit Facility (which is scheduled to expire in 2019) and new sources of capital, including additional financing. Our ability to obtain future financing will depend, among other things, on our financial condition and results of operations as well as on the financial condition of the lenders under our Revolving Credit Facility (whose obligations are several and not joint) and the condition of the capital markets or other credit markets at the time we seek financing. Increased volatility and disruptions in the financial markets could make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain financing. In addition, the adoption of new statutes and regulations, the implementation of recently enacted laws or new interpretations or the enforcement of older laws and regulations applicable to the financial markets or the financial services industry could result in a reduction in the amount of available credit or an increase in the cost of credit. If we should require external financing for any reason, there can be no assurance that we will have access to the capital markets on terms we find acceptable or at all.\nAdverse changes in the equity markets, interest rates or our credit ratings, changes in actuarial assumptions and legislative or other regulatory actions could substantially increase our U.K. pension costs and could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThrough one of our U.K. subsidiaries, we sponsor the IPC Media Pension Scheme (the \u201cIPC Plan\u201d), a defined benefit pension plan that is closed to new participants and accrual of additional benefits for current participants other than certain enhanced benefits - most notably in connection with increases in certain participants' final compensation. In addition, the majority of pensions and deferred benefits in excess of the guaranteed minimum pension are increased annually in line with the increase in the retail price index up to a maximum of 5%.\nIn connection with the Spin-Off, we and the IPC Plan\u2019s trustee (the \"IPC Plan Trustee\") entered into a binding agreement covering the actions that we would take, including an increase in the funding contribution to the IPC Plan to \u00a311 million annually from April 2014 to 2020 and additional assurances and commitments regarding the business and assets that support the IPC Plan, including the Blue Fin Building. Such agreement has been superseded as described below.\nThe most recent triennial valuation of the IPC Plan under U.K. pension regulations was conducted as of April 5, 2015. Under the assumptions used in such valuation, which are more conservative than the assumptions used to determine a pension plan\u2019s funded status in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, the IPC Plan was deemed to be underfunded by approximately \u00a3156 million. We sold the Blue Fin Building on November 24, 2015 (the \u201cBlue Fin Sale Closing\u201d), and as part of that sale a new pension funding agreement (the \u201cNew Pension Support Agreement\u201d) was reached among the IPC Plan Trustee, Time Inc. and Time Inc. (UK) Ltd. (\u201cTime Inc. UK\u201d). Pursuant to the New Pension Support Agreement, the Company was no longer subject to any restrictions on the use of proceeds from the sale of the Blue Fin Building, but agreed to make the following cash contributions to the IPC Plan: (1) \u00a350 million to be contributed within 30 days of the Blue Fin Sale Closing (which contribution was made in November 2015); (2) \u00a311 million to be contributed annually until the sixth anniversary of the Blue Fin Sale Closing; (3) contributions on the sixth, seventh and eighth anniversaries of the Blue Fin Sale Closing calculated so as to eliminate the \u201cself-sufficiency deficit\u201d, if any, of the IPC Plan as of the eighth anniversary of the Blue Fin Sale Closing, determined assuming that the discount rate on the IPC Plan\u2019s liabilities would be equivalent to 0.5% in excess of the then-prevailing rate on bonds issued by the UK Government (\u201cgilts\u201d); and (4) contributions between the eighth and 15th anniversaries of the Blue Fin Sale Closing calculated so as to eliminate the \u201crisk-free self-sufficiency deficit\u201d, if any, of the IPC Plan as of the 15th anniversary of the Blue Fin Sale Closing, determined assuming that the discount rate on the plan\u2019s liabilities would be equivalent to the then-prevailing gilts rate. The \u201cself-sufficiency deficit,\u201d which is calculated using more conservative assumptions than those used in the triennial valuation performed for purposes of determining an appropriate annual funding obligation for the IPC Plan, is an estimate of the amount of a hypothetical one-time contribution that would provide a high level of assurance that the IPC Plan could fund all future benefit obligations as they come due with no further contributions using a discount rate that is 50 basis points higher than the expected return on gilts. The \"risk-free self-sufficiency basis\" uses a discount rate that is the same as the expected return on gilts.\nThe New Pension Support Agreement provides that Time Inc. will guarantee all of Time Inc. UK\u2019s obligations under the IPC Plan and the New Pension Support Agreement, including the above-described payment obligations, as well as the obligation to fund the IPC Plan\u2019s \u201cbuyout deficit\u201d (i.e., the amount that would be needed to purchase annuities to discharge the benefits under the plan) under certain circumstances. Specifically, Time Inc. would be required to deposit the buyout deficit into escrow or provide a surety bond or other suitable credit support if we were to experience a drop in our credit ratings to certain stipulated levels or if our debt in excess of $50 million were not to be paid when due or were to come due prior to its stated maturity as a result of a default (a \u201cMajor Debt Acceleration\u201d). This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We would be permitted to recoup the escrowed funds under certain circumstances after a recovery in our credit ratings. However, if the Company or Time Inc. UK were to become insolvent, or if a Major Debt Acceleration were to occur (without being promptly cured and accompanied by a recovery in the Company\u2019s credit ratings), any escrowed funds would be immediately contributed into the IPC Plan and we would be obligated to immediately contribute into the IPC Plan any shortfall in the buyout deficit amount. Had the Company been required to fund the buyout deficit on December 31, 2016, the\namount would have been approximately \u00a3360 million. The amount of the buyout deficit changes daily and is determined by many factors, including but not limited, to changes in the fair value of the plan assets and liabilities and interest rate.\nIt is possible that, following future valuations of the IPC Plan\u2019s assets and liabilities or following future discussions with the trustee, the annual funding obligation will change. The future valuations under the IPC Plan can be affected by a number of assumptions and factors, including legislative changes, assumptions regarding interest rates, inflation, mortality, compensation increases and retirement rates, the investment strategy and performance of the IPC Plan assets, the strength of our U.K. business, and (in certain limited circumstances) actions by the U.K. pensions regulator. Volatile economic conditions, including as a result of Brexit, could increase the risk that the funding requirements increase following the next triennial valuation, which is expected to commence in April 2018. A significant increase in our funding requirements for the IPC Plan or in the calculated \"self-sufficiency deficit\" or the calculated \"risk-free self-sufficiency deficit\" could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face risks relating to doing business internationally that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur business operates internationally. There are risks inherent in doing business internationally, including:\n\u2022\nissues related to managing international operations, including our ability to hire and retain talented personnel;\n\u2022\npotentially adverse changes in tax laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nlack of sufficient protection for intellectual property in some countries;\n\u2022\ngovernment policies that restrict the print and digital flow of information;\n\u2022\ncomplying with international laws and regulations, including those governing the collection, use, retention, sharing and security of consumer data;\n\u2022\ncurrency exchange and export controls;\n\u2022\nfluctuation in currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nlocal labor laws and regulations;\n\u2022\npolitical or social instability; and\n\u2022\nlimitations on our ability to efficiently repatriate cash from our foreign operations.\nOne or more of these factors could harm our international operations and operating results. These risks will be heightened if we expand the international scope of our operations. In addition, some of our operations are conducted in foreign currencies, and the value of each of these currencies fluctuates relative to the U.S. dollar. As a result, we are exposed to exchange rate fluctuations, which in the past have had, and in the future could have, an adverse effect on our results of operations in a given period. For example, as a result of the June 23, 2016 referendum by British voters to exit the European Union (\u201cBrexit\u201d), global markets and foreign currencies have been adversely impacted. In particular, the value of the British pound has sharply declined as compared to the U.S. dollar and other currencies. A weaker British pound compared to the U.S. dollar during a reporting period would cause local currency results of our U.K. operations to be translated into fewer U.S. dollars. This volatility in foreign currencies is expected to continue as the U.K. negotiates and executes its exit from the European Union, but it is uncertain over what time period this will occur. A significantly weaker British pound compared to the U.S. dollar could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business may suffer if we cannot continue to enforce the intellectual property rights on which our business depends.\nOur business relies on a combination of trademarks, trade names, copyrights, domain names and other proprietary rights, as well as contractual arrangements, including licenses, to establish, maintain and protect our intellectual property rights and brands. Our proprietary trademarks and other intellectual property rights are important to our continued success and our competitive position. See Item 1, \u201cBusiness-Intellectual Property\u201d for a description of our intellectual property assets and the measures we take to protect them. Effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country or region in which we operate or where our products are available. We also may not be able to acquire\nor maintain appropriate domain names or trademarks in all countries or regions in which we do business. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) continues to expand the supply of domain names on the Internet and so far has designated more than 1,500 generic gTLDs, which could significantly change the structure of the Internet and make it significantly more expensive for us to protect our intellectual property on the Internet. We may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names, including generic top level domain names, that are similar to, infringe or diminish the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights. Any impairment of our intellectual property or brands, including due to changes in U.S. or foreign intellectual property laws or the absence of effective legal protections or enforcement measures, could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have been, and may be in the future, subject to claims of intellectual property infringement, which could subject us to liability or require us to change our business practices.\nSuccessful claims that we infringe the intellectual property of others could require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms, incur substantial monetary liability or be enjoined preliminarily or permanently from further use of the intellectual property in question. In addition, due to advancements in technology and the fast paced dissemination of digital content there is an increased risk of copyright and trademark infringement. From time to time, we could be the subject of infringement claims or legal proceedings by third parties due to inadvertent infringement from our digital content. This could require us to change our business practices and limit our ability to compete effectively. Even if we believe that claims of intellectual property infringement are without merit, defending against the claims can be time-consuming and costly and divert management\u2019s attention and resources away from our business.\nService disruptions or failures of our or our vendors\u2019 information systems and networks as a result of computer viruses, misappropriation of data or other malfeasance, natural disasters (including extreme weather), accidental releases of information or other similar events, may disrupt our business, damage our reputation or have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nBecause information systems, networks and other technologies are critical to many of our operating activities, shutdowns or service disruptions at our company or vendors that provide information systems, networks, printing or other services to us pose increasing risks. Such disruptions may be caused by events such as computer hacking, phishing attacks, dissemination of computer viruses, malware, worms and other destructive or disruptive software, denial of service attacks and other malicious activity, as well as power outages, natural disasters (including extreme weather), terrorist attacks or other similar events. Such events could have an adverse impact on us and our customers, including degradation or disruption of service, loss of data and damage to equipment and data. In addition, system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate, and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient to cover all eventualities. Significant events could result in a disruption of our operations, customer or advertiser dissatisfaction, damage to our reputation or brands or a loss of customers or revenues. In addition, we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for any losses associated with such events.\nWe could be subject to risks caused by misappropriation, misuse, leakage, falsification or intentional or accidental release or loss of information maintained in the information systems and networks of our company and our vendors, including personal information of our employees and customers, and company and vendor confidential data. In addition, outside parties may attempt to penetrate our systems or those of our vendors or fraudulently induce our employees or customers or employees of our vendors to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data, or to take control of our sites in order to publish false information or otherwise mislead our users. Like other companies, we have on occasion experienced, and will continue to experience, threats to our data and systems, including malicious codes and viruses, and other cyber-attacks. The number and complexity of these threats continue to increase over time. If a material breach of our security or that of our vendors occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed, we could lose customers, audience and advertisers and our reputation, brands and credibility could be damaged. We could be required to expend significant amounts of money and other resources to repair or replace information systems or networks. In addition, we could be subject to regulatory actions and claims made by consumers and groups in private litigation involving privacy issues related to consumer data collection and use practices and other data privacy laws and regulations, including claims for misuse or inappropriate disclosure of data, as well as unfair or deceptive practices. Although we develop and maintain systems and controls designed to prevent these events\nfrom occurring, and we have a process to identify and mitigate threats, the development and maintenance of these systems, controls and processes is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. Moreover, despite our efforts, the possibility of these events occurring cannot be eliminated entirely. As we distribute more of our content digitally, outsource more of our information systems to vendors, engage in more electronic transactions with consumers and rely more on cloud-based information systems, the related security risks will increase and we will need to expend additional resources to protect our technology and information systems. Additionally, a growing portion of our Subscription revenues, both through our Synapse subsidiary and direct-to-publisher subscriptions, is dependent on the continuous service model and our ability to automatically renew customers (with proper notifications and authorizations) using credit or debit cards that customers provide at the time of purchase. Significant credit card breaches at major retailers have resulted in a number of banks re-issuing credit cards. This creates a break in our relationship with customers whose cards are reissued and results in lost renewal revenue. A continuation or increase in such breaches and resulting re-issuances could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are also subject to payment card association rules and obligations under our contracts with payment card processors. Under these rules and obligations, if information is compromised, we could be liable to payment card issuers for the cost of associated expenses and penalties. In addition, if we fail to follow payment card industry security standards, even if no customer information is compromised, we could incur significant fines or experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs. Furthermore, if we fail to comply with the chargeback policies established by a payment card processor, it could result in us incurring significant fines or even the termination of our contract with that payment card processor.\nWe could be required to record significant impairment charges in the future.\nUnder U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are required to be tested for impairment annually or earlier upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances, and long-lived assets, including finite-lived intangible assets, are required to be tested for impairment upon the occurrence of a triggering event. Factors that could lead to impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets include significant adverse changes in the business climate and declines in the value of our business.\nAs part of our annual impairment test, we assessed our goodwill for impairment as of December 31, 2016. The test resulted in an impairment of $1 million. We also recognized asset impairment charges of $192 million in 2016 primarily related to an impairment of a domestic tradename intangible. In 2015, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $952 million as a result of the sale of the Blue Fin Building, a decline in our publicly traded share price and trends in our Advertising and Circulation revenues.\nMarket conditions in the publishing industry remain challenging, and we continue to experience declines in print advertising revenues and circulation revenues as a result of the continuing shift in consumer preference from print media to digital media and how consumers engage with digital media. If market conditions worsen, if the market price of our publicly traded common stock declines, or if our performance fails to meet current expectations, it is possible that the carrying value of our reporting unit, even after the impairment of goodwill discussed above, will exceed its fair value, which could result in further recognition of a noncash impairment of goodwill that could be material.\nWe have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions and investments, which involve inherent risks and uncertainties.\nWe have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions and investments, which involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including:\n\u2022\nthe difficulty in integrating newly acquired businesses and operations in an efficient and effective manner;\n\u2022\nthe challenge in achieving strategic objectives, cost savings and other anticipated benefits;\n\u2022\nthe potential loss of key employees of the acquired businesses;\n\u2022\nthe potential diversion of senior management\u2019s attention from our operations;\n\u2022\nthe risks associated with integrating financial reporting and internal control systems;\n\u2022\nthe risks associated with the computing environment in which the acquired business operates, including security risks;\n\u2022\nthe difficulty in expanding information technology systems and other business processes to incorporate the acquired businesses;\n\u2022\npotential future impairments of goodwill associated with the acquired businesses; and\n\u2022\nin some cases, the potential for increased regulation.\nIf an acquired business fails to operate as anticipated or generate anticipated returns, cannot be successfully integrated with our existing business or is not a good fit with our overall strategy, or one or more of the other risks and uncertainties identified occur in connection with our acquisitions, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nIf it becomes more difficult to attract and retain key personnel, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe are dependent on our ability to hire and retain talented employees and management. We underwent significant changes over the past year, including several changes in executive leadership and various restructuring and cost management initiatives in several functions, which were disruptive to our business. As a result of these disruptions or other factors, it may become more difficult to attract and retain the key employees we need to meet our strategic objectives.\nOur operating results are subject to seasonal variations.\nOur business has experienced, and is expected to continue to experience, seasonality due to, among other things, seasonal advertising patterns and seasonal influences on people\u2019s reading habits. Typically, our revenues from advertising are highest in the fourth quarter. The effects of such seasonality make it difficult to estimate future operating results based on the previous results of any specific quarter.\nWe may experience financial and strategic difficulties and delays or unexpected costs in completing our various restructuring plans and cost-saving initiatives, including not achieving the anticipated savings and benefits of these plans and initiatives.\nIn the past few years, we initiated restructuring plans and realignment programs that included streamlining our organizational structure to enhance operational flexibility, speed decision making, and spur the development of new cross-brand products and services. We expect to continue to actively manage our costs and may undertake additional restructuring plans and cost-savings initiatives. Our cost savings initiatives include moving some of our business operations and corporate functions to outsourced arrangements or off-shore locations. Identifying and implementing additional cost reductions, however, may become increasingly difficult to do in an operationally effective manner.\nWe may not realize the anticipated savings or benefits from one or more of these restructuring plans or cost-savings initiatives in full or in part, and we may encounter financial and strategic difficulties and delays or unexpected costs in our efforts to do so. In addition, our cost savings initiatives may adversely affect the quality of our products and brands and further limit our ability to attract and retain talent. Our cost savings initiatives are also subject to execution risk, including business disruptions, diversion of management attention, inadequate knowledge transfer, cultural differences, incurring greater than anticipated expenses and risks associated with providing services and functions in outsourced and off-shore locations. In addition, our plan to invest these savings and benefits ahead of future growth means that such costs will be incurred whether or not we realize these savings and benefits. If we fail to realize anticipated savings or benefits or fail to better align our cost structure in a timely manner, or fail to reduce business expenditures through our restructuring plans and cost-savings initiatives, our ability to continue to fund growth initiatives and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to credit risk with respect to our bank deposits and investments in certain short-term securities.\nWe maintain a portion of our cash in bank accounts with several financial institutions. Although the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation provides deposit insurance guaranteeing the safety of a depositor\u2019s accounts in the\nUnited States, such insurance is limited to an immaterial portion of our deposits. In addition, we invest a portion of our cash in securities that include Treasury money funds, government money funds and prime money funds. The value of these investments is subject to credit risk from the issuers and/or guarantors of the securities and other counterparties in certain transactions. Defaults by the issuer and, where applicable, an issuer\u2019s guarantor or other counterparties with regard to any such investments could reduce our net realized investment gains or result in investment losses.\nWe could have an indemnification obligation to Time Warner if the Distribution were determined not to qualify for non-recognition tax treatment, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition.\nIf, due to any of our representations being untrue or our covenants being breached, it were determined that the Distribution did not qualify for non-recognition of gain and loss under Section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code (the \"Code\"), or that an excess loss account existed at the date of the Spin-Off, we could be required to indemnify Time Warner for the resulting taxes and related expenses. Any such indemnification obligation could materially adversely affect our financial condition.\nIn addition, Section 355(e) of the Code generally creates a presumption that the Distribution would be taxable to Time Warner, but not to stockholders, if we or our stockholders were to engage in transactions that result in a 50% or greater change by vote or value in the ownership of our stock during the four-year period beginning on the date that begins two years before the date of the Distribution, unless it were established that such transactions and the Distribution were not part of a plan or series of related transactions giving effect to such a change in ownership. If the Distribution were taxable to Time Warner due to such a 50% or greater change in ownership of our stock, Time Warner would recognize a gain in an amount up to the fair market value of our common stock held by it immediately before the Distribution, increased by the amount of the special dividend that we paid Time Warner in connection with the Spin-Off, and we generally would be required to indemnify Time Warner for the tax on such gain and any related expenses. Any such indemnification obligation could materially adversely affect our financial condition. See Note 16, \"Related Party Transactions and Relationship with Time Warner,\" to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K.\nWe agreed to numerous restrictions to preserve the non-recognition tax treatment of the Distribution, which may reduce our strategic and operating flexibility.\nIn connection with the Spin-Off, we entered into a Tax Matters Agreement with Time Warner pursuant to which we agreed to covenants and indemnification obligations that address compliance with Section 355(e) of the Code. These covenants and indemnification obligations may limit our ability to pursue strategic transactions or engage in new businesses or other transactions that may maximize the value of our business, and might discourage or delay a strategic transaction that our stockholders may consider favorable. See Note 16, \"Related Party Transactions and Relationship with Time Warner,\" to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K.\nOur historical financial information is not necessarily representative of the results we would have achieved as an independent publicly-traded company and may not be a reliable indicator of our future results.\nWe derived the historical financial information for periods prior to the Spin-Off from Time Warner\u2019s consolidated financial statements, and this information does not necessarily reflect the results of operations and financial position we would have achieved as an independent publicly-traded company during the periods presented, or those that we will achieve in the future. This is primarily because of the following factors:\n\u2022\nPrior to the Spin-Off, we operated as part of Time Warner\u2019s broader corporate organization and Time Warner performed various corporate functions for us, including information technology, tax administration, treasury activities, accounting, benefits administration, procurement, legal and ethics and compliance program administration. Our historical financial information for periods prior to the Spin-Off reflects allocations of corporate expenses from Time Warner for these and similar functions. These allocations may not reflect the costs we would have incurred or will incur as an independent publicly-traded company.\n\u2022\nWe entered into agreements with Time Warner that either did not exist prior to the Spin-Off or that have different terms than terms of arrangements or agreements that existed prior to the Spin-Off.\n\u2022\nOur historical financial information for periods prior to the Spin-Off does not reflect changes that we have experienced or may experience as a result of our separation from Time Warner, including changes in the financing, operations, cost structure and personnel needs of our business. As part of Time Warner, we enjoyed certain benefits from Time Warner\u2019s operating diversity, size, purchasing power, borrowing leverage and available capital for investments, and we lost these benefits after the Spin-Off. As an independent entity, we may be unable to purchase goods, services and technologies, such as insurance and health care benefits and computer software licenses, or access capital markets on terms as favorable to us as those we obtained as part of Time Warner prior to the Spin-Off. In addition, subject to the discretion of our Board and other factors, we have made and expect to continue to make quarterly dividend payments to our stockholders.\nIn addition, our pre-Spin-Off financial data does not include an allocation of interest expense comparable to the interest expense we incur as a result of the Senior Notes and the Senior Credit Facilities. Our interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $63 million exclusive of fees and discounts, which is significantly higher than the amount reflected in our historical financial statements for the years before 2015.\nFollowing the Spin-Off, we became responsible for the additional costs associated with being an independent publicly-traded company, including costs related to corporate governance, investor and public relations and public reporting. Therefore, our financial statements for the years before 2015 may not be indicative of our performance as an independent publicly-traded company. For additional information about our past financial performance and the basis of presentation of our financial statements, see Item 6., \u201cSelected Financial Data,\u201d \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and our historical financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.\nOur stock price may fluctuate significantly.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate widely, depending on many factors, some of which may be beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results due to factors related to our business;\n\u2022\nsuccess or failure of our business strategies;\n\u2022\nour quarterly or annual earnings, or those of other companies in our industry;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain financing as needed;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions or dispositions;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u2022\nthe failure of securities analysts to continue to cover our common stock;\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings estimates by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates;\n\u2022\nthe operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies;\n\u2022\nchanges in the digital advertising and technology industry;\n\u2022\ninvestor perception of our company and the magazine publishing industry;\n\u2022\noverall market fluctuations;\n\u2022\nresults from any material litigation or government investigation;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws and regulations (including tax laws and regulations) affecting our business;\n\u2022\nspeculation about third party interest in an acquisition of our company;\n\u2022\nchanges in capital gains taxes and taxes on dividends affecting stockholders; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions and other external factors.\nStock markets in general have experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company. These broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nProvisions in our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-laws and of Delaware law may prevent or delay an acquisition of our company, which could decrease the trading price of our common stock.\nSeveral provisions of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, Amended and Restated By-laws and Delaware law may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that stockholders may consider favorable. These include provisions that:\n\u2022\npermit us to issue blank check preferred stock;\n\u2022\ndo not permit our stockholders to act by written consent and require that stockholder action must take place at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022\nprovide that only our Chief Executive Officer, Board of Directors or any record holders of shares representing at least 25% of the combined voting power of the outstanding shares of all classes and series of our capital stock entitled generally to vote in the election of directors, voting as a single class, are entitled to call a special meeting of our stockholders; and\n\u2022\nlimit the ability of certain stockholders to enter into business combination transactions with the Company without the approval of our Board of Directors.", "PERMNO": 14637, "SIC": 2721, "TIC": "TIME"}
