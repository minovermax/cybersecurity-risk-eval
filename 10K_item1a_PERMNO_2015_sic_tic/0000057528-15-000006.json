{"cik": "57528", "company": "SNYDER'S-LANCE, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-04", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business. Our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected by any of these risks. Additional risks and uncertainties, including risks that we do not presently know of or currently deem insignificant, may also impair our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur performance may be impacted by general economic conditions or an economic downturn.\nAn overall decline in U.S. economic activity could adversely impact our business and financial results. Economic uncertainty may reduce consumer spending as consumers make decisions on what to include in their food budgets. This could also result in a shift in consumer preference toward private label products. Shifts in consumer spending could result in increased pressure from competitors or customers to increase promotional spending or reduce the prices of some of our products and/or limit our ability to increase or maintain prices, which could lower our revenue and profitability.\nInstability in financial markets may impact our ability or increase the cost to enter into new credit agreements in the future. Additionally, it may weaken the ability of our customers, suppliers, IBOs, third-party distributors, banks, insurance companies and other business partners to perform in the normal course of business, which could expose us to losses or disrupt the supply of inputs we rely upon to conduct our business. If one or more of our key business partners fail to perform as expected or contracted for any reason, our business could be negatively impacted.\nVolatility in the price or availability of the inputs we depend on, including raw materials, packaging, energy and labor, could adversely impact our financial results.\nOur financial results could be adversely impacted by changes in the cost or availability of raw materials and packaging. While we often obtain substantial commitments for future delivery of certain raw materials, continued long-term increases in the costs of raw materials and packaging, including but not limited to cost increases due to the tightening of supply, could adversely affect our financial results.\nOur transportation and logistics system is dependent upon gasoline and diesel fuel, and our manufacturing operations depend on natural gas. While we may enter into forward purchase contracts to reduce the volatility associated with some of these costs, continued long-term changes in the cost or availability of these energy sources could adversely impact our financial results.\nOur continued growth requires us to hire, retain and develop a highly skilled workforce and talented management team. Our financial results could be adversely affected by increased costs due to increased competition for employees, higher employee turnover or increased employee benefit costs.\nWe operate in the highly competitive food industry.\nPrice competition and industry consolidation could adversely impact our financial results. The sales of most of our products are subject to significant competition primarily through promotional discounting and other price cutting techniques by competitors, some of whom are significantly larger and have greater resources than we do. In addition, there is continuing consolidation in the snack food industry, which could increase competition. Significant competition increases the possibility that we could lose one or more major customers, lose existing product authorizations at customer locations, lose market share and/or shelf space, increase expenditures or reduce selling prices, which could have an adverse impact on our business or financial results.\nSales price increases initiated by us may negatively impact our financial results if not properly implemented or accepted by our customers. Future price increases, such as those made in order to offset increased input costs, may reduce our overall sales volume, which could reduce our revenue and operating profit. Price changes driven by higher input costs may not occur, or may not occur in a timely manner, which may reduce our operating profit. Additionally, if market prices for certain inputs decline significantly below our contracted prices, customer pressure to reduce prices could lower our revenue and operating profit.\nChanges in our top retail customer relationships could impact our revenue and profitability.\nWe are exposed to risks resulting from several large retail customers that account for a significant portion of our revenue. Our top ten retail customers accounted for approximately 48% of our net revenue during 2014, with our largest retail customer representing approximately 14% of our 2014 net revenue. The loss of one or more of our large retail customers could adversely affect our financial results. These customers typically make purchase decisions based on a combination of price, service, product quality, product offerings, consumer demand, as well as distribution capabilities and generally do not enter into long-term contracts. In addition, these significant retail customers may change their business practices related to inventories, product displays, logistics or other aspects of the customer-supplier relationship. Our results of operations could be adversely affected if revenue from one or more of these customers is significantly reduced or if the cost of complying with customers\u2019 demands is significant. If receivables from one or more of these customers become uncollectible, our financial results may be adversely impacted.\nWe may be unable to maintain our profitability in the face of a consolidating retail environment.\nOur largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., accounted for 14% of our fiscal 2014 net sales, and our ten largest customers together accounted for approximately 48% of our fiscal 2014 net sales. As the retail grocery trade continues to consolidate and our retail customers grow larger and become more sophisticated, our retail customers may demand lower pricing and increased promotional programs. Further, these customers are reducing their inventories and increasing their emphasis on products that hold either the number one or number two market position and private label products. If we fail to use our sales and marketing expertise to maintain our category leadership positions to respond to these trends, or if we lower our prices or increase promotional support of our products and are unable to increase the volume of our products sold, our profitability and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nOur results may be adversely affected by the failure to execute acquisitions and divestitures successfully.\nOur ability to meet our objectives with respect to the acquisition of new businesses or the divestiture of existing businesses may depend in part on our ability to identify suitable buyers and sellers, negotiate favorable financial terms and other contractual terms, and obtain all necessary regulatory approvals. Potential risks of acquisitions also include the inability to integrate acquired businesses efficiently into our existing operations; diversion of management's attention from other business concerns; potential loss of key employees and/or customers of acquired businesses; potential assumption of unknown liabilities; the inability to implement promptly an effective control environment; potential impairment charges if purchase assumptions are not achieved or market conditions decline; and the risks inherent in entering markets or lines of business with which we have limited or no prior experience. Acquisitions outside the U.S. may present unique challenges and increase our exposure to risks associated with foreign operations, including foreign currency risks and risks associated with local regulatory agencies.\nPotential risks for divestitures include the inability to separate divested businesses or business units from the Company effectively and efficiently and to reduce or eliminate associated overhead costs. Our inability to generate revenue and earnings to replace those previously generated by Private Brands or to generate cost reductions to offset overhead costs previously absorbed by Private Brands could negatively impact future results from continuing operations. Our business or financial results may be negatively affected if acquisitions or divestitures are not successfully implemented or completed.\nThe loss of key personnel could have an adverse effect on our financial results and growth prospects.\nThere are risks associated with our ability to retain key employees. If certain key employees terminate their employment, it could negatively impact manufacturing, sales, marketing or development activities. In addition, we may not be able to locate suitable replacements for key employees or offer employment to potential replacements on acceptable terms.\nEfforts to execute and accomplish our strategy could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe utilize several operating strategies to increase revenue and improve operating performance. If we are unsuccessful due to unplanned events, our ability to manage change or unfavorable market conditions, our financial performance could be adversely affected. If we pursue strategic acquisitions, divestitures, or joint ventures, we may incur significant costs and may not be able to consummate the transactions or obtain financing. Further, the success of our acquisitions will depend on many factors, such as our ability to identify potential acquisition candidates, negotiate satisfactory purchase terms, obtain loans at satisfactory rates to fund acquisitions and successfully integrate and manage the growth from acquisitions. Integrating the operations, financial reporting, disparate technologies and personnel of newly acquired companies involves risks. As a result, we may not be able to realize expected synergies or other anticipated benefits of acquisitions.\nFuture acquisitions also could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt, which could adversely affect our financial results. In the event we enter into strategic transactions or relationships, our financial results may differ from expectations. We may not be able to achieve expected returns and other benefits as a result of potential acquisitions or divestitures.\nConcerns with the safety and quality of certain food products or ingredients could cause consumers to avoid our products.\nWe could be adversely affected if consumers in our principal markets lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain products or ingredients. Negative publicity about these concerns, whether or not valid, may discourage consumers from buying our products or cause disruptions in production or distribution of our products and negatively impact our business and financial results.\nIf our products become adulterated, misbranded or mislabeled, we might need to recall those items and we may experience product liability claims if consumers are injured or become sick.\nWe may need to recall some of our products if they become adulterated or if they are mislabeled, and may also be liable if the consumption of any of our products causes injury to consumers. A widespread recall could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall, the destruction of product inventory, and lost sales due to the unavailability of the affected product for a period of time. A significant product recall or product liability claim could also result in adverse publicity, damage to our reputation, and a loss of consumer confidence in the safety and/or quality of our products, ingredients or packaging. Such a loss of confidence could occur even in the absence of a recall or a major product liability claim. We also may become involved in lawsuits and legal proceedings if it is alleged that the consumption of any of our products causes injury or illness. A product recall or an adverse result in any such litigation could have an adverse effect on our operating and financial results. We may also lose customer confidence for our entire Branded portfolio as a result of any such recall or proceeding.\nDisruption of our supply chain could have an adverse impact on our business and financial results.\nOur ability to manufacture and sell our products may be impaired by damage or disruption to our manufacturing or distribution capabilities, or to the capabilities of our suppliers or contract manufacturers, due to factors that are hard to predict or beyond our control, such as adverse weather conditions, natural disasters, fire, pandemics or other events. Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, may adversely affect our business or financial results, particularly in circumstances where a product or ingredient is sourced from a single supplier or location.\nWe may be adversely impacted by inadequacies in, or security breaches of, our information technology systems.\nWe increasingly rely on information technology systems to conduct our business. These systems can enhance efficiency and business processes but also present risks of unauthorized access to our networks or data centers. If unauthorized parties gain access to our systems, they could obtain and exploit confidential business, customer, or employee information and harm our competitive position. Further, these information systems may experience damage, failures, interruptions, errors, inefficiencies, attacks or suffer from fires or natural disasters, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results if not adequately mitigated by our security measures and disaster recovery plans.\nFurthermore, with multiple information technology systems as a result of acquisitions, we may encounter difficulties assimilating or integrating data. In addition, we are currently in the process of consolidating systems which could provide additional security or business disruption risks which could have an adverse impact on our business and financial results.\nImproper use or misuse of social media may have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nConsumers are moving away from traditional means of electronic mail towards new forms of electronic communication, including social media. We support new ways of sharing data and communicating with customers using methods such as social networking. However, misuse of social networking by individuals, customers, competitors, or employees may result in unfavorable media attention which could negatively affect our business. Further, our competitors are increasingly using social media networks to market and advertise products. If we are unable to compete in this environment it could adversely affect our financial results.\nDemand for our products may be adversely affected by changes in consumer preferences and tastes or if we are unable to innovate or market our products effectively.\nWe are a consumer products company operating in highly competitive markets and rely on continued demand for our products. To generate revenue and profits, we must sell products that appeal to our customers and consumers. Any significant changes in consumer preferences or any inability on our part to anticipate or react to such changes could result in reduced demand for our products and erosion of our competitive and financial position. Our success depends on the ability to respond to consumer trends, including concerns of consumers regarding health and wellness, obesity, product attributes and ingredients. In addition, changes in product category consumption or consumer demographics could result in reduced demand for our products. Consumer preferences may shift due to a variety of factors, including the aging of the general population, changes in social trends, or changes in travel, vacation or leisure activity patterns. Any of these changes may reduce consumers\u2019 willingness to purchase our products and negatively impact our financial results.\nOur continued success also is dependent on product innovation, including maintaining a robust pipeline of new products, and the effectiveness of advertising campaigns, marketing programs and product packaging. Although we devote significant resources to meet this goal, there can be no assurance as to the continued ability to develop and launch successful new products or variants of existing products, or to effectively execute advertising campaigns and marketing programs.\nOur DSD network relies on a significant number of IBOs, and such reliance could affect our ability to efficiently and profitably distribute and market products, maintain existing markets and expand business into other geographic markets.\nOur DSD network relies on approximately 2,700 IBOs for the sale and distribution of Branded and Partner brand products.\nIBOs must make a commitment of capital and/or obtain financing to purchase a route business and other equipment to conduct their business. Certain financing arrangements, through third-party lending institutions, are made available to IBOs and require us to repurchase a route business if the IBO defaults on their loan and we then are required to collect any shortfall from the IBO to the extent possible. The inability of IBOs, in the aggregate, to make timely payments could require write-offs of accounts receivable or increased provisions made against accounts receivable, either of which could adversely affect our financial results.\nThe ability to maintain a DSD network depends on a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control. Some of these factors include: (i) the level of demand for the brands and products which are available in a particular distribution area; (ii) the ability to price products at levels competitive with those offered by competing producers; and (iii) the ability to deliver products in the quantity and at the time ordered by IBOs and retail customers. There can be no assurance that we will be able to mitigate the risks related to all or any of these factors in any of the current or prospective geographic areas of distribution. To the extent that any of these factors have an adverse effect on the relationships with IBOs, thus limiting maintenance and expansion of the sales market, our revenue and financial results may be adversely impacted.\nIdentifying new IBOs can be time-consuming and any resulting delay may be disruptive and costly to the business. There also is no assurance that we will be able to maintain current distribution relationships or establish and maintain successful relationships with IBOs in new geographic distribution areas. There is the possibility that we will have to incur significant expenses to attract and maintain IBOs in one or more geographic distribution areas. The occurrence of any of these factors could result in increased expense or a significant decrease in sales volume through our DSD network and harm our business and financial results.\nContinued success depends on the protection of our trademarks and other proprietary intellectual property rights.\nWe maintain numerous trademarks and other intellectual property rights, which are important to our success and competitive position, and the loss of or our inability to enforce trademark and other proprietary intellectual property rights could harm our business. We devote substantial resources to the establishment and protection of our trademarks and other proprietary intellectual property rights on a worldwide basis. Efforts to establish and protect trademarks and other proprietary intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent imitation of products by others or to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products. In addition, the laws and enforcement mechanisms of some foreign countries may not allow for the protection of proprietary rights to the same extent as in the United States and other countries.\nImpairment in the carrying value of goodwill or other intangible assets could have an adverse impact on our financial results.\nThe net carrying value of goodwill represents the fair value of acquired businesses in excess of identifiable assets and liabilities, and the net carrying value of other intangibles represents the fair value of trademarks, customer relationships, route intangibles and other acquired intangibles. Pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, we are required to perform impairment tests on our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets annually or at any time when events occur, which could impact the value of our reporting unit or our indefinite-lived intangibles. These values depend on a variety of factors, including the success of our business, market conditions, earnings growth and expected cash flows. Impairments to goodwill and other intangible assets may be caused by factors outside our control, such as increasing competitive pricing pressures, changes in discount rates based on changes in cost of capital or lower than expected sales and profit growth rates. In addition, if we see the need to consolidate certain brands, we could experience impairment of our trademark intangible assets. Significant and unanticipated changes could require a non-cash charge for impairment in a future period which may significantly affect our financial results in the period of such charge.\nNew regulations or legislation could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nFood production and marketing are highly regulated by a variety of federal, state and other governmental agencies. New or increased government regulation of the food industry, including but not limited to areas related to food safety, chemical composition, production processes, traceability, product quality, packaging, labeling, school lunch guidelines, promotions, marketing and advertising (particularly such communications that are directed toward children), product recalls, records, storage and distribution could adversely impact our results of operations by increasing production costs or restricting our methods of operation and distribution. These regulations may address food industry or society factors, such as obesity, nutritional and environmental concerns and diet trends.\nWe are exposed to interest rate volatility, which could negatively impact our financial results.\nWe are exposed to interest rate volatility since the interest rates associated with portions of our debt are variable. While we mitigate a portion of this volatility by entering into interest rate swap agreements, those agreements could lock our interest rates above the market rates.\nA significant portion of our outstanding shares of common stock is controlled by a few individuals, and their interests may conflict with those of other stockholders.\nAs of January 3, 2015, Patricia A. Warehime beneficially owned in the aggregate approximately 18% of our outstanding common stock. Mrs. Warehime serves as one of our directors. Her husband, Michael A. Warehime served as the Chairman of the Board until he passed away in August of 2014. Mrs. Warehime is the executrix, trustee and principal beneficiary of Mr. Warehime's estate and trust. As a result, Mrs. Warehime may be able to exercise significant influence over us and certain matters requiring approval of our stockholders, including the approval of significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or its assets. This could limit the ability of our other stockholders to influence corporate matters and may have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring control of our company. In addition, Mrs. Warehime may have actual or potential interests that diverge from the interests of our other stockholders.", "PERMNO": 48531, "SIC": 2052, "TIC": "LNCE"}
