RISK FACTORS\nThe risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks and uncertainties that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of those risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could suffer. The risks and uncertainties discussed below also include forward-looking statements and our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements.\nRisks Relating to Our Company\nA significant portion of our revenues are related to the dollar amount of fuel purchased by our customers, and, as a result, volatility in fuel prices could have an adverse effect on our revenues.\nOur customers in our Fleet Solutions segment primarily purchase fuel. Accordingly, a significant part of our revenue is dependent on fuel prices, which are prone to volatility. As of December 31, 2019, management estimates that approximately 21 percent of our total revenues result from fees paid to us by fuel providers based on a negotiated percentage of the purchase price of fuel purchased by our customers. We estimate that during 2020, each one cent decline in average domestic fuel prices below average actual prices would result in approximately a $1.6 million decline in 2020 revenue. Therefore, extended declines in the price of fuel would have a material adverse effect on our total revenues. We are currently exposed to the full impact of fuel price declines and our net income is exposed to fuel price volatility. If fuel prices decline, this will negatively impact our revenue and income.\nFuel prices are dependent on many factors, all of which are beyond our control. These factors include, among others:\n\u2022\nsupply and demand for oil and gas, and expectations regarding supply and demand;\n\u2022\nspeculative trading;\n\u2022\nactions by major oil exporting nations;\n\u2022\nlevel of U.S. oil production;\n\u2022\nadvances in oil production technologies;\n\u2022\npolitical conditions in other oil-producing, gas-producing or supply-route countries, including revolution, insurgency, terrorism or war;\n\u2022\nrefinery capacity;\n\u2022\nweather, including climate change and natural disasters;\n\u2022\nthe prices of foreign exports and the availability of alternate fuel sources;\n\u2022\nvalue of the U.S. dollar versus other major currencies;\n\u2022\nactions by members of Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other major oil-producing nations;\n\u2022\nimplementation of fuel efficiency standards and the adoption by fleet customers of vehicles with greater fuel efficiency or alternative fuel sources;\n\u2022\ngeneral worldwide economic conditions; and\n\u2022\ngovernmental regulations, taxes and tariffs.\nAnother component of our revenue stream is the late fees that our customers pay on past due balances. As a result, a decrease in the price of fuel leads to a decline in the amount of late fees we earn from customers who fail to pay us timely.\nA portion of our revenue in Europe is derived from the difference between the negotiated price of the fuel from the supplier and the price charged to the fleet customer. As a result, a contraction in these differences would reduce revenues and could adversely affect our operating results.\nRevenue from our Fleet business in Europe is primarily derived from transactions where our revenue is tied to the difference between the negotiated price of the fuel from the supplier and the price charged to the fleet customer. The merchant\u2019s cost of fuel is dependent on several factors including, among others, the factors described above affecting fuel prices. We experience fuel-price related revenue contraction when the merchant\u2019s cost of fuel increases at a faster rate than the fuel price we charge to our fleet customers, or the fuel-price we charge to our fleet customers decreases at a faster rate than the merchant\u2019s cost of fuel. Accordingly, we generate less revenue, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nChanges in interchange fees could decrease our revenue.\nA portion of our revenue is generated by network processing fees charged to merchants, known as interchange fees, associated with transactions processed using our cards. Interchange fee amounts associated with cards are affected by a number of factors, including regulatory limits and fee changes. In addition, interchange fees are the subject of intense legal and regulatory scrutiny and competitive pressures in the electronic payments industry. For example, the Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act, which serves to limit interchange fees, may restrict or otherwise impact the way we do business or limit our ability to charge certain fees to customers. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or the CFPB, is also engaged in rulemaking and regulation of the payments industry, in particular with respect to prepaid cards. The CFPB amended several aspects of its prepaid accounts rule, which became effective on April 1, 2019. The extensive nature of these types of regulations and the implementation dates for any such additional rulemaking may result in additional compliance obligations and expense for our business and our customers. These factors could result in lower interchange fees generally in the future. Temporary or permanent decreases in the interchange fees associated with our card transactions, could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nIf we fail to adequately assess and monitor credit risks posed by our customers, we could experience an increase in credit loss.\nWe are subject to credit risk posed by our customers, many of which are small-to mid-sized businesses. Because we often fund a customer\u2019s entire receivable while our revenue is generated from only a small percentage of that amount, our risk of loss is amplified by the customer\u2019s failure to pay. We use various formulas and models to screen potential customers and establish appropriate credit limits, but these formulas and models cannot eliminate all potential credit risks and may not prevent us from approving applications that are fraudulently completed. Moreover, businesses that are good credit risks at the time of application may deteriorate over time and we may fail to detect such changes. In addition, changes to our policies on the types and profiles of businesses to which we extend credit could also have an adverse impact on our credit losses. In times of economic slowdown, the number of our customers who default on payments owed to us tends to increase. If we fail to adequately manage our credit risks, our provision for credit losses on the income statement could be significantly higher.\nWe may incur substantial losses due to fraudulent use of our payment cards, payment systems or vouchers.\nUnder certain circumstances, we may bear the risk of substantial losses due to fraudulent use of our payment cards or payment systems. We are also subject to risk from fraudulent acts of employees or contractors. Although we maintain insurance for certain types of losses, the coverage may be insufficient or limited and may not fully protect against those losses. Additionally, criminals use sophisticated illegal activities to target us, including \u201cskimming\u201d, counterfeit cards and accounts, and identity theft. A single, significant incident or a series of incidents of fraud or theft could lead to, among other things, some or all of the following:\n\u2022\nincreased overall level of fraud;\n\u2022\ndirect financial losses as a result of fraudulent activity;\n\u2022\nreputational harm;\n\u2022\ndecreased desirability of our services;\n\u2022\ngreater regulation;\n\u2022\nincreased compliance costs;\n\u2022\nimposition of regulatory sanctions; or\n\u2022\nsignificant monetary fines.\nAll of the above could have a material adverse effect on our operations, business success, financial condition and results of operations. Our provision for credit losses, inclusive of fraud losses, was $65.7 million in 2019 compared to $66.5 million in 2018 and $64.2 million in 2017.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could affect our financial results.\nWe earn revenues, pay expenses, own assets and incur liabilities in countries using currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Such currencies include, but are not limited to, the Australian dollar, the Canadian dollar, the Euro, British Pound sterling, New Zealand dollar and Brazilian Real. Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate revenues, income and expenses, as well as assets and liabilities, into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency transactions as well as the re-measurement of our cash, receivable and payable balances that are denominated in foreign currencies, are recorded directly in the consolidated statements of income. In addition, gains and losses associated with the\nCompany\u2019s foreign currency exchange derivatives are recorded on the consolidated statements of income. Therefore, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against other major currencies that we use to conduct our business will affect our revenues, operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in those currencies. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly fluctuations in the U.S. dollar against other currencies, may materially affect our financial results.\nOur exposure to counterparty risk could create an adverse effect on our financial condition.\nWe engage in a number of transactions where counterparty risk is a relevant factor, including transactions with customers, derivatives counterparties and those businesses we work with to provide services, among others. These risks are dependent upon market conditions and also the real and perceived viability of the counterparty. The failure or perceived weakness of any of our counterparties has the potential to expose us to risk of loss in certain situations. Certain contracts and arrangements that we enter into with counterparties may provide us with indemnification clauses to protect us from financial loss. If the counterparty fails to, or is unable to fulfill these indemnification clauses, we may incur losses as well as harm to our reputation.\nWe have substantial indebtedness, which may materially and adversely affect our financial flexibility and our ability to meet our debt service obligations.\nUnder our 2016 Credit Agreement, as amended through December 31, 2019, we had an outstanding principal amount of $923.7 million on our tranche A term loan facility, an outstanding principal amount equal to $1,457.0 million on our tranche B term loan facility and amounts available consisting of an $820 million secured revolving credit facility, with a $250 million sublimit for letters of credit and a $20 million sublimit for swingline loans. On January 18, 2019, we entered into a fifth amendment to our 2016 Credit Agreement that increased the principal amount of the tranche A term loan facility by $300 million and provides for delayed draw revolving credit commitments in the amount of $25 million and term A loan commitments in the amount of $275 million to finance in part the Discovery Benefits acquisition, subject to satisfaction of customary funding conditions. On May 17, 2019, the Company entered into a sixth amendment to our 2016 Credit Agreement, which provided additional tranche B term loans in the original principal amount of $150.0 million and extended the maturity date of tranche B term loans by three years to May 17, 2026. The tranche A term loans mature, and the revolving credit facility terminates and is repayable, on July 1, 2023. On November 19, 2019, we entered into a seventh amendment to our 2016 Credit Agreement, which increased commitments under our revolving credit facility from $770.0 million to $820.0 million. In addition to the 2016 Credit Agreement, our indebtedness consists of our Notes, deposits held by WEX Bank and other liabilities outstanding.\nOur indebtedness could, among other things:\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to repaying our indebtedness, thus reducing the amount of funds available for other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to borrow additional funds necessary for working capital, capital expenditures or other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to adverse general economic or industry conditions; and\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to changes in, our business.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to meet our indebtedness obligations, including any of our obligations under the Notes. In addition, we may need to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future to fund our operations or certain strategic objectives. However, we may not be able to obtain the additional financing necessary for these purposes.\nIn addition, under the 2016 Credit Agreement as amended, unless otherwise agreed by the requisite lenders under the revolving and term A credit facilities, we are required to remain in compliance with a consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest charge coverage ratio, measured quarterly, of no less than 3.00 to 1.00; and a consolidated leverage ratio, testing consolidated funded indebtedness (excluding (i) up to $350 million of consolidated funded indebtedness due to permitted securitization transactions and (ii) the amount of consolidated funded indebtedness constituting the non-recourse portion of permitted factoring transactions, and netting up to $125.0 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents denominated in U.S. dollars held by the Company and its subsidiaries) to consolidated EBITDA, measured quarterly, of no more than 5.00 to 1.00 at December 31, 2019, decreasing to 4.75 to 1.0 at December 31, 2020 and further decreasing to 4.50 to 1.0 at December 31, 2021 and thereafter. On February 10, 2020, we entered into an Eighth Amendment to our 2016 Credit Agreement, which would, among other things, (a) modify the maximum consolidated leverage ratio to be no more than 5.75 to 1.00 commencing as of December 31, 2019, decreasing to 5.50 to 1.0 commencing as of December 31, 2020, decreasing\nto 5.00 to 1.0 commencing as of December 31, 2021 and further decreasing to 4.75 to 1.0 commencing as of December 31, 2022 and thereafter, and (b) other than for pricing purposes, allow us to test consolidated funded indebtedness excluding (i) up to $400 million of consolidated funded indebtedness due to permitted securitization transactions and (ii) the amount of consolidated funded indebtedness constituting the non-recourse portion of permitted factoring transactions, and netting up to $200.0 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents denominated in U.S. dollars held by the Company and its subsidiaries. The aforementioned amendments would only become effective concurrently with the closing of the pending acquisition of eNett and Optal, if it occurs. The 2016 Credit Agreement also contains various affirmative and negative covenants that, subject to certain customary exceptions, restrict our ability to, among other things, create liens over our property, incur additional indebtedness, enter into sale and lease-back transactions, make loans, advances or other investments, make non-ordinary course asset sales, declare or pay dividends or make other distributions with respect to equity interests, change the nature of our business, enter into certain agreements which restrict our ability to pay dividends or other distributions or create liens on our property, transact business with affiliates and/or merge or consolidate with any other person. Our ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control. Failure to comply with the financial covenants or any other non-financial or restrictive covenant in our 2016 Credit Agreement could create a default. Upon a default, our lenders could accelerate the indebtedness under the facilities (except only the requisite lenders under the revolving credit facility and the tranche A term loan facility may accelerate the revolving credit facility due to a breach of the financial covenants), foreclose against their collateral or seek other remedies, which could trigger a default under the Notes and would jeopardize our ability to continue our current operations. The Notes also contain customary negative and affirmative covenants and events of default that if breached could allow the requisite noteholders to accelerate the maturity of the Notes and to exercise their rights and remedies under the Notes, and could also trigger a default under the 2016 Credit Agreement.\nDespite our substantial indebtedness, we may still be able to incur more debt, intensifying the risks described above.\nSubject to restrictions in our 2016 Credit Agreement and the Notes, we may incur additional indebtedness, which could increase the risks associated with our already substantial indebtedness. Subject to certain limitations, including compliance with the covenants in our 2016 Credit Agreement, we have the ability to borrow additional funds under our 2016 Credit Agreement.\nIn connection with the planned acquisition of eNett, and Optal, and contingent upon the closing of the acquisition, we have obtained financing commitments from Bank of America, N.A., BofA Securities, Inc., Citizens Bank, N.A., MUFG Bank, Ltd., SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Truist Bank, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., Bank of Montreal, BMO Capital Markets Corp., Santander Bank, N.A., KeyBank National Association, KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Regions Capital Markets, a division of Regions Bank, Deutsche Bank AG Cayman Islands Branch, Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and Fifth Third Bank, National Association for (a) senior secured credit facilities in the aggregate amount of up to $2.8 billion consisting of (i) up to an approximately $2.0 billion seven-year term loan B facility comprised of approximately $1.1 billion to fund the planned acquisition and $924 million (the \u201cBackstop Term Loans\u201d) to be used to refinance our existing Term A loans under our 2016 Credit Agreement, to the extent that the 2016 Credit Agreement has not been amended prior to the funding of these facilities to increase the maximum consolidated leverage ratio upon the closing of the acquisition to 5.75x, subject to step-downs (the \u201cFinancial Covenant Amendment\u201d) and (ii) an $820 million revolving credit facility (the \u201cBackstop Revolving Credit Facility\u201d) to replace our existing revolving credit facility, to the extent the Financial Covenant Amendment has not occurred prior to the funding of these facilities, and (b) a senior unsecured bridge facility in the aggregate amount of up to $300 million minus any gross cash proceeds received by us from the issuance of any senior unsecured notes (collectively, the \u201cCommitted Financing\u201d). If funded, the Backstop Term Loans would replace the existing Term A loans and the Backstop Revolving Credit Facility would replace the existing revolving credit facility. On February 10, 2020, we entered into an Eighth Amendment to our 2016 Credit Agreement which implemented the Financial Covenant Amendment effective upon the closing of the pending acquisition of eNett and Optal, if it occurs. If we pursue additional acquisitions, we could incur further debt or further amend the terms of our existing 2016 Credit Agreement.\nThis indebtedness could have the effect, among other things, of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions and increasing interest expense. The amount of cash required to pay interest on our increased indebtedness levels following completion of the acquisition, and thus the demands on our cash resources, will be greater than the amount of cash flows required to service our indebtedness prior to the transaction. The increased levels of indebtedness following completion of the acquisition could also reduce funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes and may create competitive disadvantages relative to other companies with lower debt levels. If we do not achieve the expected benefits and cost savings from the acquisition, or if the financial performance of the combined company does not meet current expectations, then our ability to service our indebtedness may be adversely impacted.\nCertain indebtedness to be incurred in connection with the acquisition may bear interest at variable interest rates. If interest rates increase, variable rate debt will create higher debt service requirements, which could adversely affect our cash flows.\nThe agreements that will govern the indebtedness to be incurred in connection with the acquisition may contain various affirmative and negative covenants that may, subject to certain customary exceptions, restrict our ability to, among other things, create liens over our property, incur additional indebtedness, enter into sale and lease-back transactions, make loans, advances or other investments, make non-ordinary course asset sales, declare or pay dividends or make other distributions with respect to equity interests, change the nature of our business, enter into certain agreements which restrict our ability to pay dividends or other distributions or create liens on our property, transact business with affiliates and/or merge or consolidate with any other person or sell or convey certain of its assets to another person. In addition, some of the agreements that govern the debt financing may contain financial covenants that will require us to maintain certain financial ratios. Our ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control. Failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could accelerate our repayment obligations.\nMoreover, we may be required to raise substantial additional financing to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate requirements. Our ability to arrange additional financing or refinancing will depend on, among other factors, our financial position and performance, as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond our control. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional financing or refinancing on terms acceptable to us or at all.\nVolatility in the financial markets may negatively impact our ability to access credit and the terms at which we would access such credit.\nAdverse conditions in the credit market may limit our ability to access credit at a time when we would like or need to do so. Our senior secured Notes mature on February 1, 2023. Our revolving credit facility under the 2016 Credit Agreement expires on July 1, 2023 (subject to earlier maturity of the revolving credit facility and tranche A term loan on August 1, 2022 if the Notes are not repaid or the maturity extended) when the outstanding balance of the revolving credit facility and the tranche A term loan will be due. Our tranche B term loans mature on May 17, 2026. Any limitation on the availability of funds or credit facilities could have an impact on our ability to refinance the maturing debt or react to changing economic and business conditions, which could adversely impact us.\nIn connection with the planned acquisition of eNett and Optal and contingent upon the closing of the acquisition, we expect to enter into the Committed Financing or an alternative financing to fund the acquisition. Volatility in the financial markets may impact the rates that we receive under that new facility.\nVolatility in the financial markets may negatively impact WEX Bank\u2019s ability to attract and retain deposits.\nAdverse conditions in the credit market may limit WEX Bank\u2019s ability to attract deposits at a time when it would like or need to do so. A significant credit rating downgrade, material capital market disruptions, significant withdrawals by depositors at WEX Bank, or adverse changes to its industrial bank charter could impact our ability to maintain adequate liquidity and impact our ability to provide competitive offerings to our customers. Any limitation on the availability of deposits could have an impact on our ability to fund our U.S. accounts receivable, which would adversely impact the Company.\nOur industrial bank subsidiary is subject to funding risks associated with its reliance on brokered deposits.\nUnder applicable regulations, if WEX Bank were no longer \u201cwell capitalized,\u201d it would not be able to accept brokered deposits without the approval of the FDIC. WEX Bank\u2019s inability to accept brokered deposits, or a loss of a significant amount of its brokered deposits, could adversely affect our liquidity. Additionally, such circumstances could require it to raise deposit rates in an attempt to attract new deposits, or to obtain funds through other sources at higher rates, which would adversely affect our results of operations.\nTo service our indebtedness, we will require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control.\nOur ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, and to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions and research and development efforts will depend on our ability to generate cash. This, to a certain extent, is subject to economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.\nWe have substantial indebtedness, and may incur additional indebtedness, which could lead to increased interest expense and could increase the amount of cash flows required to fund interest expense associated with our indebtedness. In addition, certain obligations under the 2016 Credit Agreement bear interest at variable interest rates. As of December 31, 2019, we maintained seven forward-fixed interest rate swap agreements, which are intended to fix the future interest payments associated with $1.44 billion of our variable-rate borrowings. These swap agreements expire at various points prior to the maturity of the 2016 Credit Agreement. Despite these derivative contracts, interest rate increases still could result in larger debt service requirements. Such an increase in our debt service obligations would adversely affect our cash flows. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations, that anticipated cost savings and operating improvements will be realized on schedule or at all, that future borrowings will be available to us under our 2016 Credit Agreement or any subsequent credit agreement, or that we can obtain alternative financing proceeds in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness, including the Notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs. We may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness, including the Notes, at or before maturity. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nThe debt service obligations under our 2016 Credit Agreement could also reduce funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes and may create competitive disadvantages relative to other companies with lower debt levels. As part of our continuing strategy, we also regularly evaluate potential acquisitions that could cause us to incur additional debt. If we do not achieve the expected benefits and cost savings from any such acquisitions, or if the financial performance of the combined companies does not meet expectations, then our ability to service our indebtedness may be adversely impacted.\nIn an environment of increasing interest rates, interest expense on the variable rate portion of our borrowings would increase and we may not be able to replace our maturing debt with new debt that carries the same interest rates. We may be adversely affected by significant changes in the brokered deposit market.\nOur industrial bank subsidiary, WEX Bank, uses collectively brokered deposits, including certificates of deposit and interest-bearing money-market deposits, to finance payments on behalf of our customers. Certificates of deposit carry fixed interest rates from issuance to maturity, which vary and are relatively short term in duration. The interest-bearing money market deposits carry variable rates. Upon maturity, the deposits will likely be replaced by issuing new deposits to the extent that they are needed. In a rising interest rate environment, WEX Bank would not be able to replace maturing deposits with deposits that carry the same or lower interest rates. Therefore, rising interest rates would result in reduced net income to the extent that certificates of deposit and interest-bearing money market deposits mature and are replaced. At December 31, 2019, WEX Bank had outstanding $836.0 million in certificates of deposit maturing within one year, $143.4 million in certificates of deposit maturing between one and five years, and $362.2 million in interest-bearing money market deposits, for an aggregate exposure of $1,341.6 million in brokered deposits at WEX Bank.\nAdditionally, under our 2016 Credit Agreement and Notes, we had $2,780.8 million of indebtedness outstanding at December 31, 2019, of which approximately 35% was at variable interest rates for which we have not entered into interest rate swap agreements to fix the future interest payments. An increase in interest rates would increase the cost of borrowing under our 2016 Credit Agreement.\nOur 2016 Credit Agreement uses LIBOR as a reference rate for our term loans and revolving credit facility, such that the interest due pursuant to such loans may be calculated using LIBOR (subject to a stated minimum value). On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to stop encouraging or compelling banks to submit rates for the calibration of LIBOR by the end of 2021. In June 2017, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee selected the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d), a new index calculated by reference to short-term repurchase agreements backed by Treasury securities, as its preferred replacement for U.S. dollar LIBOR. Whether or not SOFR attains market acceptance as a LIBOR replacement tool remains in question. As such, the future of LIBOR and the potential alternatives at this time is uncertain. If the method for calculation of LIBOR changes, if LIBOR is no longer available or if lenders have increased costs due to changes in LIBOR or changes in law, we may suffer from potential increases in interest rate costs on our floating debt rate and our hedging arrangements may not perform as expected. Further, we may need to renegotiate our 2016 Credit Agreement and the variable rate loans thereunder to replace the interest rate calculated by reference to LIBOR with an interest rate calculated by reference to a new standard that is established.\nOur business is subject to a wide variety of laws, rules, regulations and government policies under the Dodd-Frank Act, which may have a significant impact on our business, results of operation and financial condition.\nOn July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, or the Dodd-Frank Act, was enacted into law. Since enactment, the Dodd-Frank Act has generally resulted in increased government regulation\nand supervision, and when fully implemented, will, among other things, result in substantial changes in the regulation of derivatives and capital market activities. The ultimate impact of the Dodd-Frank Act is difficult to assess because many provisions are being phased in over time and because the current presidential administration has indicated it may make or propose changes to provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. In particular, the Dodd-Frank Act establishes federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market and entities that participate in that market. Derivatives regulations have added costs to our business, and any additional requirements, such as future registration requirements or increased regulation of derivative contracts, may add additional costs or may require us to change any fuel price, currency and interest rate hedging practices we may then use to comply with new regulatory requirements. Potential changes could also include clearing and execution methodology of our derivatives transactions. Presently, we cannot assess the capital or margin requirements which might apply to our over-the-counter transactions. Once implemented, these changes could result in increased transaction costs. In summary, the Dodd-Frank Act and any new regulations could increase the cost of derivative contracts or modify the way in which we conduct those transactions. Additionally, we are required to pay to the lenders under the 2016 Credit Agreement, any increased costs associated with the Dodd-Frank Act and other changes in laws, rules or regulations, subject to the terms of the 2016 Credit Agreement.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act also created the CFPB, to regulate the offering of consumer financial products or services under the federal consumer financial laws. The CFPB assumed rulemaking authority under the existing federal consumer financial protection laws, and enforces those laws against and examines certain non-depository institutions and insured depository institutions with total assets greater than $10 billion and their affiliates. In addition, the CFPB was granted general authority to prevent covered persons or service providers from committing or engaging in unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices under federal law in connection with any transaction with a consumer for a consumer financial product or service, or the offering of a consumer financial product or service. The CFPB also has broad rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws, which it has exercised as described in Item 1 under the heading \u201cOther Items - Regulation - United States - The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\u201d It is unclear what future regulatory changes may be promulgated by the CFPB and what effect, if any, such changes would have on our business and operations.\nAs required under the Dodd-Frank Act, the Government Accountability Office issued its study on the implications of any elimination of the exemption to the definition of \u201cbank\u201d for industrial banks under the Bank Holding Company Act. The study did not make a recommendation regarding the elimination of this exemption. However, if this exemption were eliminated without any grandfathering or accommodations for existing institutions, we could be required to become a bank holding company which could prompt us to either cease certain activities or divest WEX Bank.\nThe current U.S. Administration and Congress have signaled their intent to significantly or completely repeal the Dodd-Frank Act and the associated implementing regulations, and it is unclear what, if any, measures may be implemented to replace it. Accordingly, there may be an extended period of uncertainty and unpredictability regarding the provisions of federal law and regulations that affect our business and operations.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act and any related legislation or regulations, or any repeal or replacement of such legislation or regulations, may have a material impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The full impact of the Dodd-Frank Act will not be known until all of the regulations implementing the statute are adopted and implemented. However, compliance with these laws and regulations, including any subsequent repeals or amendments of them, may require us to make changes to our business, and, there is a significant possibility that the Dodd-Frank Act will, at a minimum, result in increased regulatory burden and compliance costs. We have invested significant management time and resources to address the various provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and the numerous regulations that are required to be issued under it, and may have to invest significant additional time, including to address any changed business environment resulting from a repeal or replacement of all or part of the Dodd Frank Act and any related legislation or regulation.\nDecreased demand for fuel and other vehicle products and services could harm our business and results of operations.\nDemand for fuel and other vehicle products and services may be reduced by factors that are beyond our control, such as the implementation of fuel efficiency standards and the development by vehicle manufacturers and adoption by our fleet customers of vehicles with greater fuel efficiency or alternative fuel sources. To the extent that our customers require less fuel, that decline in purchase volume could reduce our revenues, limiting our profitability and preventing us from taking on other initiatives.\nOur business is dependent on several key strategic relationships, the loss of which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nRevenue we received from services we provided to our top five customers and strategic relationships accounted for approximately 13 percent of our total revenues in 2019. Accordingly, we are dependent on maintaining our strategic relationships and our results of operations would be lower in the event that any of these relationships ceases to exist. Likewise, we have agreements with the major oil companies, fuel retailers and truck stop merchants whose locations accept our payment processing services. The termination of any of these agreements would reduce the number of locations where our payment processing services are accepted; therefore, we could lose our competitive advantage and our operating results could be adversely affected. While we regularly monitor these relationships, there can be no guarantee that we will be able to maintain them in the future.\nWe may never realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions we have completed or may undertake.\nWe have acquired and may attempt to acquire businesses, technologies, services, products or licenses in technologies that we believe are a strategic fit with our business. The process of integrating and operating any acquired business, technology, service or product may result in unforeseen redundancies, operating difficulties, and expenditures and may divert significant management attention from our ongoing business operations. As a result, we may incur a variety of costs in connection with acquisitions and may never realize the anticipated benefits.\nOur pending acquisition of eNett and Optal is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals. The failure to satisfy all of the required closing conditions could delay the completion of the acquisition for a significant period of time or prevent it from occurring. Any delay in completing the acquisition could cause us to not realize some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve in the transaction. If we are unable to complete the proposed acquisition, we may have incurred substantial expenses and diverted significant management time and resources from our ongoing business. In addition, if upon the satisfaction of the closing conditions and the expiration of a marketing period in connection with our debt financing, we fail to consummate the transaction (and in certain other limited circumstances), we may be required to pay eNett and Optal cash termination fees in the aggregate amount of $51.0 million.\nThere can be no assurance that the conditions to the closing of the acquisition will be satisfied or waived or that the acquisition of eNett and Optal will be completed. Even if we are able to successfully complete the acquisition of eNett and Optal, the size and complexity of the organization may result in delays in achieving anticipated or planned benefits, including those benefits relating to commercial strategies and financial advantages.\nWe are exposed to risks associated with operations outside of the United States, which could harm both our U.S. and international operations.\nWe conduct operations in North America, South America, Asia Pacific and Europe. As part of our business strategy and growth plan, we plan to further expand internationally. Expansion of our international operations could impose substantial burdens on our resources, divert management\u2019s attention from U.S. operations and otherwise harm our business. In addition, there are many barriers to competing successfully in the international market, including:\n\u2022\nfluctuation in foreign currencies;\n\u2022\nchanges in the relations between the United States and foreign countries;\n\u2022\nactions of foreign or United States governmental authorities affecting trade and foreign investment;\n\u2022\nincreased infrastructure costs including complex legal, tax, accounting and information technology laws and treaties;\n\u2022\ninterpretation and application of local laws and regulations including, among others, those impacting anti-money laundering, bribery, financial transaction reporting, privacy and positive balance or prepaid cards;\n\u2022\nenforceability of intellectual property and contract rights;\n\u2022\npotentially adverse tax consequences due to, but not limited to, the repatriation of cash and negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws\n\u2022\ncompetitive pressure on products and services from companies based outside the U.S. that can leverage lower costs of operations;\n\u2022\nthe United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the European Union (EU) (commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d) on January 31, 2020; and\n\u2022\nlocal labor conditions and regulations.\nWe cannot assure you that our investments outside the United States will produce desired levels of revenue or costs, or that one or more of the factors listed above will not harm our business.\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s departure from the EU, or Brexit, could adversely affect us.\nDuring June 2016, the U.K. held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the EU, commonly referred to as Brexit. On January 24, 2020, the U.K. Parliament approved a withdrawal agreement (the \u201cWithdrawal Agreement\u201d) between the U.K. and the EU. On January 31, 2020, the U.K. exited the European Union and under the Withdrawal Agreement, the U.K. is subject to an eleven-month transition period (the \u201cTransition Period\u201d) by which to leave the single market and customs union.\nThe uncertainty concerning the U.K.\u2019s legal, political and economic relationship with the EU after the Transition Period could contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets, including volatility in the value of the British Pound Sterling and Euro, which in turn could adversely affect us or our customers and companies that do business with us. Such uncertainties could also trigger a general deterioration in credit conditions, a downturn in consumer sentiment and overall negative economic growth. Any of these scenarios could have an adverse effect on our business or our customers.\nIf the U.K. and the EU are unable to negotiate acceptable trading and customs terms, barrier-free access between the U.K. and other EU member states could be diminished or eliminated. The long-term effects of Brexit will depend on any agreements (or lack thereof) between the U.K. and the EU and, in particular, any arrangements for the U.K. to retain access to EU markets after the Transition Period. Such a withdrawal from the EU is unprecedented, and it is unclear how the U.K.\u2019s access to the European single market for goods, capital, services and labor within the EU and the wider commercial, legal and regulatory environment, will impact our U.K. operations.\nIn addition, Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and increased complexity as national laws and regulations in the U.K. start to diverge from EU laws and regulations. In particular, depending on the terms of Brexit, we may face new regulatory costs and challenges, including the following:\n\u2022\nif we are unable to utilize appropriate authorizations and regulator permissions, our U.K. and EU-based operations could lose their ability to offer services on a cross-border basis into the U.K. market and for our U.K. based operations to offer services on a cross-border basis in the EU market;\n\u2022\nwe could be required to obtain additional regulatory permissions to operate in the U.K. and EU market, adding costs and potential inconsistency to our business (and, depending on the capacity of the U.K. authorities, the criteria for obtaining permission, and any possible transitional arrangements, there is a risk that our business in the U.K. could be materially affected or disrupted);\n\u2022\nwe could be required to comply with regulatory requirements in the U.K. that are in addition to, or inconsistent with, the regulatory requirements of the EU, leading to increased complexity and costs for our EU and U.K. operations; and\n\u2022\nour ability to attract and retain the necessary human resources in appropriate locations to support the U.K. business and the EU business could be adversely impacted.\nThese and other factors related to Brexit could, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nNew laws, regulations and enforcement activities could negatively impact our business and the markets we presently operate in or could limit our expansion opportunities.\nOur operations are subject to substantial regulation both domestically and internationally. There are often new regulatory efforts which could result in significant constraints and may impact our operations. These existing and emerging regulations can make the expansion of our business very difficult and negatively impact our revenue. Among the regulations that impact us or could impact us are those governing: interchange rates; interest rate and fee restrictions; credit access and disclosure requirements; collection and pricing requirements; compliance obligations; data security and data breach requirements; identity theft avoidance programs; health care mandates; the cost and scope of public and private health insurance coverage; and, anti-money laundering compliance programs. We also often must obtain permission from government regulators to conduct business in new locations or in connection with the transfer of licenses for businesses that we acquire. Changes to these regulations, including expansion of consumer-oriented regulation to business-to-business transactions, could negatively impact our operations, financial condition and results of operations and could further increase our compliance costs and limit our ability to expand to new markets.\nWe also conduct business with other highly regulated businesses such as banks, payment card issuers, and health insurance providers. These industries are subject to significant potential reforms that could negatively affect these businesses, their ability to maintain or expand their products and services, and the costs associated with doing so. These developments could also negatively impact our business.\nLaws or regulations developed in one jurisdiction or for one product could result in new laws or regulations in other jurisdictions or for other products.\nRegulators often monitor other approaches to the governance of the payment industry. As a result, a law or regulation enacted in one jurisdiction could result in similar developments in another. In addition, law and regulation involving one product could influence the extension of regulations to other product offerings.\nThe expansion of certain regulations could negatively impact our business in other geographies or for other products. Rules and regulations concerning interchange and business operations regulations, for example, may differ from country to country which adds complexity and expense to our operations.\nThese varying and increasingly complex regulations could limit our ability to globalize our products and could significantly and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRegulations and industry standards intended to protect or limit access to personal information could adversely affect our ability to effectively provide our services.\nGovernmental bodies in the United States and abroad have adopted, or are considering the adoption of, laws and regulations restricting the transfer of, and requiring safeguarding of, non-public personal information. For example, in the United States, all financial institutions must undertake certain steps to ensure the privacy and security of consumer financial information, and the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which became effective on January 1, 2020, imposes additional restriction on the collection, processing and disclosure of personally-identifiable data, including imposing increased penalties on data privacy incidents. In Europe, the adoption of General Data Protection Regulation (commonly referred to as GDPR) also requires additional privacy protections and extends the scope of the EU data protection laws to all companies processing data of EU residents, regardless of the company\u2019s location. In connection with providing services to our clients, we are required by regulations and arrangements with payment networks and certain clients to provide assurances regarding the confidentiality and security of non-public consumer information. These arrangements require periodic audits by independent companies regarding our compliance with industry standards such as payment card industry, or PCI, standards and also allow for similar audits regarding best practices established by regulatory guidelines. The compliance standards relate to our infrastructure and operational procedures designed to safeguard the confidentiality and security of non-public consumer personal information received from our customers. Our ability to maintain compliance with these standards and satisfy these audits will affect our ability to attract and maintain business in the future. If we fail to comply with these regulations, we could be exposed to suits for breach of contract or to governmental proceedings. In addition, our client relationships and reputation could be harmed, and we could be inhibited in our ability to obtain new clients. If more restrictive privacy laws or rules are adopted by authorities in the future on the federal or state level, our compliance costs may increase, our opportunities for growth may be curtailed by our compliance capabilities or reputational harm and our potential liability for security and data privacy breaches may increase, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in our tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our future results.\nWe are subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our global provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets or liabilities and in evaluating our tax positions on a worldwide basis. Our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation. Any of these changes could have a material adverse effect on our profitability. For example, the 2017 Tax Act enacted in December 2017 had a significant impact on our tax obligation and effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2017. We are also subject to the examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these examinations will not materially adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nWe urge our stockholders to consult with their legal and tax advisors with respect to this legislation and the potential tax consequences of investing in or holding our common stock.\nThe healthcare industry changes often and technology-enabled services used by consumers are relatively new and unproven.\nThe market for technology-enabled services for healthcare consumers changes rapidly and new products and services are consistently being introduced. Opportunities to gain market share are challenging due to the significant resources of our existing and potential competitors. It is uncertain whether or how fast this market will continue to grow. In order to remain competitive, we are continually involved in a number of projects to develop new services or compete with these new market entrants, including the development of mobile versions of our proprietary technology platform. These projects carry risks, such as cost overruns, delays in delivery, performance problems and lack of acceptance by our customers.\nBased on our experience, consumers are still learning about HSAs and other similar tax-advantaged healthcare savings arrangements. The willingness of consumers to increase their use of technology platforms to manage their healthcare saving and spending tax advantaged benefits will impact our operating results.\nWe may incur impairment charges on goodwill or other intangible assets.\nOur goodwill resides in multiple reporting units. The profitability of individual reporting units may suffer periodically from downturns in customer demand and other factors, the high level of competition existing within our industry, and the level of overall economic activity. Individual reporting units may be relatively more impacted by these factors than the Company as a whole. As a result, demand for the services of one or more of the reporting units could decline, which could adversely affect our operations and cash flow, and could result in an impairment of goodwill. Our reporting units are tested annually during the fourth fiscal quarter of each year, or on an interim basis if impairment indicators exist in order to determine whether their carrying value exceeds their fair value. We use a combination of discounted cash flow analyses and comparable company pricing multiples to determine the fair value of our reporting units and to determine the amount of any goodwill impairment. In addition, our definite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.\nIf we determine the fair value of the reporting units is less than their carrying value as a result of the annual or interim goodwill tests, or the carrying value of our definite-lived intangible asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flows generated from the use of the asset, an impairment loss may be recognized. Any such write-down would adversely affect our results of operations.\nWhile we currently believe that the fair value of our reporting units substantially exceeds carrying value and that our goodwill will contribute indefinitely to the cash flows of the Company, materially different assumptions regarding future performance of our reporting units and the weighted-average cost of capital used in the annual valuation could result in impairment losses. In addition, while we believe that the expected future cash flows to the Company resulting from the use of our definite-lived intangible assets far exceeds the carrying value of such assets, material changes in business strategy, customer attrition in excess of expectations, and technological obsolescence could result in impairment losses and/or an acceleration of amortization expense.\nIf our industrial bank subsidiary fails to meet certain criteria, we may become subject to regulation under the Bank Holding Company Act, which could force us to divest WEX Bank or cease all of our non-banking activities, which could have an adverse effect on our revenue and business or could create a default under our 2016 Credit Agreement.\nWEX Bank meets the criteria for exemption of an industrial bank from the definition of \u201cbank\u201d under the Bank Holding Company Act. WEX Bank\u2019s failure to qualify for this exemption would cause us to become subject to regulation under the Bank Holding Company Act. This would require us to divest WEX Bank or become a Bank Holding Company and to possibly cease certain non-banking activities which may be impermissible for a Bank Holding Company, and could create a default under our 2016 Credit Agreement. Failure to qualify for this exemption could thus have an adverse effect on our revenue and business.\nThe loss or suspension of the charter for our Utah industrial bank or changes in regulatory requirements could be disruptive to operations and increase costs.\nThe regulatory status of WEX Bank enables it to issue certificates of deposit, accept money market deposits and borrow on federal funds lines of credit from other banks. These funds are used to support our operations. WEX Bank operates under a uniform set of state lending laws, and its operations are subject to extensive state and federal regulation. WEX Bank, a Utah industrial bank incorporated in 1998, is an FDIC-insured depository institution. The bank\u2019s primary regulators are the Utah DFI and the FDIC. Continued licensing and federal deposit insurance are subject to ongoing satisfaction of compliance and safety and soundness requirements. If WEX Bank were to lose its bank charter, we would\neither outsource our credit support activities or perform these activities ourselves, which would subject us to the credit laws of each individual state in which we conduct business. Furthermore, we could not be a MasterCard and/or Visa issuer and would have to work with another financial institution to issue the product or sell the portfolio. Any such change would be disruptive to our operations and could result in significant incremental costs. In addition, changes in the bank regulatory environment, including the implementation of new or varying measures or interpretations by the State of Utah or the federal government, may significantly affect or restrict the manner in which we conduct business in the future or could create a default under our 2016 Credit Agreement.\nWe are subject to extensive supervision and regulation that could restrict our activities and impose financial requirements or limitations on the conduct of our business and limit our ability to generate income.\nWe are subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision, including that of the FDIC, the CFPB, and the Utah DFI. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors\u2019 funds, federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole, not shareholders or noteholders. These regulations affect our payment operations, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy and growth, among other things. Failure to comply with laws, regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, damages, civil money penalties or reputational damage, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. While we have policies and procedures designed to prevent any such violations, there can be no assurance that such violations will not occur. The U.S. Congress and federal regulatory agencies frequently revise banking and securities laws, regulations and policies. We cannot predict whether or in what form any other proposed regulations or statutes will be adopted or the extent to which our business may be affected by any new regulation or statute. Such changes could subject our business to additional costs, limit the types of financial services and products we may offer and increase the ability of non-banks to offer competing financial services and products, among other things.\nOur industrial bank subsidiary is subject to regulatory capital requirements that may require us to make capital contributions to this subsidiary, and that may restrict the ability of the subsidiary to make cash available to us.\nWEX Bank must maintain minimum amounts of regulatory capital. If WEX Bank does not meet these capital requirements, its regulators have broad discretion to institute a number of corrective actions that could have a direct material effect on our financial condition. WEX Bank, as an institution insured by the FDIC, must maintain certain capital ratios, paid-in capital minimums and adequate allowances for loan losses. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, we are also required to serve as a source of financial strength for WEX Bank. If WEX Bank were to fail to meet any of the capital requirements to which it is subject, or if required under Dodd-Frank\u2019s source of strength requirements, we may be forced to provide WEX Bank with additional capital, which could impair our ability to service our indebtedness or may not be permitted under the terms of our 2016 Credit Agreement or Notes. To pay any dividend, WEX Bank must maintain adequate capital above regulatory guidelines. Accordingly, WEX Bank may be unable to make any of its cash or other assets available to us, including to service our indebtedness.\nWe are subject to limitations on transactions with our industrial bank subsidiary, which may limit our ability to engage in transactions with and obtain credit from our industrial bank.\nSections 23A and 23B of the FRA and the implementing regulations limit the extent to which we can borrow or otherwise obtain credit from or engage in other \u201ccovered transactions\u201d with WEX Bank. \u201cCovered transactions\u201d include loans or extensions of credit, purchases of or investments in securities, purchases of assets, including assets subject to an agreement to repurchase, acceptance of securities as collateral for a loan or extension of credit, or the issuance of a guarantee, acceptance, or letter of credit. Although the applicable rules do not serve as an outright ban on engaging in \u201ccovered transactions,\u201d they do limit the amount of covered transactions WEX Bank may have with any one affiliate and with all affiliates in the aggregate. The applicable rules also require that we engage in such transactions with WEX Bank only on terms and under circumstances that are substantially the same, or at least as favorable to WEX Bank, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with nonaffiliated companies. Furthermore, with certain exceptions, each loan or extension of credit by WEX Bank to the Company or its other affiliates must be secured by collateral with a market value ranging from 100 percent to 130 percent of the amount of the loan or extension of credit, depending on the type of collateral. Accordingly, WEX Bank may be unable to provide credit or engage in transactions with us, including transactions intended to help us service our indebtedness.\nIf the technologies we use in operating our business and interacting with our customers fail, are unavailable, or do not operate to expectations, or we fail to successfully implement technology strategies and capabilities in connection with our outsourcing arrangements, our business and results of operation could be adversely impacted.\nWe utilize a combination of proprietary and third-party technologies, including third-party owned and operated \u201ccloud\u201d technologies or third-party managed technology platforms and processing systems, to conduct our business and\ninteract with our customers, partners and suppliers, among others. This includes technology that we have developed, have contracted with others to develop, have outsourced to a single provider to operate or have obtained through third-parties by way of service agreements. To the extent that our proprietary technology or a third-party providers\u2019 technology does not work as agreed to or as expected, or if we experience outages or unavailability resulting from their operations and the services they provide to us, our ability to efficiently and effectively deliver services could be adversely impacted and our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. Similarly, any failure by our customers or partners to access the technology that we develop internally could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Although we make substantial investments in technology, there is no guarantee that it will function as intended once it is placed into operation. Lastly, given our reliance on technology, we regularly assess our technology plans, including both platforms and technology infrastructure. To the extent that we conclude that certain technologies should be retired, that existing platforms should be consolidated, or that we should change our technology strategies, we may be required to impair or accelerate depreciation on certain assets. Any of these potential changes or failures in our technology strategies may also divert management\u2019s attention and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur business is regularly subject to cyberattacks and attempted security and privacy breaches and we may not be able to adequately protect our information systems, including the data we collect about our customers, which could subject us to liability and damage our reputation.\nWe collect and store data about our customers and their fleets, including bank account information and spending data. Our customers expect us to keep this information in our confidence. In certain instances, the information we collect includes social security numbers. As a result of applicable laws, we are required to take commercially reasonable measures to prevent and mitigate the impact of cyberattacks, as well as the unauthorized access, acquisition, release and use of \u201cpersonally identifiable information,\u201d such as social security numbers. While social security numbers constitute a very small part of the data we keep, in the event of a security breach we would be required to determine the types of information compromised and determine corrective actions and next steps under applicable laws, which would require us to expend capital and other resources to address the security breach and protect against future breaches. An increasing number of organizations, including large on-line and off-line merchants and businesses, large Internet companies, financial institutions, and government institutions, have disclosed breaches of their information security systems, some of which have involved sophisticated and highly targeted attacks, including on portions of their websites or infrastructure. Like those companies, we too, are subject to regular and repeated attempts to breach our information security protections.\nAs outsourcing, specialization of functions, third-party digital services and technology innovation within the payments industry increase (including with respect to mobile technologies, tokenization, big data and cloud storage solutions), more third parties are involved in processing card transactions and there is a risk the confidentiality, integrity, privacy and/or security of data held by, or accessible to, third parties, including merchants that accept our cards, payment processors and our business partners, may be compromised, which could lead to unauthorized transactions on our cards and costs associated with responding to such an incident. In addition, high profile data breaches could change consumer behaviors, impact our ability to access data to make product offers and credit decisions and result in legislation and additional regulatory requirements.\nThe techniques used in attempts to obtain unauthorized, improper or illegal access to our systems, our data or our customers\u2019 data, to degrade service, or to sabotage our systems are constantly evolving, are difficult to detect quickly, and may not be recognized until after a successful penetration of our information security systems. Unauthorized parties attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities through various means, including, among others, targeting our systems or facilities or our third-party vendors or customers, or attempting to fraudulently induce our employees, partners, customers or others into disclosing user names, passwords, payment card information, or other sensitive information, which may in turn be used to access our information technology systems. Certain efforts may be state-sponsored and supported by significant financial and technological resources, making them even more difficult to detect. Like many companies, we are a target for such breaches and attacks. Although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect our data and customer data and to prevent data loss and other security breaches, and will continue to expend significant additional resources to bolster these protections, these security measures cannot provide absolute security. Our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to successful cyberattacks or security breaches, and third parties may be able to access our customers\u2019 personal or proprietary information and data that are stored on or accessible through those systems.\nOur security measures may also be breached due to employee error, malfeasance, system errors or vulnerabilities, or other irregularities. Any actual or perceived breach of our security could interrupt our operations; result in our systems or services being unavailable; result in improper disclosure of data; materially harm our reputation and brand; result in significant legal and financial exposure; lead to loss of customer confidence in, or decreased use of, our products and\nservices; and, adversely affect our business and results of operations. Any breaches of network or data security at our partners, some of whom maintain information about our customers, or breaches of our customers\u2019 systems could have similar effects. In addition, our customers could have vulnerabilities on their own computer systems that are entirely unrelated to our systems, but could mistakenly attribute their own vulnerabilities to us. While we take commercially appropriate steps to safeguard data used by and contained on the systems of our partners, customers and vendors, we cannot control all access to those systems and they are therefore subject to potential cyberattacks and fraud.\nFurthermore, as we have increased the number of platforms as well as the size of our networks and information systems, our reliance on these technologies have become increasingly important to our operating activities. The potential negative impact that a platform, network or information system shutdown may have on our operating activities has increased. Shutdowns may be caused by cyberattacks and unexpected catastrophic events such as natural disasters or other unforeseen events, such as software or hardware defects or cyber-attacks by groups or individuals.\nUnder the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999, also referred to as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act or GLBA, and some state laws, we and WEX Bank are required to maintain a comprehensive written information security program that includes administrative, technical and physical safeguards relating to consumer information. This requirement generally does not extend to information about companies or about individuals who obtain financial products or services for business, commercial, or agricultural purposes.\nThe GLBA also requires us and WEX Bank to provide initial and annual privacy notices to customers that describe in general terms our information sharing practices. If we or WEX Bank intend to share nonpublic personal information about consumers with affiliates and/or nonaffiliated third parties, we and WEX Bank must provide customers with a notice and a reasonable period of time for each customer to \u201copt out\u201d of any such disclosure. In addition to U.S. federal privacy laws with which we must comply, states also have adopted statutes, regulations and other measures governing the collection and distribution of nonpublic personal information about customers. In some cases, these state measures are preempted by federal law, but if not, we and WEX Bank must monitor and seek to comply with individual state privacy laws in the conduct of our businesses.\nWhen we handle individually identifiable health information, regulations issued under Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH Act, our contracts with our customers, and supplemental state laws require us to implement privacy and data security measures and to comply with breach notification requirements. We may be subject to contractual damages and civil or criminal penalties if we are found to violate these privacy, security and breach notification requirements.\nOur efforts to comply with existing and future health and financial data laws and regulations, both in the U.S. and abroad, is costly and time-consuming. Incidents involving our handling of this protected and sensitive information may consume significant financial and managerial resources and may damage our reputation, which may discourage customers from using, renewing, or expanding their use of our services.\nAny security breach, inadvertent transmission of information about our customers, failure to comply with applicable breach notification and reporting requirements, or any violation of international, federal or state privacy laws could expose us to liability in excess of any applicable insurance policies, litigation, regulatory scrutiny, and/or cause damage to our reputation. We may also be required to expend significant resources to implement additional data protection measures or to modify the features and functionality of our system offerings in a way that is less attractive to customers.\nOur failure to effectively implement new technology could jeopardize our position as a leader in our industry.\nAs a provider of information management and payment processing services, we must constantly adapt and respond to the technological advances offered by our competitors and the informational requirements of our customers, including those related to the Internet, in order to maintain and improve upon our competitive position. We may not be able to expand our technological capabilities and service offerings as rapidly as our competitors, which could jeopardize our position as a leader in our industry.\nWe are dependent on technology systems and electronic communications networks managed by third parties, which could result in our inability to prevent service disruptions.\nOur ability to process and authorize transactions electronically depends on our ability to electronically communicate with our fuel and vehicle maintenance providers through point-of-sale devices and electronic networks that are owned and operated by third parties. The electronic communications networks upon which we depend are often subject to disruptions of various magnitudes and durations. Any severe disruption of one or more of these networks could impair our ability to authorize transactions or collect information about such transactions, which, in turn, could harm our reputation for\ndependable service and adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, our ability to collect enhanced data relating to our customers\u2019 purchases may be limited by the use of older point-of-sale devices by fuel and vehicle maintenance providers. To the extent that fuel and vehicle maintenance providers within our network are slow to adopt advanced point-of-sale devices, we may not be able to offer the latest services and capabilities that our customers demand.\nUnpredictable events, including natural catastrophes or public health crises, dangerous weather conditions, technology failure, and terrorist attacks in the locations in which we or our customers operate may adversely affect our ability to conduct business and could impact our results.\nTerrorist attacks, power failure, natural disaster (such as the 2019 Australian bushfire crisis) and rapid spread of infectious disease (such as the 2019 novel coronavirus) could interrupt our operations by causing disruptions in global markets, economic conditions and travel and tourism, and triggering large-scale technology failures or delays. Events such as these, if continuing or significant, could impact our operations, financial results and profitability.\nOur industry continues to become increasingly competitive, which makes it more challenging for us to maintain profit margins at historical levels.\nWe face and expect to continue to face competition in each category of the overall industry from several companies that seek to offer competing capabilities and services. Historically, we have been able to provide customers with a wide spectrum of services and capabilities and, therefore, we have not considered price to be the exclusive or even the primary basis on which we compete. As our competitors have continued to develop their service offerings, it has become increasingly more challenging for us to compete solely on the basis of superior capabilities, technology, customer integration or service. In some areas of our business we have been forced to respond to competitive pressures by reducing our fees. We have seen erosion of our historical profit margins as we encourage existing strategic relationships to sign long-term contracts. If these trends continue and if competition intensifies, our profitability may be adversely impacted.\nWhile we have traditionally offered our services to several categories of the payments industry, with a focus on fleet, corporate payments and health in recent years, some of our competitors have successfully garnered significant share in particular categories of payments. To the extent that our competitors are regarded as leaders in specific categories, they may have an advantage over us as we attempt to further penetrate these categories.\nWe also face increased competition in our efforts to enter into new strategic relationships and renew existing strategic relationships on similar terms.\nCompliance with anti-money laundering laws and regulations creates additional compliance costs and reputational risk.\nWe must monitor and report unusual or suspicious account activity, as well as transactions involving amounts in excess of prescribed limits, as required by the Bank Secrecy Act and Internal Revenue Service regulations and other regulations. The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 imposes significant anti-money laundering compliance and due diligence obligations on financial institutions, including WEX Bank. Financial regulators have issued various implementing regulations and have made enforcement a top priority. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, or to comply with all of the relevant laws or regulations, could result in the imposition of fines or penalties and other serious legal and reputational consequences which may impact our financial results.\nEvolution and expansion of our business may subject us to additional regulatory requirements and other risks, for which failure to comply or adapt could harm our operating results.\nThe evolution and expansion of our business may subject us to additional risks and regulatory requirements, including laws governing money transmission and payment processing services. These requirements vary throughout the markets in which we operate, and have increased over time as the geographic scope and complexity of our payments product services have expanded. While we maintain a compliance program focused on applicable laws and regulations throughout the payments industry, there is no guarantee that we will not be subject to fines, criminal and civil lawsuits or other regulatory enforcement actions in one or more jurisdictions, or be required to adjust business practices to accommodate future regulatory requirements.\nIn order to maintain flexibility in the growth and expansion of our payments operations, we have registered as a money service business with FinCEN and have obtained money transmitter licenses (or their equivalents) in most states and expect to continue the license application process in additional jurisdictions throughout the United States as needed to\naccommodate new product development. Our efforts to acquire and maintain these licenses could result in significant management time, effort, and cost, and may still not guarantee compliance given the constant state of change in these regulatory frameworks. Accordingly, costs associated with changes in compliance requirements, regulatory audits, enforcement actions, reputational harm, or other regulatory limits on our ability to grow our payment processing business could adversely affect our financial results.\nOur increased presence in foreign jurisdictions increases the possibility of foreign law violations or violation of the FCPA, the United Kingdom Bribery Act of 2010 (\u201cUKBA\u201d) and the Brazilian Anti-Corruption Law (\u201cACL\u201d).\nWe are subject to the FCPA, the ACL and the UKBA, as we own subsidiaries organized under UK and Brazilian law, which serve as a holding companies for other subsidiaries. The FCPA generally prohibits U.S. companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. The UKBA is broader in its reach and prohibits bribery in purely commercial contexts in addition to bribery of government officials, and it does not allow certain exceptions that are permitted by the FCPA. Other countries in which we operate or have operated, including Brazil and other countries where we intend to operate, also have anti-corruption laws, which we are, have been or will be subject to.\nOur employees and agents interact with government officials on our behalf, including as necessary to obtain licenses and other regulatory approvals necessary to operate our business. We also have a number of contracts with third-parties that are owned or controlled by foreign governments. These interactions and contracts create a risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of our employees or agents that could be in violation of the FCPA, UKBA, ACL or other similar laws, we could be held liable for such unauthorized actions taken by our employees or agents.\nIn recent years, there have been significant regulatory reviews and actions taken by the United States and other regulators related to anti-bribery laws, and the trend appears to be greater scrutiny on payments to, and relationships with, foreign entities and individuals.\nAlthough we have policies and procedures designed to ensure that we, our employees, agents and intermediaries comply with the FCPA, ACL and UKBA, such policies or procedures may not work effectively all of the time or protect us against liability for actions taken by our employees, agents and intermediaries with respect to our business or any businesses that we may acquire. In the event that we believe, or have reason to believe, that our employees, agents or intermediaries have or may have violated applicable anti-corruption laws, we may be required to investigate or have a third party investigate the relevant facts and circumstances, which can be expensive and require significant time and attention from senior management. Our continued operation and expansion outside the United States could increase the risk of such violations in the future. Any violation of the FCPA, the UKBA or similar laws and regulations, including the ACL, could result in significant expenses, divert management attention, and otherwise have a negative impact on us. Any determination that we have violated the FCPA, UKBA, ACL or laws of any other jurisdiction could subject us to, among other things, penalties and legal expenses that could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation. The possibility of violations of the FCPA, UKBA, ACL or similar laws or regulations may increase as we expand globally and into countries with recognized corruption problems.\nThe failure to maintain effective systems of internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures could result in the inability to accurately report our financial results or prevent material misstatement due to fraud, which could cause current and potential shareholders to lose confidence in our financial reporting, adversely affect the trading price of our securities, harm our operating results, trigger a default under the 2016 Credit Agreement or result in regulatory proceedings against us.\nEffective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud and operate successfully as a public company. The failure to develop or maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures could harm our reputation or operating results, or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, or trigger a default under the 2016 Credit Agreement.\nOur financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures are reliant, in part, on information we receive from disparate internal financial reporting systems and third parties that supply information to us regarding transactions that we process. In addition, because our strategy includes pursuing growth through acquisitions of other businesses, which are at different levels of maturity and which may have underdeveloped financial reporting systems and processes, we depend on dispersed financial systems to process, summarize and report financial transactions for our distributed operations. To the extent these systems do not properly transmit information to our financial ledgers, we could fail to properly summarize and report financial results.\nAs we expand our business operations domestically and internationally, and as we implement new accounting standards promulgated by the FASB, we will need to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. If we are unable to do so, our external auditors could issue a qualified opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.\nIneffective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our securities or affect our ability to access the capital markets and could result in regulatory proceedings against us by, among others, the SEC. Currently, we are cooperating with an SEC investigation arising from the revision of our financial statements in 2019 due to issues involving our Brazil subsidiary, including our financial and disclosure controls and procedures. At this time, it is not possible to predict the outcome of the SEC\u2019s inquiry, including whether or not any proceeding will be initiated or, if so, when or how the matter will be resolved.\nMaterial weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting have in the past and could in the future lead to deficiencies in the preparation of financial statements. Deficiencies in the preparation of financial statements, could lead to litigation claims against us. The defense of any such claims may cause the diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, and we may be required to pay damages if any such claims or proceedings are not resolved in our favor. Any litigation, even if resolved in our favor, could cause us to incur significant legal and other expenses. Such events could also affect our ability to raise capital to fund future business initiatives.\nOur ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical to our success and the failure to do so may materially adversely affect our performance.\nWe believe our employees, including our executive management team, are our most important resource and, in our industry and geographic area, competition for qualified personnel is intense. If we were unable to retain and attract qualified employees, our performance could be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nIf any entity controls 10 percent or more of our common stock and such entity has caused a violation of applicable banking laws by its failure to obtain any required approvals prior to acquiring that common stock, we have the power to, and may be required to, restrict such entity\u2019s ability to vote shares held by it.\nAs owners of a Utah industrial bank, we are subject to Utah banking regulations that require any entity that controls 10 percent or more of our common stock to obtain the prior approval of Utah banking authorities. Federal law also prohibits a person or group of persons from acquiring \u201ccontrol\u201d of us unless the FDIC has been notified and has not objected to the transaction. Under the FDIC\u2019s regulations, the acquisition of 10 percent or more of a class of our voting stock would generally create a rebuttable presumption of control. In addition, our certificate of incorporation requires that if any stockholder fails to provide us with satisfactory evidence that any required approvals have been obtained, we may, or will if required by state or federal regulators, restrict such stockholder\u2019s ability to vote such shares with respect to any matter subject to a vote of our stockholders.\nAs a result of these regulatory requirements, certain existing and potential stockholders may choose not to invest or invest more in our stock. This could limit the number of potential investors and impact our ability to attract further funds.\nProvisions in our charter documents, Delaware law and applicable banking law may delay or prevent our acquisition by a third party.\nOur certificate of incorporation and by-laws contain several provisions that may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us without the approval of our board of directors. These provisions include, among other things, a classified board of directors, the elimination of stockholder action by written consent, advance notice for raising business or making nominations at meetings of stockholders and \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock. Blank check preferred stock enables our board of directors, without stockholder approval, to designate and issue additional series of preferred stock with such special dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights, including the right to issue convertible securities with no limitations on conversion, and rights to dividends and proceeds in a liquidation that are senior to the common stock, as our board of directors may determine. These provisions may make it more difficult or expensive for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting common stock. We also are subject to certain provisions of Delaware law, which could delay, deter or prevent us from entering into an acquisition, including Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder unless specific conditions are met. These provisions also may delay, prevent or deter a merger, acquisition, tender offer, proxy contest or\nother transaction that might otherwise result in our stockholders receiving a premium over the market price for their common stock.\nIn addition, because we own a Utah industrial bank, any purchaser of our common stock who would own 10 percent or more of our common stock after such purchase would be required to obtain the consent of Utah banking authorities and the federal banking authorities prior to consummating any such acquisition. These regulatory requirements may preclude or delay the purchase of a relatively large ownership stake by potential investors.", "PERMNO": 90569, "SIC": 7374, "TIC": "WEX"}
