{"cik": "1031203", "company": "GROUP 1 AUTOMOTIVE INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-23", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following risks have had or in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nMarket and Industry Risks\nAvailability and demand for and pricing of our products and services may be adversely impacted by economic conditions and other factors.\nThe automotive retail industry, and especially new vehicle unit sales, is influenced by general economic conditions, particularly consumer confidence, the level of personal discretionary spending, interest rates, exchange rates, fuel prices, technology and business model changes, supply conditions, consumer transportation preferences, unemployment rates and credit availability. Consumer spending can be materially and adversely impacted by periods of economic uncertainty or by consumer concern about manufacturer viability. Since the first quarter of 2020, there has been a worldwide impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. Global trade conditions and consumer trends that originated during the pandemic continue to persist and may also have long-lasting adverse impacts on us and our industry, independently of the progress of the pandemic. For example, pandemic-related issues have exacerbated port congestion and caused intermittent supplier shutdowns and delays.\nIncreased demand for personal electronics has created a shortfall of semiconductor chips, which in turn, has also adversely impacted production of new vehicles, parts and other supplies, thereby reducing new vehicle inventories, increasing new vehicle prices and limiting the availability of replacement parts. Under these conditions, automotive dealer profits have increased sharply as new vehicle prices and margins have more than offset the effects of lower new vehicle volume. At such time that semi-conductor chip shortages are resolved, vehicle production may increase, and new vehicle prices could decrease thereby resulting in reduced profitability at our dealerships.\nA significant portion of our vehicles purchased by customers are financed. Tightening of the credit markets, increases in interest rates and credit conditions may decrease the availability or increase the costs of automotive loans and leases and adversely impact our new and used vehicle sales and margins. In particular, if sub-prime finance companies apply higher credit standards or if there is a decline in the overall availability of credit in the sub-prime lending market, the ability of consumers to purchase vehicles could be limited, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIn addition, local economic, competitive and other conditions affect the performance of our dealerships. Our results of operations depend substantially on general economic conditions and spending habits in those regions of the U.S. where we maintain most of our operations.\nDeterioration in market conditions or changes in our credit profile could adversely affect our operations and financial condition.\nWe rely on the positive cash flow we generate from our operations and our access to the credit and capital markets to fund our operations, growth strategy, and return of cash to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Changes in the credit and capital markets, including market disruptions, limited liquidity and interest rate fluctuations, may increase the cost of financing or restrict our access to these potential sources of future liquidity. Our continued access to liquidity sources on favorable terms depends on multiple factors, including our operating performance and credit ratings. Our debt securities currently are rated just below investment-grade and a downgrade of this rating likely would negatively impact our access to the debt capital markets and increase our cost of borrowing. As a result, disruptions in the debt markets or any downgrade of our credit ratings could adversely affect our operations and financial condition and our ability to return cash to our shareholders. We can make no assurances that our ability to obtain additional financing through the debt markets will not be adversely affected by economic conditions or that we will be able to maintain or improve our current credit ratings.\nThe majority of our floorplan notes payable, mortgages and other debt are benchmarked to SOFR, which can be highly volatile as a result of changing economic conditions. Although we utilize derivative instruments to partially mitigate our exposure to interest rate fluctuations, significant increases in SOFR or other variable interest rates could have a material adverse impact on our interest expense due to the significance of our debt and floorplan balances. In February 2022, the U.S. Federal Reserve announced it expects to increase interest rates in 2022. Refer to Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk for additional analysis regarding our interest rate sensitivity.\nWe may fail to meet analyst and investor expectations, which could cause the price of our stock to decline.\nOur common stock is traded publicly, and various securities analysts follow our financial results and frequently issue reports on us which include information about our historical financial results as well as their estimates of our future performance. These estimates are based on their own opinions and are often different from management\u2019s estimates or expectations of our business. If our operating results are below the estimates or expectations of public market analysts and expectations of our investors, our stock price could decline.\nWe are subject to risks associated with our dependence on manufacturer business relationships and agreements.\nThe success of our dealerships is dependent on vehicle manufacturers whom we rely exclusively on for our new vehicle inventory. Our ability to sell new vehicles is dependent on a vehicle manufacturer\u2019s ability to produce and allocate to our dealerships an attractive, high quality and desirable product mix at the right time in order to satisfy customer demand.\nManufacturers generally support their franchisees by providing direct financial assistance in various areas, including, among others, incentives, floorplan assistance and advertising assistance. A discontinuation or change in our manufacturers\u2019 warranty and incentive programs could adversely affect our business. Manufacturers also provide product warranties and, in some cases, service contracts to customers. Our dealerships perform warranty and service contract work for vehicles under manufacturer product warranties and service contracts and we bill the manufacturer directly as opposed to invoicing the customer. In addition, we rely on manufacturers for various financing programs, OEM replacement parts, training, up-to-date product design, development of advertising materials and programs and other items necessary for the success of our dealerships.\nVehicle manufacturers may be adversely impacted by economic downturns or recessions, significant declines in the sales of their new vehicles, increases in interest rates, adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates, declines in their credit ratings, reductions in access to capital or credit, labor strikes or similar disruptions (including within their major suppliers), supply shortages, rising raw material costs, rising employee benefit costs, adverse publicity that may reduce consumer demand for their products, including due to bankruptcy, product defects, litigation, ability to keep up with technology and business model changes, poor product mix or unappealing vehicle design, governmental laws and regulations, natural disasters or other adverse events. In particular, all our OEMs are investing material amounts to develop electric and autonomous vehicles. These investments could cause financial strain on our OEMs or fail to deliver attractive vehicles for customers which could lead to adverse impacts on our business. The OEMs are also impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic\u2019s impact on the economy, factory production, parts shortages, including semiconductor chips, and other disruptions. These and other risks could materially adversely affect the financial condition of any manufacturer and impact its ability to profitably design, market, produce or distribute new vehicles, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, vehicle manufacturers were producing and delivering fewer vehicles to our dealerships due to a global semiconductor chip shortage. The semiconductor chip shortage is impacting the automobile industry\u2019s new vehicle production, which, in turn, has decreased our new vehicle inventory. Our new vehicle days\u2019 supply of inventory was approximately 12 days for the quarter ended December 31, 2021, as compared 53 days for the quarter ended December 31, 2020. If new vehicle days\u2019 supply of inventory continues to decline, it will impact our ability to satisfy customer demand. It is impossible to predict with certainty the duration of the semiconductor chip shortage or when normalized production will resume at these manufacturers. If our manufacturers\u2019 production remains at current reduced levels or continues to decline, diminishing our ability to meet the immediate needs of our customers, the semiconductor chip shortage could have a material and adverse impact on our financial and operating results.\nAdditionally, many U.S. manufacturers of vehicles, parts and supplies are dependent on imported products and raw materials in their production. Any significant increase in existing tariffs on such goods and raw materials, or implementation of new tariffs, could adversely affect our profits on the vehicles we sell.\nIf we are unable to enter into new franchise agreements with manufacturers in connection with dealership acquisitions or maintain or renew our existing franchise agreements on favorable terms, our operations may be significantly impaired.\nWe are dependent on our relationships with manufacturers, which exercise a great degree of influence over our operations through the franchise agreements. Our franchise agreements may be terminated or not renewed by the manufacturer for a variety of reasons, including any unapproved changes of ownership or management, sales and customer satisfaction performance deficiencies and other material breaches of the franchise agreements. Manufacturers may also have a right of first refusal if we seek to sell dealerships. Additionally, we cannot guarantee that the terms of any renewals will be as favorable to us as our current agreements. If such an instance occurs, although we are generally protected by automotive dealership franchise laws requiring \u201cgood cause\u201d be shown for such termination, we cannot guarantee that the termination of the franchise will not be successful.\nA manufacturer may also limit the number of its dealerships that we may own or the number that we may own in a particular geographic area. Delays in obtaining, or failing to obtain, manufacturer approvals and franchise agreements for dealership acquisitions could adversely affect our acquisition program. From time to time, we have not met all of the manufacturers\u2019 requirements to make acquisitions and have received requests to dispose of certain of our dealerships. In the event one or more of our manufacturers sought to prohibit future acquisitions, or imposed requirements to dispose of one or more of our dealerships, our acquisition and growth strategy could be adversely affected. Moreover, our franchise agreements do not give us the exclusive right to sell a manufacturer\u2019s product within a given geographic area. Subject to state laws in the U.S. that are generally designed to protect dealers, a manufacturer may grant another dealer a franchise to start a new dealership near one of our locations, or an existing dealership may move its dealership to a location that would more directly compete against us. The location of new dealerships near our existing dealerships could have a material and adverse effect on our operations and reduce the profitability of our existing dealerships. Furthermore, if current manufacturers or future manufacturers are not required to conduct their business in accordance with state franchise laws and thereby circumvent the current dealer-network to sell directly to the customer, our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nSubstantial competition in automotive sales and services could adversely impact our sales and our margins.\nThe automotive retail industry is highly competitive. Within our markets we are subject to competition from franchised automotive dealerships and other businesses as it relates to new and used vehicles, parts and service as well as acquisitions. The internet has become a significant part of the advertising and sales process in our industry. Customers are using the internet to shop, and compare prices for new and used vehicles, automotive repair and maintenance services, finance and insurance products and other automotive products. If we are unable to effectively use the internet to attract customers to our own online channels, such as our AcceleRide\u00ae platform, and mobile applications, and, in turn, to our stores, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. Additionally, the growing use of social media by consumers increases the speed and extent that information and opinions can be shared, and negative posts or comments on social media about us or any of our dealerships could damage our reputation and brand names, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe also face competition in arranging financing for our customers\u2019 vehicle purchases from a broad range of financial institutions. Additionally, we do not have any cost advantage in purchasing new vehicles from vehicle manufacturers, and our franchise agreements do not grant us the exclusive right to sell a manufacturer\u2019s product within a given geographic area. Increased competition can adversely impact our sales volumes and margins as well as our ability to acquire dealerships.\nPlease see Item 1. Business - Competition for further discussion of competition in our industry.\nChanges in consumer demand towards fuel efficient vehicles and EVs, and resulting shifts by manufacturers to meet demand, could adversely affect our new and used vehicle sales volumes, parts and service revenues and our results of operations.\nVolatile fuel prices have affected and may continue to affect consumer preferences in connection with the purchase of our vehicles. Rising fuel prices result in consumers less likely to purchase larger, more expensive vehicles, such as sports utility vehicles or luxury automobiles, and more likely to purchase smaller, less expensive and more fuel efficient vehicles. Conversely, lower fuel prices could have the opposite effect. Sudden changes in customer preferences make maintenance of an optimal mix of large and small vehicle inventory a challenge. Further increases or sharp declines in fuel prices could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nChanges in fuel prices, government support, improvements in EVs and more EV options have increased the customer demand for more fuel efficient vehicles and EVs. With a potential increase in demand by consumers for electric-powered vehicles, and government support such as the August 2021 executive order from the Biden Administration aiming to increase electric-powered vehicle sales by 2030, manufacturers have also announced increased production focus on the manufacture of fuel efficient vehicles and EVs. As more EVs potentially enter the market, and internal combustion or diesel engine vehicle production is reduced, it may be necessary to adapt to such changes by selling and servicing these units effectively in order to meet consumer demands and support the profitability of our dealerships. If maintenance costs of electric-powered vehicles were to substantially decrease, this could have a material adverse effect on our parts and service revenues. If consumer demand increases for fuel efficient vehicles or EVs and our manufacturers are not able to adapt and produce vehicles that meet the customer demands or we are unable to align with the manufacturers of these vehicles, such events could adversely affect our new and used vehicle sales volumes, parts and service revenue and our results of operations.\nWe are subject to risks resulting from the planned divestiture of our Brazilian operations which could result in an adverse impact to our operations, financial condition and business.\nWe are subject to a number of risks associated with the Brazil Disposal, including risks associated with our failure to realize the full purchase price anticipated under the Brazil Agreement as a result of amounts held in escrow for potential unforeseen indemnification obligations arising under the Brazil Agreement for breach of representations, warranties and covenants. In addition, the purchase price is denominated in BRL, which is subject to foreign currency exchange risk. In order to partially mitigate this risk, we entered into a foreign currency derivative for the conversion of BRL to USD in the form of a costless collar which protects us from significant downside exposure for $70.0 million of the expected purchase consideration.\nShould the Brazil Disposal not be successful and we are unable to divest ourselves of the Brazilian operations, we are subject to risks, including but not limited to:\n\u2022the inability to locate another buyer on the same terms;\n\u2022risks associated with the continued operation of the Brazilian business;\n\u2022impairment of relationships with employees, manufacturers and customers; and\n\u2022diversion of management time and other resources from continuing operations.\nFor more information relating to the Brazil Disposal, please see Item 1. Business of this Form 10-K.\nOur inability to acquire and integrate successful new dealerships into our business could adversely affect the growth of our revenues and earnings.\nGrowth in our revenues and earnings partially depends on our ability to acquire new dealerships and successfully integrate those dealerships into our existing operations. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to identify and acquire dealerships in the future. In addition, we cannot guarantee that any acquisitions will be successful or on terms and conditions consistent with past acquisitions. Restrictions by our manufacturers, as well as covenants contained in our debt instruments, may directly or indirectly limit our ability to acquire additional dealerships. In addition, increased competition for acquisitions may develop, which could result in fewer acquisition opportunities available to us and/or higher acquisition prices and, some of our competitors may have greater financial resources than us.\nIn addition, managing and integrating additional dealerships into our existing mix of dealerships may result in substantial costs, diversion of our management\u2019s attention, delays or other operational or financial problems. Acquisitions involve a number of special risks, including, among other things:\n\u2022incurring significantly higher capital expenditures and operating expenses;\n\u2022failing to integrate the operations and personnel of the acquired dealerships;\n\u2022entering new markets with which we are not familiar;\n\u2022incurring undiscovered liabilities at acquired dealerships, generally, in the case of stock acquisitions;\n\u2022disrupting our ongoing business;\n\u2022failing to retain key personnel of the acquired dealerships;\n\u2022impairing relationships with employees, manufacturers and customers; and\n\u2022incorrectly valuing acquired entities.\nIn particular, as a result of the consummation of the Prime Acquisition in November 2021, we now have a significantly larger business and more assets and employees than we did prior to the transaction. The integration process requires us to expend significant capital and significantly expand the scope of our operations and financial and other systems. Our management will be required to devote a substantial amount of time and attention to the process of integrating the operations of Prime into our business.\nIf any of these factors limits our ability to integrate Prime into our operations successfully or on a timely basis, our expectations regarding future results of operations, including certain run-rate synergies expected to result from the Prime Acquisition, might not be met. As a result, we may not be able to realize the expected benefits that we seek to achieve from the Prime Acquisition. In addition, we may be required to spend additional time or money on integration that otherwise would be spent on the development and expansion of our business, including efforts to further expand our product portfolio.\nVehicle manufacturers may alter their distribution models.\nIn December 2021, Mercedes Benz announced the transition to an agency model for distribution of vehicles in the U.K. This transition is expected to occur beginning with 2023. In addition to the announcement by Mercedes Benz in the U.K., certain of our other vehicle manufacturers serving the U.K. and U.S. markets recently announced plans to explore an agency model for selling new vehicles. Under an agency model, our franchised dealerships would receive a fee for facilitating the sale of a new vehicle to a customer but would no longer record the vehicle in inventory or incur floorplan interest expense, as has been historical practice. The agency model, as adopted by Mercedes Benz, will result in reduced revenues, as we will act as an agent of Mercedes Benz, receiving a commission for each sale and other expense fee support. Based on our current understanding of the proposal, we do not expect a negative impact to the U.K. region gross margin and consolidated results of operations from a change to the Mercedes Benz agency model. Notwithstanding this fact, we cannot predict the actions of other manufacturers and whether the agency models proposed by them will have the same terms and conditions as those proposed by Mercedes Benz. The agency model, if adopted by other manufacturers, would reduce revenues, although the other impacts to our U.K. and the U.S. regions and consolidated results of operations remain uncertain until such time as the other vehicle manufacturers provide additional details regarding their specific agency model plans. We are uncertain if agency models will be widely adopted in the U.K. or U.S.\nVehicle technology advancements and changes in consumer vehicle ownership preferences could adversely affect our new and used vehicle sales volumes, parts and service revenues and results of operations.\nVehicle technology advancements are occurring at an accelerating pace. These include driver assist functionality, autonomous vehicle development and rideshare and vehicle co-ownership business models. Many in the automotive industry believe that in the near future vehicles will be available to the automotive consumer at low usage costs, which may entice many vehicle owners, particularly in larger, highly populated areas, to abandon individual car ownership in favor of multiple co-ownership ride-sharing opportunities. Increased popularity in the ride-sharing subscription business model could adversely affect our new and used vehicle sales volumes, parts and service revenues and results of operations.\nOperational Risks\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, which has disrupted all of our dealership operations, has had, and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had a material adverse impact on our business, including all of our markets in the U.S. and U.K. Extraordinary and wide-ranging actions taken by governmental authorities to reduce the spread of the virus, including mandates for many individuals to substantially restrict daily activities and for many businesses to curtail or cease normal operations, significantly reduced the operating capacity of all of our dealerships in the U.S. and U.K. beginning in mid-March 2020. Even as the restrictions eased during the latter part of 2020 and throughout 2021, we continued to experience disruptions from reduced capacity and departmental shutdowns as a result of COVID-19 outbreaks and quarantines impacting our employees. Depending on future developments, the COVID-19 pandemic may continue to disrupt our operations and may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nA cybersecurity breach, including loss of confidential information or a breach of personally identifiable information (\u201cPII\u201d) about our customers or employees, could negatively affect operations and result in high costs.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we receive significant PII about our customers and our employees. A security incident to obtain such information could be caused by malicious insiders and third parties using sophisticated, targeted methods to circumvent firewalls, encryption and other security defenses, including hacking, fraud, trickery, or other forms of deception. Although many companies across many industries are affected by malicious efforts to obtain access to PII, the automotive dealership industry has been a particular target of identity thieves. The techniques used by cyber attackers change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time. We have implemented security measures that are designed to detect and protect against cyberattacks.\nDespite these measures and any additional measures we may implement or adopt in the future, our facilities and systems, and those of our third-party service providers, have been and are vulnerable to security breaches, computer viruses, lost or misplaced data, programming errors, scams, ransomware, burglary, human errors, acts of vandalism, misdirected wire transfers or other events. Some of our third-party service providers have experienced security breaches. If an unauthorized party is successful in obtaining trade secrets, PII, confidential, or otherwise protected information of our dealerships or our customers or in disrupting our operations through a cyberattack, the attack could result in loss of revenue, increase costs of doing business, negatively affect customer satisfaction and loyalty, and expose us to negative publicity. In addition, security breaches and other security incidents could expose us to a risk of loss or exposure of this information, which could result in potential liability, investigations, regulatory fines, penalties for violation of applicable laws or regulations, costs related to remediation or the payment of ransom, and litigation including individual claims or consumer class actions, administrative, and civil or criminal investigations or actions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nFurther, advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography, inadequate facility security or other developments may result in a compromise or breach of the technology we use to safeguard confidential, personal, or otherwise protected information. As the breadth and complexity of the technologies we use continue to grow, including as a result of the use of mobile devices, cloud services, open-source software, social media and the increased reliance on devices connected to the internet, the potential risk of security breaches and cybersecurity attacks also increases. Despite ongoing efforts to improve our ability to protect data from compromise, we may not be able to protect all of our data across our diverse systems. Our efforts to improve security and protect data may result in increased capital and operating costs.\nIn addition, we are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect information of clients, customers, employees and other third parties that we collect and maintain. See Item 1. Business - Governmental Regulations for information on our risks related to compliance with such laws and regulations.\nOur insurance does not fully cover all of our operational risks, and changes in the cost of insurance or the availability of insurance could materially increase our insurance costs or result in a decrease in our insurance coverage.\nThe operation of automobile dealerships is subject to a broad variety of risks. While we have insurance on our real property, comprehensive coverage for our vehicle inventory, general liability insurance, workers\u2019 compensation insurance, employee dishonesty coverage, cybersecurity breach insurance, employment practices liability insurance, pollution coverage and errors and omissions insurance in connection with vehicle sales and financing activities, we are self-insured for a portion of our potential liabilities. We purchase insurance policies for worker\u2019s compensation, liability, auto physical damage, property, pollution, employee medical benefits and other risks consisting of large deductibles and/or self-insured retentions.\nIn certain instances, our insurance may not fully cover an insured loss depending on the magnitude and nature of the claim. Additionally, changes in the cost of insurance or the availability of insurance in the future could substantially increase our costs to maintain our current level of coverage or could cause us to reduce our insurance coverage and increase the portion of our risks that we self-insure.\nThe insurance companies that underwrite our insurance require that we secure certain of our obligations for self-insured exposures with collateral. Our collateral requirements are set by the insurance companies and, to date, have been satisfied by posting surety bonds, letters of credit and/or cash deposits. Our collateral requirements may change from time to time based on, among other things, our total insured exposure and the related self-insured retention assumed under the policies. We are subject to potential premium cost fluctuations with the annual renewal of these programs.\nNatural disasters and adverse weather events can disrupt our business and may adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nSome of our dealerships are concentrated in states and regions in the U.S. and U.K., in which actual or threatened natural disasters and severe weather events (such as hurricanes, earthquakes, snowstorms, flooding and hail storms) have in the past, and may in the future, disrupt our dealership operations. A disruption in our operations may adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition to business interruption, the automotive retailing business is subject to substantial risk of property loss due to the significant concentration of property value at dealership locations. Natural disasters and severe weather events have in the past and may in the future impair the value of our dealership property. Although we have, subject to certain limitations and exclusions, substantial insurance, including business interruption insurance, we may be exposed to uninsured losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, during the year ended December 31, 2021, we incurred $2.8 million in disaster pay and insurance deductible expense associated with the February winter storm in Texas and Hurricane Ida. Additionally, should we suffer significant losses in a short period of time, we run the risk that our premiums and/or deductibles could increase, which could adversely affect our business.\nRisks associated with our international operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have continuing operations outside the U.S. in the U.K. and discontinued operations in Brazil. As a result, we face political and economic risks and uncertainties with respect to our international operations. These risks may include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022wage inflation in emerging markets;\n\u2022legal uncertainties, timing delays and expenses associated with tariffs, labor matters, import or export licenses and other trade barriers;\n\u2022transparency issues in general and, more specifically, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1974, as amended, the U.K. Bribery Act and other anti-corruption compliance laws and issues;\n\u2022inability to obtain or preserve franchise rights in the foreign countries in which we operate; and\n\u2022fluctuations in foreign currency translations within our financial statements driven by exchange rate volatility.\nLegal, Regulatory and Compliance Risks\nWe are subject to automotive and other laws and regulations, which, if we are found to have violated, may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nA number of laws and regulations applicable to automotive companies affect our business and conduct, including, but not limited to, our sales, operations, financing, insurance, advertising and employment practices. Other rules such as franchise laws and regulations, consumer protection laws and other extensive laws and regulations apply to new and used motor vehicle dealers. Additionally, in every jurisdiction in which we operate, we must obtain various permits and licenses in order to conduct our businesses. Any failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil or criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory remedial obligations or the issuance of injunctions limiting or prohibiting our operations.\nRefer to Item 1. Business - Governmental Regulations for further discussion of automotive and other laws and regulations impacting our business.\nOperational risks associated with environmental laws and regulations may expose us to significant costs and liabilities.\nOur business activities in the U.S. and U.K. are subject to stringent federal, regional, state and local laws, regulations and other controls governing specific health and safety criteria to address worker protection, the release of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. These laws, regulations and controls may impose numerous obligations upon our operations including the acquisition of permits to conduct regulated activities, the imposition of restrictions on where or how to manage or dispose of used products and wastes, the occurrence of capital expenditures to limit or prevent releases of such material and the imposition of substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations or attributable to former operations. Our compliance with these regulations may expose us to significant costs and liabilities.\nAdditionally, vehicle manufacturers in the U.S. and U.K. are subject to varying guidelines, laws and regulations adopted by their applicable governmental and administrative agencies, which include GHG emissions and CAFE standards in the U.S. Such standards may affect our manufacturers\u2019 ability to produce cost effective vehicles, which may have a material adverse effect on our sales.\nRefer to Item 1. Business - Governmental Regulations for further discussion of environmental and regulations impacting our business.\nRisks Related to Accounting Matters\nThe impairment of our goodwill and/or indefinite-lived intangibles could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe assess goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangibles for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently when events or circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred. Performance issues at individual dealerships, as well as adverse retail automotive industry and economic trends, increase the risk of an impairment charge, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. No goodwill impairments were recorded during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2021, no impairments of intangible franchise rights were recorded. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recorded $20.7 million and $19.0 million of impairment of intangible franchise rights, respectively. We may be required to record impairment charges if market and industry conditions deteriorate to such a level whereby the fair value of our reporting units, individually, is less than the carrying value of the corresponding reporting unit. We are subject to several market and industry risks as outlined elsewhere herein this Item 1A. Risk Factors, which could have a material adverse impact on our cash flows. We cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any additional impairment charge at this time; however, any such impairment charge could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Refer to Note 12. Intangible Franchise Rights and Goodwill within our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of impairment.\nNew accounting guidance or changes in the interpretation or application of existing accounting guidance could adversely affect our financial performance.\nThe implementation of new SEC rules and regulations and accounting standards could require certain systems, internal process and controls and other changes that could increase our operating costs, and result in changes to our financial statements. In 2019, for example, the implementation of accounting standards related to leases, as issued by the FASB, required us to make significant changes to our lease management and other accounting systems, and resulted in a material impact to our consolidated financial statements.\nGAAP and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business involve many subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by our management. Changes in these rules or their interpretation or in underlying management assumptions, estimates or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance. The outcome of such changes could include litigation or regulatory actions which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur internal controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented.\nManagement has designed and implemented, and periodically reviews and updates, our internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures. While we have not experienced a material failure of our internal controls, any system of controls, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures, or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 85427, "SIC": 5500, "TIC": "GPI"}
