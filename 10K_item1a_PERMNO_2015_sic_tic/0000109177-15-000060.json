{"cik": "109177", "company": "HRG GROUP, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-11-20", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following risk factors and the forward-looking statements elsewhere herein should be read carefully in connection with evaluating the business of the Company and its subsidiaries. These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results and events to differ materially from those anticipated. Many of the risk factors described under one heading below may apply to more than one section in which we have grouped them for the purpose of this presentation. As a result, you should consider all of the following factors, together which all of the other information presented herein, in evaluating the business of the Company and its subsidiaries. These risk factors may be amended, supplemented or superseded from time to time in filings and reports that we file with the SEC in the future.\nRisks Related to HRG\nWe are a holding company and our only material assets are our equity interests in our operating subsidiaries and our other investments; as a result, our principal source of revenue and cash flow is distributions from our subsidiaries; our subsidiaries may be limited by law and by contract in making distributions to us.\nAs a holding company, our only material assets are our cash on hand, the equity interests in our subsidiaries and other investments. As of September 30, 2015, excluding cash, cash equivalents and investments held by our subsidiaries, we had approximately $331.3 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments, which includes $33.2 million held by our wholly-owned subsidiary, HGI Funding. Our principal source of revenue and cash flow is distributions from our subsidiaries. Thus, our ability to service our debt, finance acquisitions and pay dividends to our stockholders in the future is dependent on the ability of our subsidiaries to generate sufficient net income and cash flows to make upstream cash distributions to us. Our subsidiaries are and will continue to be separate legal entities, and although they may be wholly-owned or controlled by us, they have no obligation to make any funds available to us, whether in the form of loans, dividends, distributions or otherwise. The boards of directors of our subsidiaries may consider a range of factors and consider their stockholders\u2019 constituencies (including public stockholders) as a whole when making decisions about dividends or other payments. The ability of our subsidiaries to distribute cash to us will also be subject to, among other things, restrictions that are contained in our subsidiaries\u2019 financing agreements, availability of sufficient funds in such subsidiaries and applicable state laws and regulatory restrictions. Claims of creditors of our subsidiaries generally will have priority as to the assets of such subsidiaries over our claims and claims of our creditors and stockholders. To the extent the ability of our subsidiaries to distribute dividends or other payments to us could be limited in any way, our liquidity and ability to grow, pursue business opportunities or make acquisitions that could be beneficial to our businesses, or otherwise fund and conduct our business could be materially limited.\nAs an example, our subsidiary Spectrum Brands is a holding company with limited business operations of its own and its main assets are the capital stock of its subsidiaries, principally SBI. The terms of Spectrum Brands\u2019 indebtedness may limit its ability to pay dividends to Spectrum Brands and to us. See Part I, Item IA.\u201cRisk Factors-Risks Related to Spectrum Brands\u2019 Business-SBI\u2019s substantial indebtedness may limit its financial and operating flexibility, and it may incur additional debt, which could increase the risks associated with its substantial indebtedness\u201d and Part I, Item IA.\u201cRisk Factors-Risks Related to Spectrum Brands\u2019 Business- Restrictive covenants in the SBI Senior Secured Facilities and the SBI Indentures may restrict SBI\u2019s ability to pursue its business strategies.\u201d\nOur subsidiary, FGL, is also a holding company with limited business operations of its own. Its main assets are the capital stock of its subsidiaries, which are principally regulated insurance companies, whose ability to pay dividends is limited by applicable insurance laws. Accordingly, FGL\u2019s payment of dividends is dependent, to a significant extent, on the generation of cash flow by its subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to FGL, by dividend or otherwise. FGL\u2019s subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, make distributions to enable FGL to meet its obligations and pay dividends. Each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity and legal and contractual restrictions may also limit FGL\u2019s ability to obtain cash from its subsidiaries. See Part I, Item 1.\u201cBusiness-Our Operating Subsidiaries-FGL-Regulation-Financial Regulation-Dividend and Other Distribution Payment Limitations\u201d in this report. See Part I, Item 1A.\u201cRisk Factors-Risks Related to FGL\u2019s and Front Street\u2019s Businesses-The agreements and instruments governing FGL\u2019s indebtedness contain significant operating and financial restrictions, which may prevent FGL from capitalizing on business opportunities.\u201d As discussed elsewhere herein, while the agreements governing the FGL Merger permit FGL to pay a regular quarterly cash dividend on its Common Stock in an amount not in excess of $0.065 per share, per quarter, FGL may not pay any other dividends without the consent of Anbang. In addition, if the FGL Merger is consummated, while we will receive the proceeds from the sale of our shares of FGL common stock, we will no longer receive dividends from FGL.\nAdditionally, the terms of Compass\u2019 indebtedness and recent declines in oil and gas prices may adversely affect its cash flow and may limit its ability to pay distributions to us. Compass may also require additional equity infusions or other support. In November 2015, HGI Funding provided a limited guaranty with respect to a portion of Compass\u2019 indebtedness. See Part I, Item 1A.\u201cRisk Factors-Risks Related to Compass-Compass has a substantial amount of indebtedness, which may adversely affect its cash flow and ability to operate its business, remain in compliance with debt covenants and make payments on its debt and distributions to us.\u201d\nIn addition, our liquidity and ability to pursue business opportunities may be impacted by the capital needs of our subsidiaries. Such entities may require additional capital to maintain or grow their businesses, make payments on their indebtedness or other commitments, and/or make upstream cash distributions. For example, given the recent declines in oil and gas prices, Compass may require capital contributions if current period earnings and cash on hand at Compass are not sufficient to reduce debt levels and remain compliant with applicable covenants in Compass\u2019 financing agreement. As another example, Front Street will require additional capital in order to engage in reinsurance transactions, and may require additional capital to meet regulatory capital requirements.\nFurthermore, these restrictions on our subsidiaries ability to pay dividends or distributions may limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness or refinance our existing indebtedness in the future as well. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate future cash flow, and we are dependent on our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to pay dividends or pay distributions to us in order for us to generate cash flow.\nWe and our subsidiaries may determine not to or may not be successful in identifying, consummating and integrating any additional suitable acquisition, disposition or other business opportunities.\nWe and/or one or more of our subsidiaries may determine not to pursue additional acquisitions, dispositions or other business opportunities and/or, if we or our subsidiaries determine to pursue such opportunities, we may not be successful in identifying and consummating suitable acquisitions, dispositions or other business opportunities at favorable valuations and other terms. Furthermore, attractive business opportunities may be limited or prohibited by applicable regulatory regimes. Any future acquisition, disposition or business opportunity may also require a substantial amount of our or our subsidiaries\u2019 management\u2019s time and may be difficult to successfully execute, and in the case of acquisitions, integrate, which could adversely affect our or our subsidiaries\u2019 management\u2019s ability to identify and consummate other acquisitions, dispositions or business opportunities. Any such failure could have a material adverse effect on our or our subsidiaries\u2019 results of operations and financial condition and our or our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to service our debt.\nEven if we or our subsidiaries do execute our acquisitions, dispositions and/or other business opportunities, there is no assurance that we or our subsidiaries will be successful in enhancing our or our subsidiaries\u2019 business or financial condition or that such transaction will be successful.\nWe are dependent on certain key personnel.\nWe are dependent upon the skills, experience and efforts of, our President and Chief Executive Officer, Omar M. Asali and David M. Maura, our Executive Vice President of Investments. As a result of their positions with our Company, Mr. Asali and Mr. Maura have significant influence over our business strategy and make most of the significant policy and managerial decisions of our Company. The loss of Mr. Asali or Mr. Maura or other key personnel, or limitations on their involvement in our business, could have a material adverse effect on our and our subsidiaries\u2019 business or operating results.\nWe and our subsidiaries may not be able to attract and retain skilled people.\nOur success and our subsidiaries\u2019 success depend, in large part, on our and their ability to attract new personnel, retain and motivate our and their existing employees, and continue to compensate such personnel competitively. Competition for the best personnel in most activities in which we and our subsidiaries engage can be intense, and we may not be able to hire these people or to retain them. Additionally, our subsidiaries are both highly dependent on the continuing efforts of their senior management teams and other key personnel. Our subsidiaries\u2019 business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if they lose any of these persons and are unable to attract and retain qualified replacements.\nBecause we face significant competition for acquisition and business opportunities, including from numerous companies with a business plan similar to ours, it may be difficult for us to fully execute our business strategy. Additionally, our subsidiaries also operate in highly-competitive industries, limiting their ability to gain or maintain their positions in their respective industries.\nWe expect to encounter intense competition for acquisition and business opportunities from both strategic investors and other entities having a business objective similar to ours, such as private investors (which may be individuals or investment partnerships), blank check companies, and other entities, domestic and international, competing for the type of businesses that we may intend to acquire. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources, or more local industry knowledge, or greater access to capital, than we do and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. These factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully completing future acquisitions and investments.\nIn addition, while we believe that there are numerous target businesses that we could potentially acquire or invest in, our ability to compete with respect to the acquisition of certain target businesses that are sizable will be limited by our available financial resources. We may need to obtain additional financing in order to consummate future acquisitions and investment opportunities. We cannot assure you that any additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. This inherent competitive limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing acquisition and investment opportunities.\nFurthermore, our subsidiaries also face competition from both traditional and new market entrants that may adversely affect them as well. See risk factors related to Spectrum, FGL and Compass herein. Additionally, the Asset Managers\u2019 markets are highly-competitive and are characterized by competitive factors that vary based upon product and geographic region. The Asset Managers have a wide variety of competitors for skilled personnel that include captive and independent finance companies, commercial banks and thrift institutions, industrial banks, community banks, leasing companies, hedge funds, insurance companies, mortgage companies, investment companies, including business development companies, manufacturers and vendors. The Asset Managers compete, amongst other things, on the basis of pricing, terms and structure. If the Asset Managers are unable to match their respective competitors\u2019 terms, they could lose market share. Should the Asset Managers match their respective competitors\u2019 terms, it is possible that they could experience lower returns and/or increased losses. The Asset Managers also may be unable to match competitors\u2019 terms as a result of their respective current or future financial condition.\nFuture acquisitions or dispositions or other business opportunities could involve unknown risks that could harm our business and adversely affect our financial condition.\nWe have in the past, and may in the future, make acquisitions or dispositions or pursue other business activities, directly or indirectly through our subsidiaries, that involve a number of risks. In the case of acquisitions, those risks may relate to the particular industry in which the business or acquisition targets operate, including risks in industries with which we are not familiar or experienced with, risks that are unknown to us and the financial, legal and operational risks related to such acquisition. In the case of disposition, those risks may relate to employment matters, counterparties, regulators and other stakeholders in the disposed business, risks unknown to us and risks related to the management of our business and the financial, legal and operational risks related to such disposition. Any such risks may result in one or more costly disputes or litigation. Although we intend to conduct extensive business, financial, operational and legal due diligence in connection with the evaluation any such opportunity, there can be no assurance our due diligence investigations will identify every matter that could have a material adverse effect on us. The realization of any such risks could expose us to unanticipated costs and liabilities and prevent or limit us from realizing the projected benefits of such acquisition, disposition or other business activity, which could adversely affect our financial condition and liquidity and our ability to service our debt.\nWe could consume resources in pursuing acquisitions, business opportunities, dispositions, financings or capital market transactions that are not consummated, which could materially adversely affect subsequent attempts to locate and acquire or invest in another business.\nWe anticipate that the investigation of each specific acquisition, disposition, financing or capital market transaction, and the negotiation, drafting, and execution of relevant agreements, disclosure documents, and other instruments, with respect to such transaction, will require substantial management time and attention and substantial costs for financial advisors, accountants, attorneys and other advisors. If a decision is made not to consummate a specific transaction, the costs incurred up to that point for the proposed transaction likely would not be recoverable. Furthermore, even if an agreement is reached relating to a specific transaction, we may fail to consummate the transaction for any number of reasons, including those beyond our control. Any such event could consume significant management time and result in a loss to us of the related costs incurred, which could adversely affect our financial position and our ability to consummate other transactions.\nCovenants in certain of our material instruments limit, and other future instruments may limit our ability to operate our business.\nThe indenture governing our 7.875% Notes (the \u201c7.875% Notes Indenture\u201d), and the indenture governing our 7.750% Notes (the \u201c7.750% Notes Indenture\u201d and, collectively with the 7.875% Notes Indenture, the \u201cIndentures\u201d) contain, and any of our other future financing agreements may contain, covenants imposing operating and financial restrictions on our business. The Indentures require us to satisfy certain financial tests, including minimum liquidity and collateral coverage ratios. If we fail to meet or satisfy any of these covenants (after applicable cure periods), we would be in default and noteholders (through the trustee or collateral agent, as applicable) could elect to declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable, enforce their interests in the collateral pledged and restrict our ability to make additional borrowings. These agreements may also contain cross-default provisions, so that if a default occurs under any one agreement, the lenders under the other agreements could also declare a default. The covenants and restrictions in the Indentures, subject to specified exceptions, restrict our, and in certain cases, our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\ncreate liens or engage in sale and leaseback transactions;\n\u2022\npay dividends or make distributions in respect of capital stock;\n\u2022\nmake certain restricted payments;\n\u2022\nsell assets;\n\u2022\nengage in transactions with affiliates, except on an arms-length basis; or\n\u2022\nconsolidate or merge with, or sell substantially all of our assets to, another person.\nThe Certificate of Designation provides one holder of our Series A Participating Convertible Preferred Stock with consent and voting rights with respect to certain of the matters referred to above and certain corporate governance rights.\nThese restrictions may interfere with our ability to obtain financings or to engage in other business activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. Moreover, a default under one of our subsidiaries\u2019 financing agreements may cause a default on our debt and our other financing arrangements.\nFinally, Spectrum Brands\u2019 and FGL\u2019s stock are, directly or indirectly, pledged as collateral under our 7.875% Notes, and foreclosure on a sufficient number of Spectrum Brands stock or FGL stock pledged as collateral would constitute a change of control under certain of SBI\u2019s debt documents or FGL\u2019s debt documents, as applicable. Upon a change of control under those debt documents, SBI or FGL, as applicable, is required to offer to repurchase their notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of their notes, plus accrued interest. In the event holders of the SBI Notes (as defined below) or FGH Notes exercise remedies in connection with a default, their claims to SBI\u2019s or FGH\u2019s assets, respectively, would have priority over the holders of our 7.875% Notes.\nFinancing covenants could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations.\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness. As of September 30, 2015, our total outstanding indebtedness was $1.8 billion. As of September 30, 2015, the total liabilities of Spectrum Brands were approximately $5.7 billion, including trade payables. As of September 30, 2015, the total liabilities of FGL were approximately $23.4 billion, including approximately $17.8 billion in annuity contractholder funds, approximately $3.5 billion in future policy benefits and approximately $300.0 million of indebtedness under the FGL Notes. As of September 30, 2015, the total liabilities of HAMCO were approximately $1.4 million and were approximately $379.4 million when consolidated with Salus, EIC and CorAmerica. As of September 30, 2015, the total liabilities of HGI Energy (including the debt at Compass) were $501.9 million. Our and our subsidiaries\u2019 significant indebtedness and other financing arrangements could have material consequences. For example, they could:\n\u2022\nmake it difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our outstanding and other future debt obligations;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions or a downturn in our business;\n\u2022\nimpair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, investments, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows to the payment to our financing sources, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flows to fund working capital, investments, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes; and\n\u2022\nplace us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors.\nAny of these risks could impact our ability to fund our operations or limit our ability to expand our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nOur ability to make payments on our financial obligations may depend upon the future performance of our operating subsidiaries and their ability to generate cash flow in the future, which are subject to general economic, industry, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that we will generate sufficient cash flow from our operating subsidiaries, or that future borrowings will be available to us, in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our financial obligations or to fund our other liquidity needs. If the cash flow from our operating subsidiaries is insufficient, we may take actions, such as delaying or reducing investments or acquisitions, attempting to restructure or refinance our financial obligations prior to maturity, selling assets or operations or seeking additional equity capital to supplement cash flow. However, we may be unable to take any of these actions on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nFuture financing activities may adversely affect our leverage and financial condition.\nSubject to the limitations set forth in the Indentures, we and our subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness and issue dividend-bearing redeemable equity interests. We expect to incur substantial additional financial obligations to enable us to consummate future acquisitions and investment opportunities. These obligations could result in:\n\u2022\ndefault and foreclosure on our assets if our operating revenues after an investment or acquisition are insufficient to repay our financial obligations;\n\u2022\nacceleration of our obligations to repay the financial obligations even if we make all required payments when due if we breach certain covenants that require the maintenance of certain financial ratios or reserves without a waiver or renegotiation of that covenant;\n\u2022\nour immediate payment of all amounts owed, if any, if such financial obligations are payable on demand;\n\u2022\nour inability to obtain necessary additional financing if such financial obligations contain covenants restricting our ability to obtain such financing while the financial obligations remain outstanding;\n\u2022\nour inability to pay dividends on our capital stock;\n\u2022\nusing a substantial portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest or dividends on our financial obligations, which will reduce the funds available for dividends on our Common Stock if declared, expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nlimitations on our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business and in the industries in which we operate;\n\u2022\nan event of default that triggers a cross default with respect to other financial obligations, including our notes;\n\u2022\nincreased vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry, financial, competitive legislative, regulatory and other conditions and adverse changes in government regulation; and\n\u2022\nlimitations on our ability to borrow additional amounts for expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our strategy and other purposes and other disadvantages compared to our competitors.\nWe and our subsidiaries rely extensively on our information technology (IT) systems, networks and services, including Internet sites, data hosting and processing facilities and tools and other hardware, software and technical applications and platforms, some of which are managed, hosted, provided and/or used by third-parties or vendors, to assist in conducting our and our subsidiaries\u2019 businesses.\nOur and our subsidiaries IT systems have been, and will likely continue to be, subject to computer viruses or other malicious codes, unauthorized access attempts, phishing and other cyber-attacks. We and our subsidiaries continue to assess potential threats and make investments seeking to address these threats, including monitoring of networks and systems and upgrading skills, employee training and security policies for us and our subsidiaries, and our respective third-party providers. However, because the techniques used in these attacks change frequently and may be difficult to detect for periods of time, we or our subsidiaries may face difficulties in anticipating and implementing adequate preventative measures. To date, we and our subsidiaries have not experienced a material impact on our businesses or operations from these attacks; however, there can be no guarantee that our security efforts will prevent breaches or breakdowns to ours, our subsidiaries\u2019 or our third-party providers\u2019 databases or systems. If the IT systems, networks or service providers we and our subsidiaries rely upon fails to function properly, or if we, our subsidiaries or one of our third-party providers suffer a loss, significant unavailability of or disclosure of our business or stakeholder information, and our and our subsidiaries\u2019 businesses continuity plans do not effectively address these failures on a timely basis, we and/or our subsidiaries may be exposed to reputational, competitive and business harm as well as litigation and regulatory action. The costs and operational consequences of responding to breaches and implementing remediation measures could be significant.\nWe have made and may continue to make significant investments in publicly traded companies. Changes in the market prices of the securities we own, particularly during times of volatility in security prices, can have a material impact on the value of our company portfolio.\nWe have made and may continue to make significant investments in publicly traded companies, both as long-term acquisition targets and, to a limited extent, as shorter-term investments. We will either consolidate our investments and subsidiaries or report such investments under the equity method of accounting. Changes in the market prices of the publicly traded securities of these entities could have a material impact on an investor\u2019s perception of the aggregate value of our Common Stock and on the value of the assets we can pledge to creditors for debt financing, which in turn could adversely affect our ability to incur additional debt or finance future acquisitions.\nWe have incurred substantial costs in connection with our prior acquisitions and dispositions and expect to incur substantial costs in connection with any other transaction we complete in the future which will reduce the amount of our available cash and could adversely affect our financial results and liquidity.\nWe have incurred substantial costs in connection with our prior acquisitions and dispositions expect to incur substantial costs in connection with any other transaction we complete in the future. These costs will reduce the amount of cash otherwise available to us and our and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to carry out our respective business plans. There is no assurance that the actual costs will not exceed our estimates. We may continue to incur additional material charges reflecting additional costs associated with our investments and the integration of our acquisitions in fiscal quarters subsequent to the quarter in which the relevant acquisition was consummated.\nCertain of our stockholders hold a significant portion of our outstanding voting stock; decisions by such stockholders, including the decision to sell their HRG securities, could adversely affect our financial results and liquidity.\nLeucadia National Corporation (\u201cLeucadia\u201d), CF Turul LLC, an affiliate of funds managed by Fortress Investment Group LLC or its affiliates (\u201cCF Turul\u201d) and funds affiliated with Harbinger Capital Partners LLC (\u201cHCP\u201d), beneficially own a significant portion of our outstanding Common Stock. Because of this, such persons may exercise significant influence over our business and affairs, including over matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders, such as the election of directors, the removal of directors, and approval of significant corporate transactions. This influence and actual control may have the effect of discouraging offers to acquire HRG because any such transaction would likely require the consent of Leucadia and CF Turul. See also Part I,\nItem 1A.\u201cRisk Factors- Provisions in our organizational documents and applicable regulations may discourage the takeover of our company, may make removal of our management more difficult and may depress our stock price.\u201d\nMatters not directly related to us can nevertheless affect Leucadia\u2019s, CF Turul\u2019s and HCP\u2019s respective decisions to maintain, decrease or increase their investments in us. Leucadia, CF Turul and HCP may at any time decide to dispose of all or a portion of their investment in us. The sale or other disposition of a certain portion of our voting stock could cause the Company and its subsidiaries to experience a change of control, which may accelerate certain of the Company\u2019s and its subsidiaries\u2019 equity awards and other obligations and/or allow certain counterparties to terminate their agreements. Among other things, such a change of control could result in a \u201cchange of control\u201d under the Indentures, requiring us to offer to repurchase our 7.875% Notes or our 7.750% Notes or to redeem our preferred stock from the holders thereof. No assurance can be provided that upon the occurrence of such an event, the Company will be able to obtain the required waivers, repay its indebtedness or secure alternative arrangements. See also Part I, Item IA.Risk Factors-Future sales of substantial amounts of our Common Stock may adversely affect our market price.\u201d\nOur officers, directors, stockholders and their respective affiliates may have a pecuniary interest in certain transactions in which we are involved, and may also compete with us.\nWe have not adopted a policy that expressly prohibits our directors, officers, stockholders or affiliates from having a direct or indirect pecuniary interest in any investment to be acquired or disposed of by us or in any transaction to which we are a party or have an interest, nor do we have a policy that expressly prohibits any such persons from engaging for their own account in business activities of the types conducted by us. We have engaged in transactions in which such persons have an interest and, subject to the terms of the Indentures and other applicable covenants in other financing arrangements or other agreements, may in the future enter into additional transactions in which such persons have an interest. In addition, such parties may have an interest in certain transactions such as strategic partnerships or joint ventures in which we are involved, and may also compete with us.\nIn the course of their other business activities, certain conflicts of interest may arise with respect to HRG, its subsidiaries, investees and their respective directors, officers and affiliates.\nCertain of our and our subsidiaries\u2019 and investee\u2019s officers and directors may become aware of business opportunities which may be appropriate for presentation to us as well as the other entities with which they are or may be affiliated. Due to those officers\u2019 and directors\u2019 existing affiliations with other entities, they may have obligations to present potential business opportunities to those entities, which could cause additional conflicts of interest. Accordingly, such persons may not present otherwise attractive business combination opportunities to us, our subsidiaries or investees.\nIn addition, HRG currently has a number of, and may in the future acquire, additional subsidiaries and investees (\u201cHRG Entities\u201d), some of which engage in business dealings with each other and HRG from time to time. As a result, conflicts of interest could arise with respect to transactions involving business dealings between HRG and the HRG Entities or between and among the HRG Entities, including potential business transactions and potential acquisitions of businesses or properties. It may not be possible to equally favor each of the HRG Entities in these business dealings, and the resolution of these conflicts may not always be equally in the best interest of all HRG Entities, which could have a material effect on HRG\u2019s and one or more HRG Entities\u2019 financial condition and results of operations.\nFuture acquisitions or dispositions may not require a stockholder vote and may be material to us.\nAny future acquisitions could be material in size and scope, and our stockholders and potential investors may have virtually no substantive information about any new business upon which to base a decision whether to invest in our Common Stock. In any event, depending upon the size and structure of any acquisitions, stockholders are generally expected to not have the opportunity to vote on the transaction, and may not have access to any information about any new business until the transaction is completed and we file a report with the Commission disclosing the nature of such transaction and/or business. Similarly, we may effect material dispositions in the future and stockholders are generally not expected to the opportunity to vote on these transactions. Even if a stockholder vote is required for any future transactions, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our restated bylaws allow for our stockholders to approve such transactions by written consent, which may result in only our large stockholders having an opportunity to vote on such transactions.\nProvisions in our organizational documents and applicable regulations may discourage the takeover of our company, may make removal of our management more difficult and may depress our stock price.\nOur organizational documents contain provisions that may have an anti-takeover effect and inhibit a change in our management. They could also have the effect of discouraging others from making tender offers for our Common Stock. As a result, these provisions could prevent our stockholders from receiving a premium for their shares of Common Stock above the prevailing market prices. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nthe authority of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d) to issue, without stockholder approval, up to 10,000,000 shares of our preferred stock with such terms as our Board may determine;\n\u2022\nspecial meetings of our stockholders may be called only by the Chairman of our Board or by our Corporate Secretary\nupon delivery of a written request executed by three directors (or, if there are fewer than three directors in office at that time, by all incumbent directors);\n\u2022\na staggered Board, as a result of which only one of the three classes of directors is elected each year;\n\u2022\nadvance notice requirements for nominations for election to our Board, or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\nthe absence of cumulative voting rights;\n\u2022\nsubject to any special rights of the holders of our preferred stock may have to elect directors, removal of incumbent directors only for cause.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains provisions that restrict mergers and other business combinations with an \u201cInterested Stockholder\u201d (as defined therein) or that may otherwise have the effect of preventing or delaying a change of control of our company. Our Board has waived the application of this provision to Leucadia and CF Turul. In addition, in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, the term \u201cInterested Stockholder\u201d excludes Harbinger Holdings, LLC (\u201cHarbinger Holdings\u201d) and any affiliates, including HCP and any other entity controlled or managed, directly or indirectly, by Philip A. Falcone. Also see Part I, Item IA. \u201cRisk Factors-HRG and certain of its subsidiaries, including Spectrum Brands and FGL, may not be able to fully utilize their net operating loss and other tax carryforwards\u201d for the restrictions on certain transfer our Common Stock.\nUnder most states\u2019 statutes, including those of Iowa and New York, acquiring 10% or more of the voting stock of an insurance company or its parent company is presumptively considered a change of control, although such presumption may be rebutted. Accordingly, any person who acquires 10% or more of the voting securities of HRG, FGL, FGH, FGL Insurance or FGL NY Insurance without the prior approval of the insurance regulators of Iowa and New York will be in violation of those states\u2019 laws and may be subject to injunctive action requiring the disposition or seizure of those securities by the relevant insurance regulator, prohibiting the voting of those securities and/or other actions determined by the relevant insurance regulator. Any such investors will need to obtain approval to divest of their controlling interest, except for Leucadia, CF Turul and HCP, each of whom has obtained the necessary regulatory approval.\nOur restated bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nOur restated bylaws provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty, any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our restated bylaws, any action to interpret, apply, enforce, or determine the validity of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or restated bylaws, or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. The choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our restated bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nThe nature of certain of our assets is volatile and their value may fluctuate or change over short periods of time.\nWe are a holding company and as such, hold, directly or indirectly, various securities and debt instruments. Investments in such securities and debt instruments involves significant risk, including the risk of partial or total loss of the value of such investments, particularly in light of uncertain domestic and global political, credit and financial market conditions. Any such loss may have a material adverse effect on our and our subsidiaries\u2019 liquidity and results of operations, and can adversely affect our and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to service our debt and carry out our business strategy.\nIn addition, some of our subsidiaries are privately-held companies and some of our assets are illiquid securities, the fair values of which are not readily determinable. We value these securities for various purposes based on a number of factors, including, without limitation, third-party independent valuations. Because valuations, and particularly valuations of private and illiquid securities, are inherently uncertain, such valuations may fluctuate significantly over time and may differ materially from the values that would have been obtained if an active market existed for these securities.\nDisruption or failures of our or our subsidiaries\u2019 information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur and our subsidiaries\u2019 information technology systems are susceptible to security breaches, operational data loss, general disruptions in functionality, and may not be compatible with new technology. We and our subsidiaries depend on information technology systems for the effectiveness of operations and to interface with those with whom we and our subsidiaries conduct business, as well as to maintain financial and other records. Disruption or failures of such information technology systems could\nimpair our or our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to effectively and timely conduct our operations and maintain financial records, which could damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur ability to dispose of securities and debt interests may be limited by restrictive stockholder agreements, by the federal securities laws and by other regulations or market conditions.\nWhen we acquire securities or debt instruments directly or indirectly through subsidiaries, we acquire securities or debt instruments that are illiquid and, when we acquire less than 100% of the equity interests of a company, we may be subject to restrictive terms of agreements with other equityholders. In addition, we may hold, and may in the future hold, securities and debt instruments that are not registered under the Securities Act and/or (as is the case with respect to our shares of Spectrum Brands and FGL) restricted securities under the Securities Act. Our ability to sell such securities and debt instruments could be limited by market conditions and the illiquid nature of such securities and debt instruments and could be limited to sales pursuant to: (i) an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the resale of those securities; (ii) Rule 144 under the Securities Act, which, among other things, requires a specified holding period and limits the manner and volume of sales; (iii) another applicable exemption under the Securities Act; or (iv) approval of certain regulators. We hold, and may in the future hold, large amounts of the securities or debt instruments of a particular issuer, which may limit our ability to sell such securities or debt instruments on economically attractive terms or at all. The inability to sell such securities or debt instruments when desired or necessary may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity, which could adversely affect our ability to service our debt and our ability to carry out our business strategy.\nWe may suffer adverse consequences if we are deemed an investment company under the Investment Company Act and we may be required to incur significant costs to avoid investment company status and our activities may be restricted.\nWe believe that we are not an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the \u201cInvestment Company Act\u201d) and we intend to continue to make acquisitions and other investments in a manner so as not to be an investment company. The Investment Company Act contains substantive legal requirements that regulate the manner in which investment companies are permitted to conduct their business activities. If the Commission or a court were to disagree with us, we could be required to register as an investment company. This would negatively affect our ability to consummate acquisitions; subject us to disclosure and accounting guidance geared toward investment, rather than operating companies; limit our ability to borrow money, issue options, issue multiple classes of stock and debt, and engage in transactions with affiliates; and require us to undertake significant costs and expenses to meet the disclosure and regulatory requirements to which we would be subject as a registered investment company. In order not to be regulated as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, unless we can qualify for an exemption, we must ensure that we are engaged primarily in a business other than investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities (as defined in the Investment Company Act) and that we do not own or acquire \u201cinvestment securities\u201d having a value exceeding 40% of the value of our total assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. To ensure that majority-owned investments, such as Spectrum Brands, do not become categorized as \u201cinvestment securities,\u201d we may need to make additional investments in these subsidiaries to offset any dilution of our interest that would otherwise cause such a subsidiary to cease to be majority-owned. We may also need to forego acquisitions that we would otherwise make or retain, or dispose of investments that we might otherwise hold.\nAny potential acquisition or investment in a foreign business or a company with significant foreign operations may subject us to additional risks.\nAcquisitions or investments by us in a foreign business or other companies with significant foreign operations, such as Spectrum Brands, subjects us to risks inherent in business operations outside of the U.S. These risks include, for example, currency fluctuations, complex foreign regulatory regimes, punitive tariffs, unstable local tax policies, trade embargoes, risks related to shipment of raw materials and finished goods across national borders, restrictions on the movement of funds across national borders and cultural and language differences. If realized, some of these risks may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and liquidity, and can have an adverse effect on our ability to service our debt. For risks related to Spectrum Brands, see Part I, Item IA. \u201cRisk Factors-Risks Related to Spectrum Brands\u2019 Business\u201d below.\nOur participation in any future joint investment could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decision-making authority, our reliance on a partner\u2019s financial condition and disputes between us and our partners.\nWe may, through one or more series of acquisitions or dispositions, acquire partial ownership interests in businesses or participate in joint ventures with third parties. In such circumstances, we may not be in a position to exercise significant decision-making authority regarding a target business, partnership or other entity if we do not own a substantial majority of the equity interests of the target. These investments may involve risks not present where a third party is not involved, including the possibility that partners might become insolvent or fail to fund their shares of required capital contributions. In addition, partners may have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals, and may be in a position to take actions contrary to our policies or objectives. Such partners, some of which may possess more industry or technical knowledge or have better access to capital and other resources, may also seek similar acquisition targets as us and we may be in competition with them for such business combination targets. Disputes between us and partners may result in litigation or arbitration\nthat would increase our costs and expenses and divert a substantial amount of our management\u2019s time and effort away from our business. Consequently, actions by, or disputes with, partners might result in subjecting assets owned by the partnership to additional risk. We may also, in certain circumstances, be liable for the actions of our third-party partners. For example, in the future, we may agree to guarantee indebtedness incurred by a partnership or other entity. Such a guarantee may be on a joint and several basis with our partner, in which case, we may be liable in the event such partner defaults on its guarantee obligation.\nThere may be tax consequences associated with our acquisition, investment, holding and disposition of target companies and assets.\nWe may incur significant taxes in connection with effecting acquisitions or investments, holding, receiving payments from, and operating target companies and assets and disposing of target companies or their assets. Our decisions to make a particular acquisition, sell a particular asset or increase or decrease a particular investment may be based on considerations other than the timing and amount of taxes owed as a result.\nHRG and certain of its subsidiaries, including Spectrum Brands and FGL, may not be able to fully utilize their net operating loss and other tax carryforward; restrictions in HRG\u2019s certificate of incorporation intended to protect net operating losses and other tax attributes may limit transfer of HRG\u2019s securities\nAs of September 30, 2015, HRG and Spectrum Brands had U.S. Federal net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carryforwards of approximately $815.3 million and $894.5 million, respectively that, if unused, will expire through year 2034. HRG and Spectrum Brands had tax benefits related to U.S. state NOL carryforwards of approximately $109.8 million and $68.7 million, respectively, at September 30, 2015, that, if unused, will expire through year 2034. As of September 30, 2015, HRG had approximately $77.8 million of U.S. Federal capital loss carryforwards that, if unused, will expire through year 2020; and Spectrum Brands had foreign loss carryforwards of approximately $127.6 million, which will expire beginning in Fiscal 2016. As of September 30, 2015, FGL had U.S. Federal NOL carryforwards of approximately $92.2 million that, if unused, will expire in years 2026 through 2035 and had capital loss carryforwards of approximately $216.9 million that, if unused, will expire through year 2019. In addition, any future subsidiary that HRG or its subsidiaries may acquire may also have significant Federal, state, local and foreign NOL carryforwards. Both HRG and Spectrum Brands have established full valuation allowances for these deferred tax assets, and FGL has established a partial valuation allowance, based on their assessments of the amounts of deferred tax assets that are more-likely-than-not realizable.\nThe ability of HRG and its subsidiaries (including any future subsidiary) to utilize their NOL and other tax carryforwards to reduce taxable income in future years may be limited for various reasons, including if projected future taxable income is insufficient to recognize the full benefit of such NOL carryforwards prior to their expiration. Additionally, the ability of HRG and its subsidiaries (including any future subsidiary) to fully use these tax assets could also be adversely affected if the respective companies were deemed to have an \u201cownership change\u201d within the meaning of Sections 382 and 383 of the Code. An ownership change is generally defined as a greater than 50% increase in equity ownership by \u201c5% shareholders\u201d (as that term is defined for purposes of Sections 382 and 383 of the Code) in any three-year period. HRG and its subsidiaries (including Spectrum Brands and FGL) have experienced ownership changes that have limited the utilization of a portion of their NOL carryforwards and other carryforward tax attributes. Future ownership changes, including transfers or dispositions of our stock by HCP or other stockholders and conversions or redemptions of our preferred stock, could, depending on their magnitude, result in ownership changes that would trigger the imposition of additional limitations on the utilization of these tax assets under Sections 382 and 383. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that, in the future, HRG and/or its subsidiaries (including any future subsidiary) will not experience additional limitations on utilizing the tax benefits of their NOL and other tax carryforwards. Such limitations could have a material adverse effect on HRG and/or its subsidiaries\u2019 results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nIn order to reduce the likelihood that future transactions in our Common Stock will result in an ownership change under Section 382 of the Code (\u201cSection 382\u201d), on July 13, 2015, following receipt of stockholder approval, we filed an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (the \u201cCharter\u201d). The Charter amendment is designed to reduce the likelihood of an \u201cownership change\u201d under U.S. federal tax laws by restricting certain direct and indirect acquisitions and dispositions of our Common Stock. The restrictions imposed under the amendment apply to any direct and indirect holders of, or persons who would become holders of, 4.9% or more of our Common Stock (and certain other interests in the Company that are treated as stock for U.S. federal tax purposes). As of July 13, 2015, which is the date of the adoption of the Charter amendment, any direct or indirect transfer of our shares of Common Stock (or such other Company securities) in violation of the restrictions will be void as of the date of the purported transfer as to the purported transferee, and the purported transferee will not be recognized as the owner of such securities for any purpose, including for purposes of voting and receiving dividends or other distributions. Our Board will have the power to determine and interpret, in its sole discretion, all matters necessary for assessing compliance with the provisions of the Charter transfer restrictions. These matters include (i) the identification of a 4.9% stockholder, (ii) whether a transfer is a prohibited transfer, (iii) the percentage stock ownership interest in the Company of any person for the purposes of Section 382, (iv) whether an instrument constitutes a security of the Company, (v) the amount or fair market value due to a purported transferee pursuant to the alternate procedure described in the Charter, (vi) the interpretation of the provisions of the Charter amendment and (vii) any other matters which our Board determines to be relevant. To the extent permitted by law, the\ngood faith determination of the Board on such matters will be conclusive and binding on all persons and entities for purposes of the Charter transfer restrictions.\nIn connection with its consideration of the Charter transfer restrictions, the Board has provided to CF Turul, the beneficial owner of 16.4% of our issued and outstanding Common Stock as of November 2, 2015, its approval, as required under the Charter transfer restrictions, to make, subject to specified limitations and other terms and conditions, one or more distributions of our shares of Common Stock on a substantially pro rata basis to the members of CF Turul (and by such members and their affiliates to the ultimate owners who are not entities sponsored or organized by Fortress Investment Group LLC). In addition, the Board has also provided the funds affiliated with HCP, the beneficial owner of approximately 10.3% of our issued and outstanding Common Stock as of November 2, 2015, its approval, as required under the Charter transfer restrictions, to sell, subject to specified limitations and other terms and conditions, the shares of Common Stock currently held by HCP.\nWhile the Charter amendment is intended protect the benefits of our NOLs and other tax assets, there can be no assurance that we will not experience future transactions in our Common Stock that results in some or all of our NOLs attributes being lost or limited. For example, (i) our Board can permit a transfer to an acquirer that results in or contributes to an ownership change if it determines that such transfer is in our or our stockholders\u2019 best interests; (ii) a court could find that part or all of the charter transfer restrictions are not enforceable, either in general or as applied to a particular stockholder or fact situation; (iii) certain changes in relationships among our stockholders or other events not proscribed under the Charter amendment could contribute to or cause an ownership change under Section 382; and (iv) an ownership change could be caused or contributed to as a result of our own actions, such as issuing, repurchasing or redeeming shares of our Common Stock, which we remain free to do if our Board determines that it is in our or our stockholders\u2019 best interests to do so.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires us to document and test our internal controls over financial reporting and to report on our assessment as to the effectiveness of these controls. Any delays or difficulty in satisfying these requirements or negative reports concerning our internal controls could adversely affect our future results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may in the future discover areas of our internal controls that need improvement, particularly with respect to our or our subsidiaries or businesses that we or our subsidiaries may acquire in the future, and newly formed businesses or entities. For instance, Compass has only recently transitioned to a stand-alone independent company with, among other things, its own reporting process and internal controls over financial reporting, and certain of our less significant subsidiaries may become more material to us and may have a greater impact on the effectiveness of our controls if the FGL Merger is consummated. We cannot be certain that we or our subsidiaries (including Compass) will develop, implement, and maintain adequate internal controls over financial reporting in the future.\nIn addition, we or our subsidiaries may acquire an entity that was not previously subject to U.S. public company requirements or did not previously prepare financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP or is not in compliance with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 or other public company reporting obligations applicable to such entity directly or through us. We or our subsidiaries may incur significant additional costs in order to ensure, that after such acquisition, HRG or our subsidiaries continue to comply with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and its other public company requirements, which, in turn, would reduce our earnings and negatively affect our liquidity or cause us to fail to meet our or our subsidiaries reporting obligations. In addition, development of an adequate financial reporting system and the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition or cause us or our subsidiaries to fail to meet our reporting obligations. To the extent any of these newly-acquired entities or any existing entities have deficiencies in their internal controls, it may impact our internal controls.\nAny failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could harm our or our subsidiaries\u2019 operating results or cause us or our subsidiaries to fail to meet our respective reporting obligations. If we or our subsidiaries are unable to conclude that we or our subsidiaries have effective internal controls over financial reporting, or if our or our subsidiaries\u2019 independent registered public accounting firm is unable to provide us or our subsidiaries with an unqualified report regarding the effectiveness of our or our subsidiaries\u2019 internal controls over financial reporting to the extent required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our or our subsidiaries\u2019 financial statements. Failure to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 could potentially subject us or our subsidiaries to sanctions or investigations by the Commission, or other regulatory authorities. In addition, failure to comply with our reporting obligations with the Commission may cause an event of default to occur under the Indentures, or similar instruments governing any debt we or our subsidiaries incur in the future.\nLimitations on liability and indemnification matters.\nAs permitted by Delaware law, we have included in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation a provision to eliminate the personal liability of our directors for monetary damages for breach or alleged breach of their fiduciary duties as directors, subject to certain exceptions. Our restated bylaws also provide that we are required to indemnify our directors under certain circumstances, including those circumstances in which indemnification would otherwise be discretionary, and we will be required to advance expenses to our directors as incurred in connection with proceedings against them for which they may be indemnified.\nIn addition, we may, by action of our Board, provide indemnification and advance expenses to our officers, employees and agents (other than directors), to directors, officers, employees or agents of a subsidiary of the Company, and to each person serving as a director, officer, partner, member, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, at our request, with the same scope and effect as the indemnification of our directors provided in our restated bylaws.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be adversely affected by further deterioration in economic conditions.\nFrom December 2007 through June 2009, the U.S. economy was in recession. Business activity across a wide range of industries and regions in the U.S. was greatly reduced. Although economic conditions have begun to improve, certain sectors remain weak and unemployment remains high. Local governments and many businesses are in serious difficulty due to lower consumer spending and the lack of liquidity in the credit markets.\nIn 2011 and 2012, concern over sovereign debt in Greece, Spain, Italy and certain other European Union countries caused significant fluctuations of the Euro, relative to other currencies, such as the U.S. Dollar. Criticism of excessive national debt among certain European Union countries has led to credit downgrades of the sovereign debt of several countries in the region, and uncertainty about the future status of the Euro. Destabilization of the European economy could lead to a decrease in consumer confidence, which could cause reductions in discretionary spending and demand for our subsidiary Spectrum Brands\u2019 products. Furthermore, sovereign debt issues could also lead to further significant, and potentially longer-term, economic issues, such as reduced economic growth and devaluation of the Euro against the U.S. Dollar, any of which could adversely affect our and each of our subsidiaries\u2019 business, financial condition and operating results.\nAdditionally, a slowing of improvement or a return to deteriorating business and economic conditions could have one or more of the following adverse effects, in particular, on the Asset Managers\u2019 businesses: a decrease in the demand for loans and other products and services offered by the Asset Managers; a decrease in net interest income derived from the Asset Managers\u2019 lending and investment activities, as applicable; a decrease in the value of the Asset Managers\u2019 assets, including the value of assets pledged as collateral by the Asset Managers\u2019 borrowers, as applicable; an impairment of certain intangible assets, such as goodwill; and an increase in the number of borrowers and counterparties who become delinquent, file for protection under bankruptcy laws or default on their loans or other obligations to the Asset Managers, as applicable. An increase in the number of delinquencies, bankruptcies or defaults could result in a higher level of nonperforming assets, net charge-offs, provision for loan losses and valuation adjustments on the Asset Managers\u2019 loans, as applicable.\nWe may issue additional shares of common stock or preferred stock which would dilute the interests of our stockholders and could present other risks.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to 500,000,000 shares of common stock and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock. As of November 2, 2015, we had 201,397,256 shares of our common stock outstanding. In addition, as of November 2, 2015, we have 9,087,965 shares of common stock remaining for issuance pursuant to the Harbinger Group Inc. 2011 Omnibus Equity Award Plan, as amended and 1,800,000 shares of common stock remaining for issuance pursuant to the Harbinger Group Inc. 2014 Warrant Plan.\nPrice fluctuations in our Common Stock could result from general market and economic conditions and a variety of other factors, including factors that affect the volatility of the common stock of any of our publicly-held subsidiaries.\nThe trading price of our Common Stock may be highly-volatile and could be subject to fluctuations in response to a number of factors beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our results of operations and the performance of our subsidiaries and their competitors;\n\u2022\nreaction of the market to our announcement of any future acquisitions or investments;\n\u2022\nthe public\u2019s reaction to our press releases, our other public announcements and our filings with the Commission;\n\u2022\nchanges in general economic conditions;\n\u2022\nactions of our historical equity investors, including sales of common stock by HCP, our directors and our executive officers; and\n\u2022\nactions by institutional investors trading in our stock.\nIn addition, the trading price of our Common Stock could be subject to fluctuations in response to a number of factors that affect the volatility of the common stock of any of our subsidiaries, such as Spectrum Brands and FGL, which are publicly traded.\nFuture sales of substantial amounts of our Common Stock may adversely affect our market price.\nWe have granted registration rights to Leucadia, CF Turul, HCP and certain of their transferees under a registration rights agreement, to facilitate the resale of their shares of our Common Stock. Under this registration rights agreement, Leucadia, CF Turul, HCP and certain of their transferees have the right, subject to certain conditions, to require us to register the sale of their shares or their\npermitted transferees\u2019 shares under the federal securities laws. By exercising their registration rights, and selling all or a portion of their shares, Leucadia, CF Turul, HCP and their permitted transferees could cause the prevailing market price of our Common Stock to decline. We have filed several registration statements on Form S-3 that have registered the sale of a substantial amount of our Common Stock, from time to time, in secondary offerings by the stockholders listed therein. Furthermore, the shares of our Common Stock owned by Leucadia, CF Turul, HCP may also be sold in the public market under Rule 144 of the Securities Act. We have, in the past, issued a substantial amount of shares of preferred stock, the majority of which were subsequently converted into shares of our Common Stock. We may issue a substantial amount of preferred stock in the future. If these rights are exercised in full, it might adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock.\nFuture sales of substantial amounts of our Common Stock into the public market, or perceptions in the market that such sales could occur, may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our Common Stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities.\nThe market liquidity for our Common Stock is relatively low and may make it difficult to purchase or sell our stock.\nThe daily trading volume in our Common Stock is volatile and relatively low, which may make it difficult to purchase or sell shares of our Common Stock. Although a more active trading market may develop in the future, there can be no assurance as to the liquidity of any markets that may develop for our Common Stock or the prices at which holders may be able to sell our Common Stock and the limited market liquidity for our stock could affect a stockholder\u2019s ability to sell at a price satisfactory to that stockholder.\nFrom time to time, we and our subsidiaries may be subject to litigation for which we and our subsidiaries may be unable to accurately assess our level of exposure and which, if adversely determined, may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.\nWe and our subsidiaries are or may become parties to legal proceedings related to our or their current or prior businesses for which, depending on the circumstances, a reserve may not have been established or otherwise provided for or insured against. There can be no assurance that we will prevail in any litigation in which we or our subsidiaries may become involved, or that our or their insurance coverage will be adequate to cover any or all potential losses. In addition, from time to time, we may decide to settle litigation involving us or our subsidiaries for a variety of reasons and regardless of our perceived merits of the claims related to such litigation. Such settlements may include non-monetary, as well as monetary terms. To the extent that we or our subsidiaries sustain losses from such proceeding which are not reserved or otherwise provided for or insured against, our business, results of operations, cash flows and/or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. See Part I, Item 3. \u201cLegal Proceedings.\u201d\nAgreements, transactions and litigation involving or resulting from the activities of our predecessor and its former subsidiaries may subject us to future claims or litigation that could materially adversely impact our capital resources.\nHRG is the successor to Zapata Corporation, which was a holding company engaged, through its subsidiaries, in a number of business activities. The activities of our predecessor company and its subsidiaries may subject us to future claims or litigation regardless of the merit of such claims or litigation and the defenses available to us and our subsidiaries. The time and expense that we may be required to dedicate to such matters may be material to us and our subsidiaries and may adversely impact our capital resources. In addition, throughout our history, our predecessor company entered into numerous transactions relating to the sale, disposal or spinoff of its partially and wholly-owned subsidiaries. We may have continuing obligations pursuant to certain of these transactions, including obligations to indemnify other parties to agreements, and may be subject to risks resulting from these transactions. See Part I, Item 3. \u201cLegal Proceedings.\u201d\nRisks Related to Spectrum Brands\u2019 Business\nSpectrum Brands is a parent company with limited business operations of its own. Its main asset is the capital stock of its subsidiaries, including SBI. Spectrum Brands conducts most of its business operations through its subsidiaries and its primary source of cash is and will be distributions from its subsidiaries.\nAccordingly, Spectrum Brands\u2019 primary sources of cash are dividends and distributions with respect to its ownership interests in its subsidiaries that are derived from their earnings and cash flow. Spectrum Brands\u2019 and SBI\u2019s subsidiaries might not generate sufficient earnings and cash flow to pay dividends or distributions in the future. Spectrum Brands\u2019 and SBI\u2019s subsidiaries\u2019 payments to their respective parent will be contingent upon their earnings and upon other business considerations. In addition, SBI\u2019s term loan facility (the \u201cSBI Term Loan Facility\u201d), SBI\u2019s asset-based revolving credit facility (the \u201cSBI ABL Facility,\u201d and, together with the SBI Term Loan Facility, the \u201cSBI Senior Secured Facilities\u201d), the indentures governing SBI\u2019s 6.375% Senior Notes due 2020 (the \u201cSBI 2020 Notes\u201d), SBI\u2019s 6.625% Senior Notes due 2022 (the \u201cSBI 2022 Notes\u201d), SBI\u2019s 6.125% Senior Notes due 2024 (the \u201cSBI 2024 Notes\u201d) and SBI\u2019s 5.750% Senior Notes due 2025 (the \u201cSBI 2025 Notes,\u201d and, together with the SBI 2020 Notes, the SBI 2022 Notes and the SBI 2024 Notes, the \u201cSBI Notes,\u201d and, such indentures governing the SBI Notes, the \u201cSBI Indentures\u201d).\nSpectrum Brands\u2019 substantial indebtedness may limit its financial and operating flexibility, and Spectrum Brands may incur additional debt, which could increase the risks associated with its substantial indebtedness.\nSBI has, and expects to continue to have, a significant amount of indebtedness. As of September 30, 2015, SBI had total indebtedness under the SBI Senior Secured Facilities, the SBI Notes and other debt instruments of approximately $3 billion. SBI\u2019s substantial indebtedness has had, and could continue to have, material adverse consequences for its business, and may:\n\u2022\nrequire Spectrum Brands to dedicate a large portion of its cash flow to pay principal and interest on its indebtedness, which will reduce the availability of its cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, research and development expenditures and other business activities;\n\u2022\nincrease its vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimit its flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in its business and the industry in which Spectrum Brands operates;\n\u2022\nrestrict its ability to make strategic acquisitions, dispositions or to exploit business opportunities;\n\u2022\nplaces Spectrum Brands at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors that have less debt; and\nlimit its ability to borrow additional funds (even when necessary to maintain adequate liquidity) or dispose of assets.\nUnder the SBI Senior Secured Facilities and the SBI indentures governing the Notes (together, the \u201cIndentures\u201d), SBI may incur additional indebtedness. If new debt is added to its existing debt levels, the related risks that Spectrum Brands now faces would increase.\nFurthermore, a substantial portion of SBI\u2019s debt bears interest at variable rates. If market interest rates increase, the interest rate on SBI\u2019s variable rate debt will increase and will create higher debt service requirements, which would adversely affect SBI\u2019s cash flow and could adversely impact SBI\u2019s results of its operations. While SBI may enter into agreements limiting SBI\u2019s exposure to higher debt service requirements, any such agreements may not offer complete protection from this risk.\nRestrictive covenants in the SBI Senior Secured Facilities and the SBI Indentures may restrict SBI\u2019s ability to pursue its business strategies.\nThe SBI Senior Secured Facilities and the SBI Indentures each restrict, among other things, asset dispositions, mergers and acquisitions, dividends, stock repurchases and redemptions, other restricted payments, indebtedness and preferred stock, loans and investments, liens and affiliate transactions. The SBI Senior Secured Facilities and the SBI Indentures also contain customary events of default. These covenants could, among other things, limit SBI\u2019s ability to fund future working capital and capital expenditures, engage in future acquisitions or development activities, or otherwise realize the value of its assets and opportunities fully. In addition, the SBI Senior Secured Facilities and the SBI Indentures require SBI to dedicate a portion of cash flow from operations to payments on debt and the SBI Senior Secured Facilities contain financial covenants relating to maximum leverage and minimum interest coverage. Such requirements and covenants could limit the flexibility of SBI\u2019s restricted entities in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the industries in which they operate. SBI\u2019s ability to comply with these covenants is subject to certain events outside of its control. If SBI is unable to comply with these covenants, the lenders under SBI Senior Secured Facilities could terminate their commitments and the lenders under the SBI Senior Secured Facilities or the holders of the SBI Notes could accelerate repayment of its outstanding borrowings and, in either case, SBI may be unable to obtain adequate refinancing of outstanding borrowings on favorable terms or at all. If SBI is unable to repay outstanding borrowings when due, the lenders under the SBI Senior Secured Facilities will also have the right to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the indebtedness owed to them. If SBI\u2019s obligations under the SBI Senior Secured Facilities are accelerated, SBI cannot assure you that its assets would be sufficient to repay in full such indebtedness.\nThe sale or other disposition by HRG, the holder of a majority of the outstanding shares of Spectrum Brands\u2019 common stock, to non-affiliates of a sufficient amount of the common stock of Spectrum Brands would constitute a change of control under the agreements governing the Spectrum Brands\u2019 debt.\nHRG owns a majority of the outstanding shares of the common stock of Spectrum Brands. The sale or other disposition by HRG to non-affiliates of a sufficient amount of the common stock of Spectrum Brands could constitute a change of control under certain of the agreements governing Spectrum Brands\u2019 debt, including any foreclosure on or sale of Spectrum Brands\u2019 common stock pledged as collateral by HRG pursuant to the indenture governing HRG's 7.875% Senior Secured Notes due 2019. Under the SBI\u2019s Senior Secured Facilities, a change of control is an event of default and, if a change of control were to occur, Spectrum Brands would be required to obtain an amendment to these agreements to avoid a default. If Spectrum Brands was unable to obtain such an amendment, the lenders could accelerate the maturity of each of Spectrum Brands\u2019 Term Loan and the Revolver Facility. In addition, under the Indentures, upon a change of control of Spectrum Brands, Spectrum Brands is required to offer to repurchase such notes from the holders at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued interest or obtain a waiver of default from the holders of such notes. If Spectrum Brands was unable to make the change of control offer, or to obtain a waiver of default, it would be an event of default under the indentures that could allow holders of such notes to accelerate the maturity of the notes.\nSpectrum Brands participates in very competitive markets and it may not be able to compete successfully, causing Spectrum Brands to lose market share and sales.\nThe markets in which Spectrum Brands participates are very competitive. In the consumer battery market, Spectrum Brands\u2019 primary competitors are Duracell (a brand of Procter & Gamble), Energizer and Panasonic (a brand of Matsushita). In the electric shaving and grooming and electric personal care product markets, Spectrum Brands\u2019 primary competitors are Braun (a brand of Procter & Gamble), Norelco (a brand of Philips), and Vidal Sassoon and Revlon (brands of Helen of Troy). In the pet supplies market, Spectrum Brands\u2019 primary competitors are Mars, Hartz and Central Garden & Pet. In the home and garden business, Spectrum Brands\u2019 principal national competitors are Scotts, Central Garden & Pet and S.C. Johnson. Spectrum Brands\u2019 principal national competitors within its small appliances product category include Jarden Corporation, DeLonghi America, Euro-Pro Operating LLC, Metro Thebe, Inc., (d/b/a HWI Breville) NACCO Industries, Inc. (Hamilton Beach ) and SEB S.A. In the hardware and home improvement industry, Spectrum Brands\u2019 principal competitors are Schlage, a division of Allegion, Masco, Fortune Brands, Kohler and American Standard. In the global auto care business, Spectrum Brands\u2019 primary competitors are Valvoline, Prestone, Turtle Wax, Black Magic and Store brands.\nIn each of these markets, Spectrum Brands also faces competition from numerous other companies. In addition, in a number of Spectrum Brands\u2019 product lines, it competes with its retail customers, who use their own private label brands, and with distributors and foreign manufacturers of unbranded products. Significant new competitors or increased competition from existing competitors may adversely affect Spectrum Brands\u2019 business, financial condition and results of Spectrum Brands\u2019 operations.\nSpectrum Brands competes with its competitors for consumer acceptance and limited shelf space based upon brand name recognition, perceived product quality, price, performance, product features and enhancements, product packaging and design innovation, as well as creative marketing, promotion and distribution strategies, and new product introductions. Spectrum Brands\u2019 ability to compete in these consumer product markets may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nSpectrum Brands competes against many well-established companies that may have substantially greater financial and other resources, including personnel and research and development, and greater overall market share than Spectrum Brands.\n\u2022\nIn some key product lines, Spectrum Brands\u2019 competitors may have lower production costs and higher profit margins than it, which may enable them to compete more aggressively in offering retail discounts, rebates and other promotional incentives.\n\u2022\nTechnological advancements, product improvements or effective advertising campaigns by competitors may weaken consumer demand for Spectrum Brands\u2019 products.\n\u2022\nConsumer purchasing behavior may shift to distribution channels, including to online retailers, where Spectrum Brands and its customers do not have a strong presence.\n\u2022\nConsumer preferences may change to lower margin products or products other than those Spectrum Brands\u2019 markets.\n\u2022\nSpectrum Brands may not be successful in the introduction, marketing and manufacture of any new products or product innovations or be able to develop and introduce, in a timely manner, innovations to its existing products that satisfy customer needs or achieve market acceptance.\nSome competitors may be willing to reduce prices and accept lower profit margins to compete with Spectrum Brands. As a result of this competition, Spectrum Brands could lose market share and sales, or be forced to reduce its prices to meet competition. If Spectrum Brands\u2019 product offerings are unable to compete successfully, its sales, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, Spectrum Brands may be unable to implement changes to its products or otherwise adapt to changing consumer trends. If Spectrum Brands is unable to respond to changing consumer trends, its operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nSales of certain of Spectrum Brands\u2019 products are seasonal and may cause its operating results and working capital requirements to fluctuate.\nOn a consolidated basis Spectrum Brands\u2019 financial results are approximately equally weighted between quarters, however, sales of certain product categories tend to be seasonal. Sales in the consumer battery, electric shaving and grooming and electric personal care product categories, particularly in North America, tend to be concentrated in the December holiday season (Spectrum Brands\u2019 first fiscal quarter). Demand for hardware and home improvement products increases during the spring and summer construction period (Spectrum Brands\u2019 third and fourth fiscal quarters) and demand for pet supplies products remains fairly constant throughout the year. Demand for home and garden control products typically peaks during the first six months of the calendar year (Spectrum Brands\u2019 second and third fiscal quarters). Small Appliances peaks from July through December primarily due to the increased demand by customers in the late summer for \u201cback-to-school\u201d sales and in the fall for the holiday season. Demand for auto care products is generally at its highest during the period from March to June (Spectrum Brands\u2019 second and third fiscal quarters) based upon historical customer seasonal purchasing patterns and timing of promotional activities. As a result of this seasonality,\nSpectrum Brands\u2019 inventory and working capital needs fluctuate significantly throughout the year. In addition, orders from retailers are often made late in the period preceding the applicable peak season, making forecasting of production schedules and inventory purchases difficult. If Spectrum Brands is unable to accurately forecast and prepare for customer orders or its working capital needs, or there is a general downturn in business or economic conditions during these periods, its business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nAdverse weather conditions during Spectrum Brands\u2019 peak selling seasons for its home and garden control and auto care products could have a material adverse effect on its home and garden business and auto care business.\nWeather conditions have a significant impact on the timing and volume of sales of certain of its lawn and garden and household insecticide and repellent products. For example, periods of dry, hot weather can decrease insecticide sales, while periods of cold and wet weather can slow sales of herbicides. Adverse weather conditions during the first six months of the calendar year (Spectrum Brands\u2019 second and third fiscal quarters), when demand for home and garden control products typically peaks, could have a material adverse effect on its home and garden business and its financial results during such period. Weather can influence customer behavior for our auto care products, especially with appearance products, which sell best during warm, dry weather. There could be a material adverse effect on the auto care segment if the weather is cold or wet, especially during peak sales season.\nSpectrum Brands is subject to significant international business risks that could hurt its business and cause its results of operations to fluctuate.\nApproximately 40% of Spectrum Brands\u2019 net sales for Fiscal 2015 were to customers outside of the U.S. Spectrum Brands\u2019 pursuit of international growth opportunities may require significant investments for an extended period before returns on these investments, if any, are realized. Spectrum Brands\u2019 international operations are subject to risks including, among others:\n\u2022\ncurrency fluctuations, including, without limitation, fluctuations in the foreign exchange rate of the Euro, British Pound, Brazilian Real, Canadian Dollar, Australian Dollar, Japanese Yen and the Mexican Peso;\n\u2022\nchanges in the economic conditions or consumer preferences or demand for its products in these markets;\n\u2022\nthe risk that because its brand names may not be locally recognized, Spectrum Brands must spend significant amounts of time and money to build brand recognition without certainty that Spectrum Brands will be successful;\n\u2022\nlabor unrest;\n\u2022\npolitical and economic instability, as a result of war, terrorist attacks, pandemics, natural disasters or otherwise;\n\u2022\nlack of developed infrastructure;\n\u2022\nlonger payment cycles and greater difficulty in collecting accounts;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on transfers of funds;\n\u2022\nimport and export duties and quotas, as well as general transportation costs;\n\u2022\nchanges in domestic and international customs and tariffs;\n\u2022\nchanges in foreign labor laws and regulations affecting Spectrum Brands\u2019 ability to hire and retain employees;\n\u2022\ninadequate protection of intellectual property in foreign countries;\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in regulatory environments;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in complying with foreign law; and\n\u2022\nadverse tax consequences.\nThe foregoing factors may have a material adverse effect on Spectrum Brands\u2019 ability to increase or maintain its supply of products, financial condition or results of operations.\nSpectrum Brands\u2019 products utilize certain key raw materials; any significant increase in the price of, or change in supply and demand for, these raw materials could have a material and adverse effect on its business, financial condition and profits.\nThe principal raw materials used to produce Spectrum Brands\u2019 products-including zinc powder, brass, electrolytic manganese dioxide powder, petroleum-based plastic materials, steel, aluminum, copper and corrugated materials (for packaging)-are sourced either on a global or regional basis by Spectrum Brands or its suppliers, and the prices of those raw materials are susceptible to price fluctuations due to supply and demand trends, energy costs, transportation costs, government regulations, duties and tariffs, changes in currency exchange rates, price controls, general economic conditions and other unforeseen circumstances. In particular, during the years 2012 and 2013, Spectrum Brands experienced extraordinary price increases for raw materials, particularly as a result of strong demand from China. Although Spectrum Brands may increase the prices of certain of its goods to its customers, Spectrum Brands may not be able to pass all of these cost increases on to its customers. As a result, its margins may be adversely impacted by such cost increases. Spectrum Brands cannot provide any assurance that its sources of supply will not be interrupted due to changes in worldwide supply of or demand for raw materials or other events that interrupt material flow, which may have an adverse effect on its profitability and results of operations.\nSpectrum Brands regularly engages in forward purchase and hedging derivative transactions in an attempt to effectively manage and stabilize some of the raw material costs it expects to incur over the next 12 to 24 months. However, Spectrum Brands\u2019 hedging positions may not be effective, or may not anticipate beneficial trends, in a particular raw material market or may, as a result of changes in its business, no longer be useful for Spectrum Brands. In addition, for certain of the principal raw materials Spectrum Brands uses to produce its products, such as electrolytic manganese dioxide powder, there are no available effective hedging markets. If these efforts are not effective or expose Spectrum Brands to above average costs for an extended period of time, and Spectrum Brands is unable to pass its raw materials costs on to its customers, Spectrum Brands\u2019 future profitability may be materially and adversely affected. Furthermore, with respect to transportation costs, certain modes of delivery are subject to fuel surcharges which are determined based upon the current cost of diesel fuel in relation to pre-established agreed upon costs. Spectrum Brands may be unable to pass these fuel surcharges on to its customers, which may have an adverse effect on its profitability and results of operations.\nIn addition, Spectrum Brands has exclusivity arrangements and minimum purchase requirements with certain of its suppliers for the home and garden business, which increase its dependence upon and exposure to those suppliers. Some of those agreements include caps on the price Spectrum Brands pays for its supplies and in certain instances, these caps have allowed Spectrum Brands to purchase materials at below market prices. When Spectrum Brands attempts to renew those contracts, the other parties to the contracts may not be willing to include or may limit the effect of those caps and could even attempt to impose above market prices in an effort to make up for any below market prices paid by Spectrum Brands prior to the renewal of the agreement. Any failure to timely obtain suitable supplies at competitive prices could materially adversely affect Spectrum Brands\u2019 business, financial condition and results of operations.\nConsolidation of retailers and Spectrum Brands\u2019 dependence on a small number of key customers for a significant percentage of its sales may negatively affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs a result of consolidation of retailers and consumer trends toward national mass merchandisers, a significant percentage of Spectrum Brands\u2019 sales are attributable to a very limited group of customers. Spectrum Brands\u2019 largest customer accounted for approximately 15% of its consolidated net sales for Fiscal 2015. As these mass merchandisers and retailers grow larger and become more sophisticated, they may demand lower pricing, special packaging or impose other requirements on product suppliers. These business demands may relate to inventory practices, logistics or other aspects of the customer-supplier relationship. Because of the importance of these key customers, demands for price reductions or promotions, reductions in their purchases, changes in their financial condition or loss of their accounts could have a material adverse effect on Spectrum Brands\u2019 business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAlthough Spectrum Brands has long-established relationships with many of its customers, Spectrum Brands does not have long-term agreements with them and purchases are generally made through the use of individual purchase orders. Any significant reduction in purchases, failure to obtain anticipated orders or delays or cancellations of orders by any of these major customers, or significant pressure to reduce prices from any of these major customers, could have a material adverse effect on Spectrum Brands\u2019 business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, a significant deterioration in the financial condition of the retail industry in general, the bankruptcy of any of Spectrum Brands\u2019 customers or if any of Spectrum Brands\u2019 customers were to leave the business, could have a material adverse effect on Spectrum Brands\u2019 sales and profitability.\nIn addition, as a result of the desire of retailers to more closely manage inventory levels, there is a growing trend among them to purchase products on a \u201cjust-in-time\u201d basis. Due to a number of factors, including (i) manufacturing lead-times, (ii) seasonal purchasing patterns and (iii) the potential for material price increases, Spectrum Brands may be required to shorten its lead-time for production and more closely anticipate its retailers\u2019 and customers\u2019 demands, which could in the future requires it to carry additional inventories and increase its working capital and related financing requirements. This may increase the cost of warehousing inventory or result in excess inventory becoming difficult to manage, unusable or obsolete. In addition, if its retailers significantly change their inventory management strategies, Spectrum Brands may encounter difficulties in filling customer orders or in liquidating excess inventories, or may find that customers are cancelling orders or returning products, which may have a material adverse effect on its business.\nFurthermore, Spectrum Brands primarily sells branded products and a move by one or more of its large customers to sell significant quantities of private label products, which Spectrum Brands does not produce on their behalf and which directly compete with its products, could have a material adverse effect on Spectrum Brands\u2019 business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs a result of its international operations, Spectrum Brands faces a number of risks related to exchange rates and foreign currencies.\nSpectrum Brands\u2019 international sales and certain of its expenses are transacted in foreign currencies. During Fiscal 2015, approximately 40% of Spectrum Brands\u2019 net sales and operating expenses were denominated in foreign currencies. Spectrum Brands expects that the amount of its revenues and expenses transacted in foreign currencies will increase as its Latin American, European and Asian operations grow and as a result of acquisitions in these markets and, as a result, its exposure to risks associated with foreign currencies could increase accordingly. Significant changes in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to foreign currencies will affect Spectrum Brands\u2019 cost of goods sold and its operating margins and could result in exchange losses or\notherwise have a material effect on Spectrum Brands\u2019 business, financial condition and results of operations. Changes in currency exchange rates may also affect Spectrum Brands\u2019 sales to, purchases from, and loans to, its subsidiaries, as well as sales to, purchases from, and provided bank lines of credit with, its customers, suppliers and creditors that are denominated in foreign currencies.\nSpectrum Brands sources many products from China and other Asian countries. To the extent the Chinese Renminbi (\u201cRMB\u201d) or other currencies appreciate with respect to the U.S. dollar, Spectrum Brands may experience fluctuations in Spectrum Brands\u2019 results of operations. Since 2005, the RMB has no longer been pegged to the U.S. dollar at a constant exchange rate and instead fluctuates versus a basket of currencies. Although the People\u2019s Bank of China regularly intervenes in the foreign exchange market to prevent significant short-term fluctuations in the exchange rate, the RMB may appreciate or depreciate within a flexible peg range against the U.S. dollar in the medium to long term. Moreover, it is possible that in the future Chinese authorities may lift restrictions on fluctuations in the RMB exchange rate and lessen intervention in the foreign exchange market.\nWhile Spectrum Brands may enter into hedging transactions in the future, the availability and effectiveness of these transactions may be limited, and Spectrum Brands may not be able to successfully hedge its exposure to currency fluctuations. Further, Spectrum Brands may not be successful in implementing customer pricing or other actions in an effort to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations and, thus, its results of operations may be adversely impacted.\nSpectrum Brands\u2019 international operations may expose it to risks related to compliance with the laws and regulations of foreign countries.\nSpectrum Brands is subject to three EU Directives that may have a material impact on its business: Restriction of the Use of Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment; Waste of Electrical and Electronic Equipment and the Directive on Batteries and Accumulators and Waste Batteries, discussed below. Restriction of the Use of Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment requires Spectrum Brands to eliminate specified hazardous materials from products it sells in EU member states. Waste of Electrical and Electronic Equipment requires Spectrum Brands to collect and treat, dispose of or recycle certain products it manufactures or imports into the EU at its own expense. The EU Directive on Batteries and Accumulators and Waste Batteries bans heavy metals in batteries by establishing maximum quantities of heavy metals in batteries and mandates waste management of these batteries, including collection, recycling and disposal systems, with the costs imposed upon producers and importers such as Spectrum Brands. The costs associated with maintaining compliance or failing to comply with the EU Directives may harm Spectrum Brands\u2019 business. For example:\n\u2022\nAlthough contracts with its suppliers address related compliance issues, Spectrum Brands may be unable to procure appropriate Restriction of the Use of Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment compliant material in sufficient quantity and quality and/or be able to incorporate it into its product procurement processes without compromising quality and/or harming its cost structure.\n\u2022\nSpectrum Brands may face excess and obsolete inventory risk related to non-compliant inventory that it may hold for which there is reduced demand, and it may need to write down the carrying value of such inventories.\n\u2022\nSpectrum Brands may be unable to sell certain existing inventories of its batteries in Europe and other countries that have adopted similar regulations.\nMany of the developing countries in which Spectrum Brands operates do not have significant governmental regulation relating to environmental safety, occupational safety, employment practices or other business matters routinely regulated in the U.S. and EU or may not rigorously enforce such regulation. As these countries and their economies develop, it is possible that new regulations or increased enforcement of existing regulations may increase the expense of doing business in these countries. In addition, social legislation in many countries in which Spectrum Brands operates may result in significantly higher expenses associated with labor costs, terminating employees or distributors and closing manufacturing facilities. Increases in Spectrum Brands\u2019 costs as a result of increased regulation, legislation or enforcement could materially and adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition.\nSpectrum Brands may not be able to adequately establish and protect its intellectual property rights, and the infringement or loss of its intellectual property rights could harm its business.\nTo establish and protect its intellectual property rights, Spectrum Brands relies upon a combination of national, foreign and multi-national patent, trademark and trade secret laws, together with licenses, confidentiality agreements and other contractual arrangements. The measures that Spectrum Brands takes to protect its intellectual property rights may prove inadequate to prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating its intellectual property. Spectrum Brands may need to resort to litigation to enforce or defend its intellectual property rights. If a competitor or collaborator files a patent application claiming technology also claimed by Spectrum Brands, or a trademark application claiming a trademark, service mark or trade dress also used by Spectrum Brands, in order to protect its rights, it may have to participate in expensive and time consuming opposition or interference proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or a similar foreign agency. Similarly, its intellectual property rights may be challenged by third parties or invalidated through administrative process or litigation. The costs associated with protecting intellectual property rights, including litigation costs, may be material. Furthermore, even if Spectrum Brands\u2019 intellectual property\nrights are not directly challenged, disputes among third parties could lead to the weakening or invalidation of its intellectual property rights, or its competitors may independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to its technology. Obtaining, protecting and defending intellectual property rights can be time consuming and expensive, and may require Spectrum Brands to incur substantial costs, including the diversion of the time and resources of management and technical personnel.\nMoreover, the laws of certain foreign countries in which Spectrum Brands operates or may operate in the future do not protect, and the governments of certain foreign countries do not enforce, intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws and government of the U.S., which may negate Spectrum Brands\u2019 competitive or technological advantages in such markets. Also, some of the technology underlying Spectrum Brands\u2019 products is the subject of nonexclusive licenses from third parties. As a result, this technology could be made available to Spectrum Brands\u2019 competitors at any time. If Spectrum Brands is unable to establish and then adequately protect its intellectual property rights, its business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nSpectrum Brands licenses various trademarks, trade names and patents from third parties for certain of its products. These licenses generally place marketing obligations on Spectrum Brands and require Spectrum Brands to pay fees and royalties based on net sales or profits. Typically, these licenses may be terminated if Spectrum Brands fails to satisfy certain minimum sales obligations or if it breaches the terms of the license. The termination of these licensing arrangements could adversely affect Spectrum Brands\u2019 business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn Spectrum Brands\u2019 Global Batteries & Appliances segment, Spectrum Brands licenses the use of the Black and Decker brand for marketing in certain small household appliances in North America, South America (excluding Brazil) and the Caribbean. In July 2014, BDC extended the license agreement through December 2018. The failure to renew the license agreement with BDC or to enter into a new agreement on acceptable terms for the period following December 2018 could have a material adverse effect on Spectrum Brands\u2019 financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. Additionally, in connection with Spectrum Brands\u2019 acquisition of the HHI Business, it received a limited right to use certain Stanley Black and Decker trademarks, brand names and logos in marketing Spectrum Brands\u2019 products and services for only five years. Pursuant to a transitional trademark license agreement, Stanley Black and Decker granted Spectrum Brands the right to use the \u201cStanley\u201d and \u201cBlack and Decker\u201d marks and logos, and certain other marks and logos, for up to five years after the completion of the HHI Business acquisition in connection with certain products and services. With Spectrum Brands\u2019 right to use these Stanley Black and Decker trademarks, brand names and logos expires, Spectrum Brands may not be able to maintain or enjoy comparable name recognition or status under its new brand. If Spectrum Brands is unable to successfully manage the transition of its business to its new brand, Spectrum Brands\u2019 reputation among its customers could be adversely affected, and its revenue and profitability could decline.\nClaims by third parties that Spectrum Brands is infringing their intellectual property and other litigation could adversely affect its business.\nFrom time to time in the past Spectrum Brands has been subject to claims that it is infringing the intellectual property of others. Spectrum Brands currently is the subject of such claims and it is possible that third parties will assert infringement claims against Spectrum Brands in the future. An adverse finding against Spectrum Brands in these or similar trademark or other intellectual property litigations may have a material adverse effect on Spectrum Brands\u2019 business, financial condition and results of operations. Any such claims, with or without merit, could be time consuming and expensive, and may require Spectrum Brands to incur substantial costs, including the diversion of the resources of management and technical personnel, cause product delays or require Spectrum Brands to enter into licensing or other agreements in order to secure continued access to necessary or desirable intellectual property. If Spectrum Brands is deemed to be infringing a third party\u2019s intellectual property and is unable to continue using that intellectual property as it had been, its business and results of operations could be harmed if it is unable to successfully develop non-infringing alternative intellectual property on a timely basis or license non-infringing alternatives or substitutes, if any exist, on commercially reasonable terms. In addition, an unfavorable ruling in intellectual property litigation could subject Spectrum Brands to significant liability, as well as require Spectrum Brands to cease developing, manufacturing or selling the affected products or using the affected processes or trademarks. Any significant restriction on Spectrum Brands\u2019 proprietary or licensed intellectual property that impedes its ability to develop and commercialize its products could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSpectrum Brands\u2019 dependence on a few suppliers and one of its U.S. facilities for certain of its products makes it vulnerable to a disruption in the supply of its products.\nAlthough Spectrum Brands has long-standing relationships with many of its suppliers, it generally does not have long-term contracts with them. An adverse change in any of the following could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations:\n\u2022\nits ability to identify and develop relationships with qualified suppliers;\n\u2022\nthe terms and conditions upon which it purchases products from its suppliers, including applicable exchange rates, transport and other costs, its suppliers\u2019 willingness to extend credit to Spectrum Brands to finance its inventory purchases and other factors beyond its control;\n\u2022\nthe financial condition of its suppliers;\n\u2022\npolitical and economic instability in the countries in which its suppliers are located, as a result of war, terrorist attacks, pandemics, natural disasters or otherwise;\n\u2022\nits ability to import outsourced products;\n\u2022\nits suppliers\u2019 noncompliance with applicable laws, trade restrictions and tariffs; or\n\u2022\nits suppliers\u2019 ability to manufacture and deliver outsourced products according to its standards of quality on a timely and efficient basis.\nIf Spectrum Brands\u2019 relationship with one of its key suppliers is adversely affected, Spectrum Brands may not be able to quickly or effectively replace such supplier and may not be able to retrieve tooling, molds or other specialized production equipment or processes used by such supplier in the manufacture of its products. The loss of one or more of its suppliers, a material reduction in their supply of products or provision of services to Spectrum Brands or extended disruptions or interruptions in their operations could have a material adverse effect on Spectrum Brands\u2019 business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSpectrum Brands manufactures the majority of its foil cutting systems for its shaving product lines, using specially designed machines and proprietary cutting technology, at its Portage, Wisconsin facility. In addition, Spectrum Brands also manufactures the majority of its residential door locks at its Subic Bay, Philippines facility. Spectrum Brands\u2019 home and garden products are mainly manufactured from its St. Louis, Missouri, facility. Damage to these facilities, or prolonged interruption in the operations of these facilities whether for repairs, as a result of labor difficulties or for other reasons, could have a material adverse effect on its ability to manufacture and sell its foil shaving, residential door locks and home and garden products, which could in turn harm its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSpectrum Brands faces risks related to its sales of products obtained from third-party suppliers.\nSpectrum Brands sells a significant number of products that are manufactured by third party suppliers over which it has no direct control. While Spectrum Brands has implemented processes and procedures to try to ensure that the suppliers it uses are complying with all applicable regulations, there can be no assurances that such suppliers in all instances will comply with such processes and procedures or otherwise with applicable regulations. Noncompliance could result in Spectrum Brands\u2019 marketing and distribution of contaminated, defective or dangerous products which could subject it to liabilities and could result in the imposition by governmental authorities of procedures or penalties that could restrict or eliminate its ability to purchase products from non-compliant suppliers. Any or all of these effects could adversely affect Spectrum Brands\u2019 business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, the Dodd-Frank Act includes provisions regarding certain minerals and metals, known as conflict minerals, mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries. These provisions require companies to undertake due diligence procedures and report on the use of conflict minerals in its products, including products manufactured by third parties. Compliance with these provisions will cause Spectrum Brands to incur costs to certify that its supply chain is conflict free and Spectrum Brands may face difficulties if its suppliers are unwilling or unable to verify the source of their materials. Spectrum Brands\u2019 ability to source these minerals and metals may also be adversely impacted. In addition, Spectrum Brands\u2019 customers may require that it provides them with a certification and its inability to do so may disqualify it as a supplier.\nClass action and derivative action lawsuits and other investigations, regardless of their merits, could have an adverse effect on Spectrum Brands\u2019 business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSpectrum Brands and certain of its officers and directors have been named in the past, and, may be named in the future, as defendants of class action and derivative action lawsuits. In the past, Spectrum Brands has also received requests for information from government authorities. Regardless of their subject matter or merits, class action lawsuits and other government investigations may result in significant cost to Spectrum Brands, which may not be covered by insurance, may divert the attention of management or may otherwise have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSpectrum Brands may be exposed to significant product liability claims which its insurance may not cover and which could harm its reputation.\nIn the ordinary course of its business, Spectrum Brands may be named as a defendant in lawsuits involving product liability claims. In any such proceeding, plaintiffs may seek to recover large and sometimes unspecified amounts of damages and the matters may remain unresolved for several years. Any such matters could have a material adverse effect on Spectrum Brands\u2019 business, results of operations and financial condition if it is unable to successfully defend against or settle these matters or if its insurance coverage is insufficient to satisfy any judgments against it or settlements relating to these matters. Although Spectrum Brands has product liability insurance coverage and an excess umbrella policy, its insurance policies may not provide coverage for certain, or any, claims against Spectrum Brands or may not be sufficient to cover all possible liabilities. Additionally, Spectrum\nBrands does not maintain product recall insurance. Spectrum Brands may not be able to maintain such insurance on acceptable terms, if at all, in the future. Moreover, any adverse publicity arising from claims made against Spectrum Brands, even if the claims were not successful, could adversely affect the reputation and sales of its products. In particular, product recalls or product liability claims challenging the safety of Spectrum Brands\u2019 products may result in a decline in sales for a particular product and could damage the reputation or the value of the related brand. This could be true even if the claims themselves are ultimately settled for immaterial amounts. This type of adverse publicity could occur and product liability claims could be made in the future.\nSpectrum Brands may incur material capital and other costs due to environmental liabilities.\nSpectrum Brands is subject to a broad range of federal, state, local, foreign and multi-national laws and regulations relating to the environment. These include laws and regulations that govern:\n\u2022discharges to the air, water and land;\n\u2022the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous substances and wastes; and\n\u2022\nremediation of contamination associated with release of hazardous substances at its facilities and at off-site disposal locations.\nRisk of environmental liability is inherent in Spectrum Brands\u2019 business. As a result, material environmental costs may arise in the future. In particular, it may incur capital and other costs to comply with increasingly stringent environmental laws and enforcement policies, such as the EU Directives: Restriction of the Use of Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment, Waste of Electrical and Electronic Equipment and the Directive on Batteries and Accumulators and Waste Batteries, discussed above. Spectrum Brands\u2019 international operations may expose Spectrum Brands to risks related to compliance with the laws and regulations of foreign countries. See Part I, Item 1A. \u201cRisk Factors-Risks Related to Spectrum Brands\u2019 Business-Spectrum Brands\u2019 international operations may expose Spectrum Brands to risks related to compliance with the laws and regulations of foreign countries.\u201d\nMoreover, there are proposed international accords and treaties, as well as federal, state and local laws and regulations that would attempt to control or limit the causes of climate change, including the effect of greenhouse gas emissions on the environment. In the event that the U.S. government or foreign governments enact new climate change laws or regulations or make changes to existing laws or regulations, compliance with applicable laws or regulations may result in increased manufacturing costs for Spectrum Brands\u2019 products, such as by requiring investment in new pollution control equipment or changing the ways in which certain of its products are made Spectrum Brands may incur some of these costs directly and others may be passed on to it from its third-party suppliers. Although Spectrum Brands believes that it is substantially in compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations at its facilities, Spectrum Brands may not always be in compliance with such laws and regulations or any new laws and regulations in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on Spectrum Brands\u2019 business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFrom time to time, Spectrum Brands has been required to address the effect of historic activities on the environmental condition of its properties or former properties. Spectrum Brands has not conducted invasive testing at all of its facilities to identify all potential environmental liability risks. Given the age of its facilities and the nature of its operations, material liabilities may arise in the future in connection with its current or former facilities. If previously unknown contamination of property underlying or in the vicinity of its manufacturing facilities is discovered, Spectrum Brands could be required to incur material unforeseen expenses. If this occurs, it may have a material adverse effect on Spectrum Brands\u2019 business, financial condition and results of operations. Spectrum Brands is currently engaged in investigative or remedial projects at a few of its facilities and any liabilities arising from such investigative or remedial projects at such facilities may have a material effect on Spectrum Brands\u2019 business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, in connection with business acquisitions, Spectrum Brands has assumed, and in connection with future acquisitions may assume in the future, certain potential environmental liabilities. To the extent Spectrum Brands has not identified such environmental liabilities or to the extent the indemnifications obtained from Spectrum Brands\u2019 counterparties are insufficient to cover such environmental liabilities, these environmental liabilities could have a material adverse effect on Spectrum Brands\u2019 business.\nSpectrum Brands is also subject to proceedings related to its disposal of industrial and hazardous material at off-site disposal locations or similar disposals made by other parties for which it is responsible as a result of its relationship with such other parties. These proceedings are under CERCLA or similar state or foreign jurisdiction laws that hold persons who \u201carranged for\u201d the disposal or treatment of such substances strictly liable for costs incurred in responding to the release or threatened release of hazardous substances from such sites, regardless of fault or the lawfulness of the original disposal. Liability under CERCLA is typically joint and several, meaning that a liable party may be responsible for all of the costs incurred in investigating and remediating contamination at a site. Spectrum Brands occasionally is identified by federal or state governmental agencies as being a potentially responsible party for response actions contemplated at an off-site facility. At the existing sites where Spectrum Brands has been notified of its status as a potentially responsible party, it is either premature to determine if Spectrum Brands\u2019 potential liability, if any, will be material or it does not believe that its liability, if any, will be material. Spectrum Brands may be named as a potentially responsible party under CERCLA or similar state or foreign jurisdiction laws in the future for other sites\nnot currently known to Spectrum Brands, and the costs and liabilities associated with these sites may have a material adverse effect on Spectrum Brands\u2019 business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCompliance with various public health, consumer protection and other regulations applicable to Spectrum Brands\u2019 products and facilities could increase its cost of doing business and expose Spectrum Brands to additional requirements with which Spectrum Brands may be unable to comply.\nCertain of Spectrum Brands\u2019 products sold through, and facilities operated under, each of its business segments are regulated by the EPA the FDA or other federal consumer protection and product safety agencies and are subject to the regulations such agencies enforce, as well as by similar state, foreign and multinational agencies and regulations. For example, in the U.S., all products containing pesticides must be registered with the EPA and, in many cases, similar state and foreign agencies before they can be manufactured or sold. Spectrum Brands\u2019 inability to obtain, or the cancellation of, any registration could have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations. The severity of the effect would depend on which products were involved, whether another product could be substituted and whether its competitors were similarly affected. Spectrum Brands attempts to anticipate regulatory developments and maintain registrations of, and access to, substitute chemicals and other ingredients, but it may not always be able to avoid or minimize these risks.\nAs a distributor of consumer products in the U.S., certain of Spectrum Brands\u2019 products are also subject to the Consumer Product Safety Act, which empowers the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (the \u201cConsumer Commission\u201d) to exclude from the market products that are found to be unsafe or hazardous. Under certain circumstances, the Consumer Commission could require it to repair, replace or refund the purchase price of one or more of its products, or it may voluntarily do so. Any additional repurchases or recalls of Spectrum Brands\u2019 products could be costly to Spectrum Brands and could damage the reputation or the value of its brands. If Spectrum Brands is required to remove, or Spectrum Brands voluntarily removes its products from the market, its reputation or brands could be tarnished and it may have large quantities of finished products that could not be sold. Furthermore, failure to timely notify the Consumer Commission of a potential safety hazard can result in significant fines being assessed against Spectrum Brands. Additionally, laws regulating certain consumer products exist in some states, as well as in other countries in which Spectrum Brands sells its products, and more restrictive laws and regulations may be adopted in the future.\nThe Food Quality Protection Act (\u201cFQPA\u201d) established a standard for food-use pesticides, which is that a reasonable certainty of no harm will result from the cumulative effect of pesticide exposures. Under the FQPA, the EPA is evaluating the cumulative effects from dietary and non-dietary exposures to pesticides. The pesticides in certain of Spectrum Brands\u2019 products that are sold through the Home and Garden Business continue to be evaluated by the EPA as part of this program. It is possible that the EPA or a third party active ingredient registrant may decide that a pesticide Spectrum Brands uses in its products will be limited or made unavailable to Spectrum Brands. Spectrum Brands cannot predict the outcome or the severity of the effect of the EPA\u2019s continuing evaluations of active ingredients used in its products.\nIn addition, the use of certain pesticide products that are sold through Spectrum Brands\u2019 Home and Garden Business may, among other things, be regulated by various local, state, federal and foreign environmental and public health agencies. These regulations may require that only certified or professional users apply the product, that users post notices on properties where products have been or will be applied or that certain ingredients may not be used. Compliance with such public health regulations could increase Spectrum Brands\u2019 cost of doing business and expose Spectrum Brands to additional requirements with which it may be unable to comply.\nAny failure to comply with these laws or regulations, or the terms of applicable environmental permits, could result in Spectrum Brands incurring substantial costs, including fines, penalties and other civil and criminal sanctions or the prohibition of sales of its pest control products. Environmental law requirements, and the enforcement thereof, change frequently, have tended to become more stringent over time and could require Spectrum Brands to incur significant expenses.\nMost federal, state and local authorities require certification by Underwriters Laboratory, Inc. (\u201cUL\u201d), an independent, not-for-profit corporation engaged in the testing of products for compliance with certain public safety standards, or other safety regulation certification prior to marketing electrical appliances. Foreign jurisdictions also have regulatory authorities overseeing the safety of consumer products. Spectrum Brands\u2019 products may not meet the specifications required by these authorities. A determination that any of its products are not in compliance with these rules and regulations could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants.\nPublic perceptions that some of the products Spectrum Brands produces and markets are not safe could adversely affect Spectrum Brands.\nOn occasion, Spectrum Brands\u2019 customers have alleged that some products failed to perform up to expectations or have caused damage or injury to individuals or property. Public perception that any of its products are not safe, whether justified or not, could impair Spectrum Brands\u2019 reputation, damage its brand names and have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, Spectrum Brands relies on certain third party trademarks, brand names and logos which it does not have exclusive use of. Public perception that any such third party trademarks, brand names and logos used by Spectrum\nBrands are not safe, whether justified or not, could have a material adverse effect on Spectrum Brands\u2019 business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf Spectrum Brands is unable to negotiate satisfactory terms to continue existing or enter into additional collective bargaining agreements, Spectrum Brands may experience an increased risk of labor disruptions and its results of operations and financial condition may suffer.\nApproximately 16% of Spectrum Brands\u2019 total labor force is covered by collective bargaining agreements. There are 4 collective bargaining agreements that will expire during its fiscal year ending September 30, 2016, which cover approximately 60% of the labor force under collective bargaining agreements, or approximately 10% of Spectrum Brands\u2019 total labor force. While Spectrum Brands currently expects to negotiate continuations to the terms of these agreements, there can be no assurances that it will be able to obtain terms that are satisfactory to it or otherwise to reach agreement at all with the applicable parties. In addition, in the course of its business, Spectrum Brands may also become subject to additional collective bargaining agreements. These agreements may be on terms that are less favorable than those under its current collective bargaining agreements. Spectrum Brands\u2019 increased exposure to collective bargaining agreements, whether on terms more or less favorable than its existing collective bargaining agreements, could adversely affect the operation of its business, including through increased labor expenses. While it intends to comply with all collective bargaining agreements to which it is subject, there can be no assurances that Spectrum Brands will be able to do so and any noncompliance could subject it to disruptions in its operations and materially and adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition.\nSignificant changes in actual investment return on pension assets, discount rates and other factors could affect Spectrum Brands\u2019 results of operations, equity and pension contributions in future periods.\nSpectrum Brands\u2019 results of operations may be positively or negatively affected by the amount of income or expense it records for its defined benefit pension plans. U.S. GAAP requires that Spectrum Brands calculate income or expense for the plans using actuarial valuations. These valuations reflect assumptions about financial markets and other economic conditions, which may change based on changes in key economic indicators. The most significant assumptions Spectrum Brands uses to estimate pension income or expense are the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. In addition, Spectrum Brands is required to make an annual measurement of plan assets and liabilities, which may result in a significant change to equity. Although pension expense and pension funding contributions are not directly related, key economic factors that affect pension expense would also likely affect the amount of cash Spectrum Brands would contribute to pension plans as required under ERISA.\nIf Spectrum Brands\u2019 goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets or other long-term assets become impaired, Spectrum Brands will be required to record additional impairment charges, which may be significant.\nA significant portion of Spectrum Brands\u2019 long-term assets consist of goodwill, other indefinite-lived intangible assets and finite-lived intangible assets recorded as a result of past acquisitions as well as through fresh start reporting. Spectrum Brands does not amortize goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, but rather reviews them for impairment on a periodic basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. Spectrum Brands considers whether circumstances or conditions exist which suggest that the carrying value of its goodwill and other long-lived intangible assets might be impaired. If such circumstances or conditions exist, further steps are required in order to determine whether the carrying value of each of the individual assets exceeds its fair value. If analysis indicates that an individual asset\u2019s carrying value does exceed its fair value, the next step is to record a loss equal to the excess of the individual asset\u2019s carrying value over its fair value.\nThe steps required by U.S. GAAP entail significant amounts of judgment and subjectivity. Events and changes in circumstances that may indicate that there may be an impairment and which may indicate that interim impairment testing is necessary include, but are not limited to: strategic decisions to exit a business or dispose of an asset made in response to changes in economic, political and competitive conditions; the impact of the economic environment on the customer base and on broad market conditions that drive valuation considerations by market participants; Spectrum Brands\u2019 internal expectations with regard to future revenue growth and the assumptions Spectrum Brands makes when performing impairment reviews; a significant decrease in the market price of Spectrum Brands\u2019 assets; a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which Spectrum Brands\u2019 assets are used; a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect Spectrum Brands\u2019 assets; an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition of an asset; and significant changes in the cash flows associated with an asset. As a result of such circumstances, Spectrum Brands may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in its financial statements during the period in which any impairment of its goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets or other long-term assets is determined. Any such impairment charges could have a material adverse effect on Spectrum Brands\u2019 business, financial condition and operating results.\nIf Spectrum Brands is unable to protect the confidentiality of its proprietary information and know-how, the value of Spectrum Brands\u2019 technology, products and services could be harmed significantly.\nSpectrum Brands relies on trade secrets, know-how and other proprietary information in operating its business. If this information is not adequately protected, then it may be disclosed or used in an unauthorized manner. To the extent that consultants, key\nemployees or other third parties apply technological information independently developed by them or by others to its proposed products, disputes may arise as to the proprietary rights to such information, which may not be resolved in Spectrum Brands\u2019 favor. The risk that other parties may breach confidentiality agreements or that Spectrum Brands\u2019 trade secrets become known or independently discovered by competitors, could harm Spectrum Brands by enabling its competitors, who may have greater experience and financial resources, to copy or use Spectrum Brands\u2019 trade secrets and other proprietary information in the advancement of their products, methods or technologies. The disclosure of Spectrum Brands\u2019 trade secrets would impair its competitive position, thereby weakening demand for its products or services and harming Spectrum Brands\u2019 ability to maintain or increase its customer base.\nSignificant costs have been incurred and are expected to be incurred in connection with the consummation of recent and future business acquisitions and the integration of such acquired businesses with Spectrum Brands into a combined company, including legal, accounting, financial advisory and other costs.\nSpectrum Brands expects to incur one-time costs in connection with integrating Spectrum Brands\u2019 operations, products and personnel and those of the businesses Spectrum Brands acquires into a combined company, in addition to costs related directly to completing such acquisitions. Spectrum Brands would expect similar costs to be incurred with any future acquisition. These costs may include expenditures for:\n\u2022employee redeployment, relocation or severance;\n\u2022integration of operations and information systems;\n\u2022combination of research and development teams and processes; and\n\u2022reorganization or closures of facilities.\nIn addition, Spectrum Brands expects to incur a number of non-recurring costs associated with combining its operations with those of acquired businesses. Additional unanticipated costs may yet be incurred as Spectrum Brands integrates its business with acquired businesses. Although Spectrum Brands expects that the elimination of duplicative costs, as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of its operations with those of acquired businesses, may offset incremental transaction and transaction-related costs over time, this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term. Additionally, while Spectrum Brands expects to benefit from leveraging distribution channels and brand names among Spectrum Brands and its acquired businesses, Spectrum Brands cannot assure you that it will achieve such benefits.\nSpectrum Brands may not realize the anticipated benefits of, and synergies from, its business acquisitions and may become responsible for certain liabilities and integration costs as a result.\nBusiness acquisitions involve the integration of new businesses that have previously operated independently from Spectrum Brands. The integration of Spectrum Brands\u2019 operations with those of acquired businesses is frequently expected to result in financial and operational benefits, including increased top line growth, margins, revenues and cost savings and be accretive to earnings per share, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and free cash flow before synergies. There can be no assurance, however, regarding when or the extent to which Spectrum Brands will be able to realize these increased top line growth, margins, revenues, cost savings or accretions to earnings per share, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization or free cash flow or other benefits. Integration may also be difficult, unpredictable, and subject to delay because of possible company culture conflicts and different opinions on technical decisions and product roadmaps. Spectrum Brands will often be required to integrate or, in some cases, replace, numerous systems, including those involving management information, purchasing, accounting and finance, sales, billing, employee benefits, payroll and regulatory compliance, many of which may be dissimilar. In some instances, Spectrum Brands and certain acquired businesses have served the same customers, and some customers may decide that it is desirable to have additional or different suppliers. Difficulties associated with the integration of acquired businesses could have a material adverse effect on Spectrum Brands\u2019 business.\nSpectrum Brands may also acquire partial or full ownership in businesses or may acquire rights to market and distribute particular products or lines of products. The acquisition of a business or the rights to market specific products or use specific product names may involve a financial commitment by Spectrum Brands, either in the form of cash or equity consideration. In the case of a new license, such commitments are usually in the form of prepaid royalties and future minimum royalty payments. There is no guarantee that Spectrum Brands will acquire businesses or product distribution rights that will contribute positively to its earnings. Anticipated synergies may not materialize, cost savings may be less than expected, sales of products may not meet expectations and acquired businesses may carry unexpected liabilities.\nIn addition, in connection with business acquisitions, Spectrum Brands has assumed, and may assume in connection with future acquisitions, certain potential liabilities. To the extent such liabilities are not identified by Spectrum Brands or to the extent the indemnifications obtained from third parties are insufficient to cover such liabilities, these liabilities could have a material adverse effect on Spectrum Brands\u2019 business.\nIntegrating Spectrum Brands\u2019 business with acquired businesses may divert its management\u2019s attention away from operations.\nSuccessful integration of acquired businesses\u2019 operations, products and personnel with Spectrum Brands may place a significant burden on its management and other internal resources. The diversion of management\u2019s attention, and any difficulties encountered in the transition and integration process, could harm its business, financial condition and operating results.\nGeneral customer uncertainty related to Spectrum Brands\u2019 business acquisitions could harm Spectrum Brands.\nSpectrum Brands\u2019 customers may, in response to the announcement or consummation of a business acquisition, delay or defer purchasing decisions. If Spectrum Brands\u2019 customers delay or defer purchasing decisions, its revenues could materially decline or any anticipated increases in revenue could be lower than expected.\nSpectrum Brands is required to supply certain products and services to Stanley Black & Decker and its subsidiaries pursuant to the terms of certain supply agreements for a period of time after the completion of the HHI Business acquisition. Our provision of products and services under these agreements require us to dedicate resources of the HHI Business and may result in unfavorable results to us.\nCertain products and services currently used by Stanley Black and Decker are produced and provided using equipment of the HHI Business which includes the acquired Tong Lung Metal Industry Co. Ltd. (the \u201cTLM Business\u201d) that Spectrum Brands acquired or certain equipment belonging to Stanley Black and Decker and its subsidiaries that will continue to be located for a period of time after the completion of the HHI Business acquisition at facilities operated by the HHI Business and the TLM Business and maintained by Spectrum Brands pursuant to certain specifications. Spectrum Brands and Stanley Black and Decker entered into supply agreements (each, a \u201cSupply Agreement\u201d) whereby Spectrum Brands provides Stanley Black and Decker and its subsidiaries with certain of these products and services for a period of time. This requires Spectrum Brands to dedicate resources of the HHI Business and the TLM Business towards the provision of these products and services and may result in unfavorable results to Spectrum Brands. These Supply Agreements are an accommodation to Stanley Black and Decker and its subsidiaries as part of the HHI Business acquisition, and the pricing of the products and services is on terms more favorable to Stanley Black and Decker and its subsidiaries than it would be in the ordinary course of business.\nSpectrum Brands faces significant risks from the AAG acquisition similar to risks generally associated with its acquisition and expansion strategy.\nThe AAG acquisition subjects Spectrum Brands to significant risks generally associated with its acquisition and expansion strategy. Significant costs have been incurred and are expected to be incurred in connection with the AAG acquisition and Spectrum Brands\u2019 integration of AAG with its business, including legal, accounting, financial advisory and other costs. Spectrum Brands may also not realize the anticipated benefits of, and synergies from, the AAG acquisition and will be responsible for certain liabilities and integration costs as a result of the AAG acquisition. As a result of the AAG acquisition and other acquisitions, Spectrum Brands may also not be able to retain key personnel or recruit additional qualified personnel, which could require Spectrum Brands to incur substantial additional costs. Each of these general risks for acquisition and expansion activities, which are described in more detail herein, could result in the AAG acquisition having a material adverse effect on Spectrum Brands\u2019 business.\nRisks Related to FGL\u2019s and Front Street\u2019s Businesses\nThe FGL Merger is subject to various closing conditions, including regulatory approvals\nThe completion of the FGL Merger is subject to various closing conditions, including, but not limited to, (1) the information statement to be filed by FGL with the SEC in connection with the FGL Merger shall have been cleared by the SEC and shall have been sent to stockholders of FGL (in accordance with Regulation 14C under the Exchange Act at least 20 days prior to the closing), (2) the absence of any law or order enacted, issued or enforced that is in effect and that makes the consummation of the FGL Merger illegal, prevents, prohibits, restrains or enjoins the consummation of the FGL Merger and (3) obtaining the requisite approvals from the IID, NYDFS, Vermont Department of Financial Regulation, China Insurance Regulatory Commission and the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. A number of the closing conditions are outside of FGL\u2019s control and it cannot predict with certainty whether all of the required closing conditions will be satisfied or waived or if other uncertainties may arise. In addition, regulators could impose additional requirements or obligations as conditions for their approvals, which may be burdensome. Despite FGL\u2019s best efforts, FGL may not be able to satisfy the various closing conditions or obtain the necessary waivers or approvals in a timely fashion or at all, in which case the FGL Merger could be prevented or delayed.\nFailure to timely complete the FGL Merger could adversely impact FGL\u2019s stock price, business, financial condition and results of operations\nA failure to complete the FGL Merger on a timely basis or at all could result in negative publicity and cause the price of FGL\u2019s common stock to decline, in particular because FGL\u2019s current stock price reflects a market assumption that the FGL Merger will occur. In addition, as a result of the announcement of the FGL Merger Agreement, trading in FGL\u2019s stock has increased substantially. If the FGL Merger is not consummated, the investment goals of FGL\u2019s stockholders may be materially different than those of FGL\u2019s stockholders on a pre-Merger announcement basis. In addition, FGL will remain liable for significant transaction costs\nthat will be payable even if the FGL Merger is not completed and could also be required to pay a termination fee to Anbang in certain specific circumstances.\nThe FGL Merger and operating restrictions contained in the FGL Merger Agreement could adversely affect FGL\u2019s business and operations\nThe FGL Merger and certain interim operating covenants in the FGL Merger Agreement that govern the conduct of FGL\u2019s business during the pendency of the FGL Merger could cause disruptions to FGL\u2019s business and business relationships, which could have an adverse impact on FGL\u2019s results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. For example, the attention of FGL\u2019s management may be directed to Merger-related considerations, FGL\u2019s current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with FGL, which may adversely affect FGL\u2019s ability to retain and hire key personnel, and parties with which FGL has business relationships, including customers, potential customers and distributors, may experience uncertainty as to the future of such relationships and seek alternative relationships or seek to alter their present business relationships with FGL in a manner that negatively impacts FGL.\nShareholder litigation against FGL, its directors and/or Anbang could delay or prevent the FGL Merger and cause FGL to incur significant costs and expenses\nTransactions such as the FGL Merger are often subject to lawsuits by shareholders. Conditions to the closing of the FGL Merger require that no law or order must have been enacted, issued or enforced and in effect, that would make the consummation of the FGL Merger illegal, prevent, prohibit, restrain or enjoin the consummation of the FGL Merger. FGL cannot provide assurance as to the outcome of any potential lawsuits, including the costs associated with defending the claims or any other liabilities that may be incurred in connection with the litigation or settlement of lawsuits.\nFGL\u2019s and Front Street\u2019s results of operations and financial condition depend on the accuracy of a broad range of assumptions and estimates made by their respective management teams.\nFGL and Front Street make certain assumptions and estimates regarding mortality, persistency, expenses, interest rates, tax liability, business mix, frequency of claims, contingent liabilities, investment performance and other factors related to their businesses and anticipated results. FGL and Front Street rely on these assumptions and estimates to determine the amounts of DAC and VOBA policy liabilities and accruals, future earnings and various components of their consolidated balance sheets. These assumptions are also used in making decisions crucial to the operation of their business, including the pricing of products and expense structures related to products. The calculations FGL and Front Street use to estimate various components of their balance sheets and consolidated statements of operations are necessarily complex and involve analyzing and interpreting large quantities of data. The assumptions and estimates required for these calculations involve judgment and by their nature are imprecise and subject to changes and revisions over time. These assumptions and estimates incorporate many factors, none of which can be predicted with certainty. To the extent their actual experience and changes in estimates differ from original estimates and assumptions, FGL\u2019s and Front Street\u2019s businesses, Consolidated Statements of Operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected. Accordingly, their results may be adversely affected by changes resulting from implementing more sophisticated administrative systems and procedures that facilitate the calculation of more precise estimates.\nFGL has minimal experience to date on policyholder behavior for its GMWB products which it began issuing in 2008; as a result, future experience could lead to significant changes in their assumptions. If emerging experience deviates from FGL\u2019s assumptions on GMWB utilization, it could have a significant effect on FGL\u2019s reserve levels and related results of operations. See Part I, Item I. \u201cBusiness-Our Operating Subsidiaries-FGL-Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.\u201d\nFGL\u2019s or Front Street\u2019s financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted if their assumptions regarding the fair value and future performance of their investments differ from actual experience.\nFGL and Front Street make assumptions regarding the fair value and expected future performance of their investments. It is possible that actual values will differ from their assumptions. Such events could result in a material change in the value of their investments, business, operations and financial condition.\nFor example, expectations that FGL\u2019s investments in RMBS and CMBS will continue to perform in accordance with their contractual terms are based on assumptions a market participant would use in determining the current fair value and considering the performance of the underlying assets. FGL has non-agency RMBS holdings of $2.2 billion as of September 30, 2015. It is possible that the collateral underlying these investments will not meet performance expectations and the lower performance levels may lead to adverse changes in the cash flows on FGL\u2019s holdings of these types of securities. This could lead to potential future other than temporary impairments (\"OTTI\") within FGL\u2019s portfolio of RMBS, CMBS, and ABS. In addition, expectations that FGL\u2019s investments in corporate securities or debt obligations will continue to perform in accordance with their contractual terms are based on evidence gathered through FGL\u2019s normal credit surveillance process. It is possible that issuers of corporate securities in which FGL has invested will perform worse than current expectations. Such events may lead FGL to recognize potential future OTTI within its portfolio of corporate securities. FGL recorded OTTI charges of approximately $81.4 million and $0.7 million\nfor the fiscal years ended Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2014, respectively. It is also possible that unanticipated events would lead FGL to dispose of certain of those holdings and recognize the effects of any market movements in FGL\u2019s financial statements.\nA financial strength ratings downgrade, potential downgrade, or any other negative action by a rating agency, could make FGL\u2019s product offerings less attractive and increase its cost of capital, and thereby could adversely affect FGL\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nVarious nationally recognized rating agencies review the financial performance and condition of insurers, including FGL\u2019s insurance subsidiaries, and publish their financial strength ratings as indicators of an insurer\u2019s ability to meet policyholder and contractholder obligations. These ratings are important to maintaining public confidence in FGL\u2019s products, its ability to market its products and its competitive position. Any downgrade or other negative action by a rating agency with respect to the financial strength ratings of FGL\u2019s insurance subsidiaries could have a materially adverse effect on FGL in many ways, including the following:\n\u2022\nadversely affecting relationships with distributors, IMOs and sales agents, which could result in reduction of sales;\n\u2022increasing the number or amount of policy lapses or surrenders and withdrawals of funds;\n\u2022\nrequiring a reduction in prices for FGL\u2019s insurance products and services in order to remain competitive;\n\u2022\nadversely affecting FGL\u2019s ability to obtain reinsurance at a reasonable price, on reasonable terms or at all; and\n\u2022\nrequiring FGL to collateralize reserves, balances or obligations under reinsurance and derivatives agreements.\nRating agencies assign ratings based upon several factors. While most of these factors relate to the rated company, some factors relate to the views of the rating agency, general economic conditions and circumstances outside the rated company\u2019s control. In addition, rating agencies use various models and formulas to assess the strength of a rated company, and from time to time rating agencies have, in their discretion, altered the models and may do so in the future in ways that negatively impact the financial strength ratings of FGL\u2019s insurance subsidiaries and make it more difficult to maintain or obtain comparable ratings going forward. As rating agencies continue to evaluate the financial services industry, it is possible that rating agencies will heighten the level of scrutiny that they apply to financial institutions, increase the frequency and scope of their credit reviews, request additional information from the companies that they rate and potentially adjust upward the capital and other requirements employed in the rating agency models for maintenance of certain ratings levels. It is possible that the outcome of any such review of FGL would have additional adverse ratings consequences, which could have a material adverse effect on FGL\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. FGL may need to take actions in response to changing standards or capital requirements set by any of the rating agencies which could cause FGL\u2019s business and operations to suffer. If the financial strength ratings of FGL\u2019s insurance subsidiaries are downgraded, FGL anticipates that its sales of new policies will be adversely impacted and that FGL could experience substantial surrenders of existing policies. In order to improve or maintain their financial strength ratings, FGL\u2019s insurance subsidiaries may limit the amount of dividends that they would otherwise pay to FGL. In that regard, FGL may, among other things, implement business strategies to improve the RBC ratio of FGL\u2019s insurance subsidiaries to a level anticipated by the rating agencies to maintain or improve FGL\u2019s current rating. If FGL is unable to achieve this level, FGL may limit dividend payments from FGL Insurance to the extent necessary. FGL cannot guarantee these measures will be successful, and if FGL Insurance fails to maintain such a target RBC ratio, its financial strength rating could suffer. FGL cannot predict what actions rating agencies may take in the future, and failure to improve or maintain current financial strength ratings could adversely affect FGL\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nFollowing the announcement of the proposed FGL Merger, the rating organizations have undertaken a review of FGL\u2019s debt ratings and FGL\u2019s insurance company subsidiaries\u2019 financial strength ratings. The rating organizations may take various actions, positive or negative, and their actions may not be known until the FGL Merger closes.\nFGH is required to maintain minimum ratings as a matter of routine practice under FGH\u2019s over-the-counter derivative agreements on forms promulgated by ISDA Under some ISDA agreements, FGH has agreed to maintain certain financial strength ratings. A downgrade below these levels provides the counterparty under the agreement the right to terminate the open derivative contracts between the parties, at which time any amounts payable by FGH or the counterparty would be dependent on the market value of the underlying derivative contracts. FGH\u2019s current rating allows multiple counterparties the right to terminate ISDA agreements. As of September 30, 2015, the amount at risk for ISDA agreements which could be terminated based upon FGH\u2019s current ratings was $80.7 million, which equals the fair value to FGH of the open over-the-counter call option positions. The fair value of the call options can never decrease below zero. No ISDA agreements have been terminated, although the counterparties have reserved the right to terminate the ISDA agreements at any time. In certain transactions, FGH and the counterparty have entered into a collateral support agreement requiring either party to post collateral when the net exposures exceed predetermined thresholds. These thresholds vary by counterparty and credit rating. As of September 30, 2015 and 2014, $7.0 million and $188.0 million, respectively, of collateral was posted by FGH\u2019s counterparties. Accordingly, the maximum amount of loss due to credit risk that FGH were to incur if parties to the call options failed completely to perform according to the terms of the contracts was $73.7 million and $108.3 million at September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nAdditionally, under certain insurance reserve financing arrangements, if FGH were to take certain actions without the counterparties consent, and such actions resulted in a specified financial strength ratings downgrade, FGH would be in default. See Part II, Item 7A.\u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk-Credit Risk and Counterparty Risk-FGL.\u201d\nThe amount of regulatory capital that FGL\u2019s and Front Street\u2019s insurance subsidiaries have and the amount of statutory capital that they must hold to maintain their financial strength ratings and meet other requirements can vary significantly from time to time due to a number of factors outside of their control.\nFGL\u2019s insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulations that provide minimum capitalization requirements based on RBC formulas for life insurance and reinsurance companies that establish capital requirements relating to insurance, business, asset, interest rate, and certain other risks.\nIn any particular year, statutory surplus amounts and RBC ratios may increase or decrease depending on a variety of factors, most of which are outside of FGL\u2019s control, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nthe amount of statutory income or losses generated by their insurance subsidiaries (which itself is sensitive to equity market and credit market conditions);\n\u2022\nthe amount of additional capital their insurance subsidiaries must hold to support business growth;\n\u2022\nchanges in reserve requirements applicable to their insurance subsidiaries;\n\u2022\ntheir ability to access capital markets to provide reserve relief;\n\u2022\nchanges in equity market levels;\n\u2022\nthe value of certain fixed-income and equity securities in their investment portfolios;\n\u2022\nchanges in the credit ratings of investments held in their portfolios;\n\u2022\nthe value of certain derivative instruments;\n\u2022\nchanges in interest rates;\n\u2022\ncredit market volatility;\n\u2022\nchanges in consumer behavior; and\n\u2022\nchanges to the RBC formulas and interpretation of the NAIC instructions with respect to RBC calculation methodologies.\nThe financial strength ratings of FGL\u2019s insurance subsidiaries are significantly influenced by their statutory surplus amounts and capital adequacy ratios. Rating agencies may also implement changes to their internal models, which differ from the RBC capital model, that have the effect of increasing or decreasing the amount of statutory capital FGL\u2019s insurance subsidiaries must hold in order to maintain their current ratings. In addition, rating agencies may downgrade the investments held in FGL\u2019s portfolio, which could result in a reduction of FGL\u2019s capital and surplus and its RBC ratio.\nIn extreme equity market declines, the amount of additional statutory reserves, FGL\u2019s insurance subsidiaries are required to hold for fixed indexed products may decrease at a rate less than the rate of change of the market value of the invested assets. This mismatch could result in a reduction of the capital, surplus or RBC ratio of FGL\u2019s insurance subsidiaries. To the extent that an insurance subsidiary\u2019s RBC ratios are deemed to be insufficient, FGL may seek to take actions either to increase the capitalization of the insurer or to reduce the capitalization requirements. If FGL is unable to accomplish such actions, the rating agencies may view this as a reason for a ratings downgrade.\nWhile the amount of statutory reserves is not directly affected by changes in interest rates, additional statutory reserves may be required as the result of an asset adequacy analysis, and this analysis of cash flow testing is altered by rising or falling interest rates and widening credit spreads.\nThe failure of any of FGL\u2019s insurance subsidiaries to meet its applicable RBC regulatory capital requirements or minimum capital and surplus requirements could subject it to further examination or corrective action imposed by insurance regulators, including limitations on its ability to write additional business, supervision by regulators or seizure or liquidation. Any corrective action imposed could have a material adverse effect on FGL\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. A decline in RBC ratios also limits the ability of an insurance subsidiary to make dividends or distributions to FGL and could be a factor in causing rating agencies to downgrade the insurer\u2019s financial strength ratings, which could have a material adverse effect on FGL\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFGL\u2019s businesses are highly regulated and subject to numerous legal restrictions and regulations.\nState Regulation\nFGL\u2019s businesses are subject to government regulation in each of the states in which they conduct business. Such regulation is vested in state agencies having broad administrative and discretionary, authority with respect to many aspects of FGL\u2019s businesses which may include, among other things, premium rates and increases thereto, underwriting practices, reserve requirements, marketing practices, advertising, privacy, policy forms, reinsurance reserve requirements, acquisitions, mergers and capital adequacy, and is concerned primarily with the protection of policyholders and other customers rather than shareholders. At any\ngiven time, FGL and its insurance subsidiaries may be the subject of a number of ongoing financial or market conduct examinations, audits or inquiries. From time to time, regulators raise issues during such examinations or audits that could, if determined adversely, have a material impact on FGL\u2019s businesses.\nFGL has received inquiries from a number of state regulatory authorities regarding its use of the U.S. Social Security Administration\u2019s Death Master File (\u201cDeath Master File\u201d) and compliance with state claims practices regulations and unclaimed property or escheatment laws. The NYDFS issued a letter and subsequent regulation requiring life insurers doing business in New York to use the Death Master File or similar databases to determine if benefits were payable under life insurance policies, annuities and retained asset accounts. Other states have enacted laws which will impose requirements on insurers to periodically compare their in-force life insurance policies and annuities against the Death Master File or similar databases, investigate any identified potential matches to confirm the death of the insured and determine whether benefits are due and attempt to locate the beneficiaries of any benefits that are due or, if no beneficiary can be located, escheat the benefit to the state as unclaimed property. FGL has received notice of escheatment audits from several states. FGL has filed suit in federal and state court to challenge the audit policies of the California controller and the applicability of California\u2019s unclaimed property laws to FGL generally. It is possible that these requirements will result in additional payments to beneficiaries, additional escheatment of funds deemed abandoned under state laws or administrative penalties and expenses. While FGL believes that it has established sufficient reserves with respect to these matters, it is possible that third parties could dispute these amounts and additional payments or additional unreported claims or liabilities could be required or identified given the ongoing regulatory developments, the effects of which could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on FGL\u2019s results of operations in any one period.\nState insurance departments conduct periodic examinations of the books and records, financial reporting, policy and rate filings, market conduct and business practices of insurance companies domiciled in their states, generally once every three to five years. The regulator in FGL Insurance\u2019s previous state of domicile, MIA completed a routine financial examination of FGL Insurance for the three-year period ended December 31, 2012. The NYDFS completed a routine financial examination of FGL NY Insurance for the three-year periods ended December 31, 2009 and is completing December 31, 2012, and the Vermont Department of Financial Regulation completed a routine financial examination of Raven Re for the period from April 7, 2011 (commencement of business) through December 31, 2012. FGL Insurance is currently the subject of ten ongoing market conduct examinations or inquiries in various states. While FGL Insurance does not believe that any of the current market conduct examinations it is subject to will result in any fines or remediation orders that will be material to its business, market conduct examinations can result in monetary fines or remediation and generally require FGL Insurance to devote significant resources to the management of such examinations. As a result of its re-domestication to Iowa, FGL Insurance will become subject to financial and market conduct examinations by the IID, the primary regulatory authority for Iowa domestic life insurance companies.\nFront Street is regulated by the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority (\u201cCIMA\u201d). CIMA has statutory powers that enable it to use its discretion to require Front Street to conducts its operations in accordance with general or specific conditions which may be imposed by CIMA or may be agreed between CIMA and Front Street. Generally, such matters are set out in the business plan which Front Street files with CIMA and, amongst others, includes reference to the risks assumed and retained by Front Street, the premium finding and capitalization levels, and Front Street\u2019s investment policies.\nNAIC\nAlthough FGL\u2019s business is subject to regulation in each state in which FGL conducts business, in many instances the state regulatory models emanate from the NAIC. State insurance regulators and the NAIC regularly re-examine existing laws and regulations applicable to insurance companies and their products. Changes in these laws and regulations, or interpretations thereof, are often made for the benefit of the consumer and at the expense of the insurer and, thus, could have a material adverse effect on FGL\u2019s business, operations and financial condition. FGL is also subject to the risk that compliance with any particular regulator\u2019s interpretation of a legal or accounting issue may not result in compliance with another regulator\u2019s interpretation of the same issue, particularly when compliance is judged in hindsight. Under insurance guaranty fund laws in most states, insurance companies doing business therein can be assessed up to prescribed limits for policyholder losses incurred by insolvent companies. FGL cannot predict the amount or timing of any such future assessments. There is an additional risk that any particular regulator\u2019s interpretation of a legal or accounting issue may change over time to FGL\u2019s detriment, or that changes to the overall legal or market environment, even absent any change of interpretation by a particular regulator, may cause FGL to change its views regarding the actions FGL needs to take from a legal risk management perspective, which could necessitate changes to FGL\u2019s practices that may, in some cases, limit its ability to grow and improve profitability.\nSome of the NAIC pronouncements, particularly as they affect accounting issues, take effect automatically in the various states without affirmative action by the states. Statutes, regulations and interpretations may be applied with retroactive impact, particularly in areas such as accounting and reserve requirements. Also, regulatory actions with prospective impact can potentially have a significant impact on currently sold products. The NAIC continues to work to reform state regulation in various areas, including comprehensive reforms relating to life insurance reserves with respect to which it may take action as early as late 2015. Additionally, various statutory accounting guidance is being evaluated, including investment value of insurance subsidiaries.\nBoth the NAIC and certain state insurance regulators have in recent months announced intentions to review the trend of hedge\nfund and private equity acquisitions of life insurance and annuity companies. Such reviews are ongoing and preliminary and they may result in stricter regulatory scrutiny or additional regulatory restrictions that could be adverse to FGL\u2019s ability to grow through acquisitions or to its business generally.\nFederal Regulation\nFGL may also be subject to regulation by the DOL when providing a variety of products and services to employee benefit plans governed by ERISA. In April 2015, the DOL released a notice of proposed rulemaking to revamp the ERISA conflict of interest rules. The proposed rule would impose fiduciary duties on anyone getting paid for advice related to a retirement investment decision, which would include insurance agents. In addition, FGL became aware that in April 2015, U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren sent letters to fifteen annuity providers, which inquired about perquisites and other incentives they give to third-party brokers, dealers and agents who sell their products. FGL did not receive such a letter, however, FGL cannot predict the outcome of Ms. Warren\u2019s inquiry. Severe penalties are imposed for breaches of duty under ERISA, and FGL cannot predict whether the proposed DOL rule will ultimately be adopted, what changes may be made to it prior to adoption, or how the rule would impact FGL\u2019s business if it were adopted.\nIn recent years, the SEC and state securities regulators have questioned whether FIAs, such as those sold by FGL, should be treated as securities under the federal and state securities laws rather than as insurance products exempted from such laws. Treatment of these products as securities would require additional registration and licensing of these products and the agents selling them, as well as cause FGL to seek additional marketing relationships for these products, any of which may impose significant restrictions on FGL\u2019s ability to conduct operations as currently operated. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, annuities that meet specific requirements, including requirements relating to certain state suitability rules, are specifically exempted from being treated as securities by the SEC. FGL expects that the types of FIAs FGL Insurance and FGL NY Insurance sell will meet these requirements and therefore are exempt from being treated as securities by the SEC and state securities regulators. However, there can be no assurance that federal or state securities laws or state insurance laws and regulations will not be amended or interpreted to impose further requirements on FIAs.\nDodd-Frank Act\nIn addition, the Dodd-Frank Act makes sweeping changes to the regulation of financial services entities, products and markets. Certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act are or may become applicable to FGL, its competitors or those entities with which they do business, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe establishment of federal regulatory authority over derivatives;\n\u2022\nthe establishment of consolidated federal regulation and resolution authority over systemically important financial services firms;\n\u2022\nthe establishment of the Federal Insurance Office;\n\u2022\nchanges to the regulation of broker dealers and investment advisers;\n\u2022\nchanges to the regulation of reinsurance;\n\u2022\nchanges to regulations affecting the rights of shareholders;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of additional regulation over credit rating agencies;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of concentration limits on financial institutions that restrict the amount of credit that may be extended to a single person or entity; and\n\u2022\nthe clearing of derivative contracts.\nNumerous provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act require the adoption of implementing rules or regulations. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act mandates multiple studies, which could result in additional legislation or regulation applicable to the insurance and reinsurance industry, FGL, its competitors or those entities with which they do business, which may impact FGL and Front Street by, among other things:\n\u2022\nplacing FGL at a competitive disadvantage relative to their competition or other financial services entities;\n\u2022\nchanging the competitive landscape of the financial services sector or the insurance or reinsurance industry;\n\u2022\nmaking it more expensive for FGL to conduct its business;\n\u2022\nrequiring FGL to reallocate significant company resources to government affairs;\n\u2022\nincreasing FGL\u2019s legal and compliance-related activities and the costs associated therewith; or\n\u2022\notherwise having a material adverse effect on the overall business climate, as well as FGL\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nUntil various studies are completed and final regulations are promulgated pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the full impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on investments, investment activities and insurance and annuity products of FGL Insurance and FGL NY Insurance remains unclear.\nOther Regulation\nOther types of regulation that could affect FGL or Front Street include insurance company investment laws and regulations, state adopted statutory accounting principles, antitrust laws, minimum solvency requirements, federal privacy laws, insurable interest laws and federal anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism laws.\nCompliance with applicable laws and regulations is time-consuming and personnel-intensive, and changes in laws and regulations may materially increase the cost of compliance and other expenses of doing business. There are a number of risks that may arise where applicable regulations may be unclear, subject to multiple interpretations or under development or where regulations may conflict with one another, where regulators revise their previous guidance or courts overturn previous rulings, which could result in FGL\u2019s or Front Street\u2019s failure to meet applicable standards. Regulators and other authorities have the power to bring administrative or judicial proceedings against FGL and Front Street, which could result, among other things, in suspension or revocation of FGL\u2019s or Front Street\u2019s licenses, cease and desist orders, fines, civil penalties, criminal penalties or other disciplinary action, which could materially harm FGL\u2019s or Front Street\u2019s results of operations and financial condition. If FGL or Front Street fail to address, or appear to fail to address, appropriately any of these matters, FGL\u2019s or Front Street\u2019s reputation could be harmed and FGL or Front Street could be subject to additional legal risk, which could increase the size and number of claims and damages asserted against them or subject them to enforcement actions, fines and penalties. See Part I, Item I, \u201cBusiness-Our Operating Subsidiaries-FGL-Regulation\u201d for further discussion of the impact of regulations on FGL\u2019s and Front Street\u2019s business.\nFGL and Front Street cannot predict what form any future changes in these or other areas of regulation affecting the insurance and reinsurance industry might take or what effect, if any, such proposals might have on FGL or Front Street if enacted into law. In addition, because FGL\u2019s and Front Street\u2019s activities are relatively concentrated in a small number of lines of business, any change in law or regulation affecting one of those lines of business could have a disproportionate impact on FGL or Front Street as compared to other more diversified insurance companies.\nFinancial services companies are frequently the targets of litigation, including class action litigation, which could result in substantial judgments.\nFGL and Front Street, like other financial services companies, are involved in litigation and arbitration in the ordinary course of business. Although FGL and Front Street do not believe that the outcome of any such litigation or arbitration will have a material adverse effect on their financial condition, it is possible that their results of operations and cash flows could be materially affected by an unfavorable outcome. More generally, FGL and Front Street operate in industries in which various practices are subject to scrutiny and potential litigation, including class actions. In addition, FGL sells its products through IMOs, whose activities may be difficult to monitor. Civil jury verdicts have been returned against insurers and other financial services companies involving sales, underwriting practices, product design, product disclosure, administration, denial or delay of benefits, charging excessive or impermissible fees, recommending unsuitable products to customers, breaching fiduciary or other duties to customers, refund or claims practices, alleged agent misconduct, failure to properly supervise representatives, relationships with agents or other persons with whom the insurer does business, payment of sales or other contingent commissions and other matters. Such lawsuits can result in substantial judgments that are disproportionate to the actual damages, including material amounts of punitive non-economic compensatory damages. In some states, juries, judges and arbitrators have substantial discretion in awarding punitive and non-economic compensatory damages, which creates the potential for unpredictable material adverse judgments or awards in any given lawsuit or arbitration. Arbitration awards are subject to very limited appellate review. In addition, in some class action and other lawsuits, financial services companies have made material settlement payments.\nFGL\u2019s reinsurers, including Wilton Re and Front Street Cayman, could fail to meet assumed obligations, increase their rates, or become subject to adverse developments that could materially adversely affect FGL\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFGL\u2019s insurance subsidiaries cede material amounts of insurance and transfer related assets and certain liabilities to other insurance companies through reinsurance. For example, a material amount of reinsured liabilities are concentrated with Wilton Re and Front Street Cayman. As of September 30, 2015, the amount recoverable from Wilton Re and Front Street Cayman was $1,493.0 million and $1,226.7 million, respectively. Given FGL\u2019s significant concentration of reinsurance with Wilton Re, if Wilton Re fails to perform its obligations under the various reinsurance treaties, such failure could have a material impact on FGL\u2019s financial position. See Part I, Item 1. \u201cBusiness-Our Operating Subsidiaries-FGL-Reinsurance-Wilton Re Transaction\u201d. However, notwithstanding the transfer of related assets and certain liabilities, FGL remains liable with respect to ceded insurance should any reinsurer fail to meet the obligations assumed. Accordingly, FGL bears credit risk with respect to its reinsurers. The failure, insolvency, inability or unwillingness of any reinsurer to pay under the terms of reinsurance agreements with FGL could materially adversely affect FGL\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. To mitigate the counterparty risk for the Front Street Cayman transaction, the assets are held on FGL Insurance\u2019s balance and are used as collateral in the event of a failure. For Wilton Re, A+ rated from Fitch, FGL monitors the credit rating. During 2014 Wilton Re announced their purchase by Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board, (\"CCIB\"), an AAA rated organization. With the capital resources of CCIB behind Wilton Re, FGL believes the counterparty risk is low. See Part I, Item 1A.\u201cBusiness-Our Operating Subsidiaries-FGL-Reinsurance-Wilton Re Transaction\u201d.\nFGL\u2019s ability to compete is dependent on the availability of reinsurance or other substitute financing solutions, both of which could involve the use of reinsurance affiliates referred to generally as \u201ccaptives\u201d. Premium rates charged by FGL are based, in part, on the assumption that reinsurance will be available at a certain cost. Under certain reinsurance agreements, the reinsurer may increase the rate it charges FGL for the reinsurance. Therefore, if the cost of reinsurance were to increase, if reinsurance were to become unavailable on commercially reasonable terms or at all, if alternatives to reinsurance were not available to FGL, if the use of captives were materially restricted through regulation, including certain general proposals currently under consideration by the NAIC, FGL\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nThe credit for reinsurance taken by FGL\u2019s insurance subsidiaries under offshore reinsurance agreements is, under certain conditions, dependent upon the offshore reinsurers ability to obtain and provide sufficient qualifying assets in a qualifying trust or qualifying letters of credit issued by qualifying lending banks. The cost of letters of credit, when available, continues to be very expensive in the current economic environment. Loss of reserve credit by an insurance subsidiary would require it to establish additional reserves and would result in a decrease in the level of its capital, which could have a material adverse effect on FGL\u2019s profitability, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn recent years, access to reinsurance has become more costly for members of the insurance industry, including FGL. In addition, the number of life reinsurers has decreased as the reinsurance industry has consolidated. The decreased number of participants in the life reinsurance market resulted in increased concentration of risk for insurers, including FGL. If the reinsurance market further contracts, FGL\u2019s ability to continue to offer FGL\u2019s products on terms favorable to it could be negatively impacted, resulting in adverse consequences to FGL\u2019s business, operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, reinsurers are facing many challenges regarding illiquid credit or capital markets, investment downgrades, rating agency downgrades, deterioration of general economic conditions and other factors negatively impacting the financial services industry generally. If such events cause a reinsurer to fail to meet its obligations, FGL\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nRestrictions on FGL\u2019s ability to use captive reinsurers could adversely impact its competitive position and results of operations.\nThe NAIC and state insurance regulators continue to review life insurance companies\u2019 use of affiliated captive reinsurers or off-shore entities. On June 4, 2014, Rector & Associates, a consulting firm commissioned by the NAIC, presented a revised report (the \u201cRector Report\u201d) to the Principle-Based Reserving Implementation Task Force of the NAIC which proposes a new regulatory framework for captives assuming term life insurance (\u201cXXX\u201d) or universal life insurance with secondary guarantees (\u201cAXXX\u201d) business, and recommends, among other things, placing limitations on the types of assets that may be used to finance reserves associated with XXX and AXXX business and making an individual state\u2019s adoption of the new regulations contemplated by the report an NAIC accreditation standard. On August 17, 2014, the NAIC Executive (EX) Committee adopted the regulatory framework proposed by the Rector Report, including recommendations to have various NAIC technical subgroups propose regulations and guidelines to implement the new framework. These technical working groups are in various stages of developing and proposing regulations and guidelines. On October 9, 2014, the NAIC\u2019s Principle-Based Reserving Implementation Task Force voted to expose for comment a new Actuarial Guideline (AG48) designed to implement many of the recommendations in the Rector Report related to the amount of assets that may be supported by different asset classes in connection with certain transactions involving captive reinsurance companies.\nIf state insurance regulators restrict the use of captive reinsurers or if FGL otherwise is unable to continue to use captive reinsurers in the future, FGL\u2019s ability to write certain products, to manage the associated risks and to deploy capital efficiently, could be adversely affected, or FGL may need to increase prices on those products, which could adversely impact its competitive position and its results of operations.\nInterest rate fluctuations and withdrawal demands in excess of FGL\u2019s and Front Street\u2019s assumptions could negatively affect their business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFGL and Front Street offer certain products that allow policyholders to withdraw their funds under defined circumstances. In order to meet such funding obligations, FGL and Front Street manage their liabilities and configure their investment portfolios so as to provide and maintain sufficient liquidity to support expected withdrawal demands and contract benefits and maturities. However, in order to provide necessary long-term returns, a certain portion of FGL\u2019s and Front Street\u2019s assets are relatively illiquid. There can be no assurance that withdrawal demands will match FGL\u2019s and Front Street\u2019s estimation of withdrawal demands. As interest rates increase, FGL and Front Street are exposed to the risk of financial disintermediation through a potential increase in the number of withdrawals. Disintermediation risk refers to the risk that policyholders may surrender their contracts in a rising interest rate environment, requiring FGL and Front Street to liquidate assets in an unrealized loss position. If FGL and Front Street experience unexpected withdrawal activity, whether as a result of interest rate movements financial strength downgrades or otherwise, it could exhaust its liquid assets and be forced to liquidate other less liquid assets, possibly at a loss or on other unfavorable terms, which could have a material adverse effect on FGL\u2019s and Front Street\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, FGL and Front Street may experience spread compression, and a loss of anticipated earnings, if credited interest rates are increased on renewing contracts in an effort to decrease or manage withdrawal activity.\nInterest rates are subject to volatility and fluctuations. For the past several years interest rates have trended downwards to historically low levels. In order to meet its policy and contractual obligations, FGL and Front Street must earn a sufficient return on its invested assets. A prolonged period of historically low rates or significant changes in interest rates could expose FGL and Front Street to the risk of not achieving sufficient return on its invested assets by not achieving anticipated interest earnings, or of not earning anticipated spreads between the interest rate earned on investments and the credited interest rates paid on outstanding policies and contracts. Additionally, a prolonged period of low interest rates in the future may lengthen liability maturity, thus increasing the need for a re-investment of assets at yields that are below the amounts required to support guarantee features of FGL\u2019s and Front Street\u2019s contracts. Both rising and declining interest rates can negatively affect FGL\u2019s and Front Street\u2019s interest earnings and spread income (the difference between the returns FGL and Front Street earn on their investments and the amounts they must credit to policyholders and contractholders). While FGL and Front Street develop and maintain asset liability management (\u201cALM\u201d) programs and procedures designed to mitigate the effect on interest earnings and spread income in rising or falling interest rate environments, no assurance can be given that changes in interest rates will not materially adversely affect FGL\u2019s or Front Street\u2019s businesses, financial conditions and results of operations.\nFGL\u2019s expectation for future interest earnings and spread income is an important component in amortization of DAC and VOBA and significantly lower interest earnings or spreads may cause FGL to accelerate amortization, thereby reducing net income in the affected reporting period. An extended period of declining interest rates or a prolonged period of low interest rates may also cause FGL or Front Street to change its long-term view of the interest rates that it can earn on its investments. Such a change in FGL\u2019s or Front Street\u2019s view would cause them to change the long-term interest rate that it assumes in their calculation of insurance assets and liabilities under U.S. GAAP. This revision would result in increased reserves and other unfavorable consequences. In addition, while the amount of statutory reserves is not directly affected by changes in interest rates, additional statutory reserves may be required as the result of an asset adequacy analysis, which is altered by rising or falling interest rates and widening credit spreads.\nAdditionally, FGL\u2019s and Front Street\u2019s ALM programs and procedures incorporate assumptions about the relationship between short-term and long-term interest rates and relationships between risk-adjusted and risk-free interest rates, market liquidity and other factors. The effectiveness of FGL\u2019s and Front Street\u2019s ALM programs and procedures may be negatively affected whenever actual results differ from these assumptions.\nChanges in interest rates may also affect the attractiveness of certain of FGL\u2019s products. For example, lower interest rates may result in decreased sales of certain of FGL\u2019s insurance and investment products. However, during periods of declining interest rates, certain life insurance and annuity products may be relatively more attractive investments to consumers, resulting in increased premium payments on products with flexible premium features, repayment of policy loans and increased persistency or a higher percentage of insurance policies remaining in force from year to year during a period when FGL\u2019s investments carry lower returns. As a result, FGL could become unable to earn its desired level of spread income.\nDuring periods of increasing market interest rates, FGL may offer higher crediting rates on interest-sensitive products, such as universal life insurance and fixed annuities, and FGL may increase crediting rates on in-force products to keep these products competitive. Increases in crediting rates, as well as surrenders and withdrawals, could have a material adverse effect on FGL\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if long-term interest rates rise dramatically within a six- to twelve-month time period, certain of FGL\u2019s products may be exposed to disintermediation risk. Higher interest rates may increase the cost of debt and other obligations having floating rate or rate reset provisions and may result in lower sales of other products. A rise in interest rates, in the absence of other countervailing changes, will increase the net unrealized loss position of FGL\u2019s investment portfolio which will decrease FGL\u2019s accumulated other comprehensive income and shareholders\u2019 equity. FGL\u2019s gross unrealized loss on FGL\u2019s available for sale (\"AFS\") portfolio was $498.4 million as of September 30, 2015 compared to $109.8 million as of September 30, 2014.\nFGL\u2019s and Front Street\u2019s investments are subject to market and credit risks. These risks could be heightened during periods of extreme volatility or disruption in financial and credit markets.\nFGL\u2019s and Front Street\u2019s invested assets and derivative financial instruments are subject to risks of credit defaults and changes in market values. Periods of extreme volatility or disruption in the financial and credit markets could increase these risks. Underlying factors relating to volatility affecting the financial and credit markets could have a material adverse impact on FGL\u2019s and Front Street\u2019s results of operations or financial condition.\nThe value of FGL\u2019s and Front Street\u2019s mortgage-backed investments depends in part on the financial condition of the borrowers and tenants for the properties underlying those investments, as well as general and specific economic trends affecting the overall default rate. FGL and Front Street are also subject to the risk that cash flows resulting from the payments on pools of mortgages that serve as collateral underlying the mortgage-backed securities FGL and Front Street own may differ from their expectations in timing or size. Cash flow variability arising from an unexpected acceleration in mortgage prepayment behavior can be significant, and could cause a decline in the estimated fair value of certain \u201cinterest-only\u201d securities within FGL\u2019s and Front Street\u2019s mortgage-backed securities portfolio. Any event reducing the estimated fair value of these securities, other than on a temporary basis, could have an adverse effect on FGL\u2019s and Front Street\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nSignificant continued financial and credit market volatility, changes in interest rates, credit spreads, credit defaults, real estate values, market illiquidity, declines in equity prices, acts of corporate malfeasance, ratings downgrades of the issuers or guarantors of these investments and declines in general economic conditions, either alone or in combination, could have a material adverse impact on FGL\u2019s or Front Street\u2019s results of operations, financial condition or cash flows through realized losses, OTTI, changes in unrealized loss positions and increased demands on capital. As of September 30, 2015 and 2014, FGL had gross unrealized losses on its AFS portfolio of $498.4 million and $109.8 million, respectively. In addition, FGL\u2019s investment portfolio is concentrated in certain industries. As of September 30, 2015 and 2014, FGL\u2019s most significant investment in one industry was its investment securities in the banking industry with a fair value of $1,979.1 million and $2,240.3 million, or 10.4% and 11.6%, respectively, of the invested assets portfolio. FGL\u2019s holdings in this industry include investments in 83 and 85 different issuers as of September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively, with the top ten investments accounting for 39.0% and 40% of the total holdings in this industry as of September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. In addition, market volatility can make it difficult for FGL and Front Street to value certain of their assets, especially if trading becomes less frequent. Valuations may include assumptions or estimates that may have significant period-to-period changes that could have an adverse impact on FGL\u2019s and Front Street\u2019s results of operations or financial condition.\nFGL is exposed to credit loss in the event of non-performance by its counterparties on call options. FGL seeks to reduce the risk associated with such agreements by purchasing such options from large, well-established financial institutions, but there can be no assurance that FGL will not suffer losses in the event of counterparty non-performance. As of September 30, 2015 and 2014, $7.0 million and $188.0 million, respectively, of collateral was posted by FGL\u2019s counterparties. Accordingly, the maximum amount of loss due to credit risk that FGL would incur if parties to the call options failed completely to perform according to the terms of the contracts was $73.7 million and $108.3 million at September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. See \"Note 5. Derivative Financial Instruments\" to FGL\u2019s audited consolidated financial statements for further discussion of credit risk.\nEquity market volatility could negatively impact FGL\u2019s or Front Street\u2019s business.\nEquity market volatility can negatively affect FGL\u2019s or Front Street\u2019s revenues and profitability in various ways, particularly as a result of guaranteed minimum withdrawal or surrender benefits in their products. The estimated cost of providing GMWB incorporates various assumptions about the overall performance of equity markets over certain time periods. Periods of significant and sustained downturns in equity markets, increased equity volatility could result in an increase in the valuation of the future policy benefit or policyholder account balance liabilities associated with such products, resulting in a reduction in FGL\u2019s or Front Street\u2019s revenues and net income. The rate of amortization of DAC and VOBA costs relating to FIA products and the cost of providing guaranteed minimum withdrawal or surrender benefits could also increase if equity market performance is worse than assumed, hence materially and adversely impacting FGL\u2019s or Front Street\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nCredit market volatility or disruption could adversely impact FGL\u2019s or Front Street\u2019s financial condition or results of operations.\nSignificant volatility or disruption in credit markets could have a material adverse effect on FGL\u2019s or Front Street\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. Changes in interest rates and credit spreads could cause market price and cash flow variability in the fixed income instruments in FGL\u2019s and Front Street\u2019s investment portfolios. Significant volatility and lack of liquidity in the credit markets could cause issuers of the fixed-income securities in FGL\u2019s or Front Street\u2019s investment portfolio to default on either principal or interest payments on these securities. Additionally, market price valuations may not accurately reflect the underlying expected cash flows of securities within FGL\u2019s or Front Street\u2019s investment portfolio.\nChanges in federal or state tax laws may affect sales of FGL\u2019s products and profitability.\nThe annuity and life insurance products that FGL markets generally provide the policyholder with certain federal income or state tax advantages. For example, federal income taxation on any increases in non-qualified annuity contract values (i.e., the \u201cinside build-up\u201d) is deferred until it is received by the policyholder. Non-qualified annuities are annuities that are not sold to a qualified retirement plan. With other savings investments, such as certificates of deposit and taxable bonds, the increase in value is generally taxed each year as it is realized. Additionally, life insurance death benefits are generally exempt from income tax.\nFrom time to time, various tax law changes have been proposed that could have an adverse effect on FGL\u2019s business, including the elimination of all or a portion of the income tax advantages described above for annuities and life insurance. Additionally, insurance products, including the tax favorable features of these products, generally must be approved by the insurance regulators in each state in which they are sold. This review could delay the introduction of new products or impact the features that provide for tax advantages and make such products less attractive to potential purchasers. If legislation were enacted to eliminate the tax deferral for annuities, such a change would have a material adverse effect on FGL\u2019s ability to sell non-qualified annuities.\nFGL and Front Street may be required to increase their valuation allowance against their deferred tax assets, and may face restrictions on FGL\u2019s and Front Street\u2019s ability to fully utilize such assets which could materially adversely affect FGL\u2019s and Front Street\u2019s capital position, business, operations and financial condition.\nDeferred tax assets refer to assets that are attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets in essence represent future savings of taxes that would otherwise be paid in cash. The realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of sufficient future taxable income, including capital gains. If it is determined that the deferred tax assets cannot be realized, a deferred tax valuation allowance must be established, with a corresponding charge to net income.\nBased on FGL\u2019s and Front Street\u2019s current assessment of future taxable income, including available tax planning opportunities, FGL and Front Street anticipate that it is more likely than not that FGL and Front Street will generate sufficient taxable income to realize all of their deferred tax assets as to which FGL and Front Street do not have a valuation allowance. If future events differ from FGL\u2019s and Front Street\u2019s current forecasts, the valuation allowance may need to be increased from the current amount, which could have a material adverse effect on FGL\u2019s and Front Street\u2019s capital position, business, operations and financial condition.\nFGL\u2019s and Front Street\u2019s business models depend on the performance of various third parties, including independent distributors, underwriters, actuarial consultants and other service providers.\nFGL and Front Street rely significantly on various third parties to provide services for their business operations. As such, their results may be affected by the performance of those other parties. For example, FGL is dependent upon independent distribution channels to sell its products, third parties to perform policy administration and underwriting functions, and independent consultants to perform actuarial analyses and asset managers to manage certain of FGL\u2019s assets. Additionally, FGL\u2019s and Front Street\u2019s operations are dependent on various service providers and on various technologies, some of which are provided or maintained by certain key outsourcing partners and other parties.\nMany of FGL\u2019s products and services are complex and are sold through third-party intermediaries. In particular, FGL\u2019s insurance businesses are reliant on these intermediaries to describe and explain their products to potential customers. The intentional or unintentional misrepresentation of FGL\u2019s products and services in advertising materials or other external communications, or inappropriate activities by FGL\u2019s personnel or an intermediary, could adversely affect FGL\u2019s reputation and business prospects, as well as lead to potential regulatory actions or litigation.\nThe third parties upon which FGL and Front Street depend may default on their obligations to FGL or Front Street due to bankruptcy, insolvency, lack of liquidity, adverse economic conditions, operational failure, fraud, loss of key personnel, or other reasons. Such defaults could have a material adverse effect on FGL\u2019s or Front Street\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. In addition, certain of these other parties may act, or be deemed to act, on behalf of FGL or represent FGL in various capacities. Consequently, FGL may be held responsible for obligations that arise from the acts or omissions of these other parties\nInterruption or other operational failures in telecommunication, information technology and other operational systems, or a failure to maintain the security, integrity, confidentiality or privacy of sensitive data residing on such systems, including as a result of human error, could harm FGL\u2019s or Front Street\u2019s business.\nFGL and Front Street are highly dependent on automated and information technology systems to record and process their internal transactions and transactions involving their customers, as well as to calculate reserves, value-invested assets and complete certain other components of their U.S. GAAP and statutory financial statements. FGL or Front Street could experience a failure of one of these systems, their employees or agents could fail to monitor and implement enhancements or other modifications to a system in a timely and effective manner, or their employees or agents could fail to complete all necessary data reconciliation or other conversion controls when implementing a new software system or implementing modifications to an existing system. Despite the implementation of security and back-up measures, FGL\u2019s and Front Street\u2019s information technology systems may be vulnerable to physical or electronic intrusions, viruses or other attacks, programming errors and similar disruptions. FGL or Front Street may also be subject to disruptions of any of these systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond their control (for example, natural disasters, acts of terrorism, epidemics, computer viruses and electrical/telecommunications outages). All of these risks are also applicable where FGL and Front Street rely on outside vendors, including Dell, to provide services to FGL and Front Street, to provide services to them and their customers. The failure of any one of these systems for any reason, or errors made by FGL\u2019s or Front Street\u2019s employees or agents, could in each case cause significant interruptions to their respective operations, which could harm their reputations, adversely affect their internal controls over financial reporting, or have a material adverse effect on FGL\u2019s or Front Street\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFGL retains confidential information in its information technology systems and those of its business partners, and it relies on industry standard commercial technologies to maintain the security of those systems. Despite its implementation of network security measures, FGL\u2019s servers could be subject to physical and electronic break-ins, and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with their computer systems. While FGL performs annual penetration tests and has adopted a number of measures to protect the security of customer and company data and have not experienced a successful cyberattack, there is no guaranty that\nsuch an attack will not occur or be successful in the future. Anyone who is able to circumvent FGL\u2019s security measures and penetrate its information technology systems could access, view, misappropriate, alter, or delete information in the systems, including personally identifiable customer information and proprietary business information. Information security risks also exist with respect to the use of portable electronic devices, such as laptops, which are particularly vulnerable to loss and theft. In addition, an increasing number of jurisdictions require that customers be notified if a security breach results in the disclosure of personally identifiable customer information. Any compromise of the security of FGL\u2019s information technology systems that results in inappropriate access, use or disclosure of personally identifiable customer information could damage FGL\u2019s reputation in the marketplace, deter purchases of its products, subject FGL to heightened regulatory scrutiny or significant civil and criminal liability and require FGL to incur significant technical, legal and other expenses.\nIn the event of a disaster such as a natural catastrophe, an industrial accident, a blackout, a computer virus, a terrorist attack or war, FGL\u2019s or Front Street\u2019s information technology systems may be inaccessible to their employees, customers, or business partners for an extended period of time. Even if FGL\u2019s or Front Street\u2019s employees are able to report to work, they may be unable to perform their duties for an extended period of time if their data or systems are disabled or destroyed. Any such occurrence could materially adversely affect FGL\u2019s or Front Street\u2019s business, operations and financial condition.\nFGL\u2019s and Front Street\u2019s insurance subsidiaries\u2019 ability to grow depends in large part upon the continued availability of capital.\nFGL\u2019s and Front Street\u2019s insurance subsidiaries\u2019 long-term strategic capital requirements will depend on many factors, including their accumulated statutory earnings and the relationship between their statutory capital and surplus and various elements of required capital. To support their long-term capital requirements, FGL, Front Street and their insurance subsidiaries may need to increase or maintain their statutory capital and surplus through financings, which could include debt, equity, financing arrangements or other surplus relief transactions. Adverse market conditions have affected and continue to affect the availability and cost of capital from external sources. Neither FGL nor Front Street are obligated, and they may choose not or may be unable, to provide financing or make any capital contribution to their insurance subsidiaries. Consequently, financings, if available at all, may be available only on terms that are not favorable to FGL or Front Street or their insurance subsidiaries. If FGL\u2019s or Front Street\u2019s insurance subsidiaries cannot maintain adequate capital, they may be required to limit growth in sales of new policies, or reinsurance treaties (each as applicable), and such action could materially adversely affect FGL\u2019s or Front Street\u2019s business, operations and financial condition.\nAccounting rules, changes to accounting rules, or the grant of permitted accounting practices to competitors could negatively impact FGL and Front Street.\nFGL and Front Street are required to comply with U.S. GAAP. A number of organizations are instrumental in the development and interpretation of U.S. GAAP, such as the SEC, the FASB and the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. U.S. GAAP is subject to constant review by these organizations and others in an effort to address emerging accounting rules and issue interpretative accounting guidance on a continual basis. FGL nor Front Street cannot assure you that future changes to U.S. GAAP will not have a negative impact on FGL or Front Street. U.S. GAAP includes the requirement to carry certain assets and liabilities at fair value. These fair values are sensitive to various factors including, but not limited to, interest rate movements, credit spreads, and various other factors. Because of this, changes in these fair values may cause increased levels of volatility in FGL\u2019s and Front Street\u2019s consolidated financial statements.\nIn addition, FGL\u2019s insurance subsidiaries are required to comply with statutory accounting principles (\u201cSAP\u201d). SAP and in particular actuarial reserving methodology are subject to constant review by the NAIC and its task forces and committees as well as state insurance departments in an effort to address emerging issues and otherwise improve financial reporting. Various proposals are currently, or have previously been, pending before committees and task forces of the NAIC, some of which, if enacted, would negatively affect FGL\u2019s insurance subsidiaries. The NAIC is also currently working to reform state regulation in various areas, including comprehensive reforms relating to life insurance reserves and the accounting for such reserves. FGL cannot predict whether or in what form reforms will be enacted and, if so, whether the enacted reforms will positively or negatively affect FGL. In addition, the NAIC Accounting Practices and Procedures manual provides that state insurance departments may permit insurance companies domiciled therein to depart from SAP by granting them permitted accounting practices. FGL cannot predict whether or when the insurance departments of the states of domicile of its competitors may permit them to utilize advantageous accounting practices that depart from SAP, the use of which is not permitted by the insurance departments of the states of domicile of FGL and its insurance subsidiaries. With respect to regulations and guidelines, states sometimes defer to the interpretation of the insurance department of the state of domicile. Neither the action of the domiciliary state nor action of the NAIC is binding on a state. Accordingly, a state could choose to follow a different interpretation. FGL can give no assurance that future changes to SAP or components of SAP or the grant of permitted accounting practices to its competitors will not have a negative impact on FGL.\nFGL\u2019s and Front Street\u2019s risk management policies and procedures could leave them exposed to unidentified or unanticipated risks, which could negatively affect their businesses or result in losses.\nFGL and Front Street have developed risk management policies and procedures and expect to continue to enhance these in the future. Nonetheless, their policies and procedures to identify, monitor, and manage both internal and external risks may not effectively mitigate these risks or predict future exposures, which could be different or significantly greater than expected. These identified risks may not be the only risks facing FGL or Front Street. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to FGL or Front Street, or that either of them currently deem to be immaterial, may adversely affect their business, financial condition or operating results. For example, FGL hedges its FIA index credits with a combination of static and dynamic strategies, which can result in earnings volatility. In addition, FGL\u2019s FIA hedging strategy economically hedges the equity returns and exposes FGL to the risk that unhedged market exposures result in divergence between changes in the fair value of the liabilities and the hedging assets.\nFGL may not be able to protect its intellectual property and may be subject to infringement claims.\nFGL relies on a combination of contractual rights and copyright, trademark and trade secret laws to establish and protect its intellectual property. Although FGL uses a broad range of measures to protect its intellectual property rights, third parties may infringe or misappropriate its intellectual property. FGL may have to litigate to enforce and protect its copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and know-how or to determine their scope, validity or enforceability, which represents a diversion of resources that may be significant in amount and may not prove successful. The loss of intellectual property protection or the inability to secure or enforce the protection of FGL\u2019s intellectual property assets could adversely impact its business and its ability to compete effectively.\nFGL also may be subject to costly litigation in the event that another party alleges its operations or activities infringe upon that party\u2019s intellectual property rights. FGL may also be subject to claims by third parties for breach of copyright, trademark, trade secret or license usage rights. Any such claims and any resulting litigation could result in significant expense and liability for damages or FGL could be enjoined from providing certain products or services to its customers or utilizing and benefiting from certain methods, processes, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets or licenses, or alternatively, FGL could be required to enter into costly licensing arrangements with third parties, all of which could have a material adverse effect on FGL\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFGL\u2019s business could be interrupted or compromised if it experiences difficulties arising from outsourcing relationships.\nIn addition to services provided by third-party asset managers and actuarial consultants, FGL outsources the following functions to third-party service providers, and expect to continue to do so in the future: (i) new business administration, (ii) hosting of financial systems, (iii) servicing of existing policies, (iv) information technology development and maintenance, (v) call centers and (vi) underwriting administration of life insurance applications. If FGL does not maintain an effective outsourcing strategy or third-party providers do not perform as contracted, it may experience operational difficulties, increased costs and a loss of business that could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations. In addition, FGL\u2019s reliance on third-party service providers that it does not control does not relieve FGL of its responsibilities and requirements. Any failure or negligence by such third-party service providers in carrying out their contractual duties may result in FGL becoming subjected to liability to parties who are harmed and ensuing litigation. Any litigation relating to such matters could be costly, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome of any such litigation may be uncertain.\nMoreover, any adverse publicity arising from such litigation, even if the litigation is not successful, could adversely affect FGL\u2019s reputation and sales of its products.\nFGL and Front Street are exposed to the risks of natural and man-made catastrophes, pandemics and malicious and terrorist acts that could materially adversely affect their business, financial condition and results of operations.\nNatural and man-made catastrophes, pandemics and malicious and terrorist acts present risks that could materially adversely affect FGL\u2019s or Front Street\u2019s results of operations. A natural or man-made catastrophe, pandemic or malicious or terrorist act could materially adversely affect the mortality or morbidity experience of FGL\u2019s business or its reinsurers, including Front Street. For instance, a significant expansion of the scope and intensity of the recent Ebola crisis beyond its current geographic regions, especially within the United States, could adversely affect the mortality and morbidity experience of FGL\u2019s or Front Street\u2019s business. Claims arising from such events could have a material adverse effect on FGL\u2019s or Front Street\u2019s business, operations and financial condition, either directly or as a result of their effect on FGL\u2019s reinsurers including Front Street or other counterparties. Such events could also have an adverse effect on lapses and surrenders of existing policies, as well as sales of new policies. While FGL and Front Street have taken steps to identify and manage these risks, such risks cannot be predicted with certainty, nor fully protected against even if anticipated.\nIn addition, such events could result in overall macroeconomic volatility or specifically a decrease or halt in economic activity in large geographic areas, adversely affecting the marketing or administration of FGL\u2019s or Front Street\u2019s business within such geographic areas or the general economic climate, which in turn could have an adverse effect on FGL\u2019s or Front Street\u2019s business,\noperations and financial condition. The possible macroeconomic effects of such events could also adversely affect FGL\u2019s or Front Street\u2019s asset portfolio.\nFGL\u2019s ability to maintain competitive policy expense costs is dependent upon the level of new sales and persistency of existing business.\nFGL\u2019s ability to maintain competitive policy expense costs is dependent upon a number of factors, such as the level of new sales, persistency of existing business and expense management. A decrease in sales or persistency without a corresponding reduction in expenses may result in higher policy expense costs.\nIn addition, lower persistency may result in higher or more rapid amortization of VOBA costs, which would result in higher unit costs and lower reported earnings. Although many of FGL\u2019s products contain surrender charges, such charges decrease over time and may not be sufficient to cover the unamortized DAC and VOBA costs with respect to the insurance policy or annuity contract being surrendered.\nThere may be adverse consequences if the independent contractor status of FGL\u2019s IMOs is successfully challenged.\nFGL sells its products through a network of approximately 200 IMOs representing approximately 30,000 independent agents and managing general agents. FGL currently treats these IMOs as independent contractors who own their own businesses. However, the tests governing the determination of whether an individual is considered to be an independent contractor or an employee are typically fact sensitive and vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Laws and regulations that govern the status of the IMOs are subject to change or interpretation by various authorities. If a federal, state or local authority or court enacts legislation or adopts regulations or adopts an interpretation that changes the manner in which employees and independent contractors are classified or makes any adverse determination with respect to some or all of FGL\u2019s independent contractors, FGL could incur significant costs in complying with such laws, regulations or interpretations, including, in respect of tax withholding, social security payments and recordkeeping, or FGL could be held liable for the actions of such independent contractors or may be required to modify its business model, any of which could have a material adverse effect on FGL\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, there is the risk that FGL may be subject to significant monetary liabilities arising from fines or judgments as a result of any such actual or alleged non-compliance with federal, state or local tax or employment laws. Further, if it were determined that FGL\u2019s IMOs should be treated as employees, FGL could possibly incur additional liabilities with respect to any applicable employee benefit plan.\nIf FGL is unable to attract and retain national marketing organizations and independent agents, sales of FGL\u2019s products may be reduced.\nFGL must attract and retain its network of IMOs and independent agents to sell its products. Insurance companies compete vigorously for productive agents. FGL competes with other life insurance companies for marketers and agents primarily on the basis of FGL\u2019s financial position, support services, compensation and product features. Such marketers and agents may promote products offered by other life insurance companies that may offer a larger variety of products than FGL does. FGL\u2019s competitiveness for such marketers and agents also depends upon the long-term relationships FGL develops with them. FGL\u2019s most important IMOs (those who are able to meet certain production targets) are referred to as \u201cPower Partners\u201d. FGL currently has 31 Power Partners that accounted for approximately 91% of FGL\u2019s Fiscal 2015 sales volume. There can be no guaranty that such relationships will continue in the future. If FGL is unable to attract and retain sufficient marketers and agents to sell its products, FGL\u2019s ability to compete and its revenues would suffer.\nFGL may be subject to an additional tax as a personal holding company on future undistributed personal holding company income if it generates passive income in excess of operating expenses (subject to certain exclusions relating to FGL\u2019s life insurance subsidiaries).\nSection 541 of the Code subjects a corporation (not including a life insurance corporation) that is a \u201cpersonal holding company\u201d (\u201cPHC\u201d) to a 20% tax on \u201cundistributed personal holding company income\u201d in addition to a corporation\u2019s normal income tax. A corporation (not including a life insurance corporation) is also generally is considered to be a PHC if (i) at least 60% of its adjusted ordinary gross income (excluding dividends paid by any non-consolidated life insurance subsidiary) is PHC Income (defined below) and (ii) more than 50% in value of its outstanding stock is owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals (including, for this purpose, certain organizations and trusts) at any time during the last half of the taxable year. Personal holding company income (\u201cPHC Income\u201d) is comprised primarily of passive investment income (but does not include non-passive income such as insurance premiums or dividends paid by any non-consolidated life insurance subsidiary) plus, under certain circumstances, personal service income.\nSo long as individuals and their affiliates hold (directly or by attribution) more than 50% in value of FGL\u2019s outstanding Common Stock, including through ownership of the outstanding Common Stock of HRG at any time during any future tax year, it is possible that FGL will be a PHC if at least 60% of its adjusted ordinary gross income consists of PHC Income (taking into account the rules and exclusions discussed above). In the past, FGL has not incurred the PHC tax. However, there can be no assurance that FGL will not be subject to this tax in the future, which, in turn, may materially and adversely impact its financial position, results\nof operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nThe agreements and instruments governing FGL\u2019s debt contain significant operating and financial restrictions, which may prevent FGL from capitalizing on business opportunities.\nThe indenture governing the 6.375% senior notes due 2021 (the \u201cSenior Notes\u201d) issued by FGH and the three-year $150.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d); each contains various restrictive covenants which limit, among other things, FGH\u2019s ability to:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\npay dividends or certain other distributions on its capital stock other than as allowed under the indenture and the Credit Agreement;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments or other restricted payments;\n\u2022\nengage in transactions with stockholders or affiliates;\n\u2022\nsell certain assets or merge with or into other companies;\n\u2022\nchange FGH\u2019s accounting policies;\n\u2022\nenter into restrictive agreements;\n\u2022\nguarantee indebtedness; and\n\u2022\ncreate liens.\nIn addition, if FGL or FGH undergoes a \u201cchange of control\u201d as defined in the indenture, each holder of FGH Senior Notes will have the right to require FGL to repurchase their FGL Senior Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount and any accrued but unpaid interest.\nAs a result of these restrictions and their effect on FGL, FGL may be limited in how it conducts its business and FGL may be unable to raise additional debt financing to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities. The terms of any future indebtedness FGL or its subsidiaries may incur could include more restrictive covenants.\nFGL\u2019s subsidiaries may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of their obligations and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy their obligations, which may not be successful.\nFGL\u2019s subsidiaries\u2019 ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance their debt obligations, including the FGH Senior Notes, depends on their financial condition and operating performance, which in turn are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond their control. FGL\u2019s subsidiaries may not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit them to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on indebtedness.\nIf FGL\u2019s subsidiaries\u2019 cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund its subsidiaries\u2019 obligations, FGL could face substantial liquidity problems and may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance indebtedness. FGL\u2019s ability to restructure or refinance its subsidiaries\u2019 debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and its financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of FGL\u2019s subsidiaries\u2019 debt could be at higher interest rates and may require compliance with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict its business operations. The terms of existing and future debt instruments may restrict FGL from adopting some of these alternatives. In addition, any failure to make payments on outstanding obligations on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of FGL\u2019s ratings, which could harm FGL\u2019s ability to conduct its business and to incur additional indebtedness. In the face of such substantial liquidity problems, FGL may be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet its obligations. FGL may not be able to consummate those dispositions and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any obligations then due.\nFGL has entered into business transactions with unaffiliated third-party borrowers through Salus and would be adversely affected if third-party borrowers were unable to meet their obligations.\nFGL maintains exposure to senior secured asset-based loans to unaffiliated third-party borrowers through loans originated by Salus, a company indirectly owned by HRG. FGL Insurance has not participated in any new originations to asset-based loans through Salus since October 2014, and this portfolio has been winding down as exposures mature and borrowers refinance. As of September 30, 2015, $109.3 million of such loans were outstanding. FGL currently estimates that this portfolio will be largely paid down by the end of calendar year 2017.\nFGL is a holding company with no operations of its own. As a consequence, FGL\u2019s ability to pay dividends on its stock will depend on the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends to FGL, which may be restricted by law.\nFGL is a holding company with limited business operations of its own. Its primary subsidiaries are insurance subsidiaries that own substantially all of its assets and conduct substantially all of its operations. Accordingly, FGL\u2019s payment of dividends is dependent, to a significant extent, on the generation of cash flow by its subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to FGL, by dividend or otherwise. FGL\u2019s subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, make distributions to enable\nFGL to meet its obligations and pay dividends. Each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity and legal and contractual restrictions may also limit FGL\u2019s ability to obtain cash from its subsidiaries.\nFGL\u2019s insurance subsidiaries are subject to various statutory and regulatory restrictions and the ability of its insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends is limited by applicable insurance laws and regulations. See Part I, Item 1A.\u201cBusiness-Our Operating Subsidiaries-FGL-Regulation-Dividend and Other Distribution Payment Limitations\u201d. The Iowa insurance law and the New York insurance law regulate the amount of dividends that may be paid in any year by FGL Insurance and FGL NY Insurance, respectively. This could limit both FGL\u2019s ability to receive cash flow from its direct wholly owned subsidiary, FGH and FGH\u2019s ability to receive cash flow from its direct wholly owned subsidiary, FGL Insurance, and FGL Insurance\u2019s ability to receive cash flow from its direct wholly owned subsidiary, FGL NY Insurance.\nEach year FGL Insurance may pay a certain limited amount of ordinary dividends or other distributions without being required to obtain the prior consent of the Iowa Commissioner. FGL Insurance is required to provide advance written notice to the Iowa Commissioner of its intention to pay dividends that are deemed ordinary dividends and to request approval to pay dividends that are deemed extraordinary dividends. Pursuant to Iowa insurance law, ordinary dividends are payments, together with all other such payments within the preceding twelve months, that do not exceed the greater of (i) 10% of FGL Insurance\u2019s statutory surplus as regards policyholders as of December 31 of the preceding year; or (ii) the net gain from operations of FGL Insurance (excluding realized capital gains) for the 12-month period ending December 31 of the preceding year. Dividends may only be paid out of statutory earned surplus.\nDividends in excess of FGL Insurance\u2019s ordinary dividend capacity are referred to as extraordinary and require prior approval of the Iowa Commissioner. In deciding whether to approve a request to pay an extraordinary dividend, Iowa insurance law requires the Iowa Commissioner to consider the effect of the dividend payment on FGL Insurance\u2019s surplus and financial condition generally and whether the payment of the dividend will cause FGL Insurance to fail to meet its required RBC ratio. In addition, Delaware law may impose requirements that may restrict FGL\u2019s ability to pay dividends to holders of FGL\u2019s common stock. FGL Insurance has not paid out extraordinary dividends since 2008, and in the future FGL Insurance may be required to request approval to pay an extraordinary dividend and there is no guarantee such a request would be approved by the Iowa Commissioner.\nIt is possible that in the future, FGL\u2019s insurance subsidiaries may be unable to pay dividends or distributions to FGL in an amount sufficient to meet its obligations or to pay dividends due to a lack of sufficient statutory net gain from operations, a diminishing statutory policyholders surplus, changes to the Iowa or New York insurance laws or regulations or for some other reason. Further, the covenants in the agreement governing the existing indebtedness of FGH significantly restrict its ability to pay dividends, which further limits FGL\u2019s ability to obtain cash or other assets from FGL\u2019s subsidiaries. If FGL\u2019s subsidiaries cannot pay sufficient dividends or distributions to FGL in the future, FGL would be unable to meet its obligations or to pay dividends. This would negatively affect FGL\u2019s business and financial condition as well as the trading price of FGL\u2019s common stock.\nFGL and Front Street operate in highly competitive industries, which could limit their abilities to gain or maintain their respective positions in the industries and could materially adversely affect their business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFGL and Front Street operate in highly competitive industries. FGL encounters significant competition in all of its product lines from other insurance companies. Front Street faces significant competition from other reinsurance providers. Many of FGL\u2019s and Front Street\u2019s competitors have greater financial resources and, with respect to FGL, higher financial strength ratings, which may have a greater market share, offer a broader range of products, services or features, assume a greater level of risk, have lower operating or financing costs, or have different profitability expectations than FGL or Front Street, as applicable. Competition could result in, among other things, lower sales or higher lapses of existing products.\nFGL\u2019s annuity products compete with fixed indexed, fixed rate and variable annuities sold by other insurance companies and also with mutual fund products, traditional bank investments and other retirement funding alternatives offered by asset managers, banks and broker-dealers. FGL\u2019s insurance products compete with those of other insurance companies, financial intermediaries and other institutions based on a number of factors, including premium rates, policy terms and conditions, service provided to distribution channels and policyholders, ratings by rating agencies, reputation and commission structures.\nConsolidation in the insurance and reinsurance industries and in distribution channels may result in increasing competitive pressures on FGL and Front Street. Larger, potentially more efficient organizations may emerge from such consolidation. In addition, some mutual insurance companies have converted to stock ownership, which gives them greater access to capital markets and greater ability to compete. The ability of banks to increase their securities-related business or to affiliate with insurance companies may materially and adversely affect sales of all of FGL\u2019s products by substantially increasing the number and financial strength of potential competitors. Consolidation and expansion among banks, insurance companies and other financial services companies with which FGL and Front Street do business could also have an adverse effect on their business, operations and financial condition if they demand more favorable terms than FGL or Front Street previously offered or if they elect not to continue to do business with FGL or Front Street following consolidation or expansion.\nFGL\u2019s ability to compete is dependent upon, among other things, its ability to develop competitive and profitable products, its ability to maintain low unit costs, and its maintenance of adequate financial strength ratings from rating agencies. FGL\u2019s ability\nto compete is also dependent upon, among other things, its ability to attract and retain distribution channels to market its products, the competition for which is vigorous. FGL competes for marketers and agents primarily on the basis of FGL\u2019s financial position, support services, compensation and product features. Such marketers and agents may promote products offered by other life insurance companies that may offer a larger variety of products than FGL does. FGL\u2019s competitiveness for such marketers and agents also depends upon the long-term relationships FGL develops with them. If FGL is unable to attract and retain sufficient marketers and agents to sell its products, its ability to compete and FGL\u2019s revenues will suffer.\nFront Street\u2019s ability to successfully compete will be dependent on its ability to successfully enter into additional reinsurance agreements and its ability to achieve its anticipated investment returns. Front Street has historically done business with other affiliates of HRG and may in the future enter into similar arrangements. There can be no assurance, however, that such arrangements will occur or that they will be successful. Front Street may not find opportunities with desired returns in primary markets. As a result, Front Street may have to turn to opportunities with more risk, such as foreign markets or other product markets, such as long-term care.\nFront Street\u2019s ability to successfully compete will also be dependent on risks associated with an insurance business and managing of assets, including, among other things, Front Street\u2019s: (a) ability to successfully implement its investment strategy, especially with respect to riskier, below-investment-grade securities; (b) exposure to credit risk associated with third parties, including brokers with whom it will conduct business; (c) ability to accurately assess the risks associated with the businesses that it will reinsure; (d) ability to provide collateral to ceding companies or otherwise comply with applicable insurance regulations; (e) ability to obtain desirable financial strength ratings and avoid any subsequent downgrade or withdrawal of any of their financial strength ratings (f) ability to secure additional capital to grow its business; (g) ability to manage the growth of its business effectively, (h) ability to successfully employ loss limitation methods to mitigate its loss exposure; (i) ability to attract qualified personnel and retain such key personnel; (j) mitigate unfavorable changes in applicable laws, accounting rules or regulations; (k) operational risks associated with, among other things, employee and contractor conduct, operational errors, system malfunctions and cyber-security incidents; and (l) successfully risks.\nRisks Related to the Asset Managers\u2019 Businesses\nThe Asset Managers may not recover all amounts that are contractually owed to them by their borrowers.\nDuring Fiscal 2015, following certain organizational changes at Salus, Salus determined to focus its efforts primarily on monitoring, servicing and collecting its existing loans and not to underwrite any new loans. after March 31, 2015. The success of Salus\u2019 business strategy is primarily dependent on its ability to recover amounts owed to it by its borrowers. While Salus has developed a variety of processes to value and monitor the collateral related to its loans and maintain its position in the collateral securing its loans, there can be no assurance that it will not suffer a partial or complete loss if the loan becomes non-performing. Such loss may arise from a variety of reasons, including, the risk profile of the borrower and the complex nature of the transaction; Salus not being provided with complete and accurate disclosure of all material information concerning the borrower and its business or Salus may, even if it receives complete and accurate information, misinterpret or incorrectly analyze such information; the failure of results or developments to materialize as anticipated or mistakes in interpreting data, assumptions, analyses, and financial forecasts prepared for Salus by its employees or third parties; or Salus\u2019 inability to timely detect operational or financial problems of the borrower that could result in a substantial impairment or loss of the value of the collateral and Salus\u2019 loan. Furthermore, while most of Salus\u2019 loans are secured by a first lien on specified collateral, there is no assurance that Salus has obtained or properly perfected its liens or will be able to seize and liquidate the collateral prior to diminution in value. Any such losses, particularly recognizing that many of Salus\u2019 loans individually represent a significant percentage of its total loans, could adversely affect the adequacy of Salus\u2019 reserves for credit losses and have a material adverse effect on Salus\u2019 business, results of operations, and financial position. For example, during Fiscal 2015, RadioShack Corp. (\"RadioShack\"), the borrower of Salus\u2019 largest loan to date, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Salus was the lender under RadioShack\u2019s $250.0 million term loan placed in December 2013 with a net exposure to Salus and its affiliates of $150.0 million after giving effect to a non-qualifying participation of $100.0 million held by a third party that was fully repaid. The extent to which Salus will be able to recover amounts owed to it by RadioShack is dependent on a number of factors, including the results of asset sales, only some of which have been completed to date, and ongoing litigation. As of September 30, 2015, the expected recovery on the RadioShack loan, excluding any additional proceeds from ongoing litigation, resulted in an impairment of $101.0 million recognized Salus and its affiliates. Aside from the RadioShack loan, during Fiscal 2015, Salus recorded additional provision for credit losses of $24.8 million primarily related to nine delinquent loans where the underlying collateral was underperforming. CorAmerica\u2019s business strategy includes the origination and acquisition of commercial real estate loans and EIC\u2019s investment strategy includes lending to borrowers in the energy and infrastructure sectors. These investment strategies each have substantial credit risk associated with them. Defaults on these loans and other credit-related investments could have a material adverse effect on these Asset Managers\u2019 financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nIn addition to borrower credit risk associated with loans and other high-yield investments, the Asset Managers are exposed to other forms of credit risk. If the Asset Managers\u2019 credit underwriting processes or credit risk judgments fail to adequately identify or assess applicable risks, or if the credit quality of their derivative counterparties, customers, manufacturers, or other parties\nwith which they conduct business materially deteriorates, they may be exposed to credit risk-related losses that may negatively impact their financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe Asset Managers must continue to address a number of issues to implement their strategies and grow their businesses.\nTo implement their strategies and grow their businesses, the Asset Managers must continue to address a number of strategic issues that affect their businesses, including the availability of capital and liquidity and operational issues. If the Asset Managers are unable to obtain access to capital and liquidity on a cost-effective and sustainable basis, they may face significant challenges. For instance, many of Salus\u2019, EIC\u2019s and CorAmerica\u2019s borrowers rely upon funding from such Asset Managers to provide them with the working capital necessary to operate their business or to fund capital improvements. In many instances, these funding requirements are time-sensitive. If any of the Asset Managers\u2019 borrowers are uncertain as to their ability to continue to provide them with funding on a timely basis or to provide the same breadth and quality of products, such Asset Manager may be unable to attract new borrowers and may experience lower business or a loss of business with its existing borrowers.\nAmong operational issues, EIC and CorAmerica must continuously originate new products and services to attract new business, and each Asset Manager must service its existing portfolio and adopt appropriate policies, procedures, and systems. In addition, in accordance with its business strategy, Salus is focused on collecting on the loans in its existing portfolio and reducing the size of its business over time. There is no assurance that any of the Asset Managers will be able to implement their strategic decisions effectively, and it may be necessary to refine, supplement, or modify their business plans and strategies in significant ways. If any Asset Manager is unable to fully implement its business plan and strategy, such inability could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations and financial position.\nThe Asset Managers are subject to a variety of operational risks, including reputational risk, legal and compliance risk, the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders, operational errors, systems malfunctions, or cyber-security incidents and other risks, which may adversely affect their businesses and results of operations.\nThe Asset Managers are exposed to many types of operational risks, including reputational risk, legal and compliance risk, the risk of fraud or theft by borrowers, employees or outsiders, unauthorized transactions by employees, or operational errors, including clerical or record keeping errors or those resulting from faulty or disabled computer or telecommunications systems or disclosure of confidential proprietary information of customers. In addition, negative public opinion can result from an Asset Manager\u2019s actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including lending practices, sales practices, customer treatment, corporate governance and acquisitions and from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to those activities. Negative public opinion can adversely affect an Asset Manager\u2019s ability to attract and keep customers and can expose it to litigation and regulatory action. Actual or alleged conduct by an Asset Manager can result in negative public opinion about its business.\nEach Asset Manager is subject to a variety of laws and regulations, including laws and regulations applicable to registered investment advisers. In order to conduct their operations in compliance with these laws and regulations, the Asset Managers have incurred and are expected to continue to incur substantial costs in order to comply with these laws and regulations. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations, as interpreted and enforced, could have a material adverse effect on an Asset Manager\u2019s results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nThe Asset Managers\u2019 businesses are dependent on their ability to process a large number of complex transactions. If an Asset Manager\u2019s financial, accounting, or other data processing systems fail or have other significant shortcomings, that Asset Manager could be materially adversely affected. Each Asset Manager is similarly dependent on their employees. For example, as Salus collects on its existing portfolio of loans it is expected that Salus\u2019 operations will significantly diminish and its number of employees will be significantly reduced. As a result, Salus will increasingly be dependent on a small number of employees. Salus and the other Asset Managers could be materially adversely affected by the loss of their key employees and/or if one of their employees causes a significant operational break-down or failure, either as a result of human error or where an individual purposefully sabotages or fraudulently manipulates its operations or systems.\nAn Asset Manager may also be subject to disruptions of its operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond its control, which may include, for example, computer viruses or electrical or telecommunications outages, natural or man-made disasters, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, or tornadoes, disease pandemics, or events arising from local or regional politics, including terrorist acts. Such disruptions may give rise to losses in service to clients and loss or liability to the Asset Manager. In addition, there is the risk that an Asset Manager\u2019s controls and procedures, as well as business continuity and data security systems prove to be inadequate. The computer systems and network systems an Asset Manager and others use could be vulnerable to unforeseen problems. These problems may arise in both an Asset Manager\u2019s internally developed systems and the systems of third-party service providers. In addition, an Asset Manager\u2019s computer systems and network infrastructure present security risks, and could be susceptible to hacking or identity theft. Any such failure could affect the Asset Manager\u2019s operations and could materially adversely affect its results of operations by requiring it to expend significant resources to correct the defect, as well as by exposing it to litigation or losses not covered by insurance. Although the Asset Managers have business continuity plans and other safeguards in place, an Asset Manager\u2019s business operations may be adversely affected by significant and widespread disruption to its physical infrastructure or operating systems that support its businesses and clients.\nEIC has a limited operating history. There can be no assurance that EIC will be able to successfully enter into investment management agreements or other investments or arrangements in the future, that such activities will be successful, or that EIC will be able to achieve its anticipated investment returns.\nAccordingly, no assurance may be provided that the Asset Managers will be successful in managing their assets, achieving their investment objectives or that the value of their assets will not decline substantially.\nRisks Related to Compass\u2019 Business\nOil, natural gas and NGL prices are volatile and have recently declined significantly. If oil, natural gas and NGL prices do not improve or if they decline further, Compass\u2019 business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nThe future financial condition, access to capital, cash flow and results of operations of Compass will depend upon the prices it receives for its oil, natural gas, and NGLs. Compass will be particularly dependent on prices for natural gas because a large portion of the proved reserves attributable to its properties are natural gas. Historically, oil, natural gas and NGL prices have been volatile and are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply and demand, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond the control of Compass. Factors that affect the prices Compass will receive for its oil and natural gas include:\n\u2022\nsupply and demand for oil and natural gas and expectations regarding supply and demand;\n\u2022\nthe level of domestic production;\n\u2022\nthe availability of imported oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\npolitical and economic conditions and events in foreign oil and natural gas producing nations, including embargoes, continued hostilities in the Middle East and other sustained military campaigns, and acts of terrorism or sabotage;\n\u2022\nthe ability of members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls;\n\u2022\nthe cost and availability of transportation and pipeline systems with adequate capacity;\n\u2022\nthe cost and availability of other competitive fuels;\n\u2022\nfluctuating and seasonal demand for oil, natural gas and refined products;\n\u2022\nconcerns about climate change or other conservation initiatives and the extent of governmental price controls and regulation of production;\n\u2022\nregional price differentials and quality differentials of oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nthe availability of refining capacity;\n\u2022\ntechnological advances affecting oil and natural gas production and consumption;\n\u2022\nweather conditions and natural disasters;\n\u2022\nforeign and domestic government relations and laws and regulations; and\n\u2022\noverall economic conditions.\nRecently, oil, natural gas and NGL prices have declined significantly. On November 16, 2015, the WTI posted price for crude oil was $41.68 per barrel and the Henry Hub spot market price of natural gas was $2.02 per MMBtu, representing decreases of 75% and 61%, respectively, from the high of $107.95 per barrel of oil and $8.15 per MMBtu for natural gas during 2014. Likewise, NGLs have suffered significant recent declines in realized prices. A further or extended decline in commodity prices could materially and adversely affect Compass\u2019 business, financial condition and results of operations and its ability to secure an adequate borrowing capacity, repay indebtedness and obtain additional capital on attractive terms. Lower oil natural gas and NGL prices may not only decrease Compass\u2019 revenues on a per unit basis but also may reduce the amount of oil, natural gas and NGLs that it can economically produce. A reduction in production could result in a shortfall in expected cash flows and require a reduction in capital spending or require additional borrowing. Without the ability to fund capital expenditures, Compass would be unable to replace reserves, which would negatively affect its future rate of growth.\nCompass has a substantial amount of indebtedness, which may adversely affect its cash flow and ability to operate its business, remain in compliance with debt covenants and make payments on its debt and distributions to us. HGI Funding has provided credit support for such indebtedness in the past but may choose not to do so in the future.\nCompass\u2019 borrowing base under the Partnership Credit Facility was $320.0 million as of November 13, 2015, and as of such date $307.0 million was drawn under the Partnership Credit Facility. Additionally, under the Partnership Credit Facility, the amount available under the borrowing base is determined semi-annually by the lenders using the lenders\u2019 valuation of Compass\u2019 assets. If the borrowing base is decreased below the amount of indebtedness then outstanding, Compass may have to repay its borrowings under the Partnership Credit Facility in order to conform to the new borrowing base. As of the November 2015 redetermination, the lenders determined that Compass\u2019 existing assets were insufficient to support a $320.0 million borrowing base. The lenders\nagreed to provide for a $320.0 million borrowing base only on the condition that HGI Funding agrees to guarantee up to $110.0 million of the Partnership Credit Facility and commit to make certain equity contributions to repay the borrowings under the Partnership Credit Facility to the extent a shortfall persisted as of the next scheduled redetermination. If Compass\u2019 assets are determined by the lenders to be insufficient to support the outstanding loans under the Partnership Credit Facility at a future redetermination, HGI Funding may determine not to provide any additional guarantees or equity commitments (or the lenders may decline to agree to maintain the borrowing base in exchange for the same), in which case Compass may be required to repay borrowings under the Partnership Credit Facility. To service its indebtedness, Compass will be required to generate a significant amount of cash. Compass\u2019 ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond its control, and any failure to meet its debt obligations could harm its business, financial condition and results of operations. In particular, Compass\u2019 reserves, borrowing base, production and cash flows can be negatively impacted by declines in natural gas prices. If Compass\u2019 operating cash flow and other capital resources are insufficient to fund its debt obligations, it may be forced to sell assets, seek additional equity or debt capital or restructure its debt. These remedies may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. In addition, the Partnership Credit Facility contains affirmative and negative covenants imposing operating and financial restrictions on Compass\u2019 business, including restrictions on, among other things, asset dispositions, mergers and acquisitions, dividends, other restricted payments, indebtedness, loans and investments, liens, affiliate transactions and amendments to organizational documents. The Partnership Credit Facility also requires the satisfaction of certain financial tests, including, among other things, a minimum consolidated current ratio and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio. Defaults under the maximum consolidated leverage ratio covenant for each fiscal quarter through the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2016 may be cured by HGI Funding, to the extent it elects to increase the amount of its guarantee of the Partnership Credit Facility. If such election is made, HGI Funding will be required to make an equity contribution to Compass in the amount of such elected guaranty within eleven business days of the delivery of Compass\u2019s compliance certificate under the Partnership Credit Agreement for the period ending September 30, 2016.\nChanges in the differential between NYMEX or other benchmark prices of oil and natural gas and the reference or regional index price used to price Compass\u2019 actual oil and natural gas sales could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations and financial condition of Compass.\nThe reference or regional index prices that Compass uses, to price its oil and natural gas sales sometimes reflect a discount to the relevant benchmark prices, such as NYMEX. The difference between the benchmark price and the price references in a sales contract is called a differential. It is not possible to accurately predict oil and natural gas differentials. Changes in differentials between the benchmark price for oil and natural gas and the reference or regional index price references in Compass\u2019 sales contracts could have a material adverse effect on Compass\u2019 results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nThere are risks associated with Compass\u2019 drilling activity that could impact the results of our operations.\nDrilling involves numerous risks, including the risk that Compass will not encounter commercially productive oil or natural gas reservoirs. The cost of identifying and acquiring properties and drilling and completing wells is also expensive. Additionally, seismic and other technology will not allow Compass to know conclusively prior to drilling a well that oil or natural gas is present or economically producible. The costs of drilling and completing wells are often uncertain, and drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors, including unexpected drilling conditions, pressure or irregularities in formations, equipment failures or accidents, weather conditions and shortages or delays in the delivery of equipment. We have experienced, and Compass may in the future experience, some delays in contracting for drilling rigs, and obtaining fracture stimulation crews and materials, which result in increasing costs to drill wells. All of these risks could adversely affect Compass\u2019 results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nPrior to April 30, 2105, Compass relied on EXCO to perform certain critical transition services. Compass has only operated as a stand-alone company since April 30, 2015 and while Compass has an experienced management team there can be no assurance that, as a new company, Compass will be able to effectively and efficiently implement its business strategy and operations.\nCompass terminated its transition services agreement with EXCO on April 30, 2015 and thereafter began operating as a stand-alone company. Compass currently handles all accounting, environmental, engineering, information technology and marketing administration services internally. Although Compass has employed an experienced management team, along with a full staff of employees, there can be no assurances that Compass will be able to perform these services as efficiently or effectively or at the same cost level at which such services were performed by EXCO. Significant disruption in these services, or unanticipated costs related to these services, could materially and adversely affect Compass\u2019 business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if Compass cannot successfully operate as a stand-alone company, with all appropriate systems and personnel, it may be unable to continue running its business as it is presently operated or at the same cost.\nCompass may be unable to successfully execute one or more disposition opportunities.\nCompass has made and continues to pursue disposition opportunities of its assets and properties, both to reduce its indebtedness and to increase its cash position. These disposition opportunities can consist of asset sales and/or the sale of stock of one or more\nof entities affiliated with Compass. There are no assurances that Compass will be able to identify suitable disposition opportunities in the future or that Compass will be able to complete such dispositions on favorable terms. Further, any such dispositions may not result in improved results of operations for Compass and significant dispositions may change the nature of Compass\u2019s operations and business.\nThe successful disposition of assets and properties requires an assessment of numerous factors, some of which are beyond Compass\u2019 control, including, without limitation, estimated recoverable reserves, exploration and development potential, prevailing oil and natural gas prices, operating costs, potential seller indemnification obligations, the creditworthiness of the buyer, the satisfaction of closing conditions that may be beyond the control of Compass and potential environmental and other liabilities. In connection with such an assessment, Compass performs a review of the subject properties that its management team believes to be generally consistent with industry practices. The resulting assessments are inexact and their accuracy uncertain, and such a review may not reveal all existing or potential benefits associated with a property, nor will it necessarily permit Compass to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their merits and deficiencies within the time frame required to complete the transactions. Sellers typically retain certain liabilities or indemnify buyers for certain matters. The magnitude of any such retained liability or indemnification obligation may be difficult to quantify at the time of the transaction and ultimately may be material. Also, as is typical in divestiture transactions, third parties may be unwilling to release Compass from guarantees or other credit support provided prior to the sale of the divested assets. As a result, after a divestiture, Compass may remain secondarily liable for the obligations guaranteed or supported to the extent that the buyer of the assets fails to perform these obligations.\nCompass relies on EXCO to provide certain natural gas marketing services, and there can be no assurance that Compass can replace those services.\nPrior to October 31, 2014, Compass\u2019 natural gas production was marketed and sold by EXCO. Upon the closing of the 2014 Acquisition from EXCO, Compass entered into several short-term agreements with EXCO, under which EXCO would continue to market and sell Compass\u2019 natural gas production from Vernon and Waskom fields. These short-term agreements have terms ending on December 31, 2015 and January 1, 2016, respectively. Compass also entered into a long-term agreement under which EXCO will continue to market and sell Compass\u2019 natural gas production from portions of the Holly field until November 30, 2020. Compass expects to enter into new contracts with other natural gas marketing companies prior to the expiration of its current arrangements with EXCO. If Compass fails to replace these contracts prior to their expiration dates, Compass will market its natural gas production internally. There is no assurance that Compass will be able to enter into replacement natural gas contracts on favorable terms or at all. Compass\u2019 business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected if it is unable to replace the natural gas marketing services currently provided by EXCO on favorable terms.\nCompass may encounter obstacles to marketing its natural gas, which could adversely impact its revenues.\nThe effective marketing and sale of Compass\u2019 natural gas production will depend upon the availability and capacity of natural gas gathering systems, pipelines and other transportation facilities. Compass will be primarily dependent upon third parties to transport its production. Transportation space on the gathering systems and pipelines to be used for Compass\u2019 natural gas is occasionally limited or unavailable due to repairs, outages caused by accidents or other events, or improvements to facilities or due to space being utilized by other companies that have priority transportation agreements. In addition, Compass\u2019 access to transportation options can also be affected by U.S. federal and state regulation of natural gas production and transportation, general economic conditions and changes in supply and demand. These factors and the availability of markets are beyond Compass\u2019 control. If regulatory or market factors materially change, the impact on Compass\u2019 revenues could be substantial and could adversely affect its ability to produce and market natural gas, which would negatively impact Compass\u2019 results of operation, cash flows and financial condition.\nCompass\u2019 estimates of oil and natural gas reserves will involve inherent uncertainty, which could materially affect the quantity and value of its reported reserves, its financial condition and the value of our interest therein.\nNumerous uncertainties are inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves, including many factors beyond Compass\u2019 control. This report contains estimates of the proved oil and natural gas reserves attributable to the properties acquired by Compass. These estimates are based upon reports of independent petroleum engineers. These reports rely upon various assumptions, including assumptions required by the SEC as to oil and natural gas prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, ad valorem and state severance taxes and availability of funds. These estimates should not be construed as the current market value of Compass\u2019 estimated proved reserves. The process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is complex, requiring significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir. As a result, the estimates are inherently imprecise evaluations of reserve quantities and future net revenue. In addition, as described in more detail in notes to the financial statements, Compass recognized an impairment of $485.1 million based on the excess of unamortized costs over fair value, which was primarily caused by the significant decline in commodity prices. The actual future production, revenues, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of Compass\u2019 recoverable oil and natural gas reserves may vary substantially from those that have been assumed in the estimates. Any significant variance in our assumptions could materially affect the quantity and value of reserves, or the amount of PV-10 and Standardized Measure\n(which is a measure recognized under U.S. GAAP) of the reserves, and Compass\u2019 financial condition. In addition, Compass\u2019 reserves, the amount of PV-10 and Standardized Measure, may be revised downward or upward based upon production history, results of future exploitation and development activities, prevailing oil and natural gas prices and other factors. A material decline in prices paid for Compass\u2019 production can adversely impact the estimated volumes and values of its reserves. Similarly, a decline in market prices for oil or natural gas may adversely affect its PV-10 and Standardized Measure. Any of these negative effects on Compass\u2019 reserves or PV-10 and Standardized Measure may decrease the value of HGI Energy\u2019s interests in Compass or the ability of Compass to pay distributions.\nCompass will be exposed to operating hazards and uninsured risks that could adversely impact its results of operations and cash flow.\nCompass\u2019 operations are subject to the risks inherent in the oil and natural gas industry, including the risks of:\n\u2022\nfires, explosions and blowouts;\n\u2022\npipe failures;\n\u2022\nabnormally pressured formations; and\n\u2022\nenvironmental accidents, such as spills, leaks, ruptures or discharges of natural gas, natural gas liquids, oil, process water, well fluids or other hazardous substances into the environment (including impacts to groundwater).\nThese events may result in substantial losses to Compass from:\n\u2022\ninjury or loss of life;\n\u2022\nsevere damage to or destruction of property, natural resources and equipment;\n\u2022\npollution or other environmental damage;\n\u2022\nenvironmental clean-up responsibilities;\n\u2022\nregulatory investigation;\n\u2022\npenalties and suspension of operations; or\n\u2022\nattorneys\u2019 fees and other expenses incurred in the prosecution or defense of litigation.\nAs is customary in the oil and gas production industry, Compass is insured against some, but not all, of these risks. Such insurance may not be adequate to cover these potential losses or liabilities. Furthermore, insurance coverage may not continue to be available at commercially acceptable premium levels or at all. Due to cost considerations, from time to time Compass may decline to obtain coverage for certain losses and liabilities, including drilling activities. Losses and liabilities arising from uninsured or under-insured events could require Compass to make large un-budgeted cash expenditures that could adversely impact its results of operations, cash flow and financial condition.\nCompass is subject to complex federal, state, local and other laws and regulations that could adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of conducting its operations.\nCompass\u2019 oil and natural gas development and production operations are subject to complex and stringent laws and regulations. In order to conduct its operations in compliance with these laws and regulations, it has obtained and must continue to obtain and maintain numerous permits, approvals and certificates from various federal, state and local governmental authorities. Compass has incurred and is expected to continue to incur substantial costs in order to comply with these laws and regulations. In addition, such costs may increase if existing laws and regulations are revised or reinterpreted, or if new laws and regulations become applicable to Compass\u2019 operations.\nCompass\u2019 business is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations as interpreted and enforced by governmental authorities possessing jurisdiction over various aspects of the exploration for, and the production and sale of, oil and natural gas. Also see Part I, Item 1. \u201cBusiness - Our Operating Subsidiaries - Compass - Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety Matters\u201d and \u201cBusiness - Our Operating Subsidiaries - Compass - Other Regulation of the Oil and Natural Gas Industry\u201d. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations, as interpreted and enforced, could have a material adverse effect on Compass\u2019 results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nCompass\u2019 hedging strategy may not effectively mitigate the impact of commodity price volatility from its cash flows, and its hedging activities could result in cash losses and may limit potential gains.\nThe prices at which Compass has, and will in the future, enter into commodity derivative contracts covering its production will be dependent upon oil and natural gas prices, and price expectations, at the time it enters into these transactions, which may be substantially higher or lower than current or future oil and natural gas prices. Accordingly, Compass\u2019 price hedging strategy may not protect it from significant declines in oil and natural gas prices received for its future production. Many of the derivative contracts to which it is and will be a party to will require it to make cash payments to the extent the applicable index exceeds a predetermined price, thereby limiting Compass\u2019 ability to realize the benefit of increases in oil and natural gas prices. If Compass\u2019 actual production and sales for any period is less than its hedged production and sales for that period (including reductions in production due to operational delays) or if Compass is unable to perform its drilling activities as planned, it might be forced to\nsatisfy all or a portion of its hedging obligations without the benefit of the cash flow from the sale of the underlying physical commodity, which may materially impact Compass\u2019 liquidity.\nCompass\u2019 hedging transactions will expose it to counterparty credit risk.\nCompass\u2019 hedging transactions expose it to risk of financial loss if a counterparty fails to perform under a derivative contract. Disruptions in the financial markets could lead to sudden changes in a counterparty\u2019s liquidity, which could impair its ability to perform under the terms of the derivative contract and, accordingly, prevent Compass from realizing the benefit of the derivative contract.\nCertain U.S. federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to oil and gas exploration and development may be eliminated as a result of future legislation.\nPresident Obama\u2019s proposed budgets for fiscal year 2011 through 2015 have included proposed legislation that would, if enacted into law, make significant changes to U.S. tax laws, including the elimination of certain key U.S. federal income tax incentives currently available to oil and natural gas exploration and production companies, such as Compass. These changes include, but are not limited to, (i) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas properties, (ii) the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs, (iii) the elimination of the manufacturing deduction for certain domestic production activities, and (iv) an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. It is unclear whether any such changes will be enacted or how soon any such changes could become effective. The passage of any legislation as a result of these proposals or any other similar changes in U.S. federal income tax laws could eliminate certain tax deductions that are currently available with respect to oil and gas exploration and development, and any such change could negatively affect the associated tax benefits otherwise available to Compass or HRG. Consequently, such changes could materially reduce the net return on investment from Compass-related properties.\nClimate change regulations could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for Compass\u2019 oil and natural gas production.\nGreenhouse gases (\u201cGHGs\u201d), including carbon dioxide, a product of the combustion of natural gas, and methane, a primary component of natural gas, may be contributing to the warming of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere, resulting in climatic changes. Federal, state and regional initiatives to reduce GHG emissions may adversely affect Compass\u2019 operations. For example, the EPA\u2019s so-called GHG tailoring rule imposes federal prevention of significant deterioration (PSD) permit requirements for new sources and modifications, and Title V operating permits for all sources, that have the potential to emit specific quantities of GHGs. Such permitting requirements could require Compass to install controls or implement other measures to reduce GHG emissions from new or modified sources. In addition, the EPA requires certain petroleum and natural gas sources to monitor, document and annually report their GHG emissions. Also see Part I, Item 1. \u201cBusiness - Our Operating Subsidiaries- Compass -Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety Matters\u201d and Part I, Item 1. \u201cBusiness - Our Operating Subsidiaries-Compass - Other Regulation of the Oil and Natural Gas Industry\u201d. These existing requirements, or any future GHG laws, regulations or permit requirements, could result in increased compliance costs or reduced demand for Compass\u2019 oil and gas production, which could negatively affect Compass\u2019 results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nCompass is subject to extensive environmental regulation, which could result in substantial liabilities and expenditures.\nCompass is subject to numerous federal, state and local laws, regulations and permit requirements relating to the protection of the environment, including those governing the discharge of materials into the water and air, the generation, management and disposal of petroleum products, process water, well fluids and hazardous substances and wastes and the remediation of contamination. Pursuant to such requirements, Compass could incur material costs and be subject to clean-up costs, fines and civil and criminal sanctions and third-party claims for property damage, natural resources damage and personal injury. Such requirements not only expose Compass to liability for its own activities, but may also expose it to liability for the conduct of others or for actions by Compass that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time those actions were taken.\nIn addition, Compass could incur substantial expenditures to comply with current or future environmental laws, regulations and permits. Such environmental requirements have grown more stringent over time. For example, federal and state regulators have become increasingly focused on air emissions associated with the oil and gas industry. On August 16, 2012, the EPA published a rule that subjects oil and gas operations to new and amended requirements under both the New Source Performance Standards and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants programs of the Clean Air Act. Among other things, the revised requirements imposed emission reduction measures on natural gas processing plants and other oil and gas operations, added reduced emission completion standards applicable to hydraulically fractured gas wells and established maximum achievable control technology standards for certain glycol dehydrators and storage vessels. These requirements will result in increased operating and compliance costs and increased regulatory burdens. Also see Part I, Item 1. \u201cBusiness - Our Operating Subsidiaries - Compass - Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety Matters\u201d and Part I, Item 1. \u201cBusiness - Our Operating Subsidiaries - Compass - Other Regulation of the Oil and Natural Gas Industry\u201d.\nThe liabilities and expenditures of Compass relating to environmental matters could have a material adverse effect on Compass\u2019 results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nCompass may experience a financial loss if any of its significant customers fail to pay it for its oil or natural gas.\nCompass\u2019 ability to collect the proceeds from the sale of oil and natural gas from its customers is dependent on the payment ability of its customer base, which includes several significant customers. If any one or more of its significant customers fails to pay it for any reason, Compass could experience a material loss. In addition, in recent years, it has become more difficult for oil and gas producers to maintain and grow a customer base of credit-worthy customers because a number of energy marketing and trading companies have discontinued their marketing and trading operations, which has significantly reduced the number of potential purchasers for oil and natural gas production. As a result, Compass may experience a material loss as a result of the failure of its customers to pay it for prior purchases of its oil or natural gas.\nCompetition in Compass\u2019 industry can be intense and it may be unable to compete in acquiring properties, contracting for drilling equipment and hiring experienced personnel.\nThe oil and natural gas industry is highly-competitive. Compass faces strong competition from other independent operators and from major oil companies in acquiring properties, contracting for drilling equipment and securing trained personnel. Many of these competitors have financial and technical resources and headcount substantially larger than Compass\u2019. As a result, Compass\u2019 competitors may be able to pay more for desirable leases, or to evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties or prospects than Compass\u2019 financial or personnel resources will permit. The oil and natural gas industry has periodically experienced shortages of drilling rigs, equipment, pipe and personnel, which has delayed development drilling and other exploitation activities and has caused significant expense/cost increases. Compass may experience difficulties in obtaining drilling rigs and other services in certain areas as well as an increase in the cost for these services and related material and equipment. It is not possible to predict when, or if, such shortages may again occur or how such shortages and price increases will affect Compass\u2019 development and exploitation program. Competition can also be strong in hiring experienced personnel, particularly in petroleum engineering, geoscience, accounting and financial reporting, tax and land professions. In addition, competition can be strong for attractive oil and natural gas producing properties, oil and natural gas companies, and undeveloped leases and drilling rights. Compass may be outbid by competitors in its attempts to acquire properties or companies.\nIf pipelines or other facilities interconnected to Compass\u2019 gathering and transportation pipelines and processing facilities become unavailable to transport or process natural gas, Compass\u2019 revenues and cash flow could be adversely affected.\nCompass has entered into contracts with third parties to obtain access to pipelines and other facilities for the gathering, processing and transportation of its oil and natural gas. Much of the natural gas transported by Compass\u2019 pipelines must be treated or processed before delivery into a pipeline for natural gas. If the processing and treating plants to which Compass delivers natural gas were to become temporarily or permanently unavailable for any reason, or if throughput were reduced because of testing, line repair, damage to pipelines, reduced operating pressures, lack of capacity or other causes, Compass\u2019 customers would be unable to deliver natural gas to end markets.\nCompass operates in a litigious environment.\nCompass operates in a litigious environment in which any constituent could bring suit regarding existing or planned operations of Compass or allege a violation of an existing contract or applicable law. Any such action could delay the commencement of planned operations or could cause a halt to existing production until such alleged violations are resolved by the courts. Not only could Compass incur significant legal and support expenses in defending its rights, but halting existing production or delaying planned operations could impact its future operations and financial condition. Such legal disputes can also distract management and other personnel from their primary responsibilities.\nIf Compass determines to pursue acquisition or reserve development opportunities, Compass may not identify all risks associated with such opportunities, which may result in unexpected liabilities and costs to it.\nIf Compass determines to pursue acquisition opportunities, it will be required to assess recoverable reserves, title, future oil and natural gas prices, operating costs, potential environmental risks and liabilities, potential tax and ERISA, liabilities, and other liabilities and other similar factors. As is common in the industry and depending on the size of the acquisition, it may not be feasible for Compass to review in detail every individual property involved in an acquisition. For example, for larger acquisitions, the review efforts of Compass may be focused on the higher-valued properties. Even a detailed review of properties and records may not reveal material existing or potential issues or provide Compass with sufficient information to assess fully their deficiencies and capabilities. Such issues, including deficiencies in the mechanical integrity of equipment or environmental conditions, may require significant remedial expenditures and could result in material liabilities and costs that negatively impact Compass\u2019 results of operations, cash flow and financial condition. Even if we or Compass are able to identify such issues with an acquisition, the seller may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection or indemnity against all or part of these problems. Even if a seller agrees to provide indemnity, the indemnity may not be fully enforceable and may be limited by floors and caps on such indemnity.\nIf Compass determines to pursue reserve development opportunities, it will faces a number of challenges that may limit its ability to develop or acquire additional oil and gas reserves, including competition, access to capital, prevailing oil and natural gas prices and the number and attractiveness of properties for sale. If Compass is unable to conduct successful development activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves, its total proved reserves will generally decline as a result of production. Also, its production will generally decline. If Compass\u2019 reserves and production decline, then the amount it will be able to borrow under the Partnership Credit Facility will also decline, which may further limit its ability to successfully acquire or develop additional reserves. Compass may be unable to locate additional reserves, drill economically productive wells or acquire properties containing proved reserves. If it fails to replace reserves through drilling or acquisitions, its level of production and cash flows will be adversely affected.\nIf Compass determines engage in acquisition, exploration, development and exploitation activities, it may not identify all the risks associated with such activities, which may result in unexpected liabilities and costs to it.\nIf Compass determines engage in acquisition, exploration, development and exploitation activities, it will need to assess data obtained from production reports and engineering studies, geophysical and geological analyses and seismic and other information, the results of which are often inconclusive and subject to various interpretations, which could significantly reduce Compass\u2019 ability to generate cash needed to service its debt, to fund its capital program and other working capital requirements and to pay distributions to us.", "PERMNO": 38295, "SIC": 3420, "TIC": "SPB"}
