{"cik": "1095858", "company": "ERBA Diagnostics, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-05-15", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below. These and other risks could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition. The risks described below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or other factors that we do not presently perceive to present significant risks to us at this time may also impair our operations. You should also refer to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIf we are not able to remediate the material weakness relating to our internal control over financial reporting, then the timing and accuracy of our financial reporting could be adversely affected and current and potential stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which would harm our business and the price of our common stock.\nAs described in Item 9A, Controls and Procedures, included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we disclosed a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to inadequate staffing of our financial accounting office. As a result of our inadequate staffing of our financial accounting office, among other things, at times we have been unable to provide timely account reconciliations. Our remediation efforts to address this material weakness are ongoing and include, among other things, hiring additional qualified personnel and evaluating or undertaking certain improvements to our systems and processes which, if successful, we believe will be sufficient to provide us with the ability to remediate or cure such material weakness in the future.\nUntil April 30, 2015, we did not have a Chief Financial Officer and our Controller had been our Principal Financial Officer and Principal Accounting Officer. Our Controller resigned effective as of April 30, 2015. Effective May 1, 2015, we hired and appointed a Chief Financial Officer. Our Chief Financial Officer will report to our Chief Executive Officer. Because our Chief Financial Officer joined the company during the second fiscal quarter of 2015, our Chief Executive Officer will serve as our Principal Financial Officer and Principal Accounting Officer until such time as we have filed this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the first fiscal quarter of 2015 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. At such time that we have made both filings, our Chief Financial Officer will then assume the responsibilities of our Principal Financial Officer and Principal Accounting Officer.\nWhile remediating this material weakness is a very high priority for our management and the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, we cannot assure you that we will not encounter further instances of breakdowns in our internal control over financial reporting. Public disclosure of this material weakness or a failure to promptly complete our remediation effort could cause our common stock price to fall. Additionally, our inability to maintain the operating effectiveness of the financial accounting office could result in material misstatements to our financial statements or other disclosures or could affect the timing of our financial reporting, all of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe remaining transactions contemplated by the investment under the stock purchase agreement with ERBA Mannheim may not be consummated on the contemplated terms, in the time frame anticipated, or at all.\nOn April 8, 2011 we entered into, and on June 30, 2011 we consummated the initial transactions under, a stock purchase agreement with ERBA Mannheim, pursuant to which we agreed to sell and issue to ERBA Mannheim an aggregate of 20,000,000 shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $15,000,000, or $0.75 per share, and warrants to purchase an additional 20,000,000 shares of our common stock with a five-year term and an exercise price per share equal to $0.75. The warrants are exercisable only to the extent that shares of our common stock have been purchased under the stock purchase agreement. The stock purchase agreement was amended on December 29, 2011 and on October 3, 2012. For purposes of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, references to the stock purchase agreement shall mean the stock purchase agreement as so amended.\nThrough December 31, 2014, under the stock purchase agreement, we have issued and sold to ERBA Mannheim a total of 15,333,334 shares of our common stock for aggregate gross proceeds of $11,500,000. As of December 31, 2014, under the stock purchase agreement, we remained obligated to issue and sell, and ERBA Mannheim remained obligated to purchase, another 4,666,666 shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $3,500,000, on the date that is 60 days after the date on which a majority of the independent directors on our board of directors determines by vote or written consent that such issuance, sale and purchase shall occur and causes notice thereof to be delivered to ERBA Mannheim.\nThrough December 31, 2014, under the stock purchase agreement, ERBA Mannheim has exercised warrants by paying to us an aggregate exercise price of $450,000 and, in connection therewith, we issued to ERBA Mannheim 600,000 shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2014, under the stock purchase agreement, warrants to purchase a total of 19,400,000 shares of our common stock remained unexercised, and warrants were exercisable for 14,733,334 shares of our common stock.\nThe remaining transactions contemplated by the investment under the stock purchase agreement may not be consummated on the contemplated terms, in the time frame anticipated, or at all. Additionally, the net proceeds of the investment contemplated by the stock purchase agreement may not provide adequate cash resources to fund our operations or liquidity needs for the reasonably foreseeable future. While the decision to initiate the consummation of the issuance and sale of the remaining shares of our common stock pursuant to the stock purchase agreement is at the discretion of a majority of the independent directors on our board of directors, ERBA Mannheim, while obligated under the stock purchase agreement to do so, will make its own decision whether, or not, to consummate the purchase of the remaining shares of our common stock pursuant to the stock purchase agreement. Additionally, the decision to exercise the warrants will be made by ERBA Mannheim based upon considerations it deems appropriate, which may include, among other things, the future market price of our common stock, which is subject to volatility and a number of other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Further, when making any such decision to purchase the remaining shares of our common stock or to exercise the warrants, ERBA Mannheim\u2019s interests may conflict with our interests. Further, the warrants may not be exercised, in whole or in part. If any of the foregoing factors were to occur, then we may not have adequate cash resources to fund our operations or liquidity needs for the reasonably foreseeable future.\nWhile we have entered into a purchase and sale agreement to sell our former facilities located in Miami, Florida, the sale of our former facilities may not be consummated on the contemplated terms, in the time frame anticipated, or at all.\nOn March 25, 2015, our wholly-owned subsidiary located in Miami Lakes, Florida - Diamedix - entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement with Joe Management LLC, as buyer, for the sale of the real property owned by Diamedix located at 2115, 2140, 2141, 2150, 2155, 2160 North Miami Avenue and 38 NW 22nd Street, in Miami, Florida, and all improvements thereon, or collectively, the Property. The purchase price for the Property is $23,000,000. As of December 31, 2014, the net book value of the land, buildings and improvements being sold was approximately $0.4 million.\nThe Purchase and Sale Agreement provides for a 45-day examination period, during which the buyer has the right to conduct a due diligence investigation of the Property and terminate the Purchase and Sale Agreement in its sole and absolute discretion. While the Purchase and Sale Agreement is binding upon Diamedix, the buyer, in its sole and absolute discretion, may terminate the Purchase and Sale Agreement during the 45-day examination period, in which case our sale of the Property would not be consummated. On May 8, 2015, the buyer and Diamedix amended the Purchase and Sale Agreement to extend the examination period to June 19, 2015.\nThe Purchase and Sale Agreement provides for the consummation of the purchase and sale of the Property to occur within 60 days after the expiration of the extended examination period. The Purchase and Sale Agreement may be assigned by the buyer without the consent of Diamedix.\nEither Diamedix or the buyer may consummate the sale and purchase, respectively, of the Property as part of a like kind exchange pursuant to Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code, or a 1031 Exchange. If Diamedix elects a 1031 Exchange and intends to purchase a replacement property with a portion of the purchase price, then a qualified independent third party intermediary will be required to hold such portion of the purchase price that is designated to be used by Diamedix to purchase the replacement property in such 1031 Exchange, and, in which case, Diamedix will not have access to such portion of the purchase price. After the consummation of the purchase and sale of the Property under the Purchase and Sale Agreement, Diamedix would have 45 days to identify the replacement property for the 1031 Exchange. The purchase of the replacement property in the 1031 Exchange would need to be consummated by the earlier to occur of 180 days after the consummation of the purchase and sale of the Property under the Purchase and Sale Agreement and the due date, including extensions, of Diamedix\u2019s tax return for the tax year in which the consummation of the purchase and sale of the Property under the Purchase and Sale Agreement occurs.\nUpon entering into the Purchase and Sale Agreement, the buyer placed into escrow an initial deposit of $100,000. If the buyer terminates the Purchase and Sale Agreement during the extended examination period, then the initial deposit will be returned to the buyer. If the buyer does not terminate the Purchase and Sale Agreement during the extended examination period, then, upon the expiration of such examination period, the buyer will be required to place into escrow an additional deposit of $400,000. After the expiration of the extended examination period, in the event of a default under the Purchase and Sale Agreement by the buyer, Diamedix would be entitled to receive the initial deposit and the additional deposit as its sole remedy. After the expiration of the extended examination period, in the event of a default under the Purchase and Sale Agreement by Diamedix, the buyer would be entitled to terminate the Purchase and Sale Agreement and receive the initial deposit and the additional deposit or attempt to specifically enforce the performance by Diamedix of its obligations under the Purchase and Sale Agreement.\nAcquisitions and our efforts to continue integrating these acquired businesses may disrupt our business operations and distract our management and may not proceed as planned.\nAcquisitions and our efforts to continue integrating these acquired businesses may use significant resources, result in disruptions to our business operations, result in distractions of our management and not proceed as planned and could expose us to unforeseen liabilities. These involve a number of special problems and risks, including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf\ndifficulty integrating acquired technologies, products, services, operations, customers and personnel with the existing businesses;\n\u25cf\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention in connection with integrating the acquired businesses;\n\u25cf\nstrain on managerial and operational resources as management tries to oversee larger operations;\n\u25cf\ndifficulty implementing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting at the acquired businesses; and\n\u25cf\nexposure to unforeseen liabilities of the acquired businesses.\nAs a result of these or other problems and risks, businesses we acquire may not produce the revenues, earnings, cash flows or business synergies that we anticipated, and the products, services or technologies of the acquired businesses may not perform as we expected. As a result, we may incur higher costs and realize lower revenues and earnings than we had anticipated. We may not be able to successfully address these problems, integrate the acquired businesses or generate sufficient revenue to offset the associated costs or other negative effects on our business.\nOur growth through acquisitions has placed, and is expected to place, significant demands on us.\nWe have grown our business through acquisitions. Businesses that grow rapidly often have difficulty managing their growth. Our growth has placed and is expected to continue to place significant demands on our management, on our accounting, financial, information and other systems and on our business. We need to continue recruiting and employing experienced executives and key employees capable of providing the necessary support. In addition, we will need to continue to improve our financial, accounting, information and other systems in order to effectively manage our growth. We cannot assure that our management will be able to manage our growth effectively or successfully, or that our financial, accounting, information or other systems will be able to successfully accommodate our external and internal growth. Our failure to meet these challenges could materially impair our business. To that effort, during 2015, we have hired a Chief Financial Officer, a Senior Vice President of Sales and a Vice President of Operations, all experienced with larger global businesses.\nWe have limited operating revenue and a history of primarily operational losses. If we continue to incur operating losses, then we may not have sufficient liquidity available to meet our needs.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded net revenues of $26.4 million and net income of $0.4 million. For the year ended December 31, 2013, we recorded net revenues of $28.3 million and net income of $0.7 million. Our principal source of short-term liquidity is, and during the past three years has been, existing cash and cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities. In connection with our evaluation of our operating results, financial condition and cash position, and specifically considering our results of operations and cash utilization during 2012 and 2011, we enacted various measures to reduce expenses in order to improve future cash flow. As a result, our operating results improved in 2013 and 2014 from the operating results achieved during 2011 and 2012. During 2011, we entered into the stock purchase agreement with ERBA Mannheim. On March 1, 2013, we entered into a $2,000,000 line of credit with Citibank, N.A., which we replaced with a new line of credit of up to $3,500,000 on March 24, 2015. For the long-term, we intend to utilize principally existing cash and cash equivalents, as well as internally generated funds, which we anticipate will be derived primarily from our operations as well as possible sources of debt and equity financings, including, without limitation, from the line of credit and the investment contemplated by the stock purchase agreement. There is, however, no assurance that existing cash and cash equivalents will, in the short- or long-term, satisfy all of our cash requirements and fund any losses from operations. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that we will be able to operate on a profitable basis or internally generate funds from our operations. If existing cash and cash equivalents are insufficient to finance operations, if we are unable to operate on a profitable basis or internally generate funds from our operations, or if existing and possible future sources of liquidity described above, including, without limitation, from the line of credit or the investment contemplated by the stock purchase agreement, are insufficient, then we may be required to curtail or reduce our operations. There can be no assurance that, if we seek to raise additional funds through issuing debt or equity securities or incurring indebtedness, any such additional funds would be available on acceptable terms or at all.\nWe have become non-compliant with the continued listing standards of the NYSE MKT. If we fail to timely cure our non-compliance with the continued listing standards of the NYSE MKT or, whether or not timely cured, if we fall below the continued listing standards of the NYSE MKT again, then our common stock could be delisted from the NYSE MKT.\nOn April 17, 2015, we received a letter from NYSE MKT LLC (the \u201cExchange\u201d) stating that the Exchange has determined that we are not in compliance with Sections 134 and 1101 of the Exchange\u2019s Company Guide (the \u201cCompany Guide\u201d) due to our failure to timely file our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The letter also stated that our failure to timely file our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014 is a material violation of its listing agreement with the Exchange and, therefore, pursuant to Section 1003(d) of the Company Guide, the Exchange is authorized to suspend and, unless prompt corrective action is taken, remove the Company\u2019s securities from the Exchange.\nOn May 1, 2015, we submitted a plan of compliance (the \u201cPlan\u201d) addressing how we intend to regain compliance with Sections 134 and 1101 of the Company Guide by July 16, 2015 (the \u201cPlan Period\u201d). If our Plan is accepted by the Exchange, then we may be able to continue our listing during the Plan Period, during which time we will be subject to periodic review to determine whether we are making progress consistent with the Plan. If our Plan is not accepted by the Exchange, then we will be subject to delisting proceedings. Furthermore, if the Plan is accepted by the Exchange, but we are not in compliance with the continued listing standards of the Company Guide by July 16, 2015, or if we do not make progress consistent with the Plan during the Plan Period, then the Exchange staff will initiate delisting proceedings as appropriate.\nConcerns regarding the Italian government fiscal and debt crises could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nA substantial portion of our accounts receivable are concentrated in Italy and may be affected by the recent fiscal and debt crises facing the Italian government. As of December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, $2.1 million and $4.6 million, respectively, of our total net accounts receivable were due from customers of our Italian subsidiary, the majority of which are located in Italy. Of our total net accounts receivable, 12% at December 31, 2014 and 24% at December 31, 2013 were due from hospitals and laboratories controlled by the Italian government. We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts, particularly in Italy where payment cycles are longer than in the United States, for potential credit losses based on the age of the accounts receivable and the results of our periodic credit evaluations of our customers\u2019 financial condition.\nRecently, the Italian government has been experiencing severe fiscal and debt crises and a recession, including its increasingly uncertain ability to service its sovereign debt obligations, caused in part by the declining global markets and economic conditions. Accordingly, we are subject to certain economic, business and, in particular, credit risk if our customers located in Italy which are hospitals or laboratories controlled by the Italian government do not pay amounts owed to us, extend payment cycles even further or ask us to accept a lower payment amount than is owed to us. Our current allowances for doubtful accounts may not be adequate and we may be required to make additional allowances, which would adversely affect, and could materially adversely affect, our operating results in the period in which the determination or allowance is or was made. Any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, operating results, financial condition and cash flows in the near term.\nAdditionally, we periodically receive payments based upon negotiated agreements with governmental regions in Italy, acting on behalf of hospitals located in the region, in satisfaction of previously outstanding accounts receivable balances. We may anticipate collection of these amounts through a payment as described above, and, therefore, not provide an allowance for doubtful accounts for these amounts. Additional payments by governmental regions in Italy are possible, and, as a result, we may consider the potential receipt of those payments in determining our allowance for doubtful accounts. If contemplated payments are not received, if existing agreements are not complied with or cancelled or if we require additional allowances, then our operating results could be materially adversely affected during the period in which the determination to increase the allowance for doubtful accounts is or was made.\nIf we fail to collect our accounts receivable, our operating results could be materially adversely affected.\nWe maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, our accounts receivable were $7.4 million and $6.6 million, respectively, and our allowance for doubtful accounts was $0.9 million and $1.1 million, respectively. There is no assurance that we will collect our outstanding accounts receivable or that our allowance for doubtful accounts will be adequate.\nThe failure to collect outstanding receivables, whether relating to Italy, the United States or elsewhere, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, operating results or financial condition. If the financial condition of our customers was to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, then we may be required to make additional allowances, which would adversely affect our operating results in the period in which the determination or allowance is or was made.\nThe future success of our business depends on our development, manufacture and marketing of new products.\nOur future success is largely dependent upon our ability to develop, manufacture and market commercially successful new scientific instruments and assays. Delays in the development, manufacture or marketing of new products will impact our operating results, financial condition and cash flows. Each of the steps in the development, manufacture and marketing of our products, as well as the process taken as a whole, involves significant periods of time and expense. There can be no assurance that:\n\u25cf\nany of our products presently under development, if and when fully developed and tested, will perform as expected,\n\u25cf\nwe will obtain necessary regulatory approvals in a timely manner, if at all, or\n\u25cf\nwe can successfully and profitably produce and market any of our products.\nAny of the above factors may materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, operating results, financial condition or cash flows.\nOur strategic initiatives, including our development and future commercial release of new products such as the next generation ELISA platform-the LISA XL, and the Hb Vario instrument system, may not be successful.\nThe development and marketing of new or enhanced products, including, without limitation, the LISA XL and Hb Vario instrument systems, is a complex and uncertain process. Accordingly, we cannot be certain that:\n\u25cf\nthe LISA XL or the Hb Vario instrument systems will perform as expected,\n\u25cf\nthe LISA XL or the Hb Vario instrument systems will enable us to expand the menu of test kits we offer,\n\u25cf\nthe LISA XL or the Hb Vario instrument systems will be a source of revenue growth for us,\n\u25cf\nwe will receive financial benefits or achieve improved operating results as a result of the future commercial release of the LISA XL or the Hb Vario instrument systems,\n\u25cf\nwe will be successful in the marketing of the LISA XL or the Hb Vario instrument systems, or\n\u25cf\ncustomers will integrate the LISA XL or the Hb Vario instrument systems into their operations as readily as expected.\nAny of the above factors may materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, operating results, financial condition or cash flows.\nOur future success depends on portfolio expansion, global geographic expansion, market segmentation and market focus strategies, and the development of new markets.\nOur success depends, in large part, on expanding our portfolio of products and on our ability to broaden sales of our existing products both in the United States and globally. Through our legacy operations, we have historically developed, manufactured and marketed diagnostic test kits, or assays, and automated instrument systems that are used to aid in the detection of disease primarily in the areas of autoimmune, infectious diseases and clinical chemistry. Our 2012 acquisition of Drew Scientific now allows us to design, manufacture and distribute instrument systems for blood cell counting and blood analysis, to sell diabetic testing products including the DS5 instrument, dispenser and associated reagent kit, which measure long-term glucose control in diabetic patients (HbA1c), and to offer a broad array of equipment for use in the field of human and veterinary hematology. Additionally, our 2012 acquisition of JAS Diagnostics now allows us to manufacture a broad range of liquid stable, diagnostics chemistry reagents used for in vitro diagnostics testing as well as to sell many general chemistry reagents that can be used on numerous open system chemistry instrument analyzers. In an effort to penetrate the market more effectively, we intend to continue expanding our portfolio of products in the areas of autoimmune, infectious diseases, clinical chemistry, hematology and diabetes testing, as well as continue increasing our sales and marketing activities in the United States and throughout the world.\nOur success also largely depends on the introduction and acceptance by hospitals, clinics and laboratories of our new diagnostic products and our ability to broaden sales of our existing products to current and new customers.\nIn an effort to penetrate the market more effectively, we intend to expand our sales and marketing activities by, among other things:\n\u25cf\nincreasing our sales force,\n\u25cf\nexpanding our promotional activities,\n\u25cf\ndeveloping additional third party strategic distributorships, and\n\u25cf\nparticipating in trade shows.\nThere is no assurance that any of the activities or programs described above or any other activities or programs will be successful. The failure of any such activities or programs could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, operating results or financial condition.\nOur own manufacture of scientific instruments, reagents and test kits may not provide us with anticipated cost savings or competitive advantages.\nWe have sought to differentiate ourselves from our competitors through our proprietary instrument systems. While some of our competitors offer proprietary instruments, other competitors use third parties to manufacture these instruments for them. We manufacture our Mago\u00ae 4 and Mago\u00ae 4S instruments at Delta, our wholly-owned subsidiary in Italy. Additionally, our wholly-owned subsidiary located in Springdale, Arkansas, ImmunoVision, produces certain autoimmune reagents and our wholly-owned subsidiary located in Miami Lakes, Florida, Diamedix, produces diagnostic test kits. There can be no assurance that we will realize cost savings or competitive advantages from our own production of scientific instruments, reagents or test kits.\nWe may not be able to increase the volume of our reagent production to meet increased demand.\nOur \u201creagent rental\u201d program in which customers make reagent kit purchase commitments with us that typically last for a period of three to five years and our sales of these reagent kits are principal sources of revenue for us. If the demand for reagent kits increases, there can be no assurance that we will be able to increase the volume of our reagent kit production in order to meet such demand. Any failure to meet the demand for reagent kits could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, operating results or financial condition.\nOur research and development expenditures may not result in commercially successful products.\nWe devote substantial resources to research and development to update and improve our existing products, as well as to develop new products and technologies. During 2014, we incurred approximately $1.4 million on our research and development efforts. We may in the future increase the amounts we spend on research and development depending upon, among other things:\n\u25cf\nthe outcome of clinical testing of products under development,\n\u25cf\ndelays or changes in government required testing or approval procedures,\n\u25cf\ntechnological and competitive developments,\n\u25cf\nstrategic marketing decisions, and\n\u25cf\nliquidity.\nAs a result, our research and development expenditures may adversely impact our earnings and cash flows in the short term. Additionally, there is no assurance that:\n\u25cf\nour research and development expenditures will result in the development of new products or product enhancements,\n\u25cf\nwe will successfully complete products currently under development,\n\u25cf\nwe will obtain regulatory approval for any such products, or\n\u25cf\nany approved product will be produced in commercial quantities, at reasonable costs, and be successfully marketed.\nThe markets for our products are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change.\nThe markets for our products are highly competitive and are characterized by continual and rapid technological developments that have resulted, and will likely continue to result, in substantial improvements in product function and performance. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate changes in technology and industry requirements and to respond to technological developments on a timely basis, either internally or through strategic alliances. Several companies have developed, or are developing, scientific instruments and assays that compete, or will compete, directly with products marketed by us. Many existing and potential competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing, research and technological resources, as well as established reputations for success in developing, manufacturing, selling and servicing products, than us. Competitors that are more vertically integrated than us may have more flexibility to compete effectively on price. We expect that existing and new competitors will continue to introduce products or services that are, directly or indirectly, competitive with those sold by us. Such competitors may succeed in developing products that are more functional or less costly than those sold by us and may be more successful in marketing such products. These and other changes and innovations in the rapidly changing medical technology market may negatively affect the sales of the products we market. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in this market or that technology developments by our competitors will not render our current or future products or technologies obsolete. If we fail to effectively compete or adapt to changing technology, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, operating results or financial condition.\nOur success depends on key personnel, the loss of whom could disrupt our business.\nOur business is dependent on the active participation of our principal executive officers. The loss of the services of any of these individuals could adversely affect our business and future prospects. In addition, our success is dependent on our ability to retain and attract additional qualified management, scientists, engineers, developers and regulatory and other personnel. Competition for such talent is intense and there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain such personnel. During 2015, we hired a Chief Financial Officer, a Senior Vice President of Sales and a Vice President of Operations, all experienced with larger global businesses.\nOur business is dependent on third party distributors.\nAlthough our direct sales force consummates the majority of our sales in the United States, we also engage third party distributors to sell our products. In Italy, our products are sold through Delta\u2019s sales representatives and independent agents. Our international sales outside of Italy are through third party distributors. There is no assurance that third party distributors or independent sales personnel will achieve acceptable levels of sales or that, if any of our existing arrangements expire or terminate, we will be able to replace any distributors or sales personnel on terms advantageous to us, or at all. Further, there is no assurance that we will be able to expand our distribution network by adding additional distributors or sales personnel. If third party distributors or independent sales personnel cease to promote our products, or if we are unable to make acceptable arrangements with distributors or sales personnel in other markets, our business, prospects, operating results or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nWe depend on our proprietary rights and cannot be certain of their confidentiality and protection.\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to protect our current and future technologies and products and to defend our intellectual property rights. The technology associated with the design and manufacture of the Mago\u00ae 4 and Mago\u00ae 4S instruments is not protected by patent registrations or license restrictions. There can be no assurance that our competitors will not gain access to our trade secrets and proprietary and confidential technologies or that they will not independently develop similar or competing trade secrets and technologies. If others develop competing instruments or other products, then this could erode our competitive advantage and materially harm our business.\nWe also rely on trade secrets, unpatented proprietary know-how and continuing technological innovation. We use confidentiality agreements with licensees, suppliers, employees and consultants to protect our trade secrets, unpatented proprietary know-how and continuing technological innovation. There can be no assurance that these parties will not breach their agreements with us. We also cannot be certain that we will have adequate remedies for any breach. Disputes may arise concerning the ownership of intellectual property or the applicability of confidentiality agreements. Furthermore, we cannot be sure that our trade secrets and proprietary technology will not otherwise become known or that our competitors will not independently develop similar or competing trade secrets and proprietary technology. We also cannot be sure, if we do not receive patents for products arising from research, that we will be able to maintain the confidentiality of information relating to our products.\nThird parties may claim that we infringe their proprietary rights, which may prevent us from manufacturing and selling some of our products or result in claims for substantial damages.\nTechnology-based companies are often very litigious and are often subject to unforeseen litigation. Therefore, although our business philosophy is to respect intellectual property rights, we face the risk of adverse claims and litigation alleging infringement of intellectual property rights belonging to others. These claims could result in costly litigation and could divert management\u2019s and technical personnel\u2019s attention from other matters. The outcome of any claim is difficult to predict because of the uncertainties inherent in litigation. In addition, regardless of the merits of any infringement claims, these claims could cause us to lose our right to develop our discoveries or commercialize our products in certain markets or could require us to pay monetary damages or royalties to license proprietary rights from third parties. Furthermore, we cannot be certain that we would be able to obtain these licenses on terms we believe to be acceptable. As a result, an adverse determination in a judicial, administrative or other similar proceeding or failure to obtain necessary licenses could have a material and adverse effect on our business, prospects, operating results or financial condition.\nThere are inherent uncertainties involved in estimates, judgments and assumptions used in the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Any changes in estimates, judgments and assumptions used could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and operating results.\nThe consolidated financial statements included in the periodic reports we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including those included as part of the Annual Report on Form 10-K, are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP involves making estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets (including goodwill and other intangible assets such as our hepatitis technology product license), liabilities and related reserves, revenues, expenses and income. This includes estimates, judgments and assumptions for assessing the recoverability of our goodwill and other intangible assets, pursuant to applicable accounting guidance. If any estimates, judgments or assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record additional expenses or impairment charges. Any resulting expense or impairment loss would be recorded as a charge against our earnings and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results. Estimates, judgments and assumptions are inherently subject to change in the future, and any such changes could result in corresponding changes to the amounts of assets (including goodwill and other intangible assets), liabilities, revenues, expenses and income. Any such changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and operating results.\nOn an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including, among others, those relating to:\n\u25cf\nproduct returns,\n\u25cf\nallowances for doubtful accounts,\n\u25cf\ninventories and related reserves,\n\u25cf\ngoodwill and other intangible assets,\n\u25cf\nincome and other tax accruals,\n\u25cf\ndeferred tax asset valuation allowances,\n\u25cf\ndiscounts and allowances,\n\u25cf\nstock based compensation,\n\u25cf\nwarranty obligations, and\n\u25cf\ncontingencies and litigation.\nWe base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our assumptions and estimates may, however, prove to have been incorrect and our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. While we believe the assumptions and estimates we make are reasonable, any changes to our assumptions or estimates, or any actual results which differ from our assumptions or estimates, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and operating results.\nDuring the third quarter of 2007, we determined there was sufficient indication to require us to assess, in accordance with applicable accounting guidance, whether any portion of our goodwill balance, which was recorded in both ImmunoVision and Delta, was impaired. Based primarily upon our estimate of forecasted discounted cash flows for each of these subsidiaries and our market capitalization, we determined that the carrying amount of the goodwill at each of Delta and ImmunoVision was in excess of its respective fair value. We concluded that all $4.7 million of the goodwill recorded at Delta and $1.2 million of the $2.1 million of goodwill recorded at ImmunoVision was impaired. As a result, we recorded a noncash goodwill impairment charge to operations totaling $5.9 million during the third quarter of 2007. Additionally, in October 2012, with the acquisition of Drew Scientific, we recorded goodwill of $2.6 million. No impairment charge was recorded for the goodwill at ImmunoVision or Drew Scientific for 2014 or 2013. However, a decline in our market capitalization or sales by ImmunoVision or Drew Scientific could require us to record impairment charges in future periods for the goodwill recorded for ImmunoVision or Drew Scientific, as the case may be, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial position and operating results.\nThe trend towards consolidation in the diagnostics industry may adversely affect us.\nThe diagnostics industry has experienced considerable consolidation through mergers and acquisitions in the past several years. This consolidation trend may result in the remaining companies having greater financial resources and technological capabilities, thereby intensifying competition in the industry, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nConsolidation of our customers or the formation of group purchasing organizations could result in increased pricing pressure that could adversely affect our operating results.\nThe health care industry has undergone significant consolidation resulting in increased purchasing leverage for customers and consequently increased pricing pressures on our business. Additionally, some of our customers have become affiliated with group purchasing organizations. Group purchasing organizations typically offer members price discounts on laboratory supplies and equipment if they purchase a bundled group of one supplier\u2019s products, which results in a reduction in the number of manufacturers selected to supply products to the group purchasing organization and increases the group purchasing organization\u2019s ability to influence its members\u2019 buying decisions. Further consolidation among customers or their continued affiliation with group purchasing organizations may result in significant pricing pressures and correspondingly reduce the gross margins of our business or may cause our customers to reduce their purchases of our products, thereby adversely affecting our business, prospects, operating results or financial condition.\nAdditionally, in Italy, and most other countries in Western Europe, our products are sold predominantly to public hospital laboratories, which are managed by government structures, either directly or indirectly. In most cases, our products are sold through a bid process known as tenders for multiple year periods. Due to the efforts exercised by many governments to contain healthcare costs, there has been a constant effort to consolidate laboratory units and, consequently, the bid process continues to become even more competitive. The containment of healthcare costs, consolidation of laboratory units or increase in the competitiveness of the bid process could adversely affect our business, prospects, operating results or financial condition.\nReimbursement policies of third parties could affect the pricing and demand for our products.\nOur profitability may be materially adversely affected by changes in reimbursement policies of governmental and private third party payors. The products we market are purchased principally by healthcare providers that typically bill third party payors such as governmental programs (e.g., Medicare and Medicaid), private insurance plans and managed care plans, for healthcare services provided to their patients. Governmental reimbursement policies are subject to rapid and significant changes in the United States, at both the federal and state levels, and in other countries. Private third party payors are increasingly negotiating the prices charged for medical products and services. There can be no assurance that healthcare providers will not respond to such pressures by substituting competitors\u2019 products for our products. A third party payor may deny reimbursement if it determines that a device was not used in accordance with cost-effective treatment methods, was experimental or for other reasons. There can be no assurance that our products will qualify for reimbursement by governmental programs in accordance with guidelines established by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, by state government payors or by commercial insurance carriers, or that reimbursement will be available in other countries.\nWe may face significant uncertainty due to government healthcare reform.\nPolitical, economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry to fundamental changes. We anticipate that the current administration, Congress and certain state legislatures will continue to review and assess the healthcare system and payment methods with an objective of ultimately reducing healthcare costs and expanding access. During March 2010, Congress approved, and the President signed into law, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, which have made and are expected to continue to make significant changes to the healthcare industry. The uncertainties regarding the ultimate features of healthcare reform initiatives and their enactment and implementation, including with respect to the recently approved federal legislation, may have an adverse effect on our customers\u2019 purchasing decisions regarding our products. At this time, we cannot predict what additional healthcare reform proposals will be adopted or what impact the recently approved federal legislation may have on our business and operations. Any impact of the recently approved federal legislation, or additional healthcare reform proposals, may be adverse on our operating results and financial condition.\nCost containment measures could affect our ability to sell our products.\nVarious legislative proposals, including proposals relating to the cost containment of healthcare products and the reimbursement policies of governmental and private third party payors, could materially impact the pricing and sale of our products. Reimbursement policies may not include our products. Even if reimbursement policies of third parties grant reimbursement status for a product, we cannot be sure that these reimbursement policies will remain in effect. Limits on reimbursement could reduce the demand for our products. The unavailability or inadequacy of third party reimbursement for our products could reduce or possibly eliminate demand for our products. We are unable to predict whether governmental authorities will enact additional legislation or regulation which will affect third party coverage and reimbursement that reduces demand for our products.\nCompliance with governmental regulation is critical to our business.\nThe products we sell are subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental and regulatory authorities in the United States, principally the FDA, and other countries. Such regulation includes the regulation of the approval, manufacturing and testing controls, labeling, marketing and sale of diagnostic devices. Failure to comply with these governmental regulations can result in fines, unanticipated compliance expenditures, interruptions of production and criminal prosecution.\nThe process of obtaining regulatory approval is rigorous, time consuming and costly. There is no assurance that necessary approvals will be attained on a timely basis, if at all, or at the anticipated cost. In addition, product approvals can be withdrawn if we fail to comply with regulatory standards or if unforeseen problems occur following initial marketing.\nIn addition, as a general matter, foreign regulatory requirements for medical devices are becoming increasingly stringent. \u201cCE Marking\u201d must be obtained for all medical devices commercially distributed in the European Union, even though the medical devices may have already received FDA clearance. In order to be commercially distributed throughout the European Union, certain of our products must bear the \u201cCE Marking.\u201d All of the products that we currently sell throughout the European Union are in conformity with the applicable \u201cCE\u201d regulations under the In Vitro Diagnostics Directive. However, if in the future we lose the authorization to use the \u201cCE Marking,\u201d we may not be able to sell our products in the European Union, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition.\nDomestic and foreign regulations are subject to change, and extensive changes in regulation may increase our operating expenses. The evolving and complex nature of regulatory requirements, the broad authority and discretion of regulatory authorities and the extremely high level of regulatory oversight result in a continuing possibility that we may be adversely affected by regulatory actions despite our efforts to maintain compliance with regulatory requirements. Delays in obtaining, or the inability to obtain, necessary domestic or foreign regulatory approvals, failures to comply with applicable regulatory requirements or extensive changes in regulation could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, operating results or financial condition.\nWe are subject to a number of regulatory and contractual restrictions with respect to our European subsidiary.\nDelta, our wholly-owned subsidiary, is located in Italy. Our employment relations in Italy are governed by numerous regulatory and contractual requirements, including, among other things, national collective labor agreements and individual employer labor agreements. These arrangements address a number of specific issues affecting our working conditions, including, without limitation, hiring, work time, wages and benefits and termination of employment. The cost of complying with these requirements is substantial and may materially adversely affect our business, prospects, operating results or financial condition. Additionally, Delta must comply with minimum capital requirements established by Italian law. From time to time, we may utilize cash to assist Delta in maintaining its compliance with these capital requirements. There can be no assurance that Delta will be able to maintain its compliance with these capital requirements with or without our cash assistance. Under certain circumstances, during the time when Delta is utilizing cash assistance that we provide, the amount of such cash assistance may not be available for our use in other portions of our business. Furthermore, any cash assistance that we provide to Delta may not be repaid or distributed to us when expected, or at all. Any of these risks may adversely affect our liquidity or financial condition.\nOur products could fail to perform according to specification or prove to be unreliable, which could damage our customer relationships and industry reputation and result in lawsuits and loss of sales.\nOur customers require demanding specifications for product performance and reliability. Because the products we market are complex and often use state-of-the-art components, processes and techniques, undetected errors and design flaws may occur. Product defects result in higher product service, warranty and replacement costs and may cause serious damage to our customer relationships and industry reputation, all of which may negatively impact our sales and business. We may be subject to lawsuits if any of the products we market fails to operate properly or causes any ailment to be undiagnosed or misdiagnosed.\nWe may be exposed to product liability claims, and there can be no assurance of adequate insurance.\nLike all diagnostics companies, the testing, manufacturing and marketing of our products may expose us to product liability and other claims resulting from their use. If any such claims against us are successful, we may be required to make significant compensation payments and suffer the associated adverse publicity. Even unsuccessful claims could result in the expenditure of funds in litigation and the diversion of management time and resources. We believe that we maintain an adequate amount of product liability insurance, but there can be no assurance that our insurance will cover all existing and future claims or that we will be able to maintain existing coverage or obtain additional coverage at reasonable rates. If a claim is not covered or if our coverage is insufficient, we may incur significant liability payments that would have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition.\nDamages to or disruptions at our facilities could adversely impact our ability to effectively operate our business.\nA portion of our facilities, as well as our corporate headquarters and other critical business functions, are located in Miami Lakes, Florida - an area subject to hurricane casualty risk. Although we have certain limited protection afforded by insurance, our business and earnings could be materially adversely affected in the event of a major windstorm.\nPolitical and economic instability and foreign currency fluctuations may adversely affect the revenues generated by our foreign operations.\nWe have a significant wholly-owned subsidiary, Delta, located in Italy. For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, Delta represented 21% and 18%, respectively, of our net revenues. In addition, our current business plan includes a goal of expanding our product reach on a global basis and specifically in key regions in Europe, South America and Asia. Conducting an international business inherently involves a number of difficulties, risks and uncertainties, such as:\n\u25cf\nexport and trade restrictions,\n\u25cf\ninconsistent and changing regulatory requirements,\n\u25cf\ntariffs and other trade barriers,\n\u25cf\ncultural issues,\n\u25cf\nlonger payment cycles,\n\u25cf\nproblems in collecting accounts receivable,\n\u25cf\npolitical instability,\n\u25cf\nlocal economic downturns,\n\u25cf\nseasonal reductions in business activity in Europe during the traditional summer vacation months, and\n\u25cf\npotentially adverse tax consequences.\nAny of the above factors may materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, operating results or financial condition.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, 21% and 18%, respectively, of our net revenues were generated in currencies other than the United States dollar, and we anticipate that this percentage may increase in future periods as a result of our efforts to expand our product reach internationally. Fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies relative to the United States dollar affect our operating results. For instance, if the United States dollar strengthens relative to foreign currency, then our earnings generated in foreign currency will, in effect, decrease when converted into United States dollars, which could have a material and adverse effect on our operating results and cash flows. We do not use financial derivatives to hedge exchange rate fluctuations.\nOur indebtedness may impact our financial condition and results of operations and the terms of our indebtedness may limit our activities.\nOn March 25, 2015, we entered into a new line of credit with Citibank, N.A., which provides for a secured, revolving credit facility of up to $3,500,000. This new line of credit has replaced our old line of credit with Citibank, which provided for a secured, revolving credit facility of up to $2,000,000. The old line of credit is no longer outstanding. As of December 31, 2014, we had approximately $1,940,000 of indebtedness outstanding under the old line of credit with Citibank. Subject to applicable restrictions in the loan agreement, we may incur indebtedness in the future. Our level of indebtedness will have several important effects on our future operations, including, without limitation, that we may be required to use a portion of our cash flow from operations for the payment of principal and interest due on our outstanding indebtedness, that our outstanding indebtedness and leverage will increase the impact of negative changes in general economic and industry conditions, as well as competitive pressures, and that our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures or general corporate purposes may be impacted.\nOur indebtedness outstanding under the line of credit bears interest at a floating rate tied to LIBOR. Accordingly, if interest rates increase, whether generally or as the result of our lender\u2019s requirement, then the amount of the interest payments on our floating rate indebtedness will also increase. General economic conditions, industry cycles and financial, business and other factors affecting our operations, many of which are beyond our control, may affect our future performance. As a result, these and other factors may affect our ability to make principal and interest payments on our indebtedness.\nAmounts outstanding under the revolving line of credit with Citibank are collateralized by all of our assets and all of the assets of our wholly-owned subsidiaries located in the United States - Diamedix, ImmunoVision, Drew Scientific and JAS. Amounts outstanding under the revolving line of credit are also secured by our pledge of up to 66% of the total combined voting power of all classes of capital stock and other equity interest entitled to vote of our wholly-owned subsidiary located in Italy - Delta. In addition, each of Diamedix, ImmunoVision, Drew Scientific and JAS has guaranteed the repayment of amounts outstanding under the revolving line of credit. Further, Transasia, our indirect parent company, has also guaranteed the repayment of amounts outstanding under the revolving line of credit.\nThe loan agreement, pursuant to which the revolving line of credit with Citibank has been made available to us, contains certain positive and negative restrictive covenants which will affect, and in certain respects will limit or prohibit, our ability to, among other things, create or permit any liens on our assets, engage in business activities substantially different than those in which we are currently engaged, enter into certain transactions in which we are not the surviving entity, transfer or sell our assets other than in the ordinary course of business, enter into certain obligations as surety or guarantor, or permit a change of control. In addition, the loan agreement requires us to maintain an enumerated level of a capital base and to maintain an enumerated leverage ratio.\nOur potential acquisitions may reduce our earnings, be difficult for us to combine into our operations or require us to obtain additional financing.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we evaluate potential business acquisition opportunities that we anticipate will provide new product and market opportunities, benefit from and maximize our existing assets and add critical mass. We often incur significant expenses in connection with our evaluation of potential business acquisition opportunities. However, we may not be successful in finding or consummating any acquisitions, and any acquisitions we make may expose us to additional risks and may have a material adverse effect on our operating results. The evaluation of acquisition opportunities may divert management\u2019s attention from our operations, and any acquisitions we make may fail to accomplish our strategic objectives, may not be successfully combined with our operations or may not perform as expected. In addition, although we generally seek acquisitions that we believe will be accretive to our per share earnings, based on current acquisition prices in the industry, our acquisitions could initially reduce our earnings and add significant intangible assets and related amortization charges. Our acquisition strategy may require us to obtain debt or equity financing, resulting in increased leverage or increased debt obligations, as compared to equity, and the dilution of our stockholders\u2019 ownership of us. We may not be able to finance acquisitions on terms satisfactory to us.\nA significant portion of our cash and cash equivalents are held at a single brokerage firm.\nA significant portion of our cash and cash equivalents are presently held at one international securities brokerage firm. Accordingly, we are subject to credit risk if this brokerage firm is unable to repay the balance in the account or deliver our securities or if the brokerage firm should become bankrupt or otherwise insolvent. Any of the above events could have a material and adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nERBA Mannheim may be deemed to control our company.\nERBA Mannheim beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, approximately 81.6% of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock. Further, assuming the full consummation of the investment under the stock purchase agreement, as amended, including the full exercise of the warrant, ERBA Mannheim would currently beneficially own, directly or indirectly, approximately 88.1% of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock. Under our certificate of incorporation, on issues for which our stockholders are eligible to vote, the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares represented at a meeting, in person or by proxy, and entitled to vote is required to approve an action. Consequently, ERBA Mannheim, without the consent of any of our other stockholders, can approve actions that require stockholder approval and elect directors acceptable to them based on their share ownership. Suresh Vazirani, the Chief Executive Officer of ERBA Mannheim, currently serves as executive Chairman of our Board of Directors, and Kishore \u201cKris\u201d Dudani, who served as the Marketing and Business Development Representative-South, Central and Latin America of ERBA Mannheim until his retirement in May 2014, currently serves as a member of our board of directors. Transasia Bio-Medicals Ltd. is the parent company of ERBA Mannheim.\nWe have limited rights to the \u201cERBA\u201d name and may be required to change our name in the future.\nAs approved by our stockholders at our 2012 annual meeting of stockholders held in June 2012, and as previously approved by our board of directors in June 2012, we changed the name of our company from \u201cIVAX Diagnostics, Inc.\u201d to \u201cERBA Diagnostics, Inc.\u201d In connection with our name change, on June 15, 2012, we entered into a use of name license agreement with ERBA Mannheim granting us a royalty-free, non-exclusive license to use the name \u201cERBA\u201d for an annual fee of one dollar. The license agreement will be terminated upon the earlier of the transfer by ERBA Mannheim to us of all of ERBA Mannheim\u2019s rights, title and interest in and to the use of the name and any stylized logos or marks associated with the name, or otherwise known as the transfer date, and such time, if any, as ERBA Mannheim no longer owns, directly or indirectly, shares of our common stock representing more than 50% of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock, or otherwise known as the share threshold date. Furthermore, ERBA Mannheim has the right to terminate the license agreement at any time prior to the earlier of the transfer date and the share threshold date, upon providing us with 180 days prior written notice of its intent to terminate and the date upon which the license agreement shall terminate or upon providing us with 30 days prior written notice of any breach of the license agreement by us, which breach remains uncured at the end of such 30 day period. There can be no assurance that ERBA Mannheim will not terminate this license agreement. Upon termination of the license agreement, we would be required to take all steps reasonably necessary to change our name as soon as practicable. The termination of this license agreement could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, operating results or financial condition.\nOur common stock has a limited trading volume, and a number of internal and external factors have caused, and may continue to cause, the market price of our common stock to be volatile.\nOur common stock has been listed and traded on the NYSE MKT (formerly known as the NYSE Amex, and prior to that the American Stock Exchange) since March 15, 2001. Because ERBA Mannheim beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, approximately 81.6% of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock, we have a limited non-affiliate market capitalization. As a result, our common stock has a limited trading volume, which may make it more difficult for our stockholders to sell their shares, and which may make the trading price of our common stock subject to price volatility.\nAdditionally, the market prices for securities of companies engaged in the healthcare field, including us, have been volatile. Many factors, including those over which we have no control, may have a significant impact on the future market price of our common stock, including, without limitation:\n\u25cf\nannouncements by us and our competitors of technological innovations, new commercial products or significant contracts or business acquisitions,\n\u25cf\nperiod-to-period changes in our financial results,\n\u25cf\nmarket acceptance of existing or new products,\n\u25cf\nhealthcare regulatory reform, and\n\u25cf\nchanges in general conditions in the economy, financial markets or healthcare industry.\nThe issuance of preferred stock or additional shares of common stock could adversely affect the rights of the holders of shares of our common stock.\nOur board of directors is authorized to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock without any further action on the part of our stockholders. Currently, we have no shares of preferred stock outstanding. In the event that we issue preferred stock in the future that has preference over our common stock with respect to payment of dividends or upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, the rights of holders of shares of our common stock may be adversely affected. In addition, the ability of our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock without any further action on the part of our stockholders may impede a takeover of us and may prevent a transaction that is favorable to our stockholders.\nCAUTIONARY STATEMENT CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nWe have made forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
