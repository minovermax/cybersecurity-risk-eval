{"cik": "1308208", "company": "UNIVERSAL LOGISTICS HOLDINGS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-16", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A:\nRISK FACTORS\nSet forth below, and elsewhere in this Report and in other documents we file with the SEC, are risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this Report.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nOur business is subject to general economic and business factors that are largely beyond our control, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nOur business is dependent upon a number of general economic and business factors that may adversely affect our results of operations. These factors include significant increases or rapid fluctuations in fuel prices, excess capacity in the transportation and logistics industry, surpluses in the market for used equipment, interest rates, fuel taxes, license and registration fees, insurance premiums, self-insurance levels, and difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified drivers and independent contractors.\nWe operate in a highly competitive and fragmented industry, and our business may suffer if we are unable to adequately address any downward pricing pressures or other factors that may adversely affect our ability to compete with other carriers.\nFurther, we are affected by recessionary economic cycles and downturns in customers\u2019 business cycles, particularly in market segments and industries, such as the automotive industry, where we have a significant concentration of customers. Economic conditions may also adversely affect our customers and their ability to pay for our services.\nDeterioration in the United States and world economies could exacerbate any difficulties experienced by our customers and suppliers in obtaining financing, which, in turn, could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe operate in the highly competitive and fragmented transportation and logistics industry, and our business may suffer if we are unable to adequately address factors that may adversely affect our revenue and costs relative to our competitors.\nNumerous competitive factors could impair our ability to maintain our current profitability. These factors include the following:\n\u2022\nwe compete with many other truckload carriers and logistics companies of varying sizes, some of which have more equipment, a broader coverage network, a wider range of services and greater capital resources than we do;\n\u2022\nsome of our competitors periodically reduce their rates to gain business, especially during times of reduced growth rates in the economy, which may limit our ability to maintain or increase rates, maintain our operating margins, or maintain significant growth in our business;\n\u2022\nmany customers reduce the number of carriers they use by selecting so-called \u201ccore carriers\u201d as approved service providers and, in some instances, we may not be selected;\n\u2022\nsome companies hire lead logistics providers to manage their logistics operations, and these lead logistics providers may hire logistics providers on a non-neutral basis which may reduce the number of business opportunities available to us;\n\u2022\nmany customers periodically accept bids from multiple carriers and providers for their shipping and logistic service needs, and this process may result in the loss of some of our business to competitors and/or price reductions;\n\u2022\nthe trend toward consolidation in the trucking and third-party logistics industries may create other large providers with greater financial resources and other competitive advantages relating to their size and with whom we may have difficulty competing;\n\u2022\nadvances in technology require increased investments to remain competitive, and our customers may not be willing to accept higher rates to cover the cost of these investments;\n\u2022\ncompetition from Internet-based and other brokerage companies may adversely affect our relationships with our customers and freight rates;\n\u2022\neconomies of scale that may be passed on to smaller providers by procurement aggregation providers may improve the ability of smaller providers to compete with us;\n\u2022\nsome areas of our service coverage require trucks with engines no older than 2011 in order to comply with environmental rules; and\n\u2022\nan inability to continue to access capital markets to finance equipment acquisition could put us at a competitive disadvantage.\nWe may be adversely impacted by fluctuations in the price and availability of diesel fuel.\nDiesel fuel represents a significant operating expense for the Company, and we do not currently hedge against the risk of diesel fuel price increases. An increase in diesel fuel prices or diesel fuel taxes, or any change in federal or state regulations that results in such an increase, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results to the extent we are unable to recoup such increases from customers in the form of increased freight rates or through fuel surcharges. Historically, we have been able to offset, to a certain extent, diesel fuel price increases through fuel surcharges to our customers, but we cannot be certain that we will be able to do so in the future. We continuously monitor the components of our pricing, including base freight rates and fuel surcharges, and address individual account profitability issues with our customers when necessary. While we have historically been able to adjust our pricing to help offset changes to the cost of diesel fuel through changes to base rates and/or fuel surcharges, we cannot be certain that we will be able to do so in the future.\nDifficulty in attracting drivers could affect our profitability and ability to grow.\nThe transportation industry routinely experiences difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified drivers, including independent contractors, resulting in intense competition for drivers. We have from time to time experienced under-utilization and increased expenses due to a shortage of qualified drivers. If we are unable to attract drivers when needed or contract with independent contractors when needed, we could be required to further adjust our driver compensation packages, increase driver recruiting efforts, or let trucks sit idle, any of which could adversely affect our growth and profitability.\nPurchase price increases for new revenue equipment and/or decreases in the value of used revenue equipment could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nDuring the last decade, the purchase price of new revenue equipment has increased significantly as equipment manufacturers recover increased materials costs and engine design costs resulting from compliance with increasingly stringent EPA engine emission standards. Additional EPA emission mandates in the future could result in higher purchase prices of revenue equipment which could result in higher than anticipated depreciation expenses. If we were unable to offset any such increase in expenses with freight rate increases, our cash flows and results of operations could be adversely affected. If the market price for used equipment continues to decline, then we could incur substantial losses upon disposition of our revenue equipment which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have significant ongoing capital requirements that could affect our liquidity and profitability if we are unable to generate sufficient cash from operations or obtain sufficient financing on favorable terms.\nThe transportation and logistics industry is capital intensive. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash from operations in the future, we may have to limit our growth, enter into unfavorable financing arrangements, or operate our revenue equipment for longer periods, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry and increased costs of compliance with, or liability for violation of, existing or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe U.S. Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, or FMCSA, and various state and local agencies exercise broad powers over our business, generally governing such activities as authorization to engage in motor carrier operations, drug and alcohol testing, safety and insurance requirements. Our owner-operators must comply with the safety and fitness regulations promulgated by the FMCSA, including those relating to drug and alcohol testing and hours-of-service. There also are regulations specifically relating to the trucking industry, including testing and specifications of equipment and product handling requirements. These measures could disrupt or impede the timing of our deliveries and we may fail to meet the needs of our customers. The cost of complying with these regulatory measures, or any future measures, could have a materially adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nA determination that independent contractors are employees could expose us to various liabilities and additional costs.\nFederal and state legislators and other regulatory authorities, as well as independent contractors themselves, have increasingly asserted that independent contractors in the transportation services industry are employees rather than independent contractors. Federal and state legislation has been introduced in the past that would make it easier for tax and other authorities to reclassify independent contractors as employees, including legislation designed to increase the recordkeeping requirements for those that engage independent contractor drivers and to increase the penalties for companies who misclassify their employees and are found to have violated employees\u2019 overtime and/or wage requirements.\nIn September 2019, California enacted a new law, A.B. 5 (\u201cAB5\u201d), that made it more difficult for workers to be classified as independent contractors. AB5 provides that the three-pronged \u201cABC Test\u201d must be used to determine worker classifications in wage order claims. Under the ABC Test, a worker is presumed to be an employee and the burden to demonstrate their independent contractor status is on the hiring company through satisfying all three of the following criteria: (a) the worker is free from control and direction in the performance of services; (b) the worker is performing work outside the usual course of the business of the hiring company; and (c) the worker is customarily engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, or business. How AB5 will be enforced is still to be determined. Although it was set to enter into effect in January 2020, a federal judge in California issued a preliminary injunction staying enforcement of AB5 on the trucking industry while the California Trucking Association (\u201cCTA\u201d) moved forward with its suit seeking to invalidate AB5. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, however, reversed the judicial stay on April 28, 2021. Shortly thereafter, the CTA announced it would petition the U.S. Supreme Court to review the decision of the Ninth Circuit, and on June 28, 2021, the Ninth Circuit granted a motion to stay enforcement of AB5 pending the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision on CTA\u2019s petition.\nWhile the U.S. Supreme Court may decide to conduct a judicial review of the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision, there can be no assurance that AB5 will not be enforceable against trucking companies in the near future, that interpretations supporting the independent contractor status will not change, that other federal or state legislation will not be enacted, or that various authorities will not successfully assert a position that re-classifies independent contractors to be employees. If our independent contractors are determined to be our employees, that determination could materially increase our exposure under a variety of federal and state tax, workers\u2019 compensation, unemployment benefits, labor, employment and tort laws, as well as our potential liability for employee benefits. In addition, such changes may be applied retroactively, and if so, we may be required to pay additional amounts to compensate for prior periods. Any of the above increased costs would adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe may incur additional operating expenses or liabilities as a result of potential future requirements to address climate change issues.\nFederal, state, and local governments, as well as some of our customers, are beginning to respond to global warming issues. This increased focus on sustainability may result in new legislation or regulations and customer requirements that could negatively affect us as we may incur additional costs or be required to make changes to our operations in order to comply with any new regulations or customer requirements. Legislation or regulations that potentially impose restrictions, caps, taxes, or other controls on emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, a by-product of burning fossil fuels such as those used in the Company\u2019s trucks, could adversely affect our operations and financial results. More specifically, legislative, or regulatory actions related to climate change could adversely impact the Company by increasing our fuel costs and reducing fuel efficiency and could result in the creation of substantial additional capital expenditures and operating costs in the form of taxes, emissions allowances, or required equipment upgrades. Any of these factors could impair our operating efficiency and productivity and result in higher operating costs. In addition, revenues could decrease if we are unable to meet regulatory or customer sustainability requirements. These additional costs, changes in operations, or loss of revenues could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nThe coronavirus outbreak or other similar outbreaks could negatively impact our financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), and any other outbreaks of contagious diseases or other adverse public health developments, could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, and cash flows. The rapid spread of COVID-19 has resulted in governmental authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, stay-at-home orders, increased border security and closures. These measures and the public health concerns resulting from the outbreak have severely disrupted economic and commercial activity. The resulting impact on domestic and global supply chains has caused slowdowns and reduced freight demand for transportation companies such as ours. Because we have a significant concentration of customers within the automotive industry, our revenues have been significantly affected by the closure of North American automotive and heavy-truck manufacturing facilities beginning in late March and throughout the second quarter of 2020. Although most automotive and heavy-truck operations have resumed production, additional closures and other consumer activity affecting our customers and any future wave of the virus or other similar outbreaks could further adversely affect our business. A significant portion of our revenue is also provided by a network of agents and owner-operators located throughout the United States and in Ontario, Canada. As the COVID-19 virus continues to spread in areas we service, a significant impact to our network due to illness or government restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our ability to service our customers and on our business and results of operations. In addition, the implementation of measures to protect the health and safety of our employees, customers, vendors, and the general public may disrupt our ability to efficiently manage personnel and operations and to recruit and retain driver and non-driver personnel, which could have a materially adverse effect on our operating results. Further, negative financial results, an economic downturn or uncertainty, or a tightening of credit markets caused by COVID-19 or other similar outbreaks could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our ability to effectively meet our short- and long-term financial obligations.\nOur revenue is largely dependent on North American automotive industry production volume and may be negatively affected by future downturns in North American automobile production.\nA significant portion of our larger customers are concentrated in the North American automotive industry. For customers generating annual revenues over $100,000, 31% of our revenues were derived from customers in the North American automotive industry during 2021. Our business and growth largely depend on continued demand for its services from customers in this industry. Any future downturns in North American automobile production, which also impacts our steel and metals customers, could similarly affect our revenues in future periods.\nOur business derives a large portion of revenue from a few major customers, and the loss of any one or more of them as customers, or a reduction in their operations, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nA large portion of our revenue is generated from a limited number of major customers concentrated in the automotive, steel and metals, and energy industries. Our top 10 customers accounted for approximately 38% of our operating revenues during 2021. Our contracts with customers generally contain cancellation clauses, and there can be no assurance that these customers will continue to utilize our services or that they will continue at the same levels. Further, there can be no assurance that these customers will not be affected by a future downturn in demand, which would result in a reduction in their operations and corresponding need for our services. Moreover, our customers may individually lose market share, apart from general economic trends. If our major customers lose U.S. market share, they may have less need for services. A reduction in or termination of services by one or more of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to retain our key employees, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be harmed.\nWe are highly dependent upon the services of our key employees and executive officers. The loss of any of their services could have a material adverse effect on our operations and future profitability. We must continue to develop and retain a core group of managers if we are to realize our goal of expanding our operations and continuing our growth. We cannot assure that we will be able to do so.\nA significant labor dispute involving us or one or more of our customers, or that could otherwise affect our operations, could reduce our revenues, and harm our profitability.\nA substantial number of our employees and of the employees of our largest customers are members of industrial trade unions and are employed under the terms of collective bargaining agreements. Each of our unionized facilities has a separate agreement with the union that represents the workers at only that facility. During 2019, a labor strike by the United Auto Workers of its employees at the facilities of our largest customer, General Motors, caused an extended shutdown of General Motors\u2019 manufacturing operations and, in turn, materially and adversely impacted our operating results during the third and fourth quarters of 2019. Any future labor disputes involving either us or our customers could similarly affect our operations. If the UAW and our automotive customers and their suppliers are unable to negotiate new contracts in the future and our customers\u2019 plants experience slowdowns or closures as a result, our revenue and profitability could be negatively impacted. A labor dispute involving another supplier to our customers that results in a slowdown or closure of our customers\u2019 plants to which we provide services could also have a material adverse effect on our business. Significant increases in labor costs as a result of the renegotiation of collective bargaining agreements could also be harmful to our business and our profitability. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 37% of our employees in the United States, Canada, and Colombia, and 91% of our employees in Mexico were members of unions and subject to collective bargaining agreements.\nIn addition, strikes, work stoppages and slowdowns by our employees may affect our ability to meet our customers\u2019 needs, and customers may do more business with competitors if they believe that such actions may adversely affect our ability to provide service. We may face permanent loss of customers if we are unable to provide uninterrupted service. The terms of our future collective bargaining agreements also may affect our competitive position and results of operations.\nOngoing insurance and claims expenses could significantly reduce our earnings and cash flows.\nOur future insurance and claims expenses might exceed historical levels, which could reduce our earnings and cash flows. The Company is self-insured for health and workers\u2019 compensation insurance coverage up to certain limits. If medical costs continue to increase, or if the severity or number of claims increase, and if we are unable to offset the resulting increases in expenses with higher freight rates, our earnings could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe face litigation risks that could have a material adverse effect on the operation of our business.\nWe face litigation risks regarding a variety of issues, including without limitation, accidents involving our trucks and employees, alleged violations of federal and state labor and employment laws, securities laws, environmental liability, and other matters. These proceedings may be time-consuming, expensive, and disruptive to normal business operations. The defense of such lawsuits could result in significant expense and the diversion of our management\u2019s time and attention from the operation of our business. In recent years, several insurance companies have stopped offering coverage to trucking companies as a result of increases in the severity of automobile liability claims and higher costs of settlements and verdicts. Recent jury awards in the trucking industry have reached into the tens and even hundreds of millions of dollars. Trends in such awards, commonly referred to as nuclear verdicts, could adversely affect our ability to obtain suitable insurance coverage or could significantly increase our cost for obtaining such coverage, which would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows. Costs we incur to defend or to satisfy a judgment or settlement of these claims may not be covered by insurance or could exceed the amount of that coverage or increase our insurance costs and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.\nWe have substantial fixed costs and, as a result, our operating income fluctuates disproportionately with changes in our net sales.\nA significant portion of our expenses are fixed costs that neither increase nor decrease proportionately with our sales. There can be no assurance that we would be able to reduce our fixed costs proportionately in response to a decline in our sales; therefore, our competitiveness could be significantly impacted. As a result, a decline in our sales would result in a higher percentage decline in our income from operations and net income.\nWe have a significant amount of debt, which could restrict our growth, place us at a competitive disadvantage or otherwise materially adversely affect our financial health.\nOur significant debt levels could have important consequences such as the following:\n\u2022\nimpair our ability to obtain additional future financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, or general corporate expenses;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business due to the necessity of dedicating a substantial portion of these funds for payments on our indebtedness;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; and\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on, or to refinance, our debt and other obligations will depend on our financial and operating performance, which, in turn, is subject to our ability to implement our strategic initiatives, prevailing economic conditions and certain financial, business, and other factors beyond our control. If our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service and other obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay expansion plans and capital expenditures, sell material assets or operations, obtain additional capital, or restructure our debt. We cannot provide any assurance that our operating performance, cash flow and capital resources will be sufficient to pay our debt obligations when they become due. We also cannot provide assurance that we would be able to dispose of material assets or operations or restructure our debt or other obligations if necessary or, even if we were able to take such actions, that we could do so on terms that are acceptable to us.\nDisruptions in the credit markets may adversely affect our business, including the availability and cost of short-term funds for liquidity requirements and our ability to meet long-term commitments, which could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nIf cash from operations is not sufficient, we may be required to rely on the capital and credit markets to meet our financial commitments and short-term liquidity needs. Disruptions in the capital and credit markets, as have been experienced during recent years, could adversely affect our ability to draw on our revolving credit facilities. Our access to funds under the credit facilities is dependent on the ability of banks to meet their funding commitments. A bank may not be able to meet their funding commitments if they experience shortages of capital and liquidity or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests from other borrowers within a short period of time.\nLonger term disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty, changing or increased regulation, reduced alternatives, or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to liquidity needed for our business. Any disruption could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the markets stabilize or until alternative credit arrangements or other funding for our business needs can be arranged, which could adversely affect our growth and profitability.\nFurther changes in U.S. tax laws and regulations may impact our effective tax rate and may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act had a favorable impact on our effective tax rate and our net income for 2018. We also have benefited from certain other tax provisions, such as those relating to capital expenditure deductions. However, future changes in the U.S. tax laws, including any changes related to capital expenditure deductions or any significant changes to federal tax rates, interest expense deductions, or the taxation of business entities, could have a materially adverse effect on our growth opportunities, business, and results of operations.\nOur results of operations may be affected by seasonal factors.\nOur productivity may decrease during the winter season when severe winter weather impedes operations. Also, some shippers may reduce their shipments after the winter holiday season. At the same time, operating expenses may increase, and fuel efficiency may decline due to engine idling during periods of inclement weather. Harsh weather conditions generally also result in higher accident frequency, increased freight claims, and higher equipment repair expenditures. Generally, demand for our value-added services delivered to existing customers increases during the second calendar quarter of each year as a result of the automotive industry\u2019s spring selling season and decreases during the third quarter of each year due to the impact of scheduled OEM customer plant shutdowns in July for vacations and changeovers in production lines for new model years. Our value-added services business is also impacted in the fourth quarter by plant shutdowns during the December holiday period.\nOur operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations, the violation of which could result in substantial fines or penalties.\nWe are subject to various environmental laws and regulations dealing with the handling of hazardous materials, underground fuel storage tanks, and discharge and retention of storm-water. We operate in industrial areas, where truck terminals and other industrial activities are located, and where groundwater or other forms of environmental contamination could occur. In prior years, we also maintained bulk fuel storage and fuel islands at two of our facilities. Our operations may involve the risks of fuel spillage or seepage, environmental damage, and hazardous waste disposal, among others. If we are involved in a spill or other accident involving hazardous substances, or if we are found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations, it could have a materially adverse effect on our business and operating results. If we should fail to comply with applicable environmental regulations, we could be subject to substantial fines or penalties and to civil and criminal liability.\nOur business may be disrupted by natural disasters and severe weather conditions causing supply chain disruptions.\nNatural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods or other adverse weather and climate conditions, whether occurring in the United States or abroad, could disrupt our operations or the operations of our customers or could damage or destroy infrastructure necessary to transport products as part of the supply chain. Specifically, these events may damage or destroy or assets, disrupt fuel supplies, increase fuel costs, disrupt freight shipments or routes, and affect regional economies. As a result, these events could make it difficult or impossible for us to provide logistics and transportation services; disrupt or prevent our ability to perform functions at the corporate level; and/or otherwise impede our ability to continue business operations in a continuous manner consistent with the level and extent of business activities prior to the occurrence of the unexpected event, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations or make our results more volatile.\nOur business may be harmed by public health crises, terrorist attacks, future war, or anti-terrorism measures.\nThe rapid or unrestricted spread of a contagious illness such as COVID-19, or the fear of such an event, could significantly disrupt global and domestic supply chains for our customers or result in various travel restrictions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. The duration of the current disruption in supply chains, and whether the magnitude of the disruption will change, are currently unknown. In addition, in order to prevent terrorist attacks, federal, state, and municipal authorities have implemented and continue to follow various security measures, including checkpoints and travel restrictions on large trucks. Our international operations in Canada and Mexico may be affected significantly if there are any disruptions or closures of border traffic due to security measures. Such measures may have costs associated with them, which, in connection with the transportation services we provide, we or our owner-operators could be forced to bear. Further, a public health crisis, terrorist attack, war, or risk of such an event also may have an adverse effect on the economy. A decline in economic activity could adversely affect our revenue or restrict our future growth. Instability in the financial markets as a result of a health pandemic, terrorism or war also could affect our ability to raise capital. In addition, the insurance premiums charged for some or all of the coverage currently maintained by us could increase dramatically or such coverage could be unavailable in the future.\nWe may be unable to successfully integrate businesses we acquire into our operations.\nIntegrating businesses we acquire may involve unanticipated delays, costs or other operational or financial problems. Successful integration of the businesses we acquire depends on a number of factors, including our ability to transition acquired companies to our management information systems. In integrating acquired businesses, we may not achieve expected economies of scale or profitability or realize sufficient revenues to justify our investment. We also face the risk that an unexpected problem at one of the companies we acquire will require substantial time and attention from senior management, diverting management\u2019s attention from other aspects of our business. We cannot be certain that our management and operational controls will be able to support us as we grow.\nOur information technology systems are subject to certain cyber risks and disasters that are beyond our control.\nWe depend heavily on the proper functioning and availability of our information, communications, and data processing systems, including operating and financial reporting systems, in operating our business. Our systems and those of our technology and communications providers are vulnerable to interruptions caused by natural disasters, power loss, telecommunication and internet failures, cyber-attack, and other events beyond our control. Accordingly, information security and the continued development and enhancement of the controls and processes designed to protect our systems, computers, software, data and networks from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a priority for us.\nWe have been, and in the future may be, subject to cybersecurity and malware attacks and other intentional hacking. Any failure to identify and address or to prevent a cyber- or malware-attack could result in service interruptions, operational difficulties, loss of revenues or market share, liability to our customers or others, the diversion of corporate resources, injury to our reputation and increased service and maintenance costs. For example, in June 2020, we experienced a previously disclosed ransomware cyber-attack affecting certain of our network systems. During the attack, we experienced limited disruption and rapidly deployed back-up systems or implemented temporary procedures to maintain operations. Based on our assessment and on information currently known, we do not believe the attack had or will have a material adverse impact on our business or results of operations.\nAlthough our information systems are protected through physical and software security as well as redundant backup systems, they remain susceptible to cyber security risks. Some of our software systems are utilized by third parties who provide outsourced processing services which may increase the risk of a cyber-security incident. We have invested and continue to invest in technology security initiatives, employee training, information technology risk management and disaster recovery plans. The development and maintenance of these measures is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become increasingly more sophisticated. Despite our efforts, we are not fully insulated from data breaches, technology disruptions or data loss, which could adversely impact our competitiveness and results of operations.\nAny future successful cyber-attack or catastrophic natural disaster could significantly affect our operating and financial systems and could temporarily disrupt our ability to provide required services to our customers, impact our ability to manage our operations and perform vital financial processes, any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our business.\nWe are subject to certain risks arising from doing business in Mexico.\nAs we continue to grow our business in Mexico, we are subject to greater risks of doing business internationally. Those risks include but are not limited to the following:\n\u2022\nFluctuations in foreign currencies;\n\u2022\nchanges in the economic strength of Mexico;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in enforcing contractual obligations and intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nburdens of complying with a wide variety of international and U.S. export and import laws; and\n\u2022\nsocial, political, and economic instability.\nWe also face additional risks associated with our business in Mexico, including but not limited to the following:\n\u2022\nChanges in Mexican law prohibiting the hiring of outsourced personnel except under specified circumstances;\n\u2022\nchanges in Mexican law that materially modify the calculation of an employer\u2019s profit-sharing payments to employees;\n\u2022\nthe adoption and enforcement of restrictive trade policies;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of any import or export tariffs, taxes, duties, or fees; and\n\u2022\npotential disruptions or delays at border crossings due to immigration-related issues or other factors.\nIf we are unable to address business concerns related to our Mexican operations in a timely and cost-efficient manner, our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows could be adversely affected.\nDiscontinuation, reform, or replacement of LIBOR may adversely affect our variable rate debt.\nBorrowings under our credit facilities are at variable rates of interest, primarily based on London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d). LIBOR tends to fluctuate based on general interest rates, rates set by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board and other central banks, the supply of and demand for credit in the London interbank market, and general economic conditions. In July 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority in the U.K. announced a desire to phase out LIBOR as a benchmark by the end of 2021. However, for U.S. dollar-denominated (\u201cUSD\u201d) LIBOR, only one-week and two-month USD LIBOR will cease to be published after 2021, and all remaining USD LIBOR tenors will continue being published until June 2023. Financial industry working groups are developing replacement rates and methodologies to transition existing agreements that depend on LIBOR as a reference rate; however, we can provide no assurance that market-accepted rates and transition methodologies will be available and finalized at the time of LIBOR cessation. If clear market standards and transition methodologies have not been developed by the time LIBOR becomes unavailable, we may have difficulty reaching agreement on acceptable replacement rates under our credit facilities. If we are unable to negotiate replacement rates on favorable terms, it could have a material adverse effect on our earnings and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nWe are controlled by Matthew T. Moroun, the Chairman of our Board of Directors. The influence of our public shareholders over significant corporate actions is limited, and Mr. Moroun\u2019s interests may conflict with our interests and the interests of other shareholders.\nMatthew T. Moroun owns directly and indirectly approximately 72% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, Mr. Moroun controls any action requiring the general approval of our shareholders, including the election of our board of directors, the adoption of amendments to our articles of incorporation and bylaws, and the approval of any merger or sale of substantially all of our assets. So long as Mr. Moroun continues to own a significant amount of our equity, even if such amount is less than a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock, he will be capable substantially influencing the outcome of votes on all matters requiring approval by the shareholders, including our ability to enter into certain corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership could limit the price that some investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock.\nThe interests of Mr. Moroun could conflict with or differ from our interests or the interests of our other shareholders. For example, the concentration of ownership he holds could delay, defer, or prevent a change of control of our Company or impede a merger, takeover or other business combination that may otherwise be favorable for us. Accordingly, Mr. Moroun could cause us to enter into transactions or agreements of which our other shareholders would not approve or make decisions with which they may disagree. Mr. Moroun may continue to retain control of us for the foreseeable future and may decide not to enter into a transaction in which shareholders would receive consideration for our common stock that is much higher than the then-current market price of our common stock. In addition, he could elect to sell a controlling interest in us to a third-party and our other shareholders may not be able to participate in such transaction or, if they are able to participate in such a transaction, such shareholders may receive less than the then current fair market value of their shares. Any decision regarding their ownership of us that Mr. Moroun may make at some future time will be in his absolute discretion, subject to applicable laws and fiduciary duties.\nBecause Matthew T. Moroun owns a controlling interest in us, we are not subject to certain corporate governance standards that apply to other publicly traded companies.\nMr. Moroun controls a majority of our outstanding common stock. As a result, we are a controlled company under the rules of the NASDAQ Stock Market. The NASDAQ rules state that a company of which more than 50% of the voting power is held by another person or group of persons acting together is a controlled company and may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance requirements, including the requirements that:\n\u2022\na majority of the board of directors consist of independent directors;\n\u2022\na nominating and corporate governance committee be composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee\u2019s purpose and responsibilities; and\n\u2022\nthe compensation committee be composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee\u2019s purpose and responsibilities.\nThese requirements will not apply to us as long as we remain a controlled company. Accordingly, you may not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of NASDAQ.\nOur stock trading volume may not provide adequate liquidity for investors.\nAlthough shares of our common stock are traded on the NASDAQ Global Market, the average daily trading volume in our common stock is less than that of other larger transportation and logistics companies. A public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth, liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence in the marketplace of a sufficient number of willing buyers and sellers of the common stock at any given time. This presence depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which we have no control. Given the daily average trading volume of our common stock, significant sales of the common stock in a brief period of time, or the expectation of these sales, could cause a decline in the price of our common stock. Additionally, low trading volumes may limit a shareholder\u2019s ability to sell shares of our common stock.\nOur ability to pay regular dividends on our common stock is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on, among other things, our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, any covenants included in our credit facilities any legal or contractual restrictions on the payment of dividends and other factors the Board of Directors deems relevant.\nWe have adopted a cash dividend policy which anticipates a total annual dividend of $0.42 per share of common stock. However, the payment of future dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend, among other things, on our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, any covenants included in our credit facilities, any legal or contractual restrictions on the payment of dividends and other factors the Board of Directors deem relevant. As a consequence of these limitations and restrictions, we may not be able to make, or may have to reduce or eliminate, the payment of dividends on our common stock. For example, due to the uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, our Board of Directors temporarily suspended the Company\u2019s cash dividend policy. We suspended the policy during the first half of 2020, but it has since been reinstated. Any change in the level of our dividends or the suspension of the payment thereof could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur articles of incorporation and bylaws have, and under Michigan law are subject to, provisions that could deter or prevent a change of control.\nOur articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that might enable our management to resist a proposed takeover of our Company. These provisions could discourage, delay, or prevent a change of control of our Company or an acquisition of our Company at a price that our shareholders may find attractive. These provisions also may discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for our shareholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. The existence of these provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. These provisions include:\n\u2022\na requirement that special meetings of our shareholders may be called only by our Board of Directors, the Chairman of our Board of Directors, our Chief Executive Officer, or the holders of a majority of our outstanding common stock;\n\u2022\nadvance notice requirements for shareholder proposals and nominations;\n\u2022\nthe authority of our Board of Directors to issue, without shareholder approval, preferred stock with such terms as the Board of Directors may determine, including in connection with our implementation of any shareholders rights plan; and\n\u2022\nan exclusive forum bylaw provision requiring that any derivative action brought on behalf of the corporation, any action asserting a claim of breach of a legal or fiduciary duty and any similar claim under the Michigan Business Corporation Act or our articles of incorporation must be brought exclusively in the Circuit Court of the County of Macomb in the State of Michigan or the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, Southern Division.\nIn addition, certain provisions of Michigan law that apply to us could discourage or prevent a change of control or acquisition of our Company.", "PERMNO": 90605, "SIC": 4210, "TIC": "ULH"}
