RISK FACTORS.\nCOVID-19 Risks\nOur financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and competitive position could be materially adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The extent to which COVID-19, and measures taken in response thereto, could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and competitive position will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic and actions taken by governmental authorities, including the effectiveness and administration of vaccines, to contain the business, financial and economic impact of the pandemic.\nWhile we are continuing to execute our business continuity plans in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, there is the potential for increased disruptions to our lime and limestone business and operations from the pandemic. Federal, state, and local governmental responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, which include restrictions requiring social distancing and pandemic-related restrictions on business activities and movement of people in the markets for our lime and limestone products, began to take effect the last two weeks of March 2020. In the second quarter 2020, the pandemic and related restrictions on business activities resulted in a general economic slowdown, which has disproportionately impacted certain industries that purchase our lime and limestone products, including oil and gas services, environmental and steel. In the third quarter 2020, business activity began to resume, and restrictions were eased. In the fourth quarter 2020, we saw demand return from certain industries, most notably our environmental and steel customers, after being down the previous quarters. However, the United States has seen multiple surges of COVID-19 cases in the fourth quarter 2020 and the first quarter 2021, which could impact the economic recovery that has occurred to date. Until there are successful implementations of COVID-19 vaccination programs, we expect a continued slowdown in economic activity as restrictions continue, or even expand, which we anticipate will have an adverse impact on the demand for our lime and limestone products and increase our costs. In addition, a continued economic slowdown may put downward pressure on the prices we are able to realize for our products.\nThe continued impact of COVID-19 may limit our ability to produce, sell and deliver our lime and limestone products to our customers; cause key management and plant-level employees not to be available to us; result in plant shutdowns due to contagion, in which case we may not be able to shift production to our other plants; cause disruptions to our supply chain as it relates to our suppliers and other vendors, as well as disrupt the supply chains of our customers; impede our ability to maintain and repair our plants and equipment; negatively impact our modernization, expansion, and development plans; negatively impact our ability to integrate acquisitions; as well as adversely impact demand and prices for our lime and limestone products and increase our costs. Although we cannot predict future developments, which are highly uncertain, including the scope and duration of the pandemic, the effectiveness of vaccines, and actions taken by governmental authorities, including the effective administration of vaccination programs, to contain the pandemic, COVID-19 could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and competitive position.\nIndustry Risks\nOur Lime and Limestone Operations are affected by general economic conditions in the U.S. and specific economic conditions in particular industries.\nGeneral and industry specific economic conditions in the United States have reduced demand for our lime and limestone products. Specifically, demand from our utility customers has decreased due to the continuing trend in the United States to retire coal-fired utility plants. Our steel and oil and gas services customers reduce their purchase volumes, at times, due to cyclical economic conditions in their industries. The overall reduction in demand for lime and limestone products has also resulted in increased competitive pressures, including pricing pressure and competition for certain customer accounts, from other lime producers.\nFor us to maintain or increase our profitability, we must maintain or increase our revenues and improve cash flows, manage our capital expenditures and control our operational and selling, general and administrative expenses. If we are unable to maintain our revenues and control our costs in these uncertain economic and regulatory times, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and competitive position could be materially adversely affected.\nOur mining and other operations are subject to operating risks that are beyond our control, which could result in materially increased operating expenses and decreased production and shipment levels that could materially adversely affect our Lime and Limestone Operations and their profitability.\nWe mine limestone in open pit and underground mining operations and process and distribute that limestone through our plants and other facilities. Certain factors beyond our control could disrupt our operations, adversely affect production and shipments and increase our operating costs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. These include geological formation problems that may cause poor mining conditions, variability of chemical or physical properties of our limestone, an accident or other major incident at a site that may cause all or part of our operations to cease for some period of time and increase our expenses, mining, processing and plant equipment failures and unexpected maintenance problems that may cause disruptions and added expenses, strikes, job actions or other work stoppages that may disrupt our operations or those of our suppliers, contractors or customers and increase our expenses, and adverse weather conditions and natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, heavy rains, flooding, ice storms, freezing weather, such as the February 2021 winter storms in the southern United States, drought and other natural events, that may affect operations, transportation or customers.\nIf any of these conditions or events occurs, our operations may be disrupted, we could experience a delay or halt of production or shipments, our operating costs could increase significantly, and we could be exposed to fines, penalties, assessments and other liabilities. If our insurance coverage is limited or excludes a given condition or event, we may not be able to recover in full the losses that we may incur as a result of such conditions or events, some of which may be substantial.\nThe lime and limestone industry is highly regionalized and competitive.\nOur competitors are predominately large private companies. The primary competitive factors in the lime industry are price, quality, ability to meet customer demands and specifications, proximity to customers, personal relationships and timeliness of deliveries, with varying emphasis on these factors depending upon the specific product application. To the extent that one or more of our competitors becomes more successful with respect to any key competitive factor, we may find it difficult to increase or maintain our prices or to retain certain customer accounts, and our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and competitive position could be materially adversely affected.\nBusiness and Financial Risks\nIn the normal course of our Lime and Limestone Operations, we face various business and financial risks that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and competitive position. Not all risks are foreseeable or within our ability to control.\nThese risks arise from various factors, including, but not limited to, fluctuating demand and prices for our lime and limestone products, including as a result of downturns in the economy and in the construction, industrial, steel and oil and gas services industries, and reduced demand from coal-fired utility plants, increased competitive pressures from other lime producers, changes in legislation and regulations, including Environmental Laws, health and safety regulations and requirements to renew or obtain operating permits, our ability to produce and store quantities of lime and limestone products sufficient in amount and quality to meet customer demands and specifications, the success of our modernization, expansion and development strategies, the uncertainty of our ability to sell our increased lime capacity from the kiln at our St. Clair facility at acceptable prices, our ability to execute our strategies and complete projects on time and within budget, our ability to integrate, refurbish and/or improve acquired facilities, including the facilities acquired as a result of the Carthage acquisition, our access to capital, volatile costs, especially fuel, electricity, transportation and freight costs, inclement weather and the effects of seasonal trends.\nWe receive most of our coal and petroleum coke by rail, so the availability of sufficient solid fuels to run our plants could be diminished significantly in the event of major rail disruptions. Domestic coal and petroleum coke may also be exported, which can increase competition and prices for the domestic supply. In addition, our freight costs to deliver our lime and limestone products are high relative to the value of our products, and they have generally increased in recent years. Our costs for delivery of solid fuels, as well as our products, also increase as demand for rail and trucking by other industries increases, and changes to Department of Transportation rules and regulations can reduce the\navailability of trucks, truck drivers and rail cars to deliver solid fuels to our plants and deliver our products to our customers. If we are unable to continue to pass along our variable coal, petroleum coke, diesel, natural gas, electricity, transportation and freight costs to our customers through higher prices or surcharges, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and competitive position could be materially adversely affected.\nWe quote our lime and limestone products on a delivered price basis to certain customers, which requires us to estimate future delivery costs. Our actual delivery costs may exceed these estimates, which would reduce our profitability.\nDelivery costs are impacted by the price of diesel. When diesel prices increase, we incur additional fuel surcharges from freight companies that cannot be passed on to our customers that have been quoted a delivered price. Material increases in the price of diesel could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s profitability.\nTo maintain our competitive position in the lime and limestone industry, we may need to continue to increase the efficiency of our operations and expand production capacity, obtain financing for any such projects and acquisitions at reasonable interest rates and acceptable terms and sell any resulting increased production at acceptable prices.\nWe may in the future undertake additional modernization and expansion and development projects and acquisitions. Such projects and acquisitions may require that we incur substantial debt, which may not be available to us at all or at reasonable interest rates or on acceptable terms. Given current and projected demand for lime and limestone products, we cannot guarantee that any such project or acquisition would be successful, that we would be able to sell any resulting increased production at acceptable prices or that any such sales would be profitable.\nAlthough prices for our lime and limestone products have been relatively firm in past years, pricing competition has increased in recent years. We are unable to predict future demand and prices, given the current economic and regulatory uncertainties in the U.S. economy as a whole and in particular industries, and cannot provide any assurance that current levels of demand and prices will continue or that any future increases in demand or prices can be maintained.\nWe may be adversely affected by our ability to insure against certain risk of our operations.\nMining limestone and producing lime and limestone products involves risks which could result in damage to our facilities, personal injury, and environmental damage. Although we maintain insurance in an amount that we consider adequate, liabilities might exceed policy limits, in which event we could incur significant costs that could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and competitive position. Additionally, the risks inherent in mining limestone and the production of lime and limestone products may significantly increase the cost of obtaining adequate insurance coverage, or make some coverage unavailable.\nWe may be adversely affected by any disruption in, or failure of, our information technology systems, including due to cyber-security risks and incidents.\nWe rely upon the capacity, reliability and security of our information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) systems for our mining, manufacturing, sales, financial and administrative functions. We also face the challenge of supporting our IT systems and implementing upgrades when necessary, including the prompt detection and remediation of any cyber-security breaches.\nOur IT systems security measures are focused on the prevention, detection and remediation of damage from computer viruses, natural disasters, unauthorized access, cyber-attack and other similar disruptions. However, our IT systems protection measures may not be successful in preventing unauthorized access, intrusion and damage. Threats to our systems can derive from human error, fraud or malice on the part of employees or third parties, encryption by ransomware, or may result from technological failure. Any failure, accident or security breach involving our IT systems could result in disruption to our operations. A material breach in the security of our IT systems could negatively impact our mining and manufacturing operations, sales or financial and administrative functions or result in the compromise of personal information of our employees, customers or suppliers. To the extent any such failure, accident or security breach results in disruption to our operations or sales or loss or disclosure of, or damage to, our data or confidential information, our costs could increase, and our reputation, business, results of operations, competitive position, and\nfinancial condition could be materially adversely affected. Additionally, should we experience a cyber-security event, we may incur substantial costs, including remediation costs, such as liability for stolen assets or information, repairs of system damage, legal costs and costs associated with regulatory actions.\nGovernmental, Legal and Regulatory Risks\nOur Lime and Limestone Operations are subject to general and industry specific regulations. Changes to the regulatory environment could increase our cost of compliance and adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and competitive position.\nWe are in a period of regulatory uncertainty, which has been heightened by the change in the United States federal government Administration and Congress. The new Administration and Congress may initiate actions to increase regulation of certain industries, including the lime industry, and may take other steps to restrict oil and gas drilling, reduce the use of coal or regulate domestic manufacturing. There can be no assurance that any of these actions, if adopted, will not increase the costs for our customers or increase the Company\u2019s cost of compliance with Environmental Laws. In addition, a variety of factors, including uncertainty with respect to governmental budgetary constraints, legislative impasses, extended government shutdowns, pandemics, trade wars, tariffs, social unrest, and increased inflationary pressures, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and competitive position.\nGovernmental fiscal and budgetary constraints, changes to tax law, legislative impasses and extended government shutdowns have in the past, and may in the future, adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations in various ways.\nGovernmental fiscal and budgetary constraints, changes to tax law, legislative impasses and extended government shutdowns may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations in various ways, including possibly reduced highway construction and infrastructure funding by federal, state and local governmental agencies, which could reduce demand for our lime and limestone products from our construction customers.\nWe incur environmental compliance costs and liabilities in our Lime and Limestone Operations, including capital, maintenance and operating costs, with respect to pollution control equipment, the cost of ongoing monitoring programs, the cost of reclamation and remediation efforts and other similar costs and liabilities relating to our compliance with Environmental Laws. We expect these costs and liabilities to continue or increase, such as possible new costs, taxes and limitations on operations, including regulation of greenhouse gas emissions. Similar environmental costs and liabilities may also be faced by some of our customers.\nThe rate of change of Environmental Laws has been rapid over the last decade, and we may face possible new uncertainties, costs and liabilities, taxes and limitations on operations, including those related to climate change initiatives. Changes in policy or political leadership may affect how Environmental Laws are interpreted or enforced by the EPA and state governmental agencies. The new Administration has signaled its intent to increase regulation under Environmental Laws and has issued multiple executive orders reversing prior deregulation. We expect our expenditure requirements for future environmental compliance, including complying with nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, ozone and particulate matter emission limitations under the NAAQS and regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, to continue or increase. Discovery of currently unknown conditions and unforeseen costs and liabilities could require additional expenditures.\nThe regulation of greenhouse gas emissions remains an issue for the Company and some of its customers. In February 2021, the new Administration rejoined the Paris Agreement, under which the United States committed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. There is no assurance that changes in the law or regulations will not be adopted, such as the imposition of a carbon tax, a cap-and-trade program requiring companies to purchase carbon credits, the imposition of greenhouse gas emission limits or other measures that would require reductions in emissions or changes to raw materials, fuel use or production rates. These changes, if adopted, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and competitive position.\nMore stringent regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could also adversely affect the competitiveness of some\nof the Company\u2019s customers, including coal-fired power plants, and indirectly the demand for our lime and limestone products. For example, our utility customers are continuing to switch from coal to natural gas or renewable sources for power generation for environmental and regulatory as well as cost reasons, thus reducing demand for our lime and limestone products for flue gas treatment processes.\nWe intend to comply with all Environmental Laws and believe our accrual for environmental costs and liabilities at December 31, 2020 is reasonable. Because many of the requirements are subjective and therefore not quantifiable or presently determinable, or may be affected by additional legislation and rulemaking, including those related to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, there is no assurance that we will be able to successfully secure new permits in connection with our future modernization and expansion and development projects, and it is not possible to accurately predict the aggregate future costs and liabilities relating to environmental compliance and their effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and competitive position.\nOur lime and limestone operations are subject to various regulatory risks, including those relating to mine safety, and reclamation and remediation obligations.\nOur mining operations are subject to mine safety regulation under the Mine Act. The Mine Act has been construed as authorizing MSHA to issue citations and orders pursuant to the legal doctrine of strict liability, or liability without fault. Citations and orders can be contested before the Commission, and as part of that process, are often reduced in severity and amount, and are sometimes dismissed.\nWe also have legal reclamation and remediation obligations associated with the retirement of AROs. Over time, the liability for AROs is recorded at its present value each period through accretion expense, and the capitalized cost is amortized over the useful life of the related asset. Upon settlement of the liability, we either settle the ARO for its recorded amount or recognize a gain or loss. We believe our accrual for AROs is reasonable, but there can be no assurance that any amounts accrued will be sufficient to meet our reclamation and remediation obligations at any point in time.\nWe intend to comply with all mining regulations and all of our reclamation and remediation obligations. Our failure to comply with such regulations and obligations may adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and competitive position.", "PERMNO": 65700, "SIC": 1400, "TIC": "USLM"}
