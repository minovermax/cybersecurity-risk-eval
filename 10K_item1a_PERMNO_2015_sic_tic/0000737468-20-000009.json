{"cik": "737468", "company": "WASHINGTON TRUST BANCORP INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-25", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors.\nBefore making any investment decision with respect to our common stock, you should carefully consider the risks described below, in addition to the other information contained in this report and in our other filings with the SEC. The risks and uncertainties described below and in our other filings are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business. If any of these known or unknown risks or uncertainties actually occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be impaired. In that event, the market price for our common stock could decline and you may lose your investment. This report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors.\nChanges in the business and economic conditions, particularly those of southern New England, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nA deterioration in the economy or increased levels of unemployment, downside economic shocks, or a return to recessionary economic conditions could lead to erosion of customer confidence, a reduction in general business activity and increased market volatility. The resulting economic pressure on consumers and businesses and lack of confidence in the financial markets could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and stock price.\nWe primarily serve individuals and businesses located in southern New England, and a substantial portion of our loans are secured by properties in southern New England. The real estate collateral securing the Bank\u2019s loans provides an alternate source of repayment in the event of default by the borrower. A weakening or deterioration in the economy of southern New England, including as a result of, among other things, real or threatened acts of war, natural disasters and adverse weather, could result in the following consequences:\n\u2022\nloan delinquencies may increase;\n\u2022\nproblem assets and foreclosures may increase;\n\u2022\ndemand for our products and services may decline;\n\u2022\ncollateral for our loans may decline in value, in turn reducing a customer's borrowing power and reducing the value of collateral securing a loan; and\n\u2022\nthe net worth and liquidity of loan guarantors may decline, impairing their ability to honor commitments to us.\nFluctuations in interest rates may impair the Bank\u2019s business.\nThe Bank\u2019s earnings and financial condition are largely dependent on net interest income, which is the difference between interest income from interest-earning assets, such as loans and investment securities, and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. However, certain assets and liabilities may react differently to changes in market interest rates. Further, interest rates on some types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate prior to changes in broader market interest rates, while rates on other types of assets and liabilities may lag behind. These rates are highly sensitive to many factors beyond our control, including general economic conditions, both domestic and foreign, and the monetary and fiscal policies of various governmental and regulatory authorities.\nWhen interest rates increase, loan prepayments generally decline and depositors shift funds from accounts that have a comparatively lower cost, such as regular savings accounts, to accounts with a higher cost, such as certificates of deposit. When interest rates decrease, loan prepayments and the receipt of payments on mortgage-backed securities generally increase, and may result in the proceeds having to be reinvested at a lower rate than the loan or mortgage-backed security being prepaid. Changes in interest rates can also affect the value of loans and investment securities. Fixed-rate investment securities, mortgage-backed securities and mortgage loans typically decline in value as interest rates rise.\nThe Bank has adopted asset and liability management policies to mitigate the potential adverse effects of changes in interest rates on net interest income, primarily by altering the mix and maturity of loans, investments, funding sources, and derivatives. However, even with these policies in place, a change in interest rates can impact our results of operations or financial condition.\nOur loan portfolio includes commercial loans, which are generally riskier than other types of loans.\nAt December 31, 2019, commercial loans represented 55% of our loan portfolio. Commercial loans generally carry larger loan balances and involve a higher risk of nonpayment or late payment than residential mortgage loans. These loans may lack standardized terms and may include a balloon payment feature. The ability of a borrower to make or refinance a balloon payment may be affected by a number of factors, including the financial condition of the borrower, prevailing economic conditions, interest rates, and collateral values. Repayment of these loans is generally more dependent on the economy and the successful operation of a business. Because of the risks associated with commercial loans, we may experience higher rates of default than if our portfolio were more heavily weighted toward residential mortgage loans. Higher rates of default could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may experience losses and expenses if security interests granted for loans are not enforceable.\nWhen Washington Trust makes loans it sometimes obtains liens, such as real estate mortgages or other asset pledges, to provide Washington Trust with a security interest in collateral. If there is a loan default, Washington Trust may seek to foreclose upon collateral and enforce the security interests to obtain repayment and eliminate or mitigate the Corporation's loss. Drafting errors, recording errors, other defects or imperfections in the security interests granted to Washington Trust and/or changes in law may render liens granted to the Washington Trust unenforceable. The Corporation may incur losses or expenses if security interests granted to Washington Trust are not enforceable.\nOur allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual loan losses, and an increase in the allowance for loan losses will adversely affect our earnings.\nWe maintain an allowance for loan losses based on available information, including, but not limited to, the quality and collectability of the loan portfolio, the creditworthiness of borrowers, certain economic conditions, the value of the underlying collateral and the level of nonaccrual and criticized loans. We rely on our loan quality reviews, our experience and our evaluation of economic conditions, among other factors, in determining the amount of provision required for the allowance for loan losses. Provisions to this allowance result in an expense for the period. If, as a result of general economic conditions, changes to previous assumptions, or an increase in defaulted loans, we determine that additional increases in the allowance for loan losses are necessary, we will incur additional expense. A problem with one or more loans could require Washington Trust to significantly increase the level of its allowance for loan losses. Federal and state regulators, in reviewing our loan portfolio as part of a regulatory examination, may request that we increase our allowance for loan losses. Any increases in our allowance for loan losses will result in a decrease in our net income and, possibly, our capital, and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nSee Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the January 1, 2020 adoption of a new accounting standard for determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses. Additionally, the new standard could produce higher volatility in future provisions for credit losses than our current process and could adversely impact our results of operations.\nEnvironmental liability associated with our lending activities could result in losses.\nIn the course of business, we may acquire, through foreclosure, properties securing loans we have originated that are in default. While we believe that our credit granting process incorporates appropriate procedures for the assessment of environmental contamination risk, there is a risk that material environmental violations could be discovered on these properties, particularly with respect to commercial loans secured by real estate. In this event, we might be required to remedy these violations at the affected properties at our sole cost and expense. The cost of this remedial action could substantially exceed the value of affected properties. We may not have adequate remedies against the prior owner or other responsible parties and could find it difficult or impossible to sell the affected properties. These events could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to liquidity risk, which could negatively affect our funding levels.\nMarket conditions or other events could negatively affect our access to or cost of funding, affecting our ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals, meet contractual obligations, or fund asset growth and new business initiatives at a reasonable cost, in a timely manner and without adverse consequences.\nAlthough we maintain a liquid asset portfolio and have implemented strategies to maintain sufficient and diverse sources of funding to accommodate planned, as well as unanticipated, changes in assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet commitments under various economic conditions, a substantial, unexpected, or prolonged change in the level or cost of\nliquidity could have a material adverse effect on us. If the cost effectiveness or the availability of supply in these credit markets is reduced for a prolonged period of time, our funding needs may require us to access funding and manage liquidity by other means. These alternatives may include generating client deposits, securitizing or selling loans, extending the maturity of wholesale borrowings, borrowing under certain secured borrowing arrangements, using relationships developed with a variety of fixed income investors, and further managing loan growth and investment opportunities. These alternative means of funding may result in an increase to the overall cost of funds and may not be available under stressed conditions, which would cause us to liquidate a portion of our liquid asset portfolio to meet any funding needs.\nOur cost of funds for banking operations may increase as a result of general economic conditions, interest rates and competitive pressures.\nDeposits are a low cost and stable source of funding. We compete with banks and other financial institutions for deposits. If, as a result of general economic conditions, market interest rates, competitive pressures, or otherwise, the amount of deposits at the Bank decreases relative to its overall banking operations, the Bank may have to rely more heavily on higher cost borrowings as a source of funds in the future or otherwise reduce its loan growth or pursue loan sales. Higher funding costs reduce our net interest margin, net interest income and net income.\nIn addition, significant components of our liquidity needs are met through our access to funding pursuant to our membership in the FHLB. The FHLB is a cooperative that provides services to its member banking institutions. The primary reason for joining the FHLB is to obtain funding. The purchase of stock in the FHLB is a requirement for a member to gain access to funding. Any deterioration in the FHLB\u2019s performance or financial condition may affect our ability to access funding and/or require Washington Trust to deem the required investment in FHLB stock to be impaired. If we are not able to access funding through the FHLB, we may not be able to meet our liquidity needs, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Similarly, if we deem all or part of our investment in FHLB stock impaired, such action could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are a holding company and depend on the Bank for dividends, distributions and other payments.\nThe Bancorp is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank. Revenues of the Bancorp are derived primarily from dividends paid to it by the Bank. The right of the Bancorp, and consequently the right of shareholders of the Bancorp, to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of the Bank, through the payment of such dividends or otherwise, is necessarily subject to the prior claims of creditors of the Bank (including depositors), except to the extent that certain claims of the Bancorp in a creditor capacity may be recognized.\nHolders of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends only when, as and if declared by our Board of Directors. Although we have historically declared cash dividends on our common stock, we are not required to do so and our Board of Directors may reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in the future. The Federal Reserve has authority to prohibit bank holding companies from paying dividends if such payment is deemed to be an unsafe or unsound practice. Additionally, the FDIC has the authority to use its enforcement powers to prohibit the Bank from paying dividends if, in its opinion, the payment of dividends would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. Further, our ability to pay dividends would be restricted if we do not maintain a capital conservation buffer. A reduction or elimination of dividends could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. See Item, \u201cBusiness-Supervision and Regulation-Dividend Restrictions\u201d and \u201cBusiness-Supervision and Regulation-Capital Adequacy and Safety and Soundness-Regulatory Capital Requirements.\u201d\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry, and laws and regulations, or changes in them, could limit or restrict our activities and could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nWe are subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision. Federal and state laws and regulations govern numerous matters affecting us, including changes in the ownership or control of banks and bank holding companies; maintenance of adequate capital and the financial condition of a financial institution; permissible types, amounts and terms of extensions of credit and investments; the manner in which we conduct mortgage banking activities; permissible non-banking activities; the level of reserves against deposits; and restrictions on dividend payments. The FDIC and the banking divisions or departments of states in which we are licensed to do business have the power to issue consent orders to prevent or remedy unsafe or unsound practices or violations of law by banks subject to their regulation, and the Federal Reserve possesses similar powers with respect to bank holding companies. In addition, Weston Financial, a registered investment advisor subsidiary, is subject to regulation under federal and state securities laws and fiduciary laws. These and other restrictions limit the manner in which we may conduct business and obtain financing.\nThe laws, rules, regulations, and supervisory guidance and policies applicable to us are subject to regular modification and change. These changes could adversely and materially impact us. Such changes could, among other things, subject us to additional costs, including costs of compliance; limit the types of financial services and products we may offer; and/or increase the ability of non-banks to offer competing financial services and products. Failure to comply with laws, regulations, policies, or supervisory guidance could result in enforcement and other legal actions by federal and state authorities, including criminal and civil penalties, the loss of FDIC insurance, revocation of a banking charter or registration as an investment adviser, other sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties, and/or reputational damage, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. See \u201cBusiness-Supervision and Regulation.\u201d\nWe are subject to numerous laws designed to protect consumers, including the Community Reinvestment Act and fair lending laws, and failure to comply with these laws could lead to a wide variety of sanctions.\nThe Community Reinvestment Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act and other fair lending laws and regulations impose community investment and nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Department of Justice and other federal agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations. A successful regulatory challenge to an institution\u2019s performance under the Community Reinvestment Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act or other fair lending laws and regulations could result in a wide variety of sanctions, including damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, restrictions on mergers and acquisitions, restrictions on expansion and restrictions on entering new business lines. Private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution\u2019s performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation. Such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may become subject to enforcement actions even though noncompliance was inadvertent or unintentional.\nThe financial services industry is subject to intense scrutiny from bank supervisors in the examination process and aggressive enforcement of federal and state regulations, particularly with respect to mortgage-related practices and other consumer compliance matters, and compliance with anti-money laundering, Bank Secrecy Act and Office of Foreign Assets Control regulations, and economic sanctions against certain foreign countries and nationals. Enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices. We maintain systems and procedures designed to ensure that we comply with applicable laws and regulations; however, some legal/regulatory frameworks provide for the imposition of fines or penalties for noncompliance even though the noncompliance was inadvertent or unintentional and even though there were systems and procedures designed to ensure compliance in place at the time. Failure to comply with these and other regulations, and supervisory expectations related thereto, may result in fines, penalties, lawsuits, regulatory sanctions, reputation damage, or restrictions on our business.\nWe face significant legal risks, both from regulatory investigations and proceedings, and from private actions brought against us.\nFrom time to time we are named as a defendant or are otherwise involved in various legal proceedings, including class actions and other litigation or disputes with third parties. There is no assurance that litigation with private parties will not increase in the future. Actions currently pending against us may result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other results adverse to us, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, or cause serious reputational harm to us. As a participant in the financial services industry, it is likely that we will continue to experience litigation related to our businesses and operations.\nWe are subject to capital and liquidity standards that require banks and bank holding companies to maintain more and higher quality capital and greater liquidity than has historically been the case.\nWe became subject to new capital requirements in 2015. These new standards, which are now fully phased-in, force bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries to maintain substantially higher levels of capital as a percentage of their assets, with a greater emphasis on common equity as opposed to other components of capital. The need to maintain more and higher quality capital, as well as greater liquidity, and generally increased regulatory scrutiny with respect to capital levels, may at some point limit our business activities, including lending, and our ability to expand. It could also result in our being required to take steps to increase our regulatory capital and may dilute shareholder value or limit our ability to pay dividends or otherwise return capital to our investors through stock repurchases.\nWe have credit and market risk inherent in our investment securities portfolio.\nWe maintain a securities portfolio, which includes obligations of U.S. government-sponsored enterprises and agencies, including mortgage-backed securities; obligations of states and political subdivisions; individual name issuer trust preferred debt securities; and corporate bonds. We seek to limit credit losses in our securities portfolios by generally purchasing only highly-rated securities. The valuation and liquidity of our securities could be adversely impacted by reduced market liquidity, increased normal bid-asked spreads and increased uncertainty of market participants, which could reduce the market value of our securities, even those with no apparent credit exposure. The valuation of our securities requires judgment and as market conditions change security values may also change.\nPotential downgrades of U.S. government agency and government-sponsored enterprise securities by one or more of the credit ratings agencies could have a material adverse effect on our operations, earnings and financial condition.\nA possible future downgrade of the sovereign credit ratings of the U.S. government and a decline in the perceived creditworthiness of U.S. government-related obligations could impact our ability to obtain funding that is collateralized by affected instruments, as well as affect the pricing of that funding when it is available. A downgrade may also adversely affect the market value of such instruments. We cannot predict if, when or how any changes to the credit ratings or perceived creditworthiness of these organizations will affect economic conditions. Such ratings actions could result in a significant adverse impact on us. Among other things, a downgrade of the sovereign credit ratings of the U.S. government could adversely impact the value of our investment securities portfolio and may trigger requirements to post additional collateral for trades relative to these securities. A downgrade of the sovereign credit ratings of the U.S. government or the credit ratings of related institutions, agencies or instruments would significantly exacerbate the other risks to which we are subject and any related adverse effects on the business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.\nOur ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty and other relationships. We have exposure to a number of different counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial industry, including brokers and dealers, other commercial banks, investment banks, and other financial institutions. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, could lead to market-wide liquidity problems and losses or defaults by us or by other institutions and organizations. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or customer. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be liquidated or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the financial instrument exposure due to us. There is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nUncertainty about the replacement of LIBOR may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nLIBOR is used extensively in the United States as a benchmark for various commercial and financial contracts, including funding sources, adjustable rate mortgages, corporate debt, interest rate swaps and other derivatives. LIBOR is set based on interest rate information reported by certain banks. These LIBOR banks have indicated they will support the LIBOR indices through 2021 to allow for an orderly transition to an alternative reference rate. In the United States, efforts to identify a set of alternative U.S. dollar reference interest rates include proposals by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee of the Federal Reserve. Other financial services regulators and industry groups are evaluating the phase-out of LIBOR and the development of alternate reference rate indices or reference rates. Some of the Corporation\u2019s assets and liabilities are indexed to LIBOR. The Corporation is evaluating the potential impact of the possible replacement of the LIBOR benchmark interest rate, but is not able to predict whether LIBOR will cease to be available after 2021, whether the alternative rates the Federal Reserve proposes to publish will become market benchmarks in place of LIBOR, or what the impact of such a transition will have on the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nMarket changes or economic downturns may adversely affect demand for our fee-based services and level of wealth management assets under administration.\nEconomic downturns could affect the volume of income earned from, and demand for, fee-based services. Revenues from wealth management services depend in large part on the level of assets under administration, which are primarily marketable securities. Market volatility that results in clients liquidating investments, as well as lower asset values, can\nreduce the level of assets under management and administration and decrease the Corporation's wealth management revenues, which could materially adversely affect the Corporation's results of operations.\nIn addition, revenues from mortgage banking activities are largely dependent on mortgage origination volume and sales volume. Changes in interest rates and the condition of housing markets could adversely impact the volume of residential mortgage originations, sales and related mortgage banking activities.\nOur wealth management business is highly regulated, and the regulators have the ability to limit or restrict our activities and impose fines or suspensions on the conduct of our business.\nWe offer wealth management services through the Bank and Weston Financial. Weston Financial is a registered investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act. The Investment Advisers Act imposes numerous obligations on registered investment advisers, including fiduciary, record keeping, operational and disclosure obligations. We are also subject to the provisions and regulations of ERISA to the extent that we act as a \u201cfiduciary\u201d under ERISA with respect to certain of our clients. ERISA and the applicable provisions of the federal tax laws impose a number of duties on persons who are fiduciaries under ERISA and prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of each ERISA plan which is a client, as well as certain transactions by the fiduciaries (and certain other related parties) to such plans. Investment contracts with institutional and other clients are typically terminable by the client, also without penalty, upon 30 to 60 days\u2019 notice. Changes in these laws or regulations could have a material adverse impact on our profitability and mode of operations.\nWe face continuing and growing security risks to our information base, including the information we maintain relating to our customers.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we rely on electronic communications and information systems to conduct our business and to store sensitive data, including financial information regarding customers. Our electronic communications and information systems infrastructure could be susceptible to cyberattacks, hacking, identity theft or terrorist activity. We have implemented and regularly review and update extensive systems of internal controls and procedures as well as corporate governance policies and procedures intended to protect our business operations, including the security and privacy of all confidential customer information. In addition, we rely on the services of a variety of third-party service providers to meet our data processing and communication needs. No matter how well designed or implemented our controls are, we cannot provide an absolute guarantee to protect our business operations from every type of problem in every situation. A failure or circumvention of these controls could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial condition.\nWe regularly assess and test our security systems and disaster preparedness, including back-up systems, but the risks are substantially escalating. We also review and assess the cyber-security risk of our third-party service providers. As a result, cybersecurity and the continued enhancement of our controls and processes to protect our systems, data and networks from attacks, unauthorized access or significant damage remain a priority. Accordingly, we may be required to expend additional resources to enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities or exposures. Any breach of our system security could result in disruption of our operations, unauthorized access to confidential customer information, significant regulatory costs, litigation exposure and other possible damages, loss or liability. Such costs or losses could exceed the amount of available insurance coverage, if any, and would adversely affect our earnings. Also, any failure to prevent a security breach or to quickly and effectively deal with such a breach could negatively impact customer confidence, damaging our reputation and undermining our ability to attract and keep customers.\nWe rely on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure.\nThird party vendors provide key components of our business infrastructure such as internet connections, network access and core application processing. While we have selected these third party vendors carefully, we do not control their actions. Any problems caused by these third parties, including as a result of their not providing us their services for any reason or their performing their services poorly, could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers or otherwise conduct our business efficiently and effectively. Replacing these third party vendors could also entail significant delay and expense.\nWe may not be able to successfully implement future information technology system enhancements, which could adversely affect our business operations and profitability.\nWe invest significant resources in information technology system enhancements in order to provide functionality and security at an appropriate level. We may not be able to successfully implement and integrate future system enhancements, which could adversely impact the ability to provide timely and accurate financial information in compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, which could result in sanctions from regulatory authorities. Such sanctions could include fines and suspension of trading in our stock, among others. In addition, future system enhancements could have higher than expected costs and/or result in operating inefficiencies, which could increase the costs associated with the implementation as well as ongoing operations.\nFailure to properly utilize system enhancements that are implemented in the future could result in impairment charges that adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations and could result in significant costs to remediate or replace the defective components. In addition, we may incur significant training, licensing, maintenance, consulting and amortization expenses during and after systems implementations, and any such costs may continue for an extended period of time.\nOur business may be adversely affected if we fail to adapt our products and services to evolving industry standards and consumer preferences.\nThe financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The widespread adoption of new technologies, including internet services, cryptocurrencies and payment systems, could require substantial expenditures to modify or adapt our existing products and services as we grow and develop our internet banking and mobile banking channel strategies in addition to remote connectivity solutions. We might not be successful in developing or introducing new products and services, integrating new products or services into our existing offerings, responding or adapting to changes in consumer behavior, preferences, spending, investing and/or saving habits, achieving market acceptance of our products and services, reducing costs in response to pressures to deliver products and services at lower prices or sufficiently developing and maintaining loyal customers.\nWe may incur significant losses as a result of ineffective risk management processes and strategies.\nWe seek to monitor and control our risk exposure through a risk and control framework encompassing a variety of separate but complementary financial, credit, operational, compliance, and legal reporting systems; internal controls; management review processes; and other mechanisms. While we employ a broad and diversified set of risk monitoring and risk mitigation techniques, those techniques and the judgments that accompany their application may not be effective and may not anticipate every economic and financial outcome in all market environments or the specifics and timing of such outcomes.\nDamage to our reputation could significantly harm our business, including our competitive position and business prospects.\nWe are dependent on our reputation within our market area, as a trusted and responsible financial services company, for all aspects of our business with customers, employees, vendors, third-party service providers, and others, with whom we conduct business or potential future businesses. Our ability to attract and retain customers and employees could be adversely affected if our reputation is damaged. Our actual or perceived failure to address various issues could give rise to reputational risk that could cause harm to us and our business prospects. These issues also include, but are not limited to, legal and regulatory requirements; properly maintaining customer and employee personal information; record keeping; money-laundering; sales and trading practices; ethical issues; appropriately addressing potential conflicts of interest; and the proper identification of the legal, reputational, credit, liquidity and market risks inherent in our products. Failure to appropriately address any of these issues could also give rise to additional regulatory restrictions and legal risks, which could, among other consequences, increase the size and number of litigation claims and damages asserted or subject us to enforcement actions, fines and penalties and cause us to incur related costs and expenses. Furthermore, any damage to our reputation could affect our ability to retain and develop the business relationships necessary to conduct business, which in turn could negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations, and the market price of our common stock.\nWe may not be able to compete effectively in our increasingly competitive industry.\nWe compete with financial and non-financial services firms, including traditional banks, online banks, financial technology companies, and investment management and wealth advisory firms, including commercial banks and trust companies,\ninvestment advisory firms, mutual fund companies, stock brokerage firms. These companies compete on the basis of, among other factors, size, location, quality and type of products and services offered, price, technology, brand recognition and reputation. Emerging technologies have the potential to further intensify competition and accelerate disruption in the financial services industry. In recent years, non-financial services firms, such as financial technology companies, have begun to offer services traditionally provided by financial institutions. These firms attempt to use technology and mobile platforms to enhance the ability of companies and individuals to borrow, save and invest money. Many of these non-financial services competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures than we do. Our long-term success depends on our ability to develop and execute strategic plans and initiatives; to develop competitive products and technologies; and to attract, retain and develop a highly skilled employee workforce. Our ability to successfully attract and retain wealth management clients is dependent upon our ability to compete with competitors\u2019 investment products, level of investment performance, client services and marketing and distribution capabilities. If we are not successful, our results of operations and financial condition may be negatively impacted.\nWe may be unable to attract and retain key personnel.\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract and retain key personnel. Certain key personnel that have regular direct contact with customers and clients often build strong relationships that are important to our business. In addition, the Corporation relies on key personnel to manage and operate its business, including major revenue producing functions, such as loan and deposit generation and wealth management services. Competition for qualified personnel in the financial services industry can be intense and we may not be able to hire or retain the key personnel that we depend upon for success. Frequently, we compete in the market for talent with entities that are not subject to comprehensive regulation, including with respect to the structure of incentive compensation. The unexpected loss of services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse impact on our business because of their skills, knowledge of the markets in which we operate, years of industry experience and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel. Also, the loss of key personnel could jeopardize our relationships with customers and clients and could lead to the loss of accounts. Losses of such accounts could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nNatural disasters, acts of terrorism and other external events could harm our business.\nNatural disasters can disrupt our operations, result in damage to our properties, reduce or destroy the value of the collateral for our loans and negatively affect the economies in which we operate, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. A significant natural disaster, such as a tornado, hurricane, earthquake, fire or flood, could have a material adverse impact on our ability to conduct business, and our insurance coverage may be insufficient to compensate for losses that may occur. Acts of terrorism, war, civil unrest, or pandemics could cause disruptions to our business or the economy as a whole. While we have established and regularly test disaster recovery procedures, the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition.\nThe performance of our securities portfolio in difficult market conditions could have adverse effects on our results of operations.\nUnder GAAP, we are required to review our securities portfolio periodically for the presence of other-than-temporary impairment, taking into consideration current market conditions, the extent and nature of changes in fair value, issuer rating changes and trends, volatility of earnings, current analysts\u2019 evaluations, our ability and intent to hold securities until a recovery of fair value, as well as other factors. Adverse developments with respect to one or more of the foregoing factors may require us to deem particular securities to be other-than-temporarily impaired, with the credit related portion of the reduction in the value recognized as a charge to the results of operations in the period in which the impairment occurs. Market volatility may make it difficult to value certain securities. Subsequent valuations, in light of factors prevailing at that time, may result in significant changes in the values of these securities in future periods. Any of these factors could require us to recognize further impairments in the value of our securities portfolio, which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations in future periods.\nIf we are required to write-down goodwill or other intangible assets recorded in connection with our acquisitions, our profitability would be negatively impacted.\nUnder GAAP, if the purchase price of an acquired company exceeds the fair value of the company\u2019s net assets, the excess is carried on the acquirer\u2019s balance sheet as goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets. Goodwill must be evaluated for impairment at least annually. Long-lived intangible assets are amortized and are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable. A\nsignificant and sustained decline in our stock price and market capitalization, a significant decline in our expected future cash flows, a significant adverse change in the business climate, slower growth rates or other factors could result in impairment of goodwill. Write-downs of the amount of any impairment, if necessary, would be charged to the results of operations in the period in which the impairment occurs. There can be no assurance that future evaluations of goodwill or intangible assets will not result in findings of impairment and related write-downs, which would have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in accounting standards can materially impact our financial statements.\nOur accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. From time to time, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) or regulatory authorities change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. Such changes are expected to continue and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in our restating prior period financial statements. Additionally, significant changes to accounting standards may require costly technology changes, additional training and personnel, and other expense that will negatively impact our results of operations.\nIn 2016, the FASB released a new accounting standard for determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses (\u201cACL\u201d). The new accounting standard will be effective for reporting periods beginning January 1, 2020 and will be a significant change from the accounting standard in effect for prior reporting periods. The new accounting standard requires the ACL to be calculated based on current expected credit losses over the full remaining expected life of the financial assets rather than losses inherent in the portfolio as of a point in time. Upon adoption of this new accounting standard, we expect to recognize increases in the ACL on loans and in the ACL on off-balance sheet credit exposures, and a one-time net of tax cumulative-effect adjustment that decreases retained earnings. The Corporation also plans to elect the regulatory capital transition relief issued by the FDIC to provide banking organizations the option to phase in over a three-year period the day-one adverse effects on regulatory capital resulting from the adoption of this new accounting standard. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nChanges in tax laws and regulations and differences in interpretation of tax laws and regulations may adversely impact our financial statements.\nWe are subject to tax law changes that could impact our effective income tax rate and our net deferred tax assets. Tax law changes may or may not be retroactive to previous periods and could negatively affect our current and future financial performance. Our net deferred tax assets are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The Corporation assesses the deferred tax assets periodically to determine the likelihood of the Corporation\u2019s ability to realize the benefits. Management judgment is required in determining the appropriate recognition and valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, including projections of future taxable income, as well as the character of that income. A change in statutory tax rates may result in a decrease or increase to the Corporation\u2019s deferred tax assets. A decrease in the Corporation\u2019s deferred tax assets could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s results of operations or financial condition.\nLocal, state or federal tax authorities may interpret tax laws and regulations differently than we do and challenge tax positions that we have taken on tax returns. This may result in differences in the treatment of revenues, deductions, credits and/or differences in the timing of these items. The differences in treatment may result in payment of additional taxes, interest, penalties, or litigation costs that could have a material adverse effect on our results.\nThe market price and trading volume of our stock can be volatile.\nThe price of our common stock can fluctuate widely in response to a variety of factors. In addition, the trading volume in our common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur. We cannot assure you that the market price of our common stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly. Some of the factors that could cause fluctuations or declines in the price of our common stock include, but are not limited to, actual or anticipated variations in reported operating results, recommendations by securities analysts, the level of trading activity in our common stock, new services or delivery systems offered by competitors, business combinations involving our competitors, operating and stock price performance of companies that investors deem to be comparable to Washington Trust, news reports relating to trends or developments in the financial, credit, mortgage and housing markets as well as the financial services industry, and changes in government regulations.\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future and such capital may not be available when needed.\nAs a bank holding company, we are required by regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations. We may need to raise additional capital in the future to provide us with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet our commitments and business needs. Our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on, among other things, conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside of our control, and our financial performance. We cannot assure you that such capital will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. Our inability to raise sufficient additional capital on acceptable terms when needed could subject us to certain activity restrictions or to a variety of enforcement remedies available to the regulatory authorities, including limitations on our ability to pay dividends or pursue acquisitions, the issuance by regulatory authorities of a capital directive to increase capital and the termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC.\nCertain provisions of our articles of incorporation may have an anti-takeover effect.\nProvisions of Rhode Island law, our articles of incorporation and by-laws, and federal banking laws, including regulatory approval requirements, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would be perceived to be beneficial to our shareholders. The combination of these provisions may inhibit a non-negotiated merger or other business combination, which, in turn, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 11397, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "WASH"}
