{"cik": "1337013", "company": "InfuSystem Holdings, Inc", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-09", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nAn investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully all of the material risks described below, together with the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If any of the following events occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be materially adversely affected.\nRISK FACTORS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS AND THE INDUSTRY IN WHICH WE OPERATE\nOur business is substantially dependent on third-party reimbursement. Any change in the overall health care reimbursement system may adversely impact our business.\nOur revenues are substantially dependent on third-party reimbursement. We are paid directly by private insurers and governmental agencies, often on a fixed fee basis, for the use of continuous infusion equipment and related disposable supplies provided to patients. If the average fees allowable by private insurers or governmental agencies were reduced, the negative impact on revenues could have a material effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Also, if amounts owed to us by patients and insurers are reduced or not paid on a timely basis, we may be required to increase our bad debt expense and/or decrease our revenues.\nChanges in the health care reimbursement system often create financial incentives and disincentives that encourage or discourage the use of a particular type of product, therapy or clinical procedure. Such changes may be impacted by the growth in ACOs, reduction of providers by payors, the use of lower cost rental networks and other factors. Market acceptance of continuous infusion therapy may be adversely affected by changes or trends within the health care reimbursement system. Changes to the health care reimbursement system that favor other technologies or treatment regimens that reduce reimbursements to providers or treatment facilities, including increasing competitive pressures from home health care and other companies that use our services, may adversely affect our ability to market our services profitably. Overall, such dependency and potential changes could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOn April 21, 2015, the CMS announced plans to recompete the supplier contracts awarded in Round 1 Recompete of the Medicare DMEPOS Competitive Bidding Program. CMS is required by law to recompete contracts under the DMEPOS Competitive Bidding Program at least once every three years. The Round 1 Recompete contract period for all product categories expires on December 31, 2016. The Round 1 2017 product categories do not include a category for external infusion pumps as in the previous Round 1 Recompete. There is no assurance that this exclusion will remain in the future and there is not currently sufficient information available to determine how this development may impact our future revenues and net income.\nFor additional information pertaining to CMS, refer to Item 1 - Business - Significant Customers and also Recent Events in Our Business.\nThe loss of a relationship with one or more third party payors could negatively impact our business.\nOur contracts for reimbursement with third party payors are often for a term of one year, with automatic one-year renewals, unless we or the contracted payor elect not to renew. These evergreen contracts are subject to termination upon written notice. One or more terminations could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAny federal government shutdown may adversely impact our business.\nOur revenues are dependent on private insurers and governmental agencies. In the absence of any bipartisan agreement in the federal government with respect to payments from governmental agencies, our revenues could be reduced. In addition, any federal government shutdown could also have a material and adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business has and may continue to be adversely impacted by the U.S. federal government\u2019s sequestration.\nOn March 1, 2013, most agencies of the U.S. federal government automatically reduced their budgets according to an agreement made by Congress in 2012 known as \u201csequestration\u201d. Originally devised as an incentive to force Congressional agreement on budget issues, the sequestration order was approved on March 1, 2013 by the President of the United States. Beginning in 2013, we were impacted by the sequestration order, which effects Medicare payments. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the impact on our revenue was $0.4 million, which was consistent with the same twelve month period in 2014. As of the date of this report, it is our understanding that the mandatory payment reduction of 2% will continue through March 31, 2016. We also believe that the cuts will likely continue until definitive action is taken by the U.S federal government on this issue.\nPayor concentration may adversely impact our business.\nA substantial portion of our contracted payor revenues have been dependent on one payor or a limited concentration of payors. In particular, Medicare represented approximately 32% and 30% of our net revenue from our Oncology Business for 2015 and 2014, respectively, or approximately 19% of our total revenues for both 2015 and 2014. Medicare represented 20% and 18% of our consolidated accounts receivable, net for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. For 2015 and 2014, our next largest contracted payor was a national association comprised of multiple members, which, in the aggregate accounted for approximately 18% of our net revenue for our Oncology Business for both 2015 and 2014, and approximately 12% of our total revenues for both 2015 and 2014. This same contracted payor represented 27% and 26% of our consolidated accounts receivable, net for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We also contract with various other third party payor organizations, Medicaid, commercial Medicare replacement plans, self-insured plans and numerous other insurance carriers. Other than the payors noted above, no other single payor represented more than 9% of third-party payor net revenue. To the extent such dependency continues, significant fluctuations in revenues, results of operations and liquidity could arise if Medicare or any other significant contracted payor reduces its reimbursement for the services we provide.\nOur billing process is dependent on meeting payor claims processing guidelines which are subject to change at the discretion of the payors. Such changes would materially impact our ability to bill and the timing of such billings, which could materially and adversely impact our revenues, bad debt expense and cash flows, which impact would be even greater if such changes are made by one of our larger payors.\nThe continued consolidation of physician practices, outpatient infusion clinics, oncology clinics, homecare providers and hospitals increases the concentration of decision makers whom either choose to use our ambulatory electronic pumps within our Oncology Business or directly rent, lease or purchase pumps or supplies directly from us.\nWhile we make every effort to benefit from such concentration, such concentration could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIncreased focus on early detection and diagnostics may adversely affect our business.\nAn increased focus on lowering health care spending via improved diagnostic testing (i.e., defensive medicine) and patient monitoring could materially and negatively affect our business. A large portion of our ambulatory infusion pumps are dedicated to a specific form of cancer (i.e., colorectal). As a result of rising health care costs, there may be a demand for more cost-effective approaches to disease management, specifically for colorectal cancer, as well as for emphasis on screening and accurate diagnostic testing to facilitate early detection of potentially costly, severe afflictions. Any change in the approach to treatment of colorectal cancer could have a material and adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf future clinical studies demonstrate that oral medications or other therapies that do not use our electronic ambulatory pumps are at least as effective as continuous infusion therapy, our business could be adversely affected.\nNumerous ongoing clinical trials are currently evaluating and comparing the therapeutic benefits of current continuous infusion-based regimens with various oral medication regimens. If these clinical trials demonstrate\nthat oral medications provide equal or greater therapeutic benefits and/or demonstrate reduced side effects compared to prior oral medication regimens, our revenues and overall business could be materially and adversely affected. Additionally, if new oral medications or other therapies that do not utilize our ambulatory electronic pumps are introduced to the market that are superior to existing oral therapies, physicians\u2019 willingness to prescribe continuous infusion-based regimens could decline, which would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are dependent on our Medicare Supplier Number.\nWe are required to have a Medicare Supplier Number in order to bill Medicare for services provided to Medicare patients. Furthermore, all third party and Medicaid contracts require us to have a Medicare Supplier Number. We are required to comply with Medicare DMEPOS Supplier Standards in order to maintain such number. If we are unable to comply with the relevant standards, we could lose our Medicare Supplier Number. The loss of such identification number for any reason would prevent us from billing Medicare for patients who rely on Medicare to pay their medical expenses and, as a result, we would experience a decrease in our revenues. Without such a number, we would be unable to continue our various third party and Medicaid contracts. A significant portion of our revenues are dependent upon our Medicare Supplier Number, the loss of which would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe CMS requires that all DME providers must be accredited by a CMS approved accreditation organization. On February 17, 2009, we initially received accreditation from the CHAP, and we have remained accredited to date. If we lost our accredited status, our business, financial condition, revenues and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected.\nOur success is impacted by the availability of the chemotherapy drugs that are used in our continuous infusion pump systems.\nWe primarily derive our revenues from the rental of ambulatory infusion pumps to oncology patients through physicians\u2019 offices and chemotherapy clinics. A shortage in the availability of chemotherapy drugs that are used in the continuous infusion pump system, which has occurred in the past, could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe impact of United States health care reform legislation on us remains uncertain.\nThe ACA has perpetuated the development of alternative provider payment models by CMS and the major national commercial payors. These payment models do not replace the current fee-for-service models nor replace current payor contracts, but rather provide additional financial incentives to certain \u201caccountable\u201d providers to improve quality and lower cost. The implications for the Company will come from the provider networks that are forming in order to integrate and coordinate care under these alternative models with CMS and the commercial payors. These provider networks include ACOs, patient-centered primary care medical homes, specialty medical homes, networks accepting bundled payment programs, and other \u201cperformance\u201d networks that contract with CMS and commercial payors under alternative payment models that financially reward improved quality and lower medical cost. The relationship between us and our provider practices and facilities that are participating in these provider networks under alternative payment models will depend on (i) the extent to which these provider networks give priority to the medical cost associated with our DME services and (ii) whether our services are seen as part of a care delivery model that delivers higher value - higher quality at a lower cost.\nOur failure to perform under these alternative payment models, or under similar models or conditions introduced by future legislation, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe rely on independent suppliers for our products. Any delay or disruption in the supply of products, particularly our supply of electronic ambulatory pumps, may negatively impact our operations.\nOur infusion pumps are obtained from outside vendors. The majority of our new pumps are electronic infusion pumps which are supplied to us by two major suppliers: Smiths Medical, Inc. and WalkMed Infusion, LLC. The loss or disruption of our relationships with outside vendors, including pump, parts, or supply recall or pump end of life announcements, could subject us to substantial delays in the delivery or service of pumps to customers. Significant delays in the delivery or service of pumps could result in possible cancellation of orders and the loss of customers. Our inability to provide pumps to meet delivery schedules could have a material adverse effect on our reputation in the industry, as well as on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe face periodic reviews and billing audits from governmental and private payors and these audits could have adverse results that may negatively impact our business.\nAs a result of our participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, we are subject to various governmental reviews and audits to verify our compliance with these programs and applicable laws and regulations. We also are subject to audits under various government programs in which third party firms engaged by CMS conduct extensive reviews of claims data and medical and other records to identify potential improper payments under the Medicare program. Private pay sources also reserve the right to conduct audits. If billing errors are identified in the sample of reviewed claims, the billing error can be extrapolated to all claims filed which could result in a larger overpayment than originally identified in the sample of reviewed claims. Our costs to respond to and defend reviews and audits may be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Moreover, an adverse review or audit could result in:\n\u2022\nrequired refunding or retroactive adjustment of amounts we have been paid by governmental or private payors;\n\u2022\nstate or Federal agencies imposing fines, penalties and other sanctions on us;\n\u2022\nloss of our right to participate in the Medicare program, state programs, or one or more private payor networks; or\n\u2022\ndamage to our business and reputation in various markets.\nAny one of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe do not collect sales or consumption taxes in some jurisdictions.\nOur core services are exempt from sales tax or its equivalent in many states. However, there are a several states that consider pump rentals, sales and services taxable regardless of method of payment. We are collecting sales tax or its equivalent in several jurisdictions. A successful assertion by one or more states or localities requiring us to collect taxes where we currently do not, could result in substantial tax liabilities, including for past sales, as well as penalties and interest.\nIf we are unsuccessful in our efforts to implement and support information technology improvements or respond to technological changes, our growth, prospects and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nTo remain competitive, we must continue to enhance and improve the functionality and features of our technology solutions and services. We have implemented a service to support EMR technology with some of our outpatient infusion practices that enables billing information to be transferred between us and medical facilities electronically and automatically, thus eliminating the current use of mail, email and/or faxes. We have also implemented a web portal that supports our rental and service customers. If these efforts cease to be successful, our reputation and ability to attract and retain customers and contributors will be adversely affected.\nFurthermore, we are likely to incur expenses in connection with continuously updating and improving our technology infrastructure and services. Without such improvements, our operations might suffer from unanticipated system disruptions, slow application performance or unreliable service levels, any of which could negatively affect our reputation and ability to attract and retain customers and contributors. We may face significant delays in introducing new services, products and enhancements.\nIf competitors introduce new products and services using new technologies or if new industry standards and practices emerge, our existing technology and systems may become obsolete or less competitive, and our business may be harmed. In addition, the expansion and improvement of our systems and infrastructure will require us to commit substantial financial, operational and technical resources, with no assurance that our business will improve.\nAll of these factors could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nTechnological interruptions or the efficiency of our website and technology solutions would damage our reputation and brand and adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe satisfactory performance, security, reliability and availability of our network infrastructure are critical to our reputation, our ability to attract and retain customers and our ability to maintain adequate customer service levels. Any system interruptions, outside intrusions, or security breaches could result in negative publicity, damage our reputation and brand or adversely affect our results of operations. We may experience temporary system interruptions for a variety of reasons, including security breaches and other security incidents, viruses, telecommunication and other network failures, power failures, software errors or data corruption. We rely upon third-party service providers, such as co-location and cloud service providers, for our data centers and application hosting, and we are dependent on these third parties to provide continuous power, cooling, internet connectivity and physical security for our servers. In the event that these third-party providers experience any interruption in operations or cease business for any reason, or if we are unable to agree on satisfactory terms for continued hosting relationships, our business could be harmed and we could be forced to enter into a relationship with other service providers or assume hosting responsibilities ourselves. Although we operate two data centers in an active/standby configuration for geographic and vendor redundancy and even though we maintain a third disaster recovery facility to back up our content collection, a system disruption at the active data center could result in a noticeable disruption of our services. Even a disruption as brief as a few minutes could have a negative impact on marketplace activities and could therefore result in a loss of revenues. Because some of the causes of system interruptions may be outside of our control, we may not be able to remedy such interruptions in a timely manner, or at all.\nAll of these factors could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur failure to maintain controls and processes over billing and collecting could have a significant negative impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe collection of accounts receivable is a significant challenge, and requires constant focus and involvement by management and ongoing enhancements to information systems and billing center operating procedures. If we are unable to properly bill and collect our accounts receivable, our results could be materially and adversely affected. While management believes that controls and processes are satisfactory, there can be no assurance that accounts receivable collectability will remain at current levels.\nState licensure laws for DME suppliers are subject to change. If we fail to comply with any state laws, we will be unable to operate as a DME supplier in such state and our business operations will be adversely affected.\nAs a DME supplier operating in all 50 states, we are subject to each state\u2019s licensure laws regulating DME suppliers. State licensure laws for DME suppliers are subject to change and we must ensure that we are\ncontinually in compliance with the laws of all 50 states. In the event that we fail to comply with any state\u2019s laws governing the licensing of DME suppliers, we will be unable to operate as a DME supplier in such state until we regain compliance. We may also be subject to certain fines and/or penalties and our business operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur allowance for doubtful accounts may not be adequate to cover actual losses.\nOur third-party payor contracts do not guarantee annual inflationary increases, typical of the DME payor contracting environment. Contracted reimbursement rates are either subject to increases or decreases in CMS program rates or if not indexed to government rates, are frozen until those payors contracts are reopened and renegotiated. While we monitor reimbursement levels to identify specific payor reimbursement rates that have eroded and renegotiate such rates, we may not be able to maintain or improve overall reimbursement levels, thereby compromising the adequacy of the predicted allowance for doubtful accounts.\nWe may also face reduced reimbursements from private third party payors. As a result, our customers may be unable to make timely payments to us. Although we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments, we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same loss rates that we have in the past. If we begin to experience an increase in our loss rates in excess of our allowances for doubtful accounts it could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur growth strategy includes expanding into treatment for cancers other than colorectal. There can be no assurance that continuous infusion-based regimens for these other cancers will become standards of care for large numbers of patients or that we will be successful in penetrating these different markets.\nAn aspect of our growth strategy is to expand into the treatment of other cancers, such as head, neck and gastric. This population of patients will expand only if clinical trial results for new drugs and new combinations of drugs demonstrate superior outcomes for regimens that include continuous infusion therapy relative to alternatives. No assurances can be given that these new drugs and drug combinations will be approved or will prove superior to oral medication or other treatment alternatives. In addition, no assurances can be given that we will be able to penetrate successfully any new markets that may develop in the future or manage the growth in additional resources that would be required.\nOur business may be subject to natural forces beyond our control.\nNatural disasters, including hurricanes, earthquakes, floods, excessive snowfall and other unfavorable weather conditions, may affect our operations. Natural catastrophes may have a detrimental effect on our gross revenue, preventing many patients from visiting a facility to obtain our ambulatory infusion pumps or receive treatment. Similarly, such events could impact key suppliers or vendors, disrupting the services or materials they provide us. The severity of these occurrences, should they ever occur, will determine the extent to which and if our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows is materially and adversely affected.\nThe industry in which we operate is intensely competitive and ever-changing. If we are unable to successfully compete with our competitors, our business operations may suffer.\nThe drug infusion industry is highly competitive. Some of our competitors and potential competitors, including some of the practices that we service, have significantly greater resources than we do for information technology, marketing and sales. As a result, they may be better able to compete for market share, even in areas in which our services may be superior. The industry is subject to technological changes and such changes may put our current fleet of pumps, smart pump licensing, our information technology solutions or our other technological-based solutions at a competitive disadvantage. Furthermore, the healthcare industry, in general, is experiencing market consolidation, reducing the number of decision makers. If we are unable to effectively compete in our market, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be materially and adversely affected.\nOur industry is dependent on regulatory guidelines that affect our billing practices. If our competitors do not comply with these regulatory guidelines, our business could be adversely affected.\nAggressive competitors may not fully comply with rules regarding CMS and other payors\u2019 billing and documentation requirements. Competitors, who do not meet the same standards of compliance that we do with respect to billing regulations, may put us at a potential competitive disadvantage. We are a participating provider with Medicare and under contract with approximately 340 third party payor networks, all of which have very stringent guidelines. If our competitors do not comply with these regulatory guidelines, we could be put at a potential competitive disadvantage and our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be material and adversely affected.\nAlthough we do not manufacture the products we distribute, if one of the products distributed by us proves to be defective or is misused by a health care practitioner or patient, we may be subject to liability that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nAlthough we do not manufacture the pumps that we distribute, a defect in the design or manufacture of a pump distributed or serviced by us, or a failure of pumps distributed by us to perform for the use specified, could have a material and adverse effect on our reputation in the industry and subject us to claims of liability for injuries and otherwise. Misuse of the pumps distributed by us by a practitioner or patient that results in injury could similarly subject us to liability. Any substantial underinsured loss could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, any impairment of our reputation could have a material and adverse effect on our revenues and prospects for future business.\nWe intend to continue to pursue opportunities for the further expansion of our business through strategic alliances and/or joint ventures. Future strategic alliances and/or joint ventures may require significant resources and/or result in significant unanticipated costs or liabilities to us.\nWe intend to continue to pursue opportunities for the further expansion of our business through strategic alliances and/or joint ventures. Any future strategic alliances or joint ventures will depend on our ability to identify suitable partners, negotiate acceptable terms for such transactions and obtain financing, if necessary. These investments require significant managerial attention, which may be diverted from our other operations.\nIf we engage in strategic acquisitions, we may experience significant costs and difficulty in assimilating operations or personnel, which could threaten our future growth.\nIf we make any acquisitions, we could have difficulty assimilating operations, technologies and products and services. In addition, we could have difficulty integrating or retaining personnel and maintaining employee morale as we take steps to combine the personnel and business cultures of separate organizations into one and to eliminate duplicate positions and functions. It may also be difficult for us to preserve important relationships with others, such as strategic partners, customers, and suppliers, who may delay or defer decisions on agreements with us, or seek to change existing agreements with us, because of the acquisition. In addition, acquisitions may involve entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience. The occurrence of any one or more of these factors could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management\u2019s and employees\u2019 attention from our ongoing business operations, result in decreased operating performance and increase our expenses. Moreover, our profitability may suffer because of acquisition-related costs or amortization of intangible assets. Furthermore, we may have to incur debt or issue equity securities in future acquisitions. The issuance of equity securities would dilute our existing stockholders.\nWe may be unable to maintain adequate working relationships with health care professionals.\nWe seek to maintain close working relationships with respected physicians and medical personnel in hospitals and universities. We rely on these professionals to assist us in the development of proprietary service\nand improvements to complement and expand our existing service and product lines. If we are unable to maintain these relationships, our ability to market and sell new and improved products and services could decrease and future operating results could be unfavorably affected.\nIf we fail to comply with applicable governmental or accrediting bodies\u2019 regulations, we could face substantial penalties and our business, operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nCertain federal, state health care, and accreditation bodies\u2019 laws and regulations, including those pertaining to fraud and abuse and patients\u2019 rights are applicable to our business. The laws that affect our ability to operate include:\n\u2022\nthe federal health care program Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce (i) the referral of an individual, for an item or service, or (ii) the purchasing or ordering of a good or service, for which payment may be made under federal health care programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;\n\u2022\nfederal false claims laws which prohibit, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent, and which may apply to entities like us that promote medical devices, provide medical device management services and may provide coding and billing advice to customers;\n\u2022\nHIPAA, which prohibits executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program or making false statements relating to health care matters and which also imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information; and\n\u2022\nstate law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws that may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers, and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ in significant ways from state to state and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nIf our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Any penalties, damages, fines, curtailment or restructuring of our operations could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business. Moreover, achieving and sustaining compliance with applicable federal and state privacy, security and fraud laws may prove costly.\nFailure to protect our intellectual property could substantially harm our business and operating results.\nIn order to protect our trade secrets and other confidential information, we rely in part on confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and third parties with whom we have relationships. These agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of misappropriation of trade secrets or any unauthorized disclosure of trade secrets and other confidential information. In addition, others may independently discover our trade secrets and confidential information, and in such cases we could not assert any trade secret rights against such parties. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce or determine the scope of our trade secret rights and related confidentiality and nondisclosure provisions. Failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection, or our competitors\u2019 acquisition of our trade secrets, could materially and adversely affect our competitive business position.\nWe are dependent upon executive officers and other key personnel. The loss of any of our executive officers or other key personnel could reduce our ability to manage our businesses and achieve our business plan, which could cause our sales to decline and our operating results and cash flows to suffer.\nOur success is substantially dependent on the continued services of our executive officers and other key personnel who generally have extensive experience in our industry. Our future success also will depend in large part upon our ability to identify, attract and retain other highly qualified executive officers, managerial, finance, technical and sales and marketing personnel. Competition for these individuals is intense. The loss of the services of any executive officer or other key employee, or our failure to attract and retain other qualified and experienced personnel on acceptable terms, could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCovenants in our current and any future debt agreement restrict our business.\nOur Credit Agreement contains, and the agreements that govern our future indebtedness may contain, covenants that restrict our ability to and the ability of our subsidiaries to, among other things:\n\u2022\nengage in a transaction that results in a change of control, as defined by the Credit Agreement governing the Credit Facility;\n\u2022\ncreate, incur, assume or suffer to exist any lien upon any of our property, assets or revenues;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments or acquisitions;\n\u2022\ncreate, incur, assume or suffer to exist any indebtedness;\n\u2022\nmerge, dissolve, liquidate, consolidate or sell all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022\nmake any disposition or enter into any agreement to make any disposition;\n\u2022\nrepurchase outstanding stock from the open market; and\n\u2022\ndeclare or make, directly or indirectly, any dividend or other restricted payment, or incur any obligation (contingent or otherwise) to do so.\nThese covenants may restrict our ability to operate our business. Our failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could result in reduced liquidity for the Company and could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, our ability to pay interest and repay the principal for our indebtedness is dependent upon our ability to manage our business operations, generate sufficient cash flows to service such debt and the other factors discussed in this section. There can be no assurance that we will be able to manage any of these risks successfully.\nEconomic uncertainty or economic deterioration could adversely affect us.\nWhile the global economy is improving, there are still uncertainties surrounding the strength of the recovery that may continue to drive stock market and interest rate volatility and adversely impact consumer confidence, product demand, and our ability to refinance our debt. Economic conditions, along with our operating performance, may also materially and adversely impact our ability to access the financial markets. Accordingly, our future business and financial results are subject to uncertainty. If economic conditions deteriorate in the future, our future revenues and financial results could be materially and adversely affected.\nRISK FACTORS RELATING SPECIFICALLY TO OUR COMMON STOCK\nThe market price of our common stock has been, and is likely to remain, volatile, subject to low trading volume and may decline in value.\nThe market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile. Market prices for securities of health care services companies, including ours, have historically been volatile, and the market has\nfrom time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that appear unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. The following factors, among others, can have a significant effect on the market price of our common stock:\n\u2022\nannouncements of technological innovations, new products, or clinical studies by others;\n\u2022\ngovernment regulation;\n\u2022\nchanges in the coverage or reimbursement rates of private insurers and governmental agencies;\n\u2022\nannouncements regarding new products or services;\n\u2022\nannouncements or speculation regarding strategic alliances, mergers, acquisitions or other transactions;\n\u2022\ndevelopments in patent or other proprietary rights;\n\u2022\nthe liquidity of the market for our common stock;\n\u2022\nnews of other healthcare events or announcements;\n\u2022\nchanges in health care policies in the United States or globally;\n\u2022\nglobal financial conditions; and\n\u2022\ncomments by securities analysts and general market conditions.\nThe realization of any risks described in these \u201cRisk Factors\u201d could also have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock.\nWe do not pay dividends and this may negatively affect the price of our stock.\nUnder the terms of our Credit Agreement, our ability to pay dividends on our common stock is limited and we do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. The future price of our common stock may be adversely impacted because we do not pay dividends.\nRestricted stock and the exercise of stock options may depress our stock price and may result in dilution to our common stockholders.\nThere are a significant number of shares of restricted stock and outstanding options to purchase our stock. If the market price of our common stock rises above the exercise price of outstanding options, holders of those securities may be likely to exercise their options and sell the common stock acquired upon exercise in the open market. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market by holders of options may depress the prevailing market price for our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the future sale of our equity securities. Additionally, if the holders of outstanding options exercise those options, our common stockholders will incur dilution in their relative percentage ownership.\nAs of December 31, 2015, options to purchase 2.3 million shares of common stock were outstanding, at a weighted average exercise price of $2.49 per share, of which 1.4 million were exercisable at a weighted average exercise price of $2.45 per share. In addition, restricted stock of 0.2 million shares, with a weighted average grant date fair value of $2.09 per share, were outstanding and were issuable upon the vesting of certain time restrictions.\nWe may be subject to limitations on net operating loss carryforwards and certain built-in losses following an ownership change.\nIf we experience an ownership change, either via a major transaction or a series of trades where a substantial percentage of our ownership changes, which may be less than a majority of our ownership in certain cases, we may be limited in our ability to use our deferred tax assets and may be required to record a valuation allowance against such assets.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2015, we completed an update to our analysis of past ownership (as defined under Section 382 of the Code), and as a result, we believe that, consistent with previously completed analyses, we have not experienced an ownership change from December 31, 2010 through the date of such updated analysis. We have undertaken a definitive analysis necessary to quantify the effect of ownership change as of December 31, 2010 on the net operating loss carryforwards generated prior to December 31, 2010. Based on the analysis, we are subject to an annual limitation of $1.8 million on our use of remaining pre-ownership change net operating loss carryforwards of $4.7 million (and certain other pre-change tax attributes). Our federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $15.5 million will begin to expire in various years beginning in 2028. There can be no assurance that we will not experience an ownership change in the future, in which case we may be limited in our ability to use our deferred tax assets and may be required to record a valuation allowance against such assets.", "PERMNO": 12452, "SIC": 8090, "TIC": "INFU"}
