RISK FACTORS\nWe operate in a changing environment that involves numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our operations. The following highlights some of the factors that have affected, and in the future could affect, our operations.\nRisks Related to our Business\nOur success is dependent upon our ability to protect our patents.\nOur success is substantially dependent upon our proprietary technologies and our ability to protect our intellectual property rights. We currently own thirty-three (33) patents that relate to various technologies including (i) our Remote Power Patent covering the delivery of power to certain devices over PoE networks, (ii) our Mirror Worlds Patent Portfolio relating to foundational technologies that enable unified search and indexing, displaying and archiving of documents in a computer system, (iii) our Cox Patent Portfolio relating to identification of media content, and (iv) our QoS patents covering the transmission of audio, voice and data in order to achieve high quality of service (QoS) over computer and telephony networks. We have successfully defended several challenges to certain claims of our Remote Power Patent and our Cox Patent Portfolio at the USPTO (see \"Legal Proceedings\" at pages 27-30 hereof) However, the validity of our Remote Power Patent and certain patents within our Cox Patent Portfolio are currently being challenged in patent infringement litigation pending in the courts (see \"Legal Proceedings\" at pages 27-30 of this Annual Report). We rely upon our patents and trade secret laws, non-disclosure agreements with our employees, consultants and third parties to protect our intellectual property assets. The complexity of patent and common law and the uncertainty of the outcome of litigation create risk that our efforts to protect our intellectual property assets may not be successful. We cannot assure you that our patents will be upheld or that third parties will not invalidate our patent assets. If our intellectual property assets are not upheld, particularly our Remote Power Patent, such an event would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations as our revenue stream is largely dependent upon the continued validity of our Remote Power Patent.\nIf we are unsuccessful in legal proceedings involving our intellectual property, including if any of the claims of defendants to invalidate our patents are successful, such a result would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe currently have several litigations pending in the courts against parties whom we believe require a license to our patents including (i) litigation relating to our Remote Power Patent against four data networking equipment manufacturers and (ii) two litigations against Google and YouTube with respect to certain patents within our Cox Patent Portfolio. In addition, in the future we may commence patent litigation against third parties alleging infringement of our patents. We are also likely to face future proceedings (as we have in the past) at the United States Patent and Trademark Office (\"USPTO\") challenging the validity of our intellectual property assets. Patent litigation is inherently risky and the outcome is uncertain. The defendants in our pending litigations are all large, well financed companies with\n- 16 -\nsubstantially greater resources than us. We may not be successful in such litigation and the outcome of such litigation could be harmful to us. In addition, it is customary for defendants in patent litigation to assert claims seeking to invalidate our patents including commencement of proceedings at the USPTO. If we are unsuccessful in enforcing and validating our patents and/or if third party claims against us seeking to invalidate our patents are successful, they may be able to obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which effectively could block our ability to license or otherwise capitalize on our proprietary technologies. Furthermore, then existing licensees of our patents will no longer be obligated to pay royalties to us. Successful litigation against us resulting in a determination that our patents, particularly our Remote Power Patent, are not valid or enforceable, and/or that third parties do not infringe, would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend upon our Remote Power Patent which expires in March 2020 for a significant portion of our revenue and profit.\nOur Remote Power Patent has generated licensing revenue in excess of $105,000,000 from May 2007 through December 31, 2016. We currently have sixteen (16) royalty bearing license agreements for our Remote Power Patent pursuant to which licensees have an obligation to pay us royalties on a monthly or quarterly basis for the life of the patent (which expires March 2020). Such royalty bearing licenses include, among others, agreements with Cisco Systems, Inc., Dell, Inc., Microsemi Corporation, Netgear, Inc., Motorola Solutions, Inc., NEC Corporation, Polycom, Inc. and ShoreTel Inc. The obligation of licensees of our Remote Power Patent to continue to make royalty payments to us is contingent upon the continued validity of certain claims of our Remote Power Patent. The validity and infringement of our Remote Power Patent is currently at issue in our pending litigation against four data equipment manufacturers in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas (see \"Legal Proceedings\" at pages 27-28 hereof). In the event certain claims of our Remote Power Patent are determined to be invalid in such pending litigation, licensees of our Remote Power Patent would have no further obligation to make royalty payments to us which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, upon the expiration of the Remote Power Patent in March 2020, licensees of our Remote Power Patent will have no further obligations to pay us royalties. Such royalty bearing licenses consisting of quarterly or monthly royalties resulted in $10,788,000 of revenue in 2016. Accordingly, if we are unable to enter into royalty bearing license agreements by March 2020 with respect to other patents owned by us, we will receive no regular ongoing royalty revenue.\nWe may not be able to capitalize in the future on our strategy to acquire high quality patents with significant licensing opportunities or enter into strategic relationships with third parties to license or otherwise monetize their intellectual property.\nBased upon the success we have achieved to date from licensing our Remote Power Patent (twenty-four (24) license agreements which have generated in excess of $105,000,000 in revenue), the revenue we have generated from our Mirror Worlds Patent Portfolio ($47,150,000) and establishing a patent portfolio currently consisting of thirty-three patents, we believe we have the expertise and sufficient\n- 17 -\ncapital to compete in the intellectual property monetization market and to enter strategic relationships with third parties to develop, commercialize, license or otherwise monetize their intellectual property. However, we may not be able to acquire additional intellectual property or, if acquired, we may not achieve material revenue or profit from such intellectual property. Acquisitions of patent assets are competitive, time consuming, complex and costly to consummate. Our strategy is to focus on acquiring high quality patent assets which management believes have the potential for significant licensing opportunities. These high quality patent opportunities are difficult to find and are often very competitive to acquire. In addition, such acquisitions present material risks. Even if we acquire additional patent assets, we may not be able to achieve significant licensing revenue or even generate sufficient revenue related to such patent assets to offset the acquisition costs and the legal fees and expenses which may be incurred to enforce, license or otherwise monetize such patents. In addition, we may not be able to enter into strategic relationships with third parties to license or otherwise monetize their intellectual property and, even if we consummate such strategic relationships, we may not achieve material revenue or profit from such relationships.\nWe are largely dependent upon our license agreement with Cisco for a significant portion of our revenue. The loss of Cisco as a licensee would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nCisco Systems, Inc. (\"Cisco) accounted for 17% and 87%of our licensing revenue for the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. In addition, Cisco accounted for 76% and 71% of our revenue from royalty bearing license agreements for the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. In accordance with our Settlement and License Agreement, dated May 25, 2011, with Cisco (the \"Agreement\"), Cisco is obligated to pay us royalties on a quarterly basis (which began in the first quarter of 2011) based on its sale of PoE products in the United States, up to the maximum royalties per year of $9 million ($8 million per year through 2015) for the remaining term of our Remote Power Patent (March 2020). The royalty payments are subject to certain conditions including the continued validity of certain claims of our Remote Power Patent. The actual royalty payments may be less than the cap stated above. Under the terms of the Agreement, if we grant other licenses with lower royalty rates to third parties (as defined in the Agreement), Cisco shall be entitled to the benefit of the lower royalty rates provided it agrees to the material terms of such other license. Under the terms of the Agreement, we have certain obligations to Cisco and if we materially breach such terms, Cisco will be entitled to stop paying royalties to us. Furthermore, if certain claims of our Remote Power Patent are declared invalid, Cisco would have no further obligation to pay us royalties. The aforementioned event would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n- 18 -\nWe may not be successful in enforcing or defending our Cox Patent Portfolio or generating additional revenue from our Mirror Worlds Patent Portfolio.\nWe acquired our Cox Patent Portfolio in 2013, which currently consists of seventeen (17) patents. We have not yet achieved any revenue from our Cox Patent Portfolio. We are currently enforcing patents within our Cox Patent Portfolio against Google and YouTube, who are challenging these patents (see \"Legal Proceedings\" at pages 29-30 hereof). We may not be successful in enforcing or defending our Cox Patent Portfolio, which would have a negative impact on our future revenue growth and profits.\nIn addition, while we have achieved revenue of $47,150,000 related to our Mirror Worlds Patent Portfolio to date, it is uncertain whether we will be able to generate additional revenue from this patent portfolio.\nA limited number of our licensees account for a significant portion of our licensing revenue.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, three licensees constituted 83% of our licensing revenue including Apple, Inc. (53%), Cisco Systems, Inc. (17%) and Dell, Inc. (13%). For the year ended December 31, 2015, Cisco accounted for 51% of our licensing revenue and Microsoft accounted for 28% of our licensing revenue. It is anticipated that a few licensees will continue to constitute a significant portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future. To the extent sales of PoE products by our significant licensees of our Remote Power Patent are adversely affected our revenues will be significantly impacted.\nLegislation, regulations, court rulings and actions by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office have materially increased the risk and cost of enforcement of patents and may continue to do so in the future.\nLegislation, regulations, court rulings and actions by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office have materially increased the risk and cost of enforcing patents. United States patent laws were amended by the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, referred to as the America Invents Act, which became effective on March 16, 2013. The America Invents Act includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law. In general, it attempts to address issues surrounding the enforceability of patents and the increase in patent litigation by, among other things, establishing new procedures for patent litigation and new administrative post-grant review procedures to challenge the patentability of issued patents outside of litigation, including Inter Partes Review (IPR) and Covered Business Method Review (CBM) proceedings which provide third parties a timely, cost effective alternative to district court litigation to challenge the validity of an issued patent. In addition, the America Invents Act changes the way that parties may be joined in patent infringement actions, increasing the likelihood that such actions will need to be brought against individual parties allegedly infringing by their respective individual actions or activities. The America Invents Act and its implementation has increased the uncertainties and costs surrounding the enforcement of patent rights, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n- 19 -\nIn addition, changes in patent law could adversely impact our business. Such changes may not be advantageous to us and may make it more difficult to obtain adequate patent protection to enforce our patents. Increased focus on the growing number of patent lawsuits, particularly by non-practicing entities (NPEs), may result in legislative changes which increase the risk and costs of asserting patent litigation.\nOur pending patent infringement litigations in the courts involving our Remote Power Patent and the Cox Patent Portfolio are time consuming and costly.\nWe have a pending litigation in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Tyler Division against four data networking equipment manufacturers for infringement of our Remote Power Patent (commenced in September 2011 and currently scheduled for trial in November 2017). In April 2014 and December 2014, we initiated patent litigation in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against Google and YouTube for infringement of several of our patents within our Cox Patent Portfolio. The litigation pertaining to our Cox Patent Portfolio is currently stayed pending appeal of Final Written Decisions of the Patent Trial and Appeal Board of the USPTO to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (see \"Legal Proceedings\" at pages 29-30 of this Annual Report).\nWhile we have contingent legal fee arrangements with our patent litigation counsel in each litigation (excluding proceedings at the USPTO), we are responsible for a portion of the expenses which are anticipated to be material. In addition, the time and effort required of our management to effectively pursue these litigations is likely to be significant and it may adversely affect other business opportunities.\nWe face intense competition to acquire intellectual property and enter into strategic relationships.\nWith respect to our ability to acquire additional intellectual property or enter into strategic relationships with third parties to monetize their intellectual property, we face considerable competition from other companies, many of which have significantly greater financial and other resources than we have. The patent licensing and enforcement business has grown significantly over the past several years and there has been an increase in the number of companies seeking to acquire intellectual property rights from third parties. Companies including, among others, Acacia Research Corporation (NASDAQ:ACTG), Intellectual Ventures, WiLan Inc. (NASDAQ:WILN), VirnetX Holdings Corp. (NYSE MKT:VHC), Marathon Patent Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:MARA) and RPX Corporation (NASDAQ:RPXC) seek to acquire or partner with third parties to license or enforce intellectual property rights. It is expected that others will enter this market as well. Many of these competitors have significantly more financial and human resources than us.\nWe may also compete with strategic corporate buyers, litigation funding firms such as Burford Capital Limited, Fortress Investment Group, Parabellum Capital LLC and Bentham Capital LLC, venture capital firms and hedge funds for intellectual property acquisitions and licensing opportunities. Many of these competitors have greater financial resources and human resources than us.\n- 20 -\nOur quarterly and annual operating and financial results and our revenue are difficult to predict and are likely to fluctuate significantly in future periods.\nOur quarterly and annual operating and financial results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly from period to period. Our revenue and net income was $65,088,000 and $23,223,000, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $16,565,000 and $4,107,000, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our revenue and net income was $12,309,000 and $1,766,000, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2014 and $8,017,000 and $1,016,000 for the year ended December 31, 2013. Accordingly, our revenue, net income and results of operations may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors that are outside our control including, but not limited to, our ability and timing in consummating future license agreements for our intellectual property assets, the timing and extent of payments received by us from licensees, the timing and our ability to achieve successful outcomes from current and future patent litigation, and the timing and our ability to achieve revenue from future strategic relationships.\nThe patent monetization cycle is long, costly and unpredictable.\nThere is generally a significant time lag between acquiring a patent portfolio and recognizing revenue from those patent assets. During this time lag, significant costs are likely to be incurred which may have a negative impact on our results of operations, cash flow and financial position. Furthermore, the outcome of our efforts to monetize our patents is uncertain and we may not be successful.\nWe may need to pursue litigation to protect our patent rights as we have done in the past (see \"Legal Proceedings\" at pages 27-30 hereof). Such litigation is typically protracted and complex. The costs are typically substantial, and the outcomes are unpredictable. In addition, the Federal courts are becoming more crowded and as a result patent litigation is taking longer.\nIn the future we could be classified as a Personal Holding Company resulting in a 20% tax on our PHC Income that we do not distribute to our shareholders.\nThe personal holding company (\"PHC\") rules under the Internal Revenue Code impose a 20% tax on a PHC's undistributed personal holding company income (\"PHC Income\" which means, in general, taxable income subject to certain adjustments). For a corporation to be classified as a PHC, it must satisfy two tests that (i) more than 50% in value of its outstanding shares must be owned directly or indirectly by 5 or fewer individuals at anytime during the second half of the year (after applying constructive ownership rules to attribute stock owned by entities to their beneficial owners and among certain family members and other related parties) (the \"Ownership Test\") and (ii) at least 60% of its adjusted ordinary gross income for a taxable year consists of dividends, interest, royalties, annuities and rents (the \"Income Test\"). During the second half of 2016 through the date of this Annual Report (as well as prior years), we did not meet the Ownership Test. Due to the significant number of shares held by our largest shareholders, we will continually assess our share ownership to determine whether it meets the Ownership Test. If the Ownership Test were met and the income generated by us were determined to constitute \"royalties\" within the meaning of the Income Test, we would constitute a PHC and we would be subject to a 20% tax on the amount of any PHC Income that we do not distribute to our shareholders.\n- 21 -\nDependence upon CEO and Chairman.\nOur success is largely dependent upon the personal efforts of Corey M. Horowitz, our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our Board of Directors. On July 14, 2016, we entered into a new employment agreement with Mr. Horowitz pursuant to which he continues to serve as our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer for a five year term. The loss of the services of Mr. Horowitz would have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects. We do not maintain key-man life insurance on the life of Mr. Horowitz.\nIt may be difficult for us to verify royalty amounts owed to us under our license agreements with our licensees including Cisco, and this may cause us to lose potential revenue.\nThe standard terms of our royalty bearing license agreements require our licensees to report the sale of licensed products and report this data to us in most cases on a quarterly basis. Although our standard license terms give us the right to audit books and records of our licensees to verify this information, audits can be expensive, time consuming, incomplete and subject to dispute. From time to time, we may audit certain of our licensees (as we did with Cisco in 2014 resulting in additional licensing revenue of $3,281,000) to verify independently the accuracy of the information contained in their royalty reports in an effort to decrease the likelihood that we will not receive the revenue to which we are entitled under the terms of our license agreements. However, we cannot give assurances that these audits will be frequent enough and/or effective to that end. There is no certainty that we will receive additional revenue from an audit and in some cases there may be an over-payment which will be credited against future royalties under our license agreements.\nOur current licenses for our Remote Power Patent may not continue to result in significant revenue and do not necessarily mean we will achieve additional license agreements.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we achieved revenue of $22,588,000 and $11,915,000 from royalty bearing license agreements for our Remote Power Patent, respectively. We currently have royalty bearing license agreements for our Remote Power Patent with sixteen (16) licensees including, among others, Cisco Systems, Inc., Dell Inc., Netgear, Inc., Microsemi Corporation, Motorola Solutions, Inc., NEC Corporation, ShoreTel Inc. and Polycom, Inc., pursuant to which such parties are obligated to pay us on-going royalties on a monthly or quarterly basis for the life of our Remote Power Patent (March 2020). Notwithstanding such royalty bearing license agreements, we may not continue to achieve significant revenue from such license agreements. Our failure to continue to achieve significant revenue from our existing license agreements would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we may not be able to consummate additional licensing agreements resulting in material revenue with respect to our Remote Power Patent.\n- 22 -\nOur current licensing revenue from royalty bearing license agreements depends upon the continued viability of the PoE market.\nEthernet is the leading local area networking technology in use today. PoE technology allows for the delivery of power over Ethernet (\"PoE\") cables rather than by separate power cords. As a result a wide variety of network devices, including IP telephones, wireless LAN access points, web-based network security cameras, data collection terminals and other network devices are able to receive power over existing data cables. The failure of the PoE market to remain viable would have a material adverse effect on licensing revenue for our Remote Power Patent which is currently our sole patent generating regular on-going licensing revenue.\nOur markets are subject to rapid technological change and our technologies face potential technology obsolescence.\nThe markets covered by our intellectual property are characterized by rapid technological changes, changing customer requirements, frequent new product introductions and enhancements, and evolving industry standards. The introduction of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards may render our technologies obsolete or less marketable.\nIn addition, other companies may develop competing technologies that offer better or less expensive alternatives to PoE and the other technologies covered by our intellectual property. Moreover, technological advances or entirely different approaches developed by other companies or adopted by various standards groups could render our Remote Power Patent and our other patents obsolete, less marketable or unenforceable.\nThe burdens of being a public company may adversely affect us including our ability to pursue litigation.\nAs a public company, our management must devote substantial time, attention and financial resources to comply with U.S. securities laws. This may have a material adverse effect on management's ability to effectively and efficiently pursue its business. In addition, our disclosure obligations under U.S. securities laws require us to disclose information publicly that will be available to litigation opponents. We may, from time to time, be required to disclose information that may have a material adverse affect on our litigation strategies. This information may enable our litigation opponents to develop effective litigation strategies that are contrary to our interests.\n- 23 -\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nInvestors may have limited influence on stockholder decisions because ownership of our common stock is concentrated.\nAs of March 15, 2017, our executive officers and directors beneficially owned 30.8% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, these stockholders may be able to exercise substantial control over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or its assets. This concentration of ownership will limit other stockholders' ability to influence corporate matters and may have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring control over us.\nOur common stock may be delisted from the NYSE MKT LLC if we fail to comply with continued listing standards.\nOur common stock is currently traded on the NYSE MKT LLC market under the symbol \"NTIP\". If we fail to meet any of the continued listing standards of the NYSE MKT LLC, our common stock could be delisted from NYSE MKT LLC. Such delisting could adversely affect the price and trading (including liquidity) of our common stock.\nThe significant number of options and restricted stock units outstanding may adversely affect the market price for our common stock.\nAs of March 15, 2017, there were outstanding options to purchase an aggregate of 2,235,000 shares of our common stock at exercise prices ranging from $0.83 to $2.34. In addition, we have outstanding restricted stock units which if fully vested result in the issuance of an additional 930,500 shares of common stock. To the extent that outstanding options are exercised and restricted stock units become vested, existing stockholder percentage ownership will be diluted and any sales in the public market of the common stock underlying such options or restricted stock units may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock.\nWe may seek to raise additional funds, finance intellectual property acquisitions or develop strategic relationships by issuing capital stock that would dilute your ownership.\nWe may elect to raise financing by issuing equity securities, which, if conducted in the future, would materially reduce the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders. Furthermore, any newly issued securities could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our existing common stock. Moreover, any issuances by us of equity securities may be at or below the prevailing market price of our stock and in any event may have a dilutive impact on your ownership interest, which could cause the market price of stock to decline. We may also raise additional funds through the incurrence of debt or the issuance or sale of other securities or instruments senior to our common shares. The holders of any debt securities or instruments we may issue could have rights superior to the rights of our common stockholders.\n- 24 -\nFuture sales of shares of our common stock may cause the prevailing market price of our shares to decline and could harm our ability to raise additional capital.\nWe have previously issued a substantial number of shares of restricted common stock, which are eligible for resale under Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933, and may become freely tradable. We have also registered a substantial number of shares including shares that are issuable upon the exercise of options and pursuant to restricted stock units. In addition, if holders of options choose to exercise their purchase rights or restricted stock units vest, and such parties sell shares of common stock in the public market or if holders of currently restricted common stock or registered common stock sell such shares in the public market, or attempt to publicly sell such shares in a short time period, the prevailing market price for our common stock may decline. Such decline in the price of our common stock may also adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital.\nProvisions in our corporate charter, by-laws and in Delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, could discourage a takeover and adversely affect existing stockholders.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes the board of directors to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock. The preferred stock may be issued in one or more series, the terms of which may be determined at the time of issuance by our board of directors, without further action by stockholders, and may include, among other things, voting rights (including the right to vote as a series on particular matters), preferences as to dividends and liquidation, conversion and redemption rights, and sinking fund provisions, any of which could adversely affect holders of our common stock. Although there are currently no shares of preferred stock outstanding, future holders of preferred stock may have rights superior to our common stock and such rights could also be used to restrict our ability to merge with, or sell our assets to third parties.\nWe are also subject to the \"anti takeover\" provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which could prevent us from engaging in a \"business combination\" with a 15% or greater stockholder for a period of three years from the date such person acquired that status unless appropriate board or stockholder approvals are obtained.\nIn addition, our By-laws contain advance notice requirements for director nominations and for new business to be brought up at stockholder meetings. Stockholders wishing to submit director nominations or raise matters to a vote of stockholders must provide notice to us within specified date windows and in very specific forms in order to have that matter voted on at a stockholders meeting.\nThe aforementioned provisions could deter unsolicited takeovers or delay or prevent changes in our control or management, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over the then current market price. These provisions may also limit the ability of stockholders to delay, deter or prevent a change of control, or approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests.\n- 25 -\nOur stock price may be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock may be highly volatile and could fluctuate widely in price in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the following:\n\u00b7\nthe outcome of our legal proceedings;\n\u00b7\nour ability to continue to successfully enforce and/or defend our Remote Power Patent;\n\u00b7\nour ability to continue to receive material revenue from licensees of our Remote Power Patent;\n\u00b7\nour ability to continue to enter into new license agreements with third parties with respect to our Remote Power Patent;\n\u00b7\nour ability to license and monetize our Cox Patent Portfolio;\n\u00b7\nour ability to further license or monetize our Mirror Worlds Patent Portfolio;\n\u00b7\nour ability to acquire additional intellectual property;\n\u00b7\nour ability to continue to achieve material revenue and profits;\n\u00b7\nour ability to enter into strategic relationships with third parties to license or otherwise monetize their intellectual property;\n\u00b7\nvariations in our quarterly and annual operating results;\n\u00b7\nour ability to raise capital when needed;\n\u00b7\nsales of our common stock;\n\u00b7\ntechnology changes;\n\u00b7\nlegislative, regulatory and competitive developments; and\n\u00b7\neconomic and other external factors.\nIn addition, the securities markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also have a material and adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 34936, "SIC": 6794, "TIC": "NTIP"}
