RISK FACTORS\nSummary Risk Factors:\nIn the course of conducting our business operations, we are exposed to a variety of risks, some of which are inherent in our industry and others of which are more specific to our own businesses. The discussion below addresses the material factors, of which we are currently aware, that could affect our businesses, results of operations and financial condition and make an investment in the Company speculative or risky.\nSome of these risks include:\n\u2022The scale and scope of the COVID-19 pandemic is having and is likely to continue to have an adverse impact on our business.\n\u2022Our growth depends upon the continued growth in demand for electric vehicles with high performance lithium compounds.\n\u2022Lithium prices can be volatile, especially due to changes in supply.\n\u2022Adverse conditions in the economy and volatility and disruption of financial markets can negatively impact our customers, and downturns in our customers\u2019 end-markets could adversely affect our sales and profitability.\n\u2022We face competition in our business.\n\u2022Our operating results are subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations.\n\u2022Production expansion efforts are complex projects that will require significant capital expenditures and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties.\n\u2022The development and adoption of new battery technologies that rely on inputs other than lithium compounds could significantly impact our prospects and future revenues.\n\u2022We may have difficulty accessing global capital and credit markets.\n\u2022The conditional conversion feature of the 2025 Notes may adversely impact our liquidity or dilute our stockholders, depending on the method of settlement.\n\u2022We may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our debt.\n\u2022Our research and development efforts may not succeed, and our competitors may develop more effective or successful products.\n\u2022We may make future acquisitions which may be difficult to integrate, divert management and financial resources and result in unanticipated costs.\n\u2022We have substantial international operations and sales, and the risks of doing business in foreign countries could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022Our lithium extraction and production operations in Argentina expose us to specific political, financial and operational risks.\n\u2022Our operations and suppliers may be subject to physical and other risks, including natural disasters, epidemics, pandemics, and other catastrophic events beyond our control, which could disrupt production and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\u2022Severe weather events, including the effects of climate change, are inherently unpredictable and may have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial results and financial condition.\n\u2022We derive a substantial portion of our revenue from a limited number of customers, and the loss of, or a significant reduction in orders from a large customer could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\n\u2022We may not satisfy customer qualification processes, customers\u2019 or governments\u2019 quality standards, and could be subject to damages based on claims brought against us or lose customers as a result of the failure of our products to meet certain quality standards.\n\u2022Global inflation, fluctuations in the price of energy and certain raw materials, and our inability to obtain raw materials and products under contract sourcing arrangements, could have an adverse effect on the margins of our products, our business, financial condition and our results of operations.\n\u2022Our success depends upon our ability to attract and retain key employees and the identification and development of talent to succeed senior management.\n\u2022Some of our employees are unionized or are employed subject to local laws that are less favorable to employers than the laws of the U.S.\n\u2022Our business and operations could suffer in the event of cybersecurity breaches or disruptions to our information technology environment.\n\u2022Our inability to protect our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022We have not established \u201cproven\u201d or \u201cprobable\u201d reserves, as defined by the SEC under Industry Guide 7, through the completion of a feasibility study for the minerals that we produce.\n\u2022Our business could be negatively impacted by sustainability and ESG matters and/or our reporting of such matters.\n\u2022Our business and financial results may be adversely affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings.\n\u2022We, our operations, facilities, products and raw materials are subject to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, and costs to comply with, and liabilities related to, these laws and regulations could adversely affect our business.\n\u2022Unanticipated changes in our tax provisions, variability of our effective tax rate, the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could impact our financial performance.\n\u2022If there is a determination that the Separation and the Distribution is taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, then FMC and its stockholders could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities, and we could incur significant liabilities.\n\u2022Our stock price may fluctuate significantly.\n\u2022Some provisions of Delaware law and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may deter third parties from acquiring us.\n\u2022We are not declaring or paying cash dividends at this time, and this may deter certain investors from purchasing our stock.\nAdditional factors that could affect our businesses, results of operations and financial condition are discussed in Forward-Looking Statements at the end of this section. However, other factors not discussed below or elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K could also adversely affect our businesses, results of operations and financial condition. Therefore, the risk factors below should not be considered a complete list of potential risks that we may face.\nAny risk factor described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in any of our other SEC filings could by itself, or together with other factors, materially adversely affect our liquidity, competitive position, business, reputation, results of operations, capital position or financial condition, including by materially increasing our expenses or decreasing our revenues, which could result in material losses.\nAmong the factors that could have an impact on our ability to achieve operating results and meet our other goals are:\nCOVID-19 Risks:\nThe scale and scope of the COVID-19 pandemic is having and is likely to continue to have an adverse impact on our business.\nWe face various risks related to health epidemics like the continuing global COVID-19 pandemic. Changes in consumer behavior, pandemic fears, market demand downturns, and restrictions intended to slow the spread of COVID-19 have led and may continue to cause business disruption, volatility in global capital and financial markets, and a global slowdown of economic activity. The emergency measures imposed by governments on businesses and individuals, including quarantines, travel restrictions, social distancing, workforce retention rules and restrictions on the movement of workers, among other measures, have impacted and may further impact our workforce and operations, and those of our customers and suppliers. The severity of the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and their impact on our results, will be determined by how long the COVID-19 pandemic continues, which is currently unknown. The disruptions and duration may be impacted by the actions that governments, businesses and individuals may take in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic, more contagious variants of the virus, vaccine resistance and delays in vaccine distribution. Future disruptions could have an adverse impact on our operations and expansion activities, results, financial position and liquidity, or on our ability to successfully execute our business strategies and initiatives.\nWe have manufacturing operations in the U.S., Argentina, China, the United Kingdom, and India, general operations in Singapore, and sales offices in the U.S., China, the United Kingdom, India, South Korea and Japan. Each of these countries has been affected by the outbreak and has adopted measures to contain it, and each may adopt even stricter measures in the future. The government of Argentina previously imposed workforce retention rules prohibiting the dismissal of workers without just cause, which were replaced by rules requiring the payment of enhanced severance benefits upon termination of employment. In the UK, lockdown measures may be re-imposed to contain new variants of the coronavirus. Government measures and restrictions globally have had a negative impact on demand for our products and a negative impact on the efficient operation of our facilities, supply chains and logistics. We have experienced disruptions and delays within our supply chain and logistics operations in the U.S., China, Southeast Asia, Argentina and Europe. This includes challenges at ports due to national quarantines, difficulties with scheduling cargo ships, additional warehouse costs due to shipment delays, and the restriction of movements by trucks within and between countries. While in certain cases the Company has availed itself of certain exemptions from government restrictions, there can be no assurance that these exemptions will not be modified or revoked. Any new or continuing government restrictions, and any failure to obtain or retain an exemption, may lead to a further negative impact on our business, including increased costs, higher payroll taxes, and/or an inability to meet supply obligations to customers.\nThe rapid and global spread of COVID-19 has resulted in the disruption and temporary shutdown of the businesses of certain of our customers, end users, contract manufacturers and suppliers, and limits on access to the production facilities of our contract manufacturers and suppliers. Some contract manufacturers and suppliers may be unable to perform under a contract, file for bankruptcy protection, go out of business, or suffer disruptions in their business due to the COVID-19 pandemic. All of the foregoing could adversely impact our ability to meet our production schedules and otherwise operate our business and will increase our costs and expenses (which will not be covered by insurance).\nWe may experience impacts from changes in industry trends and customer orders, a recession, IT failures, including remote connectivity or limitations due to internal or external causes, as well as impacts on our workforce in any of the countries or regions where we operate. If the virus were to affect a significant number of the workforce employed or operating at any one of our facilities, or they refrain from working due to pandemic fears or illness, or they are restricted from doing so by government order or request, we may experience delays or the inability to produce and deliver products to our customers on a timely basis; and/or successfully execute upon our expansion plans in a timely and cost effective manner.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has also caused disruption and volatility in the global capital and financial markets, which may increase our cost of capital. Our stock price may also fluctuate greatly.\nTo the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of exacerbating many of the other risks described in the risk factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, in our other filings with the SEC, or in reports to our stockholders.\nGrowth Strategy and Market Risks:\nOur growth depends upon the continued growth in demand for electric vehicles with high performance lithium compounds.\nWe are one of a few producers of performance lithium compounds that are a critical input in current and next generation high energy density batteries used in electric vehicle applications. Our growth is dependent upon the continued adoption by consumers of electric vehicles, the rate of development and adoption of next generation high nickel battery technologies in some electric vehicle segments, and the rate of adoption of high performance lithium compounds. If the market for electric vehicles does not develop as we expect, or develops more slowly than we expect, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations will be affected. The market for electric vehicles is relatively new, rapidly evolving, and could be affected by numerous external factors, such as:\n\u2022\ngovernment regulations and automakers' responses (including fleet electrification roadmaps and battery technology choices) to those regulations;\n\u2022\ntax and economic incentives;\n\u2022\nrates of consumer adoption, which is driven in part by perceptions about electric vehicle features (including range per charge), quality, safety, performance, cost and charging infrastructure;\n\u2022\ncompetition, including from other types of alternative fuel vehicles, hybrid vehicles, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, and high fuel-economy internal combustion engine vehicles; and\n\u2022\nvolatility in the cost of battery materials, oil and gasoline.\nLithium prices can be volatile, especially due to changes in supply.\nThe prices of lithium have been, and may continue to be, volatile. Some of our contracts for the sale of performance lithium compounds have index-based pricing, which could provide a benefit if lithium pricing rises, or could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations if lithium pricing declines. We expect that prices for the performance lithium compounds we manufacture will continue to be influenced by various factors, including regional and global demand-supply balance as well as the business strategies of major producers and users. Certain market analysts predict a significant increase in global lithium capacity over the short and medium term. However, there is a high degree of uncertainty about the time period involved to achieve targeted output volumes, operating costs, and product quality at a level that will be qualified by customers. Further declines in lithium prices could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdverse conditions in the economy and volatility and disruption of financial markets can negatively impact our customers, and downturns in our customers\u2019 end-markets could adversely affect our sales and profitability.\nWe produce performance lithium compounds for application in a diverse range of end-products, including for batteries in electric vehicles and energy storage applications and for a wide variety of industrial, pharmaceutical, aerospace, electronics, agricultural and polymer applications. Deterioration in the global economy or in the specific industries in which our customers compete could adversely affect the demand for our customers\u2019 products, which, in turn, could negatively affect our sales and profitability. Many of our customers\u2019 end-markets are cyclical in nature or are subject to secular downturns. Historically, cyclical or secular end-market downturns have periodically resulted in diminished demand for our performance lithium compounds and have caused a decline in average selling prices, and we may experience similar problems in the future.\nWe face competition in our business.\nWe compete globally against a number of other lithium producers. Competition is based on several key criteria, including economies of scale, technological capabilities, service, product performance, quality, cost and price. Some of our competitors are larger than we are and may have greater financial resources for growth, acquisitions, expansions (including in the geographic areas where we operate), research and development and other matters. These competitors may also be able to maintain greater operating and financial flexibility. If we fail to compete effectively, we may be unable to retain or expand our market share, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We may also face potential competition from substitute materials or technologies and through backward integration, alliances, partnerships within the electric vehicle supply chain, and from other mining or resource extraction and battery materials recycling companies that enter the lithium production or recycling business. This may influence our future expansion decisions or limit our ability to expand.\nOur operating results are subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations.\nOur revenue and operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future. These fluctuations may occur on a quarterly or annual basis and are due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include, among others:\n\u2022 changes in our product mix or customer mix;\n\u2022 changes in product quality requirements and increased qualification time periods;\n\u2022 changes in product regulatory classifications;\n\u2022 changes by electric vehicle and battery manufacturers in supply chain locations and raw material suppliers\u2019 participation for those locations;\n\u2022 the oversupply and inventory levels of lithium compounds in the global lithium industry;\n\u2022 the timing of receipt, reduction or cancellation of significant product orders by customers, or the use of substitute products for lithium by customers;\n\u2022 the timing, duration and pricing terms of new customer contracts and renewals;\n\u2022 our ability to adapt to changes in technology trends affecting the lithium industry, including new manufacturing processes;\n\u2022fluctuations in currency exchange and interest rates, and inflation;\n\u2022 the effects of competitors\u2019 actions and competitive pricing pressures, including decreases in average selling prices of our products;\n\u2022changes in manufacturing costs, including energy, raw material price increases; and\n\u2022the extent to which we are required and able to purchase third-party lithium carbonate meeting necessary specifications to supplement internally produced lithium carbonate from our company-owned mineral deposits in Argentina, as purchasing from third parties (if available) leads to higher production costs and reduced margins.\nIf our operating results in one or more future quarters fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, a significant decline in the trading price of our common stock may occur, which may happen immediately or over time.\nProduction expansion efforts are complex projects that will require significant capital expenditures and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties.\nIn order to meet growing and forecasted demands for our performance lithium compounds, particularly lithium hydroxide, we intend to expand our lithium carbonate and hydroxide capacities when warranted by market conditions or long-term customer commitments. We are undergoing expansion of annual lithium carbonate production at our existing operations in Argentina in addition to seeking alternative lithium resources. Expansion projects are complex undertakings, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete these projects within our projected budget and schedule or that we will be able to achieve the anticipated benefits from them. Unforeseen technical or construction difficulties, lack of adequate water or energy, regulatory requirements (including permits), labor or civil/political unrest, community relations or logistical issues, or local hiring and procurement policies and requirements (discussed further under the below risk factor \u201cOur lithium extraction and production operations in Argentina expose us to specific political, financial and operational risks\u201d) could increase the cost of these projects, delay the projects or render them infeasible. Any significant delay in the completion of the projects or increased costs could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe development and adoption of new battery technologies that rely on inputs other than lithium compounds could significantly impact our prospects and future revenues.\nCurrent and next generation high energy density batteries for use in electric vehicles rely on lithium compounds as a critical input. The pace of advances in current battery technologies, the development and adoption of new battery technologies that rely on inputs other than lithium compounds, or a delay in the development and adoption of next generation high nickel battery technologies that utilize lithium hydroxide could significantly impact our prospects and future revenues. Many materials and technologies are being researched and developed with the goal of making batteries lighter, more efficient, faster charging and less expensive. Some of these could be less reliant on lithium hydroxide or other lithium compounds, especially if the demand for batteries for use in electric vehicles outstrips the available supply of lithium hydroxide or other lithium compounds. We cannot predict which new technologies may ultimately prove to be commercially viable and their share in the overall mix over any time horizon. Commercialized battery technologies that use less lithium compounds could materially and adversely impact our prospects and future revenues.\nWe may have difficulty accessing global capital and credit markets.\nWe expect to rely on cash generated from operations and external financing to fund our growth and ongoing capital needs. The expansion of our business or other business opportunities may require significant amounts of capital. While we believe that our cash from operations, together with borrowing availability under our Revolving Credit Facility and other potential financing strategies that may be available to us, will be sufficient to meet these needs in the foreseeable future, if we need additional external financing, our access to credit markets and the pricing of our capital will be dependent upon maintaining sufficiently strong credit metrics and the state of the capital markets generally. There can be no assurances that we would be able to obtain equity or debt financing on terms we deem acceptable, and it is possible that the cost of any financings could increase significantly, thereby increasing our expenses and decreasing our net income. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or raise adequate external financing, including as a result of significant disruptions in the global credit markets, we could be forced to restrict our operations and growth opportunities, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nOur net leverage ratio under our Revolving Credit Facility covenants may increase during the next 12 months from the date of this filing. Compliance with our debt covenants will continue to be determined, in large part, by our ability to manage the timing and amount of our capital expenditures, which is within our control, as well as by our ability to achieve forecasted operating results and to pursue other working capital financing strategies that may be available to us, which is less certain and outside of our control.\nThe conditional conversion feature of the 2025 Notes may adversely impact our liquidity or dilute our stockholders, depending on the method of settlement.\nPursuant to the conditional conversion feature of the 2025 Notes, holders of 2025 Notes are entitled to convert the 2025 Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. The conditional conversion feature was triggered during each of the first,\nsecond, third and fourth quarters of 2021, and thus holders had the option to convert all or any portion of their 2025 Notes at any time through December 31, 2021. If one or more holders elect to convert their 2025 Notes (if the conditional conversion feature is triggered again), we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share). In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their 2025 Notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the 2025 Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.\nWe may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our debt.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness, including the 2025 Notes, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be unfavorable or dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations.\nOur research and development efforts may not succeed, and our competitors may develop more effective or successful products.\nThe industries and the end markets into which we sell our products experience regular technological change and product improvement. Our ability to compete successfully depends in part upon our ability to maintain a superior technological capability and to continue to identify, develop and commercialize new and innovative performance lithium compounds for use in our customers\u2019 products. There is no assurance that our research and development efforts will be successful or that any newly developed products will pass our customers\u2019 qualification processes or achieve market-wide acceptance. If we fail to keep pace with evolving technological innovations in our customers\u2019 end markets, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, existing or potential competitors may develop products which are similar or superior to our products or are more competitively priced. If our product launching efforts are unsuccessful, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe may make future acquisitions which may be difficult to integrate, divert management and financial resources and result in unanticipated costs.\nAs part of our continuing business strategy, we may make additional acquisitions of, or investments in, companies or technologies that complement our current products, enhance our market coverage, technical capabilities or production capacity, expand our access to lithium deposits in other geographic locations, or offer growth opportunities. We do not have specific timetables for any future plans and we cannot be certain that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition or investment candidates for sale at reasonable prices.\nRecent and future investments or acquisitions could pose numerous risks to our operations, including difficulty integrating the acquired operations, products, technologies or personnel; substantial unanticipated integration costs; diversion of significant management attention and financial resources from our existing operations; a failure to realize the potential cost savings or other financial benefits and/or the strategic benefits of the acquisitions; and the incurrence of liabilities from the acquired businesses for environmental matters, infringement of intellectual property rights or other claims (for which we may not be successful in seeking indemnification). These and other risks relating to acquiring, integrating and operating acquired assets or companies could cause us not to realize the anticipated benefits from such activity and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOperational Risks:\nWe have substantial international operations and sales, and the risks of doing business in foreign countries could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe conduct a substantial portion of our business outside the U.S. (see Note 4: Revenue Recognition, in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K). Accordingly, our business is subject to risks related to foreign exchange as well as risks related to the differing legal, political, social and regulatory requirements and economic conditions (including inflation) of the many jurisdictions where we conduct business.\nChanges in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the U.S. Dollar will affect the recorded levels of our assets, liabilities, net sales, cost of goods sold and operating margins and could result in exchange losses. Our results of operations may be adversely affected by any volatility in currency exchange rates and our ability to manage effectively our currency transaction and translation risks. Foreign currency debt and foreign exchange forward contracts may be used in countries where we do business, thereby reducing our net asset exposure. Foreign exchange forward contracts are also used to hedge firm and highly anticipated foreign currency cash flows. The Argentine peso has recently declined significantly in value, and we currently do not hedge foreign currency risks associated with the Argentine peso due to the limited availability and high cost of suitable derivative instruments.\nIn addition, it may be more difficult for us to enforce agreements or collect receivables through foreign legal systems. There is a risk that foreign governments may nationalize private enterprises in certain countries where we operate. In certain countries or regions, terrorist activities and the response to such activities may threaten our operations more than in the U.S. Social and cultural norms in certain countries may not support compliance with our corporate policies including those that require compliance with substantive laws and regulations. Also, changes in general economic and political conditions in countries where we operate are a risk to our financial performance and future growth. Our sales depend on international trade and moves to impose tariffs and other trade barriers, as is happening in various countries including the U.S., could negatively affect our sales and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe and our subsidiaries are also subject to rules and regulations related to anti-bribery, anti-corruption (such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act), anti-money laundering, trade sanctions, export controls, and customs matters, including duties and tariffs. Compliance with such laws may be costly and violations of such laws may carry substantial penalties. We may also be subject to complex and time-consuming investigations or audits by governmental authorities and regulatory agencies, which can occur in the ordinary course of business or which can result from increased scrutiny from a particular agency towards an industry, country or practice. Such investigations or audits may subject us to increased government scrutiny, investigation and civil and criminal penalties, and may limit our ability to import or export our products.\nAs we continue to operate our business globally, our success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other related risks. There can be no assurance that the consequences of these and other factors relating to our international operations will not have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn particular, one of our key manufacturing facilities is located in the United Kingdom. Following a referendum in 2016, votes in the United Kingdom approved that country's exit from the European Union (\"Brexit\"). The United Kingdom formally left the European Union on January 31, 2020, subject to a 11-month transition period. Following completion of the transition period, the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union was completed on December 31, 2020. In connection with Brexit, the United Kingdom and the European Union entered into the UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement (the \"TCA\"), which is an agreement on the future trading relationship between the parties. Because the agreement merely sets forth a framework in many respects and will require complex additional bilateral negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union as both parties continue to work on the rules for implementation, significant uncertainty remains about how the precise terms of the relationship between the parties will differ from the terms before withdrawal. We derive a significant portion of our revenues from sales outside of the U.S., including from the European Union. Brexit has and may continue to introduce significant uncertainties into global financial markets, including volatility in foreign currencies, and adversely impact the markets in which we and our customers operate. Adverse consequences such as deterioration in economic conditions, volatility in currency exchange rates or adverse changes in regulation could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. All of these potential consequences could be further magnified if additional countries were to exit the European Union. While we actively monitor for developments in the discussion between the United Kingdom and the European Union and update our contingency plans, any new rules and regulation could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur lithium extraction and production operations in Argentina expose us to specific political, financial and operational risks.\nWe obtain the substantial majority of our lithium from our operations in Argentina. Our operations in Argentina expose us to the following risks, and the occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations:\n\u2022\nPolitical and financial risks that are typical of developing countries. Such risks include: high rates of inflation; risk of expropriation and nationalization or changes in or nullification of concession rights; changes in taxation policies; restrictions on foreign exchange and repatriation; labor unrest; changing political norms and currency controls; and governmental policies and regulations that favor or require us or our contractors and subcontractors to award contracts in, employ citizens of, or purchase supplies from, Argentina and the local provinces where we operate. In addition, changes in mining or investment policies or shifts in political attitude in Argentina concerning mining may adversely affect our operations or profitability. There can be no assurance that the new or future governments of Argentina will not impose greater state control of lithium resources, or take other actions that are adverse to us.\n\u2022\nRisks associated with changes in tax laws. On December 20, 2019 the Argentine Congress declared an economic emergency and introduced new export duties on hydrocarbon and mining goods (including lithium), a special tax on foreign exchange transactions, changes to taxes on bank accounts, the Argentine income tax, internal taxes and a delay in the reduction of the corporate tax rate (which was subsequently increased to 35% in 2021). Under the tax stability certificate we have with the Argentine federal government, we are entitled to reimbursement or set-off (against other federal taxes) of any amount paid in excess of the total federal taxable burden applicable to us under such certificate. However, there can be no assurance that we will seek, or be able to obtain, such reimbursement or set-off, or that there will be no other changes in tax laws.\n\u2022\nOperational risks stemming from our dependence upon mining concessions granted to us under the Argentine Mining Code. We hold title to these mining concessions in perpetuity until the deposit is exhausted of all minerals, provided that we pay annual mining fees and keep the mining concessions active in accordance with the Argentine Mining Code. Failure to pay the annual fees or to keep the mining concessions active may result in revocation of our mining concessions. In addition, Argentinian federal and provincial mining authorities retain broad discretion in the enforcement of mining and environmental regulations, including through imposition of fines or suspension of mining extraction or related water rights.\n\u2022\nRisks associated with the loss or depletion of our mineral deposit. Our primary source for lithium is our current brine site at Salar del Hombre Muerto. In order to maintain our production capabilities, we will need to replace or supplement our lithium resources there in the event our access is disrupted or lost, whether due to a natural disaster, depletion or otherwise. Although we seek to reduce dependence on this primary source of supply for lithium, there is no assurance we will be able to do so in a timely manner or on commercially favorable terms. In addition, due to the current trend of growth in the lithium industry, there is no assurance that we will be able to discover or acquire new and valuable lithium resources, or that the actual production results will match the expected results.\n\u2022\nRisks of certain natural disasters. Our lithium brines and related production facilities are located in a seismically active region in northwest Argentina. A major earthquake could have adverse consequences for our operations and for general infrastructure, such as roads, rail, and access to goods in Argentina. Our production operations in Argentina could also be subject to significant rain events, as our production processes rely on natural evaporation and a significant rain event could impact our production. In the first quarter of 2019 and the last quarter of 2021, we experienced a significant rain event in Argentina, which disrupted our production operations. We may not recover the expected volume that was lost in the last quarter of 2021 in 2022. If our brine site in Argentina were to suffer continuing, significant rain events, or if any of our operating facilities in Argentina were to suffer an earthquake or other natural disaster, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022\nRisks associated with water rights and our access to water. Access to fresh water is essential to our production operations in Argentina; we hold water use rights granted to us by provincial Argentine authorities and will need to secure additional water rights for our planned production expansion. (See Part I, Item 1 Business-Raw Materials-Water section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K). Our operations take place in a dry, mountainous region that has limited access to fresh water. The governmental authority may seek to suspend or alter our rights or the applicable water rights code may change, each of which may limit our access to fresh water. In addition, our access to water may be impacted by third-party claims (including local competitors who are expanding their own operations), over-permitting by the government, changes in geology, climate change (including the potential effects of climate change such as drought, changes in precipitation patterns, and severe weather events) or other natural factors, such as wells drying up or reductions in the amount of water available in the wells or sources from which we obtain water, that we cannot control. There can be no assurance that we will have access to sufficient quantities of water to support our production operations, either at current capacities or our planned production expansion, in the future. There is currently no specific regulation of wetlands at the Argentine national or provincial level. However, during 2020, a number of bills to regulate wetlands were introduced to the Argentine Congress and were reviewed by different committees within the Argentine House of Representatives and Senate. One was approved by the Committee of Natural Resources of the House of Representatives, but was not reviewed by the Senate. If any bill is passed, our access to water in the Los Patos and Trapiche rivers may be affected, as it could prohibit any activity in the wetlands, including the installation of any infrastructure that could modify the hydrologic regimen, the construction of dams, and mining activity.\n\u2022\nRisks associated with foreign exchange controls and restrictions. On September 1, 2019, the Argentine Government reinstated certain foreign exchange restrictions. The restrictions that may impact our Argentina operations relate to: (i) a requirement that Argentinian exporters repatriate proceeds allocated or earned abroad and convert them into Argentinian pesos within a specified time-frame; (ii) limitations on the payment of dividends and payment for services performed by related parties, which would now generally require prior written authorization from the Argentinian Central Bank; (iii) a prohibition on the purchase of foreign exchange as an investment to hedge foreign exchange fluctuations; and (iv) restrictions on payments for imported goods. These restrictions have been extended until June 30, 2022.\n\u2022\nRisks associated with local labor matters. Argentina has experienced labor unrest over wages and benefits paid to workers. In the past, the Argentine government has passed laws, regulations and decrees requiring companies in the private sector to increase salaries or maintain minimum wage levels and provide specified benefits to employees and may do so again in the future. For instance, the national government declared a public labor emergency that took effect on December 13, 2019 and that remained in place until December 31, 2021. During this period, severance compensation for dismissal without justified cause, lack of work and force majeure was to be doubled (this decree did not apply to any employees hired after December 13, 2019). While the decree has now expired, the Argentine Executive Power has implemented a similar measure providing for enhanced severance benefits until June 30, 2022. Employers have also experienced significant pressure from their employees and labor organizations to increase wages and to provide additional employee benefits. Any disruptions, labor unrest, unionization efforts or increased personnel-related expenses in Argentina could have a material and adverse effect on our business and operating expenses.\n\u2022\nRisks associated with inflation. Inflation is another risk associated with our Argentina operations. Effective July 1, 2018, Argentina was designated as a highly inflationary economy, as it has experienced cumulative inflation of approximately 100 percent or more over a three-year period. As a result of this determination and in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the functional currency of our operations in Argentina was changed from the Argentine peso to the U.S. dollar. Gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of non-U.S. dollar monetary assets and liabilities of Argentina are recorded in net earnings. We anticipate high rates of inflation to continue in Argentina.\n\u2022\nRisks associated with Argentina\u2019s economy. Argentina has been facing economic difficulty for the past several years. Since 2015, the Argentine economy has experienced a recession, a political and social crisis, and a significant depreciation of the Argentine peso against major international currencies. Depending on the relative impact of other variables affecting our operations, including technological changes, inflation, gross domestic product (\u201cGDP\u201d) growth, and regulatory changes, the continued depreciation of the Argentine peso could have a material and adverse effect on our business and operating expenses.\n\u2022\nRisks associated with civil or political unrest in our areas of operations. Civil and political unrest is common in Argentina and we have experienced protests and claims at our facilities in Argentina. Significant civil or political unrest in the areas of our operations could lead to a delay or suspension in operations or our planned expansion project, delay or loss of production, damage to our facilities, or loss of license, and could negatively impact our reputation. A delay or suspension in operations or our expansion, delay or loss of production, damage to our facilities, or negative impact to our reputation could have a material and adverse effect on our business and operating expenses. In addition, we must comply with requirements for prior consultation of communities and ethnic groups who are affected by our planned expansion project in Argentina (including for future expansion efforts). Notwithstanding our compliance with these requirements, such communities and groups may be successful in lawsuits brought against us or civil unrest may occur, potentially leading to increased costs, operational delays and other impacts that could have a material and adverse effect on our business and operating expenses.\nOur operations and suppliers may be subject to physical and other risks, including natural disasters, epidemics, pandemics, and other catastrophic events beyond our control, which could disrupt production and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe conduct large-scale lithium production operations in Argentina and own, operate and/or contract with large-scale manufacturing facilities in China, India, the United Kingdom and the U.S. Our operating results will be dependent in part on the continued operation of the various production facilities and the ability to manufacture products on schedule. Interruptions at these facilities may materially reduce the productivity and profitability of a particular manufacturing facility, or our business as a whole, during and after the period of such operational difficulties.\nOur operations and those of our contract manufacturers are subject to hazards inherent in lithium production and manufacturing and the related storage and transportation of raw materials, products such as butyllithium, and wastes. These potential hazards include explosions, fires, severe weather and natural disasters, including earthquakes, mechanical failure of equipment, unscheduled downtimes, supplier disruptions, labor shortages or other labor difficulties (including widespread labor unrest in Argentina and Chile), information technology systems outages, disruption in our supply chain or manufacturing and distribution operations, transportation interruptions, chemical spills, discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases, shipment of contaminated or off-specification product to customers, storage tank leaks, changing regulatory requirements, other environmental risks, or other sudden disruption in business operations beyond our control as a result of events such as acts of sabotage, unilateral government actions, terrorism or war, civil or political unrest, natural disasters, power outages and energy shortages, and public health epidemics. Outbreaks of pandemic diseases, such as coronavirus, or the fear of such events, have provoked responses, including government-imposed travel restrictions and limits on access to the production facilities of our contract manufacturers. Some of these hazards may cause severe damage to, or destruction of, property and equipment or personal injury and loss of life and may result in suspension of operations or the shutdown of affected facilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThere have been a number of industrial plant explosions in China during recent years that have resulted in fatalities. China is the largest producer and consumer of chemicals in the world, but regulation of, and safety standards within the industry has historically been weak and inconsistent. In light of the historical blasts, fatalities and property damage, the Chinese government has expanded inspections, implemented a computerized monitoring system to alert the government of potential accidents, shut down facilities and toughened punishments for companies that violate safety standards. Manufacturers in China have also experienced sporadic power outages as a result of electricity shortages. If any explosion, power outage or similar event were to occur at or near any of our facilities or contract manufacturers in China, or if the Chinese government were to impose new regulations limiting or suspending (temporarily or permanently) the operations of our facilities or contract manufacturers in China, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurthermore, the hazards described above could cause temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of component products from some local and international suppliers, disruption in the transport of our products and significant delays in the shipment of\nproducts and the provision of services, or negatively affect customer demand, which could in turn cause the loss of sales and customers, or could otherwise result in significant damages, threats, interruptions, or delays to our business and initiatives. Existing insurance arrangements may not provide protection for all of the costs that may arise from such events. Accordingly, disruption of our operations or the operations of a significant supplier or customer could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nSevere weather events, including the effects of climate change, are inherently unpredictable and may have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial results and financial condition.\nOur business, including our customers and suppliers, may be exposed to severe weather events and natural disasters, such as heat waves, tornadoes, tsunamis, tropical storms (including hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones), earthquakes, windstorms, hailstorms, severe thunderstorms and heavy downpours, wildfires, and other fires, which could cause operating results to vary significantly from one period to the next. We may incur losses in our business in excess of: (i) those experienced in prior years, (ii) the average expected level considered in pricing decisions, or (iii) current insurance coverage limits. The incidence and severity of severe weather conditions and other natural disasters are inherently unpredictable. Climate change may affect the occurrence of certain natural events, such as an increase in the frequency or severity of wind and thunderstorm events, and tornado or hailstorm events due to increased convection in the atmosphere; extreme heat; water shortages; more frequent wildfires and subsequent landslides in certain geographies; higher incidence of deluge flooding and accelerated soil erosion; and the potential for an increase in severity of the hurricane, typhoon and cyclone events due to higher sea surface temperatures. Additionally, climate change may adversely impact the demand, price, and availability of insurance. Due to significant variability associated with future changing climate conditions, including potential impacts on air, water and land quality, as well as impacts to ecosystems and human health and safety, we are unable to predict the impact climate change will have on our business.\nWe derive a substantial portion of our revenue from a limited number of customers, and the loss of, or a significant reduction in orders from, a large customer could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nIn any particular period, a substantial amount of our total revenue could come from a relatively small number of customers (see Note 4: Revenue Recognition, in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K). It is likely that we will continue to derive a significant portion of our revenue from a relatively small number of customers in the future. If we were to lose any material customer or if any such customer significantly reduced or delayed its orders, such loss, reduction or delay could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not satisfy customer qualification processes, customers\u2019 or governments\u2019 quality standards, and could be subject to damages based on claims brought against us or lose customers as a result of the failure of our products to meet certain quality standards.\nSince our products are derived from natural resources, they may contain impurities that may not meet certain customer or government quality standards. As a result, we may not be able to sell our products if we cannot meet such requirements. In addition, customers may impose stricter or lengthier qualification processes for our manufacturing operations (or delay any approval, which could in turn delay our plant improvement or expansion plans), stricter quality standards on our products, or governments may enact stricter regulations for the distribution or use of our products. Some of our products also have a limited shelf life, which can affect the ability of a customer to use our product and/or lead to returns and warranty claims. Failure to meet such customer and government standards could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations if we are unable to sell our products in one or more markets or to important customers in such markets. In addition, our cost of production may increase to meet any newly imposed or enacted standards.\nWe warrant to our customers that our products conform to mutually agreed product specifications. If a product fails to meet warranted quality specifications, a customer could seek a replacement, the refund of the purchase price or damages for costs incurred as a result of the product failing to meet the specification. In addition, because many of our products are integrated into our customers\u2019 products, such as lithium-ion batteries in EVs and energy storage applications, we may be requested to participate in or fund, in whole or in part, the costs of a product recall conducted by a customer.\nIn addition, we utilize third parties to produce or further process a portion of our performance lithium compounds. We endeavor to contract with third-party manufacturers that we believe are able to meet our delivery schedule and other requirements. Nevertheless, we may not be able to monitor the performance of these third parties as directly and efficiently as we do our own production facilities. As a result, we are exposed to the risk that our third-party providers may fail to perform their contractual obligations or may fail to meet the quality or other requirements of our customers, which may in turn adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs with all quality control systems, any failure or deterioration of our quality control systems or that of our third-party contract manufacturers could result in defects in our projects or products, which in turn may subject us to contractual, product liability and other claims. Any such claims, regardless of whether they are ultimately successful, could cause us to incur significant costs, harm our business reputation and result in significant disruption to our operations. Furthermore, if any such claims were ultimately successful, we could be required to pay substantial monetary damages or penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGlobal inflation, fluctuations in the price of energy and certain raw materials, and our inability to obtain raw materials and products under contract sourcing arrangements, could have an adverse effect on the margins of our products, our business, financial condition and our results of operations.\nThe long-term profitability of our operations will be, in part, related to our ability to continue to economically and reliably obtain resources, including energy, raw materials, and finished products. Our raw material and energy costs can be volatile and may increase significantly, as they are doing so now as a result of global inflation and supply chain disruptions. In contrast, we enter into contracts for our products that are often at fixed or formula-based prices or otherwise do not permit us to pass on increased costs in sale prices immediately or at all. To the extent we are unable to obtain such resources or to pass on increases in the prices of energy and raw materials to our customers, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In addition, we source a significant portion of our intermediate and finished products through contract manufacturing arrangements. An inability to obtain these products or execute under these arrangements would adversely impact our ability to sell products and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success depends upon our ability to attract and retain key employees and the identification and development of talent to succeed senior management.\nOur success depends on our ability to attract and retain key personnel, and we rely heavily on critical executive and senior management level individuals, as well as those with niche technical skills. The inability to recruit and retain key personnel, including personnel with technical skills, or the unexpected loss of such personnel may adversely affect our operations. In addition, because of our reliance on these individuals, our future success depends, in part, on our ability to identify and develop or recruit talent to succeed our senior management and other technical positions throughout the organization. If we fail to identify and develop or recruit successors, we are at risk of being harmed by the departures of these key employees.\nSome of our employees are unionized or are employed subject to local laws that are less favorable to employers than the laws of the U.S.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 1,109 full time, part time and temporary and contract employees. A large number of our employees are employed in countries in which employment laws provide greater bargaining or other rights to employees than the laws of the U.S. Such employment rights require us to work collaboratively with the legal representatives of the employees to effect any changes to labor arrangements. For example, our operational and production employees in Argentina, approximately 188, are represented by a union that must approve any changes in conditions of employment, including salaries and benefits and staff changes, and may impede efforts to restructure our workforce. In prior years, we have had to negotiate wage increases for our employees with the union because of inflation in Argentina and will be expected to do so in the future. The current four-year collective bargaining agreement in place is set to expire in 2023 and includes annual salary negotiation. A strike, work stoppage, slowdown or significant dispute with our employees could result in a significant disruption of our operations or higher ongoing labor costs.\nOur business and operations could suffer in the event of cybersecurity breaches or disruptions to our information technology environment.\nAs with all enterprise information systems, our information technology systems could be penetrated by outside parties intent on extracting information, corrupting information, or disrupting business processes. Our systems, which contain critical information about our business (including intellectual property and confidential information of our customers, vendors and employees), have in the past been, and likely will in the future be, subject to unauthorized access attempts. Unauthorized access could disrupt our business operations and could result in failures or interruptions in our computer systems and in the loss of assets (including our intellectual property and confidential business information), which could harm our competitive position, reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure, or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential information about the company, our employees, our vendors, or our customers, could result in litigation, violations of various data privacy regulations in some jurisdictions, and also potentially result in liability to us. This could damage our reputation, or otherwise harm our business, financial condition, or results of operations, and the devotion of additional resources to the security of our information technology systems in the future could significantly increase the cost of doing business.\nOur inability to protect our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nProtection of our patents, trade secrets, trademarks and copyrights, proprietary processes, methods, formulations, and compounds, the incorporation of such formulations and compounds into various products and other technology is important to our business. Although our existing processes and products may not be protected or protectable by patents, we generally rely on the intellectual property laws of the U.S. and certain other countries in which our products are produced or sold, as well as licenses and nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements, to protect our intellectual property rights. Notwithstanding the measures we take to ensure our intellectual property assets are adequately protected, there are circumstances out of our control that make result in the loss of valuable proprietary technologies. These circumstances include, the patent, trade secret and trademark laws of some countries, or their enforcement, which may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S.. If patents are issued to us, those patents may not provide meaningful protection against competitors or against competitive technologies. There can be no assurance that our intellectual property rights will not be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or rendered unenforceable.\nFrom time to time, we may license or otherwise obtain certain intellectual property rights from third parties and we endeavor to do so on terms favorable to us. However, we may not be able to license or otherwise obtain intellectual property rights on such terms or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to create a competitive advantage and create innovative solutions for our customers, which will adversely affect our net sales and our relationships with our customers.\nWith respect to unpatented proprietary manufacturing expertise, continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets necessary to develop and maintain our competitive position, while we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to protect our intellectual property, there can be no assurance that our confidentiality agreements will not be breached, that they will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets and proprietary manufacturing expertise or that adequate remedies will be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or manufacturing expertise. In addition, our trade secrets and know-how may be improperly obtained by other means, such as a breach of our information technology security systems or direct theft.\nIf we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights, our competitive position could suffer. We may also be required to spend significant resources to monitor and police our intellectual property rights. Similarly, if we were to infringe on the intellectual property rights of others, our competitive position could suffer. Furthermore, other companies may duplicate or reverse engineer our technologies or design around our patents.\nIn some instances, litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and protect our proprietary information, or to defend against claims by third parties that our products infringe their intellectual property rights. Any litigation or claims brought by or against us, whether with or without merit, could result in substantial costs to us and divert the attention of our management, which could harm our business and results of operations. In addition, any intellectual property litigation or claims against us could result in the loss or compromise of our intellectual property and proprietary rights, subject us to significant liabilities, require us to seek licenses on unfavorable terms, prevent us from manufacturing or selling certain products or require us to redesign certain products, any of which could harm our business and results of operations.\nWe have not established \u201cproven\u201d or \u201cprobable\u201d reserves, as defined by the SEC under Industry Guide 7, through the completion of a feasibility study for the minerals that we produce.\nWe have not established proven or probable reserves, as defined by the SEC under Industry Guide 7, through the completion of a \u201cfinal\u201d or \u201cbankable\u201d feasibility study for any of the minerals that we currently produce. Since we conduct operations without having established proven or probable reserves, there may be greater inherent uncertainty as to whether or not mineralized material can be economically obtained as originally planned and anticipated. In addition, we do not at present plan to conduct exploration activities or other activities to establish reserves in Argentina. Because we do not have any proven or probable reserves, there can be no assurance that a commercially viable deposit exists to support production at existing levels or to expand our production capacity in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business could be negatively impacted by sustainability and ESG matters and/or our reporting of such matters.\nThere is an increasing focus from certain investors, customers, consumers, regulators, government officials, community groups, employees, proxy advisory firms, the press, NGOs and other stakeholders concerning sustainability and ESG matters. From time to time, we communicate certain goals and initiatives regarding environmental matters, responsible sourcing, human rights, corporate governance and social responsibility, including those described in our Company\u2019s Sustainability Report as well as other disclosures. We could fail, or be perceived to fail, in our achievement of such initiatives or goals, or we could fail in fully and accurately reporting our progress on such initiatives and goals. In addition, we could be criticized, including\nthrough social media, for the scope of such initiatives or goals or perceived as not acting responsibly in connection with these matters. Our business and our reputation could be negatively impacted by such shortcomings, failings or perceptions, and this could impact employee recruitment and retention, and the willingness of customers and our partners to do business with us or our customers. Any such sustainability and ESG issues, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition, organizations that provide information to investors on corporate governance and related matters have developed ratings methodologies for evaluating companies on their approach to ESG matters, and unfavorable ratings of our company or our industries may lead to negative investor sentiment and the diversion of investment to other companies or industries.\nThe Company\u2019s business and reputation could also be negatively impacted by shortcomings, failings or adverse perceptions in ESG matters of the industries and customers we serve, as well as that of the suppliers, contractors and business partners we work with.\nRegulatory and Governmental Risks:\nOur business and financial results may be adversely affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings.\nWe are involved from time to time in legal and regulatory proceedings, which may be material. The outcome of proceedings, lawsuits and claims may differ from our expectations, leading us to change estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables.\nLegal and regulatory proceedings, whether with or without merit, and associated internal investigations, may be time-consuming and expensive to prosecute, defend or conduct, divert management\u2019s attention and other resources, inhibit our ability to sell our products, result in adverse judgments for damages, injunctive relief, penalties and fines, and otherwise negatively affect our business.\nWe, our operations, facilities, products and raw materials are subject to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, and costs to comply with, and liabilities related to, these laws and regulations could adversely affect our business.\nWe are subject to extensive federal, state, local, and foreign environmental and safety laws, regulations, directives, rules and ordinances concerning, among other things, employee health and safety, the composition of our products, the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, the usage and availability of water, the cleanup of contaminated properties (including the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as CERCLA or Superfund, in the U.S., and similar foreign and state laws) and the reclamation of our brine extraction operations and certain other assets at the end of their useful life. In addition, our production facilities require numerous operating permits. Due to the nature of these requirements and changes in our operations, we may incur substantial capital and operating costs, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe may also incur substantial costs, including fines, damages, criminal or civil sanctions and remediation costs, or experience interruptions in our operations, for violations arising under these laws and regulations or permit requirements. In addition, we may be required to either modify existing or obtain new permits to meet our capacity expansion plans. We may be unable to modify or obtain such permits or if we can, it may be costly to do so. Furthermore, environmental, health and safety laws and regulations are subject to change and have become increasingly stringent in recent years. Future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, or changes to existing laws or regulations, could require us to alter our production processes, acquire pollution abatement or remediation equipment, modify our products or incur other expenses, which could harm our business and results of operations.\nIf we violate environmental, health and safety laws or regulations, in addition to being required to correct such violations, we can be held liable in administrative, civil or criminal proceedings for substantial fines and other sanctions could be imposed that could disrupt or limit our operations. Liabilities associated with the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances, as well as personal injury, property damages or natural resource damages arising from the release of, or exposure to, such hazardous substances, may be imposed without regard to violations of laws or regulations or other fault, and may also be imposed jointly and severally. Such liabilities may also be imposed on many different entities, including, for example, current and prior property owners or operators, as well as entities that arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances.\nWe have in the past, and may in the future, be subject to claims by third parties or employees relating to exposure to hazardous materials and the associated liabilities may be material. We also have generated, and continue to generate, hazardous wastes at a number of our facilities, including our Bessemer City, North Carolina facility. Additional information may arise in the future concerning the nature or extent of our liability with respect to Bessemer City, North Carolina, and additional sites may be identified for which we are alleged to be liable, that could cause us to materially increase our environmental accrual or the upper range of the costs we believe we could reasonably incur for such matters.\nScientists periodically conduct studies on the potential human health and environmental impacts of chemicals, including products we manufacture and sell. Also, nongovernmental advocacy organizations and individuals periodically issue public statements alleging human health and environmental impacts of chemicals, including products we manufacture and sell. Based upon such studies or public statements, our customers may elect to discontinue the purchase and use of our products, even in the absence of any reliable scientific basis for such public statements or any controlling government regulation. Such actions could significantly decrease the demand for our products and, accordingly, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and profitability.\nWe manufacture or market a number of products that are or have been the subject of attention by the European Union and United Kingdom regulatory authorities. Concern about the impact of some of our products on human health or the environment may lead to regulation, or reaction in our markets independent of regulation, that could reduce or eliminate markets for such products. Our business and our customers are subject to significant requirements under REACH, which imposes obligation on European Union manufacturers and importers of chemicals and other products into the European Union to compile and file comprehensive reports, including testing data, on each chemical substance, and perform chemical safety assessments. Currently, certain lithium products are undergoing a risk assessment review under REACH, which may eventually result in restrictions in the handling or use of lithium carbonate and other lithium products that we produce, which may increase our production costs. In addition, REACH regulations impose significant additional burdens on chemical producers, importers, downstream users of chemical substances and preparations, and the entire supply chain. South Korea has a similar Act on the Registration and Evaluation of Chemicals which is known as \"K-REACH.\" Both REACH and K-REACH may lead to significant compliance costs and result in increases in the costs of raw materials we purchase and the products we sell. Increases in the costs of our products could result in a decrease in their overall demand; additionally, customers may seek products that are not regulated, which could also result in a decrease in the demand of certain products subject to the REACH and K-REACH regulations, respectively. If we fail to comply with REACH, K-REACH or other similar laws and regulations, we may be subject to penalties or other enforcement actions, including fines, injunctions, recalls or seizures, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows and profitability.\nUnanticipated changes in our tax provisions, variability of our effective tax rate, the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could impact our financial performance.\nWe operate in multiple jurisdictions, which contributes to the volatility of our effective tax rate. Our future effective tax rates may be materially impacted by numerous items including: a future change in the composition of earnings from foreign and domestic tax jurisdictions; accounting for uncertain tax positions; business combinations; expiration of statutes of limitations or settlement of tax audits; changes in valuation allowances; expiration or termination of favorable tax abatement or concession arrangements with foreign tax jurisdictions; and changes in tax law (including, without limitation, in the event of the enactment of the Build Back Better Act or similar legislation in the U.S.).\nWe have favorable tax concession arrangements with certain foreign tax jurisdictions, which provide for reduced tax rates of income tax, and in certain cases various other taxes. These arrangements are generally valid for a fixed term, subject to renewal at the option of the tax authority. In certain cases, the arrangement is subject to specified conditions which, if not satisfied, may result in the reduction or elimination of the associated beneficial tax arrangement. There can be no assurance that we will be able to renew any favorable tax concession arrangements upon their expiration, or that we will successfully satisfy the conditions required in order to retain any such arrangements. If we are unable to renew any such arrangements or if we do not satisfy the associated conditions, we may lose the benefits of such arrangements, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and profitability.\nWe are also subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions. Tax authorities may disagree with our intercompany charges, cross-jurisdictional transfer pricing or other matters, and may assess additional taxes as a result. There can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits, and the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision, net income and cash flows. If these audits result in assessments different from amounts reserved, future financial results may include unfavorable adjustments to our tax liabilities.\nRisks Related to the Separation:\nIf there is a determination that the Separation and the Distribution is taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, then FMC and its stockholders could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities, and we could incur significant liabilities.\nIn connection with the Distribution, FMC received a tax opinion from counsel that the Distribution, together with certain related transactions, qualifies as a tax-free \u201creorganization\u201d within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code (the \u201cCode\u201d) and a tax-free distribution within the meaning of Section 355 of the Code. The opinion relied on certain facts,\nassumptions, representations and undertakings from FMC and us regarding the past and future conduct of the companies\u2019 respective businesses and other matters. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are incorrect or not otherwise satisfied, FMC and its stockholders may not be able to rely on the opinion of counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities. Notwithstanding the opinion of counsel, the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) could determine on audit that the Separation and the Distribution is taxable if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings is not correct or has been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion, or for other reasons, including as a result of certain significant changes in the stock ownership of FMC or us after the Distribution. If the Separation and the Distribution is determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, FMC and/or its stockholders could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities, and we could incur significant liabilities under applicable law or as a result of the Tax Matters Agreement with FMC.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock:\nOur stock price may fluctuate significantly.\nThe trading price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and subject to wide price fluctuations in response to various factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and industry;\n\u2022\nmarket conditions or investor sentiment in the broader stock market, the end markets into which we sell our products, or our industry in particular;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly financial and operating results;\n\u2022\nour capital financing decisions and debt levels;\n\u2022\nmergers, acquisitions, divestitures, corporate reorganizations, and other strategic activity;\n\u2022\nintroduction of new products and services by us, our competitors or customers;\n\u2022\nissuance of new or changed securities analysts\u2019 reports or recommendations;\n\u2022\nsales or purchases of large blocks of our stock;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022\nregulatory developments;\n\u2022\nlitigation and governmental investigations;\n\u2022\neconomic and political conditions or events; and\n\u2022\nchanges in investor perception of our market positions based on third-party information.\nThese and other factors may cause the market price and demand for our common stock to fluctuate substantially, which may limit or prevent investors from readily selling their shares of common stock and may otherwise negatively affect the liquidity of our common stock. In addition, when the market price of a stock is volatile, certain holders of that stock may institute securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock. If any of our stockholders brought a lawsuit against us, we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit or any future securities class litigation that may be brought against the company. We have been sued by several plaintiffs in connection with our IPO. See Part I, Item 3 Legal Proceedings, and Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in this Form 10-K. The existing lawsuit and any future lawsuits could also divert the time and attention of our management from our business.\nThe trading market for our common stock will also be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. Moreover, if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock, or if our results of operations do not meet their expectations, our stock price could decline.\nSome provisions of Delaware law and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may deter third parties from acquiring us.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide for, among other things:\n\u2022\na staggered board and restrictions on the ability of our stockholders to fill a vacancy on the Board of Directors;\n\u2022\nthe authorization of undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval;\n\u2022\na requirement that certain business combinations with interested stockholders arising after the date on which no person or group owns a majority of the voting power of our common stock must be approved by the holders of at least 80% of the voting power of our common stock;\n\u2022\nadvance notice requirements for stockholder proposals; and\n\u2022\na requirement that, after such time as no person or group holds a majority of the voting power of our common stock, our stockholders may not take action by written consent without a duly called annual or special meeting.\nThese anti-takeover defenses could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and cause us to take other corporate actions than they desire. Our Board of Directors has approved the elimination of the staggered board and the supermajority voting provisions from our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and recommended that our stockholders approve these changes, but to date, we have not received sufficient stockholder support to remove these provisions.\nWe are not declaring or paying cash dividends at this time, and this may deter certain investors from purchasing our stock.\nAny future determination to pay dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors in accordance with applicable law and will be dependent upon our financial condition and results of operations, capital requirements, contractual restrictions, business prospects and other factors that our Board of Directors considers relevant. At this time, no declaration or payment of cash dividends has been made or planned.\nSPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION\nStatement under the Safe Harbor Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995: We and our representatives may from time to time make written or oral statements that are \u201cforward-looking\u201d and provide other than historical information, including statements contained in Item 1.
