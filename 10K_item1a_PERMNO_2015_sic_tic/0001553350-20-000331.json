You should not invest in our common stock unless you can afford to lose your entire investment. You should consider carefully the following risk factors and other information in this annual report before deciding to invest in our common stock. If any of the following risks and uncertainties develops into actual events, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected, and you could lose your entire investment in our Company.\nRisks Related to our Business\nTHERE ARE NO ASSURANCES WE WILL BE ABLE TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN.\nWe have incurred substantial operating and net losses, as well as negative operating cash flows, since our inception through December 31, 2019. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we reported net losses of $1,686,641 and $216,382, respectively, and at December 31, 2019 we had a working capital deficit of $2,820,926. At December 31, 2019, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $64.5 million. Our financial statements have been prepared on the basis that we will operate as a going concern; however, as set forth in the report on our audited financial statements issued by our independent auditor appearing later in this report, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. We anticipate that we will continue to incur losses in future periods until we are successful in significantly increasing our revenues, if ever, particularly in light of the adverse impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on our Company\u2019s operations. There are no assurances that we will be able to raise our revenues to a level which supports profitable operations and provides sufficient funds to pay our obligations. If we are unable to meet those obligations, we could be forced to cease operations in which event investors would lose their entire investment in our Company.\nWE EXPECT THE IMPACT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC ON OUR COMPANY TO MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN 2020.\nWe have been materially and adversely impacted by the disruptions in our business as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. Our company is located in Palm Beach County, Florida which is subject to a \u201cstay at home\u201d order. While we are able to continue limited operations as a non-consumer facing company that can fulfill orders and shipments with a minimal staff that can maintain social distancing, we have reduced production and shipments to approximately 1 day per week.\n\u00b7\nAs described elsewhere herein, we are materially dependent on revenues from a limited number of customers. Even before the \u201cstay at home\u201d order was issued, we were experiencing a significant decline in orders from our customers because of disruptions in our customers\u2019 businesses as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. In addition, as a result of our historic concentration on sales to customers in the oil and gas industry, the decline in oil prices is expected to further materially adversely impact our sales beginning with the first quarter of 2020. During the first quarter of 2020 we have also already experienced a slowdown from customer\u2019s inquiries from other industries and we expect that trend to continue until such time as the full impact of the virus is known, travel restrictions are lifted and corporate capital expenditures are normalized;\n\u00b7\nWe also expect delays in our supply chain, including delivery of raw materials and component products as companies throughout the country are affected by local quarantines and disruptions.\nWhile the foregoing are some of the immediate impacts we are witnessing, this list is not exhaustive and we are unable to predict the overall impact on our company at this time. Our loss of revenues will materially impact our liquidity, and we do not know if we have sufficient access to working capital from historic sources to continue as a going concern. Our senior management will continue to monitor our situation on a daily basis. However, we expect that these factors and others we have yet to experience will materially adversely impact our company, its business and operations for the foreseeable future.\nWE NEED ADDITIONAL FINANCING WHICH WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS. IF WE CANNOT RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL AS NEEDED, OUR ABILITY TO FUND OUR ONGOING OPERATIONS WILL BE IN JEOPARDY AND WE WILL BE UNABLE TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN.\nAs described elsewhere herein, our net sales are not sufficient to pay our operating expenses. Our capital requirements depend on a number of factors, including our ability to internally grow our revenues, manage our business and control our expenses. Historically, our operations have been financed primarily through a credit line from our Executive Chairman, as well as short-term loans from other affiliates. At December 31, 2019, we owed him approximately $9.5 million which is due on December 31, 2021. In 2017 he advised us that he did not expect to continue to provide working capital advances to the Company at historic levels, if at all. In 2019 and 2018, we borrowed additional $833,000 and $325,000, respectively from him under short term demand notes. On March 9, 2020 the Company entered into a Revolving Credit Agreement with Christian Meissner pursuant to which Mr. Meissner agreed to make a $250,000 credit line available to us from time to time until September 30, 2020. Our ability to draw amounts under the credit line is at the discretion of Mr. Meissner. On March 9, 2020 we drew an initial $100,000 under this credit line and $33,618 to satisfy our obligations under the Business Loan Agreement with Kabbage and we used the balance of the proceeds for working capital. The reductions in the amount of advances to us from our Executive Chairman have adversely impacted our operations from time to time and there are no assurances Mr. Meissner will agree to make further advances to us under the Revolving Credit Agreement. While we do not have any external sources of liquidity at this time, the Company is in continuing discussion with third parties for potential investment. These historic discussions, however, have not resulted in identifying any potential capital raising transactions which were upon proposed terms which we believed were fair to our Company and our stockholders. Given our history of losses and secured debt levels and the adverse impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on our Company\u2019s operations, we expect to continue to face a number of significant challenges in our ability to raise capital. If we do not raise funds as needed, or if we should be unable to borrow additional funds under the Revolving Credit Agreement, our ability to provide for current working capital needs, pay our obligations as they become due, and continue our existing business and operations is in jeopardy. In this event, we would no longer be able to continue as a going concern, and you could lose all of your investment in our Company.\nOUR NET SALES DECREASED IN 2019 FROM 2018 AND ARE NOT SUFFICIENT TO FUND OUR OPERATING EXPENSES.\nNet sales for 2019 decreased by 64% from 2018 and our current operations remain insufficient to fund our operating expenses and pay our obligations as they become due. We used cash in operations of approximately $945,916 and $187,222 in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our gross profit margins decreased from 41% in 2018 to 14% during 2019.The decrease in our gross profit margins in 2019 is attributable to reduced sales which is attributable to reduced facility utilization due to decreased sales and an increase in the reserve for slow moving inventory of $30,368. We are unable to predict when, if ever, our gross margins will return to 2018 levels. This significant decline in our gross profit margins further exacerbates our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWE ARE DEPENDENT UPON SALES TO A LIMITED NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS AND ONE EXCLUSIVE DISTRIBUTOR REPRESENTING THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY.\nWe are dependent upon sales to a limited number of customers. During 2019 sales from two customers represented a total of 67% of sales and during 2018 sales from four customers represented a total of 83% of sales. We do not have contracts with our customers and the loss of sales from one or more of these customers could materially impact our results of operations in future periods. In addition, in September 2017, we granted DNOW exclusive worldwide rights to sell our products in the oil and gas industry. Sales under the agreement amounted to approximately $556,302 in 2019, representing approximately 37% of our total net sales for 2019 versus $1.7 million in 2018 representing 42% of our total net sales in 2018. There are no binding obligations from DNOW to purchase a certain amount of product from us, nor to undertake any specific marketing or sales incentives related to our products. While we granted DNOW these exclusive rights because we believed its distribution network was broad enough that it could facilitate our growth in this industry, we are wholly dependent upon DNOW\u2019s sales efforts over which we have limited control. The exclusive nature of this agreement prevents us from engaging other distributors to facilitate sales of our products in the oil and gas industry. In that event, our revenues may be adversely impacted in future periods.\nOUR ASSETS SERVE AS COLLATERAL UNDER A TWO SECURED LENDING ARRANGEMENTS.\nAs described elsewhere in this report, in March 2019 under the terms of a note exchange agreement with our Executive Chairman, we granted him a first position security interest in our assets in exchange for his agreement to extend the due date of the obligations due to our Executive Chairman to December 31, 2021. At December 31, 2019 we owe him approximately $9.5 million. In March 2020, the Company entered into a Revolving Credit Agreement with Christian Meissner pursuant to which Mr. Meissner agreed to make a $250,000 credit line available to us from time to time until September 30, 2020which is secured by a first position security interest in our assets. In connection with this transaction, our Executive Chairman entered a Subordination Agreement subordinating his first position security interest to this new secured lender. If we were to default on our obligations under these security agreements, one or both of the lenders could seek to foreclose on our assets in which event we would be unable to continue our operations, even assuming such operations resume once the \u201cstay at home\u201d order described earlier in this report is lifted. In that event, you would lose your entire investment in our company.\nAT DECEMBER 31, 2019 OUR CURRENT LIABILITIES INCLUDE $1,542,423 OF DEFERRED COMPENSATION. WE DO NOT HAVE THE FUNDS TO PAY THESE AMOUNTS.\nSince 2005, Mr. Kroger, our President and COO, has deferred a portion of his compensation to assist us in managing our cash flow and working capital needs. In addition, Mr. Edward Vittoria, our CEO who joined our company in May 2018, is also deferring a portion of his compensation when necessary to assist us in managing our cash flow and working capital needs. Finally, two other former employees, who no longer receive a salary, received regular payments from their deferred compensation through May 31, 2019, after which we did not maintain adequate cash flow to continue making such payments. As there is no written agreement with these employees which memorializes the terms of salary deferral, only an election to do so, it is possible that the employees could demand payment in full at any time, elect to no longer defer their salaries, or reduce the amount they currently defer. Unless we are successful in raising additional capital, we are unable to satisfy this or any other demands by these officers and employees for full payment of these obligations, of which there are no assurances. On or about April 9, 2020 a former employee of the Company filed a complaint in the circuit court of the 15th judicial circuit in and for Palm Beach County, Florida, alleging breach or oral contract for failure to pay deferred salary, demanding relief of approximately $356,500 in deferred salary, plus applicable interests and attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. While as of the date of this filing the Company has not been served with the complaint, the Company intends to vigorously defend itself against the claims.\nIF WE ARE UNABLE TO PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS AS IT IS PRESENTLY CONDUCTED IS IN JEOPARDY.\nOur success is heavily dependent on our proprietary technology and we rely on a combination of contractual rights, patents, trade secrets, trademarks and non-disclosure agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights. There can be no assurances that the steps we take to protect our proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of the technology or independent development by others of products with features based upon, or otherwise similar to, our products. In addition, although we believe that any new technology currently in development or patent pending has been independently developed and does not infringe on the proprietary rights of others, there can be no assurance that we are correct or that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us in the future. If instituted, there can be no assurances we will have adequate resources to defend a patent infringement or other proprietary rights infringement action. If we are unable to adequately protect our proprietary rights or if other products should be developed which are substantially similar to ours, our ability to continue our operations as they are presently conducted could be in jeopardy and we could be forced to cease operations. The Company believes it will have future benefits from current patent awards and applications to the extent it has working capital to pursue those patents, of which there is no assurance, and does not regard our business as being dependent upon any single patent or group of patents that may expire in the near-term.\nRisk Related to our Common Stock\nPROVISIONS OF OUR CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND BYLAWS MAY DELAY OR PREVENT A TAKE-OVER WHICH MAY NOT BE IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF OUR STOCKHOLDERS.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may be deemed to have anti-takeover effects, which include when and by whom special meetings of our shareholders may be called, and may delay, defer or prevent a takeover attempt. In addition, certain provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law also may be deemed to have certain anti-takeover effects. Further, our certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to 500,000 shares of preferred stock with such rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by our board of directors in their sole discretion. Although, to date, we have never issued preferred stock, our board of directors may, without stockholder approval, issue series of preferred stock with dividends, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights that could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of our common stock.\nTHE EXERCISE OF OUTSTANDING WARRANTS AND OPTIONS WILL BE DILUTIVE TO OUR EXISTING STOCKHOLDERS.\nAt December 31, 2019, we had 69,016,468 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding and the following securities, which are exercisable into shares of our common stock, were outstanding:\n\u00b7\n350,000 shares of our common stock issuable upon the exercise of warrants with exercise price $0.050 per share; and\n\u00b7\n11,152,500 shares of our common stock issuable upon the exercise of options with exercise prices ranging from $0.017 per share to $0.046 per share.\nThe issuance of these shares will be dilutive to our existing stockholders.\nBECAUSE OUR STOCK CURRENTLY TRADES BELOW $5.00 PER SHARE, AND IS QUOTED ON THE OTCQB\u00ae MARKETPLACE, OUR STOCK IS CONSIDERED A \"PENNY STOCK\" WHICH CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS LIQUIDITY.\nAs the trading price of our common stock is less than $5.00 per share, our common stock is considered a \"penny stock,\" and trading in our common stock is subject to the requirements of Rule 15g-9 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Under this rule, broker/dealers who recommend low-priced securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors must satisfy special sales practice requirements. The broker/dealer must make an individualized written suitability determination for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written consent prior to the transaction.\nSecurities and Exchange Commission regulations also require additional disclosure in connection with any trades involving a \"penny stock,\" including the delivery, prior to any penny stock transaction, of a disclosure schedule explaining the penny stock market and its associated risks. These requirements severely limit the liquidity of our common stock in the secondary market because few brokers or dealers are likely to undertake these compliance activities. Purchasers of our common stock may find it difficult to resell the shares in the secondary market.\nTHERE MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY IN THE MARKET FOR OUR SECURITIES IN ORDER FOR INVESTORS TO SELL THEIR SECURITIES. THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK MAY BE VOLATILE.\nWhile our common stock is quoted on the OTCQB Tier of the OTC Markets, our common stock is thinly traded and should be considered an illiquid investment. The market price of our common stock will likely be highly volatile, as is the stock market in general, and the market for over the counter quoted stocks in particular. Some of the factors that may materially affect the market price of our common stock are beyond our control, such as conditions or trends in the industry in which we operate or sales of our common stock. These factors may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our performance. In addition, the public stock markets have experienced extreme price and trading volume volatility. This volatility has significantly affected the market prices of securities of many companies for reasons frequently unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nFINRA SALES PRACTICE REQUIREMENTS MAY ALSO LIMIT A STOCKHOLDERS ABILITY TO BUY AND SELL OUR STOCK.\nIn addition to the penny stock rules promulgated by the SEC, which are discussed earlier in this section, the rules of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (FINRA) require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative, low-priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must have reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer\u2019s financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit the ability to buy and sell our stock and have an adverse effect on the market value for our shares.", "PERMNO": 89259, "SIC": 3714, "TIC": "PFTI"}
