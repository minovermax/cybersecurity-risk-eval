Before you make an investment decision regarding our common stock, you should carefully consider the following risks, as well as general economic and business risks, and all of the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any of the following risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition and cause the trading price of our common stock to decline. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also significantly impair our business operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Our Industry:\nOur revenue has declined, we have incurred significant net losses, and we may not be profitable in the future.\nWe incurred net losses of $16.7 million and $8.7 million for 2015 and 2014, respectively. We had net income of $0.3 million and $6.3 million for 2013 and 2012, respectively. We had an accumulated deficit of $47.2 million as of December 31, 2015. In 2015 and 2014, we did not generate sufficient revenue to offset operating expenses, which may occur in future periods as well. Our revenue has declined in recent periods as a result of a variety of factors, including increased competition and the maturation of our business, and we cannot assure you that our revenue will not decline further. We expect to invest heavily in our operations to support anticipated future growth; as a result, our operating expenses will increase substantially and to be profitable we will need to increase our revenue sufficiently to offset these higher expenses. You should not consider our historical revenue growth or operating expenses prior to recent periods as indicative of our future performance. If our revenue growth rate continues to decline or our operating expenses exceed expectations, our financial performance will be adversely affected. Further, if our future growth and operating performance fail to meet investor or analyst expectations, it could have a materially negative effect on our stock price.\nOur rapidly evolving industry makes it difficult to evaluate our business and prospects and may increase your investment risk.\nWe commenced operations in 2004 and, as a result, we have only a limited operating history upon which you can evaluate our business and prospects in a rapidly evolving industry. Although we have experienced revenue growth in recent periods, it is likely that we will not be able to sustain this growth. Because the digital video advertising industry is relatively new, we will encounter risks and difficulties frequently encountered by early-stage companies in rapidly evolving industries, including the need to:\n\u2022\nMaintain our reputation and build trust with advertisers and digital media property owners;\n\u2022\nOffer competitive pricing to advertisers (including periodic discounting) and digital media properties;\n\u2022\nCompete with larger, better capitalized competitors in addressing industry trends such as programmatic buying and real-time bidding;\n\u2022\nMaintain and expand our advertising inventory;\n\u2022\nDeliver advertising results that are superior to those that advertisers or digital media property owners could achieve through the use of competing providers or technologies;\n\u2022\nContinue to develop, launch and upgrade the technologies that enable us to provide our solutions;\n\u2022\nRespond to evolving government regulations relating to the Internet, telecommunications, mobile, privacy, marketing and advertising aspects of our business;\n\u2022\nIdentify, attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel; and\n\u2022\nManage expanding operations, including our international expansion.\nIf we do not successfully address these risks, our revenue could decline, our costs could increase, and our ability to pursue our growth strategy and attain profitability could be compromised.\nOur quarterly operating results fluctuate and are difficult to predict, and our results are likely to fluctuate and be unpredictable in the future. As such, our operating results could fall below our expectations or investor expectations.\nOur operating results are difficult to predict, particularly because we generally do not have long-term arrangements with our customers, and have historically fluctuated. Our future operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. As a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. You should not rely on our past operating results as an indication of our future performance. Factors that may affect our quarterly operating results include:\n\u2022\nSeasonal patterns in advertising;\n\u2022\nThe addition and loss of new advertisers and digital media properties;\n\u2022\nOur variable and unpredictable transaction-based sales cycle;\n\u2022\nChanges in demand for our solutions;\n\u2022\nAdvertising budgets of our advertiser customers;\n\u2022\nAdvertiser cancellation of insertion orders;\n\u2022\nChanges in the amount, price and quality of available advertising inventory from digital media properties;\n\u2022\nChanges in how digital advertising inventory is bought and sold;\n\u2022\nThe timing and amount of sales and marketing expenses incurred to attract new advertisers and digital media properties;\n\u2022\nChanges in the economic prospects of advertisers or the economy generally, which could alter advertisers' spending priorities, or could increase the time it takes us to close sales with advertisers;\n\u2022\nChanges in our pricing policies or the pricing policies of our competitors, and changes in the pricing of digital video advertising generally;\n\u2022\nChanges in governmental regulation of the Internet, wireless networks, mobile platforms, digital video brand or mobile advertising, or the collection, use, processing or disclosure of device or user data;\n\u2022\nCosts necessary to improve and maintain our technologies;\n\u2022\nDiscounts on our products offered to new and existing customers;\n\u2022\nTiming differences between our payments to digital media property owners for advertising inventory and our collection of advertising revenue related to that inventory; and\n\u2022\nCosts related to acquisitions of other businesses.\nAs a result of these and other factors, our operating results may fall below the expectations of market analysts and investors in future periods. If this happens, even temporarily, the market price of our common stock may fall.\nSeasonal fluctuations in digital video advertising activity could adversely affect our cash flows.\nOur cash flows from operations vary from quarter to quarter due to the seasonal nature of advertiser spending. For example, many advertisers devote a disproportionate amount of their advertising budgets to the fourth quarter of the calendar year to coincide with increased holiday purchasing. In addition, we acquire advertising inventory on a guaranteed basis, or at a fixed price, in order to meet the anticipated increased demand in the fourth quarter. These seasonal effects have been partially masked by our revenue growth and other factors, such as episodic political campaign advertising spending. However, if and to the extent that seasonal fluctuations become more pronounced, or are not offset by other factors, our operating cash flows could fluctuate materially from period to period as a result.\nA substantial portion of our revenue depends on a small number of advertising agency customers representing a limited number of advertisers and a reduction in digital advertising purchased by those customers or advertisers could significantly reduce our revenue.\nBrand advertisers represented by a limited number of advertising agencies account for a significant portion of our revenue. A significant reduction in our revenue from digital advertising purchased by these advertising agency customers or by one or more of the brand advertisers that they represent could materially harm our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe generally do not have long-term agreements with our customers, and we may be unable to retain key customers, attract new customers, or replace departing customers with customers that can provide comparable revenue to us.\nOur success requires us to maintain and expand our current customer relationships and to develop new relationships. Our contracts and relationships with advertising agencies on behalf of advertisers generally do not include long-term obligations requiring them to purchase our solutions and are cancelable upon short or no notice and without penalty. As a result, we may have limited visibility into our future advertising revenue streams. We cannot assure you that our customers will continue to use our solutions, or that we will be able to replace, in a timely or effective manner, departing customers with new customers that generate comparable revenue. If a major customer representing a significant portion of our business decides to materially reduce its use of our solutions or to cease using our solutions altogether, our revenue could be significantly reduced. Any non-renewal, renegotiation, cancellation or deferral of large advertising contracts, or a number of contracts that in the aggregate account for a significant amount of revenue, could cause an immediate and significant decline in our revenue and harm our business.\nWe are highly dependent on advertising agencies as intermediaries, and this may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain business.\nNearly all of our revenue comes from executing brand advertising campaigns for advertising agencies that purchase our solutions on behalf of their advertiser clients. Advertising agencies are instrumental in assisting brand owners to plan and purchase advertising, and each advertising agency will allocate advertising spend from brands across numerous channels. We do not have exclusive relationships with advertising agencies and we depend on agencies to work with us as they embark on marketing campaigns for brands. While in some cases we are invited by advertising agencies to present directly to their advertiser clients or otherwise have developed a relationship directly with an advertiser, we nevertheless depend on advertising agencies to present to their advertiser clients the merits of our digital video advertising solutions. Inaccurate descriptions of our digital video advertising solutions by advertising agencies, over which we have no control, negative recommendations to use our service offerings or failure to mention our solutions at all could hurt our business. In addition, if an advertising agency is dissatisfied with our solutions on a particular marketing campaign or generally, we risk losing the business of the advertiser for whom the campaign was run and of other advertisers represented by that agency. With advertising agencies acting as intermediaries for multiple brands, our customer base is more concentrated than might be reflected by the number of brand advertisers for which we conduct marketing campaigns. Since many advertising agencies are affiliated with other agencies in a larger corporate structure, if we fail to maintain good relations with one agency in such an organization, we may lose business from the affiliated agencies as well.\nOur sales could be adversely impacted by industry changes relating to the use of advertising agencies. For example, if advertisers seek to bring their marketing campaigns in-house rather than using an advertising agency, we would need to develop direct relationships with the advertisers, which we might not be able to do and which could increase our sales and marketing expense. Moreover, as a result of dealing primarily with advertising agencies, we have a less direct relationship with advertisers than would be the case if advertisers dealt with us directly. This may drive advertisers to attribute the value we provide to the advertising agency rather than to us, further limiting our ability to develop long-term relationships directly with advertisers. Advertisers may move from one advertising agency to another, and, accordingly, even if we have a positive relationship with an advertising agency, we may lose the underlying business when an advertiser switches to a new agency. The presence of advertising agencies as intermediaries between us and the advertisers thus creates a challenge to building our own brand awareness and affinity with the advertisers that are the ultimate source of our revenue.\nIn addition, advertising agencies that are our customers also offer or may offer some of the components of our solutions, including selling digital video advertising inventory through their own trading desks. As a result, these advertising agencies are, or may become, our competitors. If they further develop their capabilities they may be more likely to offer their own solutions to advertisers and our ability to compete effectively could be significantly compromised and our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry, and we may not be able to compete successfully.\nThe digital video advertising market is highly competitive, with many companies providing competing solutions. We compete with Hulu, Google (YouTube and DoubleClick) and Facebook (LiveRail) as well as many ad exchanges, demand-side advertiser platforms and ad networks. We also face competition from direct response (search-based) advertisers who seek to target brands. Many of our competitors are significantly larger than we are and have more capital to invest in their businesses. Our competitors may establish or strengthen cooperative relationships with digital media property partners and brand advertisers, or other parties, which limit our ability to promote our solutions and generate revenue. For example, brand advertiser customers that adopt demand-side advertiser platforms disrupt our direct client relationship with those customers. Competitors could also seek to gain market share by reducing the prices they charge to advertisers, introducing products and solutions that are similar to ours or introducing new technology tools for advertisers and digital media properties. Moreover, increased competition for video advertising inventory from digital media properties could result in an increase in the portion of advertiser revenue that we must pay to digital media property owners to acquire that advertising inventory.\nSome large advertising agencies that represent our current advertising customers have their own relationships with digital media properties and can directly connect advertisers with digital media properties. Our business will suffer to the extent that our advertisers and digital media properties purchase and sell advertising inventory directly from one another or through other companies that act as intermediaries between advertisers and digital media properties. Other companies that offer analytics, mediation, exchange or other third party solutions have or may become intermediaries between advertisers and digital media properties and thereby compete with us. Any of these developments would make it more difficult for us to sell our solutions and could result in increased pricing pressure, reduced profit margins, increased sales and marketing expenses or the loss of market share.\nWe may not be able to integrate, maintain and enhance our advertising solutions to keep pace with technological and market developments.\nThe market for digital video advertising solutions is characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards and frequent introductions of new products and services. To keep pace with technological developments, satisfy increasing advertiser and digital media property requirements, maintain the attractiveness and competitiveness of our advertising solutions and ensure compatibility with evolving industry standards and protocols, we will need to anticipate and respond to varying product lifecycles, regularly enhance our current advertising solutions and develop and introduce new solutions and functionality on a timely basis. This requires significant investment of financial and other resources. For example, we are required to invest significant resources into integrating our solutions with multiple forms of Internet-connected devices in order to maintain a comprehensive advertising platform. We have periodically experienced difficulty integrating with some digital media properties. We may continue to experience similar difficulties and these difficulties will consume financial, engineering and managerial resources and we may not have the financial resources to make investments across all new forms of Internet-connected devices in the future. Additionally, Internet-connected TV is a relatively new market opportunity, from which we have realized only limited revenue, that requires us to apply financial, development, engineering and managerial resources to ensure that our advertising solutions remain compatible with technological and market developments. Similarly, ad exchanges and other technological developments may displace us or introduce an additional intermediate layer between us and our advertising customers and digital media properties that could impair our relationships with those customers. Our inability, for technological, business or other reasons, to enhance, develop, introduce and deliver compelling advertising solutions in response to changing market conditions and technologies or evolving expectations of advertisers, digital media properties or consumers of digital video advertising could hurt our ability to deliver successful digital video campaigns which could result in our advertising solutions becoming obsolete and a failure to grow or retain our current advertiser base.\nDigital video advertising is shifting, in part, to programmatic buying and real-time bidding (\u201cRTB\u201d) systems. Programmatic buying is the automated purchase of digital advertising inventory through a combination of machine-based transactions, data and algorithms. RTB, a subset of programmatic buying, is the real-time purchase and sale of advertising inventory on an impression-by-impression basis on ad exchanges. Programmatic buying and RTB are emerging and growing trends in the buying and selling of digital advertising inventory. The recognition by advertisers that an increased use of programmatic buying and RTB systems may constitute an effective way to achieve their campaign goals and cost savings, and the recognition by digital media property owners that they may achieve greater returns from an increased use of programmatic buying and RTB systems is challenging our traditional pricing model. There can be no assurance that such trends, or the acceleration of such trends, will not erode our revenue. In 2014, we introduced Video Reach, our first generation demand-side programmatic buying solution which had limited revenue impact. We have continued to invest resources in expanding our programmatic products. In June 2015 we launched YuMe for Advertisers, or YFA, which is our second generation demand-side programmatic buying solution. We recently developed and currently offer a full end-to-end video-based programmatic solution. We may be unable to successfully sell, integrate or maintain this solution and there can be no assurance that our advertising customers or our network of digital media property owners will embrace or adopt our programmatic solution. The acceleration of these programmatic trends along with the lack of customer adoption of our programmatic solutions would cause our revenue to decrease and our business to suffer.\nIf we fail to detect advertising fraud or other actions that impact our advertising campaign performance, we could harm our reputation with advertisers or agencies, which would cause our revenue and business to suffer.\nOur business relies on our ability to deliver successful and effective video advertising campaigns. Some of those campaigns may experience fraudulent and other invalid impressions, clicks or conversions that advertisers may perceive as undesirable, such as non-human traffic generated by machines that are designed to simulate human users and artificially inflate user traffic on websites. These activities could overstate the performance of any given video advertising campaign and could harm our reputation. It may be difficult for us to detect fraudulent or malicious activity because we do not own content and rely in part on our digital media properties to control such activity. These risks become more pronounced as the digital video industry shifts to programmatic buying. While we routinely review the campaign performance on our digital media properties\u2019 inventory, such reviews may not detect or prevent fraudulent or malicious activity. If we fail to detect or prevent fraudulent or other malicious activity, the affected advertisers may experience or perceive a reduced return on their investment and our reputation may be harmed. High levels of fraudulent or malicious activity could lead to dissatisfaction with our solutions, refusals to pay, refund or future credit demands or withdrawal of future business. In addition, advertisers increasingly rely on third party vendors to measure campaigns against audience guarantee, viewability and other requirements and to detect fraud. If we are unable to successfully integrate our technology with such vendors, or our measurement and fraud detection differs from their findings, our customers could lose confidence in our solutions, we may not get paid for certain campaigns and our revenues could decrease. Further, if we are unable to detect fraudulent or other malicious activities and advertisers demand fraud-free inventory, our supply could fall drastically, making it impossible to sustain our current business model. If we fail to detect fraudulent or other malicious activities that impact the performance of our brand advertising campaigns, we could harm our reputation with our advertisers or agencies and our revenue and business would suffer.\nWe depend on the proliferation of digital video advertisements and anything that prevents this proliferation, including the possibility to opt out of services and functionality, will negatively impact our business model.\nThe success of our business model depends on our ability to deliver digital video advertisements to consumers on a wide variety of Internet-connected devices. We believe that digital video advertising is most successful when targeted primarily through analysis of data. This data might include a device's location or data collected when device users view an ad or video or when they click on or otherwise engage with an ad, or it could include demographic or other data about users' interests or activities that is licensed in or acquired from third parties. Users may elect not to allow data sharing for targeted advertising for many reasons, such as privacy concerns, or to avoid usage charges based on the amount or type of data consumed on the device. Users may opt out of interest-based advertising by YuMe through the opt-out feature on YuMe's website or the Network Advertising Initiative's consumer choices website or other opt-out features that may be developed. In addition, Internet-connected devices and operating systems controlled by third parties increasingly contain features that allow device users to disable functionality that allows for the delivery of ads on their devices. Device and browser manufacturers may include or expand these features as part of their standard device specifications. For example, when Apple announced that UDID, a standard device identifier used in some applications, was being superseded and would no longer be supported application developers were required to update their apps to utilize alternative device identifiers such as universally unique identifier, or, more recently, identifier-for-Advertising, which simplify the process for Apple users to opt out of behavioral targeting. In addition, many advertising companies may participate in self-regulatory programs, such as the Network Advertising Initiative or Digital Advertising Alliance, through which they agree to offer users the ability to opt out of behavioral advertising. If users elect to utilize the opt-out mechanisms in greater numbers, our ability to deliver effective advertising campaigns on behalf of our advertisers would suffer, which could hurt our ability to generate revenue and become profitable.\nThe digital video market may deteriorate or develop more slowly than we expect, which could harm our business.\nDigital video advertising is an emerging market. Advertisers have historically spent a smaller portion of their advertising budgets on digital advertising than on traditional advertising methods, such as television, newspapers, radio and billboards. In addition, spending on digital advertising has historically been primarily for direct response advertising, or relatively simple display advertising such as banner ads on websites. Advertiser spending in the emerging digital video advertising market is uncertain. Many advertisers still have limited experience with digital video advertising and may continue to devote larger portions of their limited advertising budgets to more traditional offline or online performance-based advertising, instead of shifting resources to digital video advertising. In addition, our current and potential future customers may ultimately find digital video advertising to be less effective than traditional advertising media or marketing methods or other technologies for promoting their products and solutions, and they may reduce their spending on digital video advertising as a result. If the market for digital video advertising deteriorates, or develops more slowly than we expect, or brand advertisers prefer traditional TV advertising over our solutions, we may not be able to increase our revenue and our business would suffer.\nDue to our significant level of international operations, including our development and ad operations work conducted in India, we are subject to international operational, financial, legal and political risks that could harm our operating results.\nMost of our research and development and ad operations work is conducted in India, where we have a significant presence. In addition, we have operations in Europe, Latin America and China, and may continue to expand our international operations into other countries. We expect to continue to rely on significant cost savings obtained by concentrating our research and development and ad operations work in India, rather than in the San Francisco Bay Area. However, the rate of wage inflation has historically been higher in India than in the United States, and we may not be able to maintain these cost savings in the future. If the cost of development and engineering work in India were to significantly increase or the labor environment in India were to change unfavorably, we would no longer be able to rely on these cost savings or may need to move our development, engineering and ad operations work elsewhere. Accordingly, if we are unable to rely on these significant cost savings, we would lose a competitive advantage, we may not be able to sustain our growth and our profits may decline.\nOther risks associated with our international operations include:\n\u2022\nThe difficulty of managing and staffing international offices and the increased travel, infrastructure and legal compliance costs associated with multiple international locations, particularly labor, environmental, data privacy and other laws and regulations that govern our operations in those countries;\n\u2022\nThe challenge of managing a development team in geographically disparate locations;\n\u2022\nChanges or volatility in currency exchange rates, especially the euro and British pound sterling, which are the functional currencies for most of our European operations;\n\u2022\nPotential customer perceptions about receiving ad operations support services from India, where our ad operations team is based;\n\u2022\nLegal uncertainties regarding foreign taxes, tariffs, quotas, export controls, export licenses, import controls and other trade barriers;\n\u2022\nEconomic and political instability and high levels of wage inflation;\n\u2022\nPotentially adverse tax consequences;\n\u2022\nLegal requirements for transfer, processing and use of data generated through our operations in foreign countries;\n\u2022\nWeaker intellectual property protection in some countries; and\n\u2022\nDifficulties and costs in recruiting and retaining talented and capable individuals in foreign countries.\nAny of these factors could harm our international operations and businesses and impair our ability to continue expanding into international markets.\nExpanding our international operations subjects us to new challenges and risks.\nWe have expanded our international operations by opening offices in new countries and regions. For example, we expanded into the United Kingdom with the acquisition of Appealing Media in the second half of 2011, launched operations in Canada, France and Spain in 2012, the Nordic region and Germany in 2013, and Latin America and China in 2014. However, we have a limited sales operations history as a company outside the United States, and our ability to manage our business and conduct our operations internationally requires considerable management attention and resources and is subject to the challenges of supporting a rapidly growing business in an environment of multiple cultures, customs, legal systems, alternative dispute systems, regulatory systems and commercial infrastructures. International expansion will require us to invest significant funds and other resources. Expanding internationally may subject us to new risks that we have not faced before or increase risks that we currently face, including risks associated with:\n\u2022\nEstablishing and maintaining effective controls at foreign locations and the associated increased costs;\n\u2022\nProviding digital video advertising solutions among different cultures, including potentially modifying our solutions and features to ensure that we deliver ads that are culturally relevant in different countries;\n\u2022\nVariations in traffic access costs and margins, region by region;\n\u2022\nIncreased competition from local providers of digital video advertising solutions;\n\u2022\nLonger sales or collection cycles in some countries;\n\u2022\nCredit risk and higher levels of payment fraud;\n\u2022\nCompliance with anti-bribery laws, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Anti-Bribery Act;\n\u2022\nCompliance with foreign data privacy frameworks, such as the EU Data Privacy Directive;\n\u2022\nCurrency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u2022\nForeign exchange controls that might prevent us from repatriating cash earned outside the United States;\n\u2022\nEconomic instability in some countries, particularly those in Europe where we have recently expanded;\n\u2022\nPolitical instability;\n\u2022\nCompliance with the laws of numerous taxing jurisdictions where we conduct business, potential double taxation of our international earnings and potentially adverse tax consequences due to changes in applicable U.S. and foreign tax laws;\n\u2022\nThe complexity and potential adverse consequences of U.S. tax laws as they relate to our international operations; and\n\u2022\nOverall higher costs of doing business internationally.\nFurther expansion of our international operations may require significant management attention and financial resources and may place burdens on our management, administrative, operational and financial infrastructure. Additionally, in most instances digital media properties can change the terms and supply of ad inventory they make available to us at any time and if digital media properties increase the cost and/or reduce the supply of inventory available to us in international markets, our growth forecasts in these markets may suffer. Further, if our revenue from our international operations, and particularly from our operations in the countries and regions on which we have focused our spending, do not exceed the expense of establishing and maintaining these operations, our business and operating results will suffer.\nWe may experience foreign currency gains and losses. Changes in currency exchange rates can adversely affect our profitability.\nWe incur foreign currency transaction gains and losses, primarily related to foreign currency exposures that arise from British pound and euro denominated transactions that we expect to cash settle in the near term, which are charged against earnings in the period incurred. We have a program which utilizes foreign currency forward contracts designed to offset the risks associated with certain foreign currency transaction exposures. We may suspend the program from time to time. As a part of this program, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts so that increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset at least in part by gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts in an effort to mitigate the risks and volatility associated with our foreign currency transaction gains or losses. We expect that we will continue to realize gains or losses with respect to our foreign currency exposures, net of gains or losses from our foreign currency forward contracts. For example, we will experience foreign currency gains and losses in certain instances if it is not possible or cost effective to mitigate our foreign currency exposures, if our mitigation efforts are ineffective, or if we suspend our foreign currency forward contract program. Our ultimate realized loss or gain with respect to currency fluctuations will generally depend on the size and type of cross-currency exposures that we enter into, the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates, whether we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to offset these exposures and other factors. All of these factors could materially impact our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nOur business depends on our ability to collect and use data to deliver ads, and to disclose data relating to the performance of our ads, and any limitation on these practices could significantly diminish the value of our solutions and cause us to lose customers and revenue.\nWhen we deliver an ad to an Internet-connected device, we are able to collect information about the placement of the ad and the interaction of the device user with the ad, such as whether the user visited a landing page or watched a video. We are also able to collect information about the user's IP address, device, mobile location and some demographic characteristics. We may also contract with one or more third parties to obtain additional pseudonymous information about the device user who is viewing a particular ad, including information about the user's interests. As we collect and aggregate this data provided by billions of ad impressions, we analyze it in order to optimize the placement and scheduling of ads across the advertising inventory provided to us by digital media properties.\nAlthough the data we collect does not enable us to determine the actual identity of any individual, our customers or end users might decide not to allow us to collect some or all of the data or might limit our use of it. For example, a digital media property might not agree to provide us with data generated by interactions with the content on its apps, or device users might not consent to share their information about device usage. Additionally, we collect substantially more data from digital media properties using our YuMe SDKs instead of industry standard technologies such as IAB's Video Ad Serving Template (\u201cVAST\u201d). If more digital media property owners choose to continue to use VAST or other industry standard technologies rather than our proprietary YuMe SDKs, our ability to collect valuable data may be impaired, negatively affecting our business and revenue. Any limitation on our ability to collect data about user behavior and interaction with content could make it more difficult for us to deliver effective digital video advertising programs that meet the demands of our customers. This in turn could harm our revenue and impair our business.\nAlthough our contracts with advertisers generally permit us to aggregate data from advertising campaigns, sometimes an advertiser declines to permit the use of this data, which limits the usefulness of the data that we collect. Furthermore, advertisers may request that we discontinue using data obtained from their campaigns that have already been aggregated with other advertisers' campaign data. It would be difficult, if not impossible, to comply with these requests, and complying with these kinds of requests could cause us to spend significant amounts of resources. Interruptions, failures or defects in our data collection, mining, analysis and storage systems, as well as privacy concerns and regulatory restrictions regarding the collection, use and processing of data, could also limit our ability to aggregate and analyze the data from our customers' advertising campaigns. If that happens, we may not be able to optimize the placement of advertising for the benefit of our advertising customers, which could make our solutions less valuable, and, as a result, we may lose customers and our revenue may decline.\nIf the use of \u201cthird party cookies\u201d is rejected by Internet users, restricted or otherwise subject to unfavorable regulation, our performance could decline and we could lose advertisers and revenue.\nCookies (small text files) are used to gather data to help support our products. These cookies are placed through an Internet browser on an Internet user\u2019s computer and correspond to certain data sets on our servers. Cookies collect anonymous information, such as when an Internet user views an ad, clicks on an ad, or visits one of our advertisers\u2019 websites.\nCookies may easily be deleted or blocked by Internet users. All of the most commonly used Internet browsers allow Internet users to modify their browser settings to prevent first party or third party cookies from being accepted by their browsers. Internet users can also delete cookies and/or download \u201cad blocking\u201d software that prevents cookies from being stored on a user\u2019s computer. If more Internet users adopt these settings or delete their cookies more frequently than they currently do, our business could be harmed. In addition, the Safari browser blocks third party cookies by default, and other browsers may do so in the future. Unless such default settings in browsers are altered by Internet users, we will be able to set fewer of our cookies in browsers, which could adversely affect our business. There have also been announcements that prominent advertising platforms plan to replace cookies with alternative web tracking technologies. These alternative mechanisms have not been described in technical detail, and have not been announced with any specific stated time line. It is possible that these companies may rely on proprietary algorithms or statistical methods to track web users without the deployment of cookies, or may utilize log-in credentials entered by users into other web properties owned by these companies, such as their digital email services, to track web usage without deploying third party cookies. Alternatively, such companies may build alternative and potentially proprietary user tracking methods into their widely-used web browsers.\nIf and to the extent that cookies are blocked and/or replaced by proprietary alternatives, our continued use of cookies may face negative consumer sentiment, reduce our market share, or otherwise place us at a competitive disadvantage. If cookies are replaced, in whole or in part, by proprietary alternatives, we may be obliged to license proprietary tracking mechanisms and data from companies that have developed them, which also compete with us as advertising networks, and we may not be able to obtain such licenses on economically favorable terms. If such proprietary web-tracking standards are owned by companies that compete with us, they may be unwilling to make that technology available to us.\nIn addition, in the EU, Directive 2002/58/EC (as amended by Directive 2009/136/EC), commonly referred to as the \u201cCookie Directive,\u201d directs EU member states to ensure that storing or accessing information on an Internet user\u2019s device, such as through a cookie, is allowed only if the Internet user has given his or her consent. Because we lack a direct relationship with Internet users, we rely on our digital media property owners, both practically and contractually, to obtain such consent. Some member states have adopted and implemented, and may continue to adopt and implement, legislation that negatively impacts the use of cookies for digital advertising. Some of these member states also require prior express user consent, as opposed to merely implied consent, to permit the placement and use of cookies. Where member states require prior express consent, our ability to deliver advertisements on certain websites or to certain users may be impaired.\nOur business practices with respect to data could give rise to liabilities, restrictions on our business or reputational harm as a result of evolving governmental regulation, legal requirements or industry standards relating to consumer privacy and data protection.\nIn the course of providing our solutions, we collect, transmit and store information related to and seeking to correlate Internet-connected devices, user activity and the ads we place. Federal, state and international laws and regulations govern the collection, use, processing, retention, sharing and security of data that we collect across our advertising solutions. We strive to comply with all applicable laws, regulations, policies and legal obligations relating to privacy and data collection, processing use and disclosure. However, the applicability of specific laws may be unclear in some cases and domestic and foreign government regulation and enforcement of data practices and data tracking technologies is expansive, not clearly defined and rapidly evolving. In addition, it is possible that these requirements may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is new or inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other rules or our practices. Any actual or perceived failure by us to comply with U.S. federal, state or international laws, including laws and regulations regulating privacy, data, security or consumer protection, or disclosure or unauthorized access by third parties to this information, could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities, competitors, private parties or others. Any proceedings or actions against us alleging violations of consumer protection laws or asserting privacy-related theories could hurt our reputation, force us to spend significant amounts in defense of these proceedings, distract our management, increase our costs of doing business, adversely affect the demand for our solutions and ultimately result in the imposition of monetary liability. We may also be contractually liable to indemnify and hold harmless our customers from the costs or consequences of litigation resulting from using our solutions or from the disclosure of confidential information, which could damage our reputation among our current and potential customers, require significant expenditures of capital and other resources and cause us to lose business and revenue.\nThe regulatory framework for privacy issues is evolving worldwide, and various government and consumer agencies and public advocacy groups have called for new regulation and changes in industry practices, including some directed at the digital advertising industry in particular. It is possible that new laws and regulations will be adopted in the United States and internationally, or existing laws and regulations may be interpreted in new ways, that would affect our business, particularly with regard to collection or use of data to target ads and communication with consumers and the international transfer of data from Europe to the U.S. The U.S. government, including the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Commerce, has announced that it is reviewing the need for greater regulation of the collection of consumer information, including regulation aimed at restricting some targeted advertising practices. In Europe, the Court of Justice of the European Union recently invalidated the \u201cUS-EU Safe Harbor framework,\u201d which created a safe harbor under the European Data Protection Directive for certain European data transfers to the U.S. We had not self-certified under this regime, and therefore were not directly affected by this decision. However, stricter regulation of European data transfers to U.S. in future may impact our ability to serve European customers effectively, or require us to open and operate datacenters in the European Union which would result in a higher cost of doing business in these jurisdictions and could subject us to direct regulatory enforcement by data protection authorities in the European Union.\nThe Federal Trade Commission has also adopted revisions to the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (\u201cCOPPA\u201d) that expand liability for the collection of information by operators of websites and other electronic solutions that are directed to children. Questions exist as to how regulators and courts may interpret the scope and circumstances for potential liability under COPPA, and the Federal Trade Commission continues to provide guidance and clarification as to its 2013 revisions of COPPA. FTC guidance or enforcement precedent may make it difficult or impractical for us to provide advertising on certain websites, services or applications. In addition, member states of the EU are in the process of reforming the EU's existing data protection legal framework, which may result in a greater compliance burden for us in the course of delivering ads in Europe. Complying with any new regulatory requirements could force us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner that could reduce our revenue or compromise our ability to effectively pursue our growth strategy.\nWhile we have not collected data that is traditionally considered personal data, such as name, email address, physical address, phone numbers or social security numbers, we typically collect and store IP addresses, geo-location information, and device or other persistent identifiers that are or may be considered personal data in some jurisdictions or otherwise may be the subject of legislation or regulation. For example, some jurisdictions in the EU regard IP addresses as personal data, and certain regulators, such as the California Attorney General\u2019s Office, have advocated for including IP addresses, GPS-level geolocation data, and unique device identifiers as personal data under California law.\nEvolving definitions of personal data within the EU, the United States and elsewhere, especially relating to the classification of IP addresses, machine or device identifiers, geo-location data and other such information, may cause us to change our business practices, diminish the quality of our data and the value of our solution, and hamper our ability to expand our offerings into the EU or other jurisdictions outside of the United States. Our failure to comply with evolving interpretations of applicable laws and regulations, or to adequately protect personal data, could result in enforcement action against us or reputational harm, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition to compliance with government regulations, we voluntarily participate in trade associations and industry self-regulatory groups that promulgate best practices or codes of conduct addressing the provision of Internet advertising. We could be adversely affected by changes to these guidelines and codes in ways that are inconsistent with our practices or in conflict with the laws and regulations of U.S. or international regulatory authorities. For instance, new guidelines, codes, or interpretations, by self-regulatory organizations or government agencies, may require additional disclosures, or additional consumer consents, such as \u201copt-in\u201d permissions to share, link or use data, such as health data from third parties, in certain ways. If we fail to abide by, or are perceived as not operating in accordance with, industry best practices or any industry guidelines or codes with regard to privacy, our reputation may suffer and we could lose relationships with advertisers and digital media properties.\nWe depend on digital media properties for advertising inventory to deliver our advertising customers' advertising campaigns, and any decline in the supply of advertising inventory from these digital media properties could hurt our business.\nWe depend on digital media properties to provide us with inventory within their sites and apps on which we deliver ads. Generally, the digital media property owners that supply their advertising inventory to us are not required to provide any minimum amounts of advertising inventory to us, nor are they contractually bound to provide us with a consistent supply of advertising inventory. The tools that we provide to digital media properties allow them to make decisions as to how to allocate advertising inventory among us and other advertising technology providers, some of which may be our competitors. An ad exchange, or other third party acting as an intermediary on behalf of digital media properties, could pressure us to increase the prices we pay to digital media property owners for that inventory, which may reduce our operating margins, or otherwise block our access to that inventory, without which we would be unable to deliver ads on behalf of our advertising customers.\nIn most instances, digital media properties can change the amount of inventory they make available to us at any time. Digital media properties may seek to change the terms at which they offer inventory to us, or they may elect to make advertising inventory available to our competitors who offer ads to them on more favorable economic terms. Supply of advertising inventory is also limited for some digital media properties, such as special sites or new technologies or where there is perceived higher quality or viewability, and these digital media properties generally request higher prices, fixed price arrangements or guarantees. In addition, digital media properties sometimes place significant restrictions on our use of their advertising inventory. These restrictions may prohibit ads from specific advertisers or specific industries, or they could restrict the use of specified creative content or format.\nIf digital media properties decide not to make advertising inventory available to us for any of these reasons, or decide to increase the price of inventory, or place significant restrictions on our use of their advertising inventory, we may not be able to replace this with inventory from other digital media properties that satisfy our requirements in a timely and cost-effective manner. If we enter into fixed price arrangements or guarantees to secure inventory or significantly increase the amounts of such arrangements or guarantees, we may be unable to sell some or all of such inventory profitably or at all. In addition, significant digital media properties in the industry may enter into exclusivity arrangements with our competitors, which could limit our access to a meaningful supply of advertising inventory. If any of this happens, our revenue could decline, our liquidity could be negatively impacted and our cost of acquiring inventory could increase, lowering our operating margins.\nOur business model is dependent on the continued growth in usage of the Internet, computers, smartphones, tablets, Internet-connected TVs and other devices, as well as continued audience fragmentation as a result of this continued growth.\nOur business model depends on the continued proliferation of the Internet, computers and Internet-connected devices, such as smartphones, tablets and Internet-connected TVs, as well as the increased consumption of digital media content on the Internet through those devices resulting in increased audience fragmentation. However, consumer usage of these Internet-connected devices and resulting audience fragmentation may be inhibited for a number of reasons, such as:\n\u2022\nInadequate network infrastructure to support advanced features;\n\u2022\nUsers' concerns about the security of these devices and the privacy of their information;\n\u2022\nInconsistent quality of cellular or wireless connections;\n\u2022\nUnavailability of cost-effective, high-speed Internet service;\n\u2022\nChanges in network carrier pricing plans that charge device users based on the amount of data consumed; and\n\u2022\nGovernment regulation of the Internet, telecommunications industry, mobile platforms and related infrastructure.\nFor any of these reasons, users of the Internet and Internet-connected devices may limit the amount of time they spend and the type of activities they conduct on these devices. In addition, technological advances may standardize or homogenize the way users access digital video content, making brand-receptive audiences easier for advertisers to reach without use of our solutions. Our total addressable market size may be significantly limited if user adoption of the Internet and Internet-connected devices and consumer consumption of content on those devices and resulting audience fragmentation do not continue to grow. These conditions could compromise our ability to increase our revenue and to become profitable.\nWe may be unable to deliver advertising in a context that is appropriate for digital advertising campaigns, which could harm our reputation and cause our business to suffer.\nIt is very important to advertisers that their brand advertisements not be placed in or near content that is unlawful or would be deemed offensive or inappropriate by their customers. Unlike advertising on television, where the context in which an advertiser's ad will appear is highly predictable and controlled, digital media content is more unpredictable, and we cannot guarantee that digital video advertisements will appear in a context that is appropriate for the brand. We rely on continued access to premium ad inventory in high-quality and brand-safe environments, viewable to consumers across multiple screens. If we are not successful in delivering context appropriate digital video advertising campaigns for advertisers, our reputation will suffer and our ability to attract potential advertisers and retain and expand business with existing advertisers could be harmed, or our customers may seek to avoid payment or demand future credits for inappropriately placed advertisements, any of which could harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nAny inability to deliver successful digital video advertising campaigns due to technological challenges or an inability to persuasively demonstrate success will prevent us from growing or retaining our current advertiser base.\nIt is critical that we deliver successful digital video advertising campaigns on behalf of our advertisers. Factors that may adversely affect our ability to deliver successful digital video advertising campaigns include:\n\u2022\nInability to accurately process data and extract meaningful insights and trends, such as the failure of our Audience Amplifier to accurately process data to place ads effectively at digital media properties;\n\u2022\nFaulty or out-of-date algorithms that fail to properly process data or result in inability to capture brand-receptive audiences at scale;\n\u2022\nTechnical or infrastructure problems causing digital video not to function, display properly or be placed next to inappropriate context;\n\u2022\nInability to control video completion rates, maintain user attention or prevent end users from skipping advertisements;\n\u2022\nInability to detect and prevent advertising fraud and other malicious activity;\n\u2022\nInability to fulfill audience guarantee or viewability requirements of our advertiser customers;\n\u2022 Inability to integrate with third parties that measure our campaigns against audience guarantee or viewability requirements;\n\u2022\nUnavailability of standard digital video audience ratings and brand receptivity measurements for brand advertisers to effectively measure the success of their campaigns; and\n\u2022\nAccess to quality inventory at sufficient volumes to meet the needs of our advertisers\u2019 campaigns.\nOur ability to deliver successful advertising campaigns also depends on the continuing and uninterrupted performance of our own internal and third party managed systems, which we utilize to place ads, monitor the performance of advertising campaigns and manage our advertising inventory. Our revenue depends on the technological ability of our solutions to deliver ads and measure them. Sustained or repeated system failures that interrupt our ability to provide solutions to customers, including security breaches and other technological failures affecting our ability to deliver ads quickly and accurately and to collect and process data in connection with these ads, could significantly reduce the attractiveness of our solutions to advertisers, negatively impact operations and reduce our revenue. Our systems are vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources, including telecommunications failures, power outages, malicious human acts and natural disasters. In addition, any steps we take to increase the reliability and redundancy of our systems may be expensive and may not be successful in preventing system failures. Also, advertisers may perceive any technical disruption or failure in ad performance on digital media properties' platforms to be attributable to us, and our reputation could similarly suffer, or advertisers may seek to avoid payment or demand future credits for disruptions or failures, any of which could harm our business and results of operations. If we are unable to deliver successful advertising campaigns, our ability to attract potential advertisers and retain and expand business with existing advertisers could be harmed and our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.\nThe impact of worldwide economic conditions, including effects on advertising spending by brand advertisers, may adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur financial performance is subject to worldwide economic conditions and their impact on advertising spending by brand advertisers, which may be disproportionately affected by economic downturns. Expenditures by advertisers generally tend to reflect overall economic conditions, and to the extent that worldwide economic conditions materially deteriorate or change, our existing and potential advertisers may reduce current or projected advertising budgets and the use of our advertising solutions. In particular, digital video advertising may be viewed by some of our existing and potential advertisers as a lower priority and could cause advertisers to reduce the amounts they spend on advertising, terminate their use of our digital video advertising solutions or default on their payment obligations to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur sales efforts with advertisers and digital media properties require significant time and expense.\nAttracting new advertisers and digital media properties requires substantial time and expense, and we may not be successful in establishing new relationships or in maintaining or advancing our current relationships. For example, it may be difficult to identify, engage and market to potential advertisers who do not currently spend on digital video advertising or are unfamiliar with our current solutions. Furthermore, many of our customers' purchasing and design decisions typically require input from multiple internal constituencies, including those units historically responsible for a larger TV brand campaign. As a result, we must identify those persons involved in the purchasing decision and devote a sufficient amount of time to presenting our solutions to each of those persons.\nThe novelty of our solutions and our business model often requires us to spend substantial time and effort educating our own sales force and potential advertisers, advertising agencies and digital media properties about our offerings, including providing demonstrations and comparisons against other available solutions. This process is costly and time-consuming. If we are not successful in targeting, supporting and streamlining our sales processes, our ability to grow our business may be adversely affected.\nIf our pricing model is not accepted by our advertisers, we could lose customers and our revenue could decline.\nWe offer our solutions to advertisers based principally on a fixed-rate pricing model under which the fee is based on the number of times the ad is shown, known as an impression, without regard to immediate performance. Alternative pricing models, such as cost-per-click, cost-per-action and cost-per-engagement, have proliferated in the marketplace and may make it more difficult for us to convince advertisers that our pricing model is superior. We do not employ pricing models under which advertisers pay only if some specific viewer action is taken, for instance, clicking through to a website or installing a mobile application. Our ability to generate significant revenue from advertisers will depend, in part, on the advertisers' belief in the brand uplift and recall value proposition of digital video advertising compared to either traditional TV advertising or performance-based advertising and pricing models. In addition, it is possible that new pricing models that are not compatible with our business model may be developed and gain widespread acceptance. If advertisers do not understand or accept the benefits of our pricing model, then the market for our solutions may decline or develop more slowly than we expect, limiting our ability to grow our revenue and profits.\nFailure to manage growth properly could seriously harm our business.\nWe have experienced, and in the future we may continue to experience, significant growth in our business. If we do not effectively manage our growth, the quality of our solutions may suffer, which could negatively affect our reputation and demand for our solutions. Our growth has placed, and is expected to continue to place, a significant strain on our managerial, administrative, operational and financial resources and our infrastructure. Our future success will depend, in part, upon the ability of our senior management to manage growth effectively. Among other things, this will require us to:\n\u2022\nImplement additional management information systems;\n\u2022\nFurther develop our operating, administrative, legal, financial and accounting systems and controls;\n\u2022\nHire additional personnel;\n\u2022\nDevelop additional levels of management within our company;\n\u2022\nLocate additional office space;\n\u2022\nMaintain and improve coordination among our engineering, product, operations, legal, finance, sales, marketing and customer service and support organizations; and\n\u2022\nManage our expanding international operations.\nMoreover, if our sales increase, we may be required to concurrently deploy our advertising technologies infrastructure at multiple additional locations and/or provide increased levels of customization. As a result, we may lack the resources to deploy our advertising solutions on a timely and cost-effective basis. Failure to accomplish any of these requirements could impair our ability to deliver our advertising solutions in a timely fashion, fulfill existing customer commitments or attract and retain new customers.\nOur business is subject to the risks of earthquakes, fires, floods and other natural catastrophic events and to interruption by man-made problems such as computer viruses or terrorism.\nOur systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, fires, floods, power losses, telecommunications failures, terrorist attacks, acts of war, human errors, break-ins and similar events. For example, a significant natural disaster, such as a tornado, earthquake, fire or flood, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition, and our insurance coverage may be insufficient to compensate us for losses that may occur. Our corporate offices and one of our data centers are located in California, a region known for earthquakes and one of our data centers is located in New Jersey, a region susceptible to hurricane activity. A significant amount of our development and ad operations work is located in Chennai, India, a region susceptible to tsunamis and typhoons. In addition, acts of terrorism, which may be targeted at metropolitan areas that have higher population density than rural areas, could cause disruptions in our or our advertisers' businesses or the economy as a whole. Our servers may also be vulnerable to computer viruses, break-ins, denial-of-service attacks and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems, which could lead to interruptions, delays, loss of critical data. We may not have sufficient protection or recovery plans in some circumstances, such as natural disasters affecting California, New Jersey or Chennai, India. As we rely heavily on our data centers, computer and communications systems and the Internet to conduct our business and provide high-quality customer service, such disruptions could negatively impact our ability to run our business and either directly or indirectly disrupt our advertisers' businesses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we do not retain our senior management team and key employees, or attract and retain additional sales and technology talent, we may not be able to sustain our growth or achieve our business objectives.\nPeriodically, we experience attrition in certain key management positions. Our future success is substantially dependent on the continued service of our senior management team. We do not maintain key-person insurance on any of these employees. Our future success also depends on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled employees, particularly employees with technical skills that enable us to deliver effective advertising solutions and sales and customer support representatives with experience in digital video advertising and strong relationships with brand advertisers, agencies and digital media properties. Competition for these employees in our industry is intense and we have experienced difficulty in recruiting and retaining them. Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel also have greater resources than we have. Competition for qualified personnel is particularly intense in the San Francisco Bay Area, where our headquarters are located, and in Chennai, India, where our engineering and research and development resources are primarily located. As a result, we may be unable to attract or retain these management, technical, sales, marketing and customer support personnel that are critical to our success, resulting in harm to our key customer relationships, loss of key information, expertise or know-how and unanticipated recruitment and training costs. Additionally, our ability to achieve revenue growth in the future will depend, in part, on our success in recruiting, retaining and training sufficient numbers of sales personnel. These new employees require training in order to achieve full productivity. The timing of these activities may continue to negatively impact sales productivity. Additionally, the loss of the services of our senior management or other key employees could make it more difficult to successfully operate our business and pursue our business goals.\nIf we cannot foster or maintain an effective corporate culture as we grow and evolve, our future success could be negatively impacted.\nWe believe that fostering and maintaining an effective corporate culture that promotes innovation, creativity and teamwork has been and will be in the future a critical contributor to our success. Fostering and maintaining an effective corporate culture will become increasingly difficult as we grow and implement the more complex organizational management structures necessary to support our growth and to comply with the requirements imposed on public companies. Failure to foster, maintain and further develop our culture could negatively impact our future success.\nAcquisitions or investments may be unsuccessful and may divert our management's attention and consume significant resources.\nA part of our growth strategy is to pursue additional acquisitions or investments in other businesses or individual technologies where the acquisition fits within our strategic goals and we could complete it at an attractive valuation. Any acquisition or investment may require us to use significant amounts of cash, issue potentially dilutive equity securities or incur debt. In addition, acquisitions involve many risks, any of which could harm our business, including:\n\u2022\nDifficulties in integrating the operations, technologies, solutions and personnel of acquired businesses, especially if those businesses operate outside of our core competency of delivering digital video advertising;\n\u2022\nCultural challenges associated with integrating employees from the acquired company into our organization;\n\u2022\nIneffectiveness or incompatibility of acquired technologies or solutions;\n\u2022\nPotential loss of key employees of acquired businesses;\n\u2022\nInability to maintain the key business relationships and the reputations of acquired businesses;\n\u2022\nDiversion of management's attention from other business concerns;\n\u2022\nLitigation for activities of the acquired company, including claims from terminated employees, customers, former stockholders or other third parties;\n\u2022\nIn the case of foreign acquisitions, the need to integrate operations across different cultures and languages and to address the particular economic, currency, political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries;\n\u2022\nCosts necessary to establish and maintain effective internal controls for acquired businesses;\n\u2022\nFailure to successfully further develop the acquired technologies in order to recoup our investment; and\n\u2022\nIncreased fixed costs.\nActivities of our advertising customers and digital media properties with which we do business could damage our reputation or give rise to legal claims against us.\nWe do not monitor or have the ability to control whether our advertising customers' advertising of their products and solutions complies with federal, state, local and foreign laws. Failure of our advertising customers to comply with federal, state, local or foreign laws or our policies could damage our reputation and expose us to liability under these laws. We may also be liable to third parties for content in the ads we deliver if the content involved violates copyrights, trademarks or other intellectual property rights of third parties or if the content is defamatory, unfair and deceptive, or otherwise in violation of applicable laws. A third party or regulatory authority may file a claim against us even if our advertising customer has represented that its ads are lawful and that they have the right to use any copyrights, trademarks or other intellectual property included in an ad. Any of these claims could be costly and time-consuming to defend and could also hurt our reputation within the advertising industry. Further, if we are exposed to legal liability, we could be required to pay substantial fines or penalties, redesign our business methods, discontinue some of our solutions or otherwise expend significant resources. Similarly, we do not monitor or have the ability to control whether digital media property owners with which we do business are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, or intellectual property rights of others, and their failure to do so could expose us to legal liability. Third parties may claim that we should be liable to them for content on digital media properties if the content violates copyrights, trademarks or other intellectual property rights of third parties or if the content is defamatory, unfair and deceptive, or otherwise in violation of applicable laws or other brand protection measures. These risks become more pronounced as the digital video industry shifts to programmatic buying.\nOur software could be susceptible to errors, defects, or unintended performance problems that could result in loss of reputation, lost inventory or liability.\nWe develop and offer complex software that is embedded by digital media properties in devices, video technologies, software and operating systems. Complex software often contains defects, particularly when first introduced or when new versions are released. Determining whether our software has defects may occur after versions are released into the market and distributed to digital media properties. Defects, errors or unintended performance problems with our software could unintentionally jeopardize the performance of digital media properties' products. This could result in injury to our reputation, loss of revenue, diversion of development and technical resources, increased insurance costs and increased warranty costs. If our software contains any undetected defects, errors or unintended performance problems, digital media properties may refuse to embed our software into their products and we may be unable to collect data or acquire advertising inventory from digital media properties. These defects, errors and unintended performance problems could also result in product liability or warranty claims. Although we attempt to reduce the risk of losses resulting from these claims through warranty disclaimers and limitation of liability clauses in our agreements, these contractual provisions may not be enforceable in every instance. Furthermore, although we maintain errors and omissions insurance, this insurance may not adequately cover these claims. If a court refused to enforce the liability-limiting provisions of our contracts for any reason, or if liabilities arose that were not contractually limited or adequately covered by insurance, our business could be materially harmed.\nOur inability to use software licensed from third parties, or our use of open source software under license terms that interfere with our proprietary rights, could disrupt our business.\nOur technologies incorporate software licensed from third parties, including some software, known as open source software, which we use without charge. Although we monitor our use of open source software, the terms of many open source licenses to which we are subject have not been interpreted by U.S. or foreign courts, and there is a risk that these licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to provide our solutions to our customers. In the future, we could be required to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our solutions, which licenses may not be available on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. Alternatively, we may need to re-engineer our solutions or discontinue use of portions of the functionality provided by our solutions. In addition, the terms of open source software licenses may require us to provide software that we develop using this software to others on unfavorable license terms. Further, if a digital media property owner who embeds our software in their devices, video technologies, software and operating systems incorporates open source software into its software and our software is integrated with such open source software in the final product, we could, under some circumstances, be required to disclose the source code to our software. While we carefully monitor the use of all open source software and try to ensure that no open source software is used in such a way as to require us to disclose the source code to our software, such use could inadvertently occur. Our inability to use third party software or the requirement to disclose the source code to our software could result in disruptions to our business, or delays in the development of future offerings or enhancements of existing offerings, which could impair our business.\nSoftware and components that we incorporate into our advertising solutions may contain errors or defects, which could harm our reputation and hurt our business.\nWe use a combination of custom and third party software, including open source software, in building our advertising solutions. Although we test software before incorporating it into our solutions, we cannot guarantee that all of the third party technologies that we incorporate will not contain errors, bugs or other defects. We continue to launch enhancements to our advertising solutions, and we cannot guarantee any of these enhancements will be free from these kinds of defects. If errors or other defects occur in technologies that we utilize in our advertising solutions, it could result in damage to our reputation and losses in revenue, and we could be required to spend significant amounts of additional research and development resources to fix any problems.\nOur failure to protect our intellectual property rights could diminish the value of our solutions, weaken our competitive position and reduce our revenue.\nWe regard the protection of our intellectual property, which includes patents and patent applications, trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks and domain names, as critical to our success. We strive to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on federal, state and common law rights, as well as contractual restrictions. We enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and confidentiality agreements with parties with whom we conduct business in order to limit access to, and disclosure and use of, our proprietary information. However, these contractual arrangements and the other steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not prevent the misappropriation of our proprietary information or deter independent development of similar technologies by others.\nIn the United States, we have 11 patents issued, 16 non-provisional patent applications pending and one provisional patent application pending. We also have 38 foreign and seven international patent applications pending. There can be no assurance that our patent applications will be approved, that any patents issued will adequately protect our intellectual property, or that these patents will not be challenged by third parties or found to be invalid or unenforceable. We have eight registered trademarks in the United States, 30 registered trademarks in foreign jurisdictions and are also pursuing the registration of additional trademarks and service marks in the United States and in locations outside the United States. Effective trade secret, copyright, trademark and patent protection is expensive to develop and maintain, both in terms of initial and ongoing registration requirements and the costs of defending our rights. We may be required to protect our intellectual property in an increasing number of jurisdictions, a process that is expensive and may not be successful or which we may not pursue in every location. We may, over time, increase our investment in protecting our intellectual property through additional patent filings that could be expensive and time-consuming.\nMonitoring unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult and costly. Our efforts to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our intellectual property. We may not be able to detect unauthorized use of, or take appropriate steps to enforce, our intellectual property rights. Further, our competitors may independently develop technologies that are similar to ours but which avoids the scope of our intellectual property rights. In addition, the laws of many countries, such as China and India, do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of European countries and the United States. Further, the laws in the United States and elsewhere change rapidly, and any future changes could adversely affect us and our intellectual property. Our failure to meaningfully protect our intellectual property could result in competitors offering solutions that incorporate our most technologically advanced features, which could seriously reduce demand for our advertising solutions. In addition, we may in the future need to initiate infringement claims or litigation. Litigation, whether we are a plaintiff or a defendant, can be expensive, time-consuming and may divert the efforts of our technical staff and managerial personnel, which could harm our business, whether or not the litigation results in a determination that is unfavorable to us. In addition, litigation is inherently uncertain, and thus we may not be able to stop our competitors from infringing our intellectual property rights.\nWe could incur substantial costs and disruption to our business as a result of any claim of infringement of another party's intellectual property rights, which could harm our business and operating results.\nIn recent years, there has been significant litigation in the United States over patents and other intellectual property rights. From time to time, we face allegations that we or customers who use our products have infringed the trademarks, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties, including allegations made by our competitors or by non-practicing entities. We cannot predict whether assertions of third party intellectual property rights or claims arising from these assertions will substantially harm our business and operating results. If we are forced to defend any infringement claims, whether they are with or without merit or are ultimately determined in our favor, we may face costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel. Some of our competitors have substantially greater resources than we do and are able to sustain the cost of complex intellectual property litigation to a greater extent and for longer periods of time than we could. Furthermore, an adverse outcome of a dispute may require us: to pay damages, potentially including treble damages and attorneys' fees, if we are found to have willfully infringed a party's patent or other intellectual property rights; to cease making, licensing or using products that are alleged to incorporate or make use of the intellectual property of others; to expend additional development resources to redesign our products; and to enter into potentially unfavorable royalty or license agreements in order to obtain the rights to use necessary technologies. Royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may be unavailable on terms acceptable to us, or at all. In any event, we may need to license intellectual property which would require us to pay royalties or make one-time payments. Even if these matters do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor or without significant cash settlements, the time and resources necessary to resolve them could harm our business, operating results, financial condition and reputation.\nIn addition, if our advertising customers do not own the copyright for advertising content included in their advertisements or if digital media property owners do not own the copyright for content to the digital media next to which the advertisements appear, advertisers and digital media properties could receive complaints from copyright owners, which could harm our reputation and our business.\nIf we fail to establish and maintain effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis could be impaired.\nPrior to the initial public offering of our common stock on August 7, 2013 our (\u201cIPO\u201d), we were a private company and were not required to test our internal controls on a systematic basis. In addition, we had limited accounting personnel and other resources with which to address our internal controls. As a public company we are required to evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and, beginning with our 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 10, 2015, to provide a management report on our internal control over financial reporting. This requires that we incur substantial internal costs to maintain and expand our accounting and finance functions and that we expend significant management efforts.\nWe have had significant operations both in the United States and India and we have expanded into Europe, Latin America and China. Historically, we have had separate systems of internal controls covering our international operations, which may have included control deficiencies. We are in the process of consolidating these systems and remediating any control deficiencies, and we may experience difficulties with the consolidation that could harm our operations and cause our business to suffer.\nWe may in the future discover areas of our internal controls that need improvement. Our internal control over financial reporting will not prevent or detect all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system's objectives will be met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud will be detected.\nIf we are unable to maintain proper and effective internal controls, we may not be able to produce timely and accurate financial statements, and we or our independent registered public accounting firm may conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective. If that were to happen, the market price of our stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the stock exchange on which our common stock is listed, the SEC or other regulatory authorities.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the \u201cJOBS Act\u201d). As an emerging growth company we are not required to obtain auditor attestation of our reporting on internal control over financial reporting, we have reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and we are not required to hold nonbinding advisory votes on executive compensation. We cannot predict whether investors will find our common stock less attractive as a result of our reliance on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nWe will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of: the end of the fiscal year in which the market value of the shares of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of June 30, the end of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenue of $1.0 billion, the date on which we issue more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt in a three-year period, or August 2018.\nWe have incurred and will continue to incur significantly increased costs and devote substantial management time as a result of operating as a public company.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. For example, we are and will continue to be subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and are required to comply with the applicable requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, as well as rules and regulations subsequently implemented by the SEC and the New York Stock Exchange, including the establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and changes in corporate governance practices. Compliance with these requirements has increased our legal and financial compliance costs and has made some activities more time consuming and costly, while also diverting management attention. In particular, we expect to continue to incur significant expenses and devote substantial management effort toward ensuring compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which will increase when we are no longer an emerging growth company as defined by the JOBS Act.\nOperating as a public company has made it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance. As a public company, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified people to serve on our board of directors, our board committees or as executive officers.\nWe may need additional capital in the future to meet our financial obligations and to pursue our business objectives. Additional capital may not be available on favorable terms, or at all, which could compromise our ability to meet our financial obligations and grow our business.\nWhile we anticipate that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months, we may need to raise additional capital to fund operations in the future or to finance acquisitions. If we seek to raise additional capital in order to meet various objectives, including developing existing or future technologies and solutions, increasing working capital, acquiring businesses, expanding geographically and responding to competitive pressures, capital may not be available on favorable terms or may not be available at all. Lack of sufficient capital resources could significantly limit our ability to take advantage of business and strategic opportunities. Any additional capital raised through the sale of equity or debt securities with an equity component would dilute our stock ownership. If adequate additional funds are not available, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate material parts of our business strategy, including potential additional acquisitions or the continued development of new or existing technologies or solutions and geographic expansion.\nOur net operating loss carryforwards may expire unutilized or underutilized, which could prevent us from offsetting future taxable income.\nWe may be limited in the portion of net operating loss carryforwards that we can use in the future to offset taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes, including any limitations that may be imposed under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code as a result of our IPO. At December 31, 2015, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of $23.5 million, which expire at various dates beginning in 2025. At December 31, 2015 had state and local net operating loss carryforwards of $20.5 million, which expire beginning in 2016. Our gross state net operating loss carryforwards are separate from our federal net operating loss carryforwards and expire over various periods beginning in 2016, based on individual state tax law.\nWe periodically assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our net deferred tax assets. We consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, including historical levels of income, expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible profits. As a result of this analysis of all available evidence, both positive and negative, we concluded that a full valuation allowance against our net U.S. deferred tax assets should be applied as of December 31, 2015. To the extent we determine that all or a portion of our valuation allowance is no longer necessary, we will recognize an income tax benefit in the period this determination is made for the reversal of the valuation allowance. Once the valuation allowance is eliminated or reduced, its reversal will no longer be available to offset our current tax provision. These events could have a material impact on our reported results of operations.\nIf the market price of our common stock sustains additional declines, our investments in recorded goodwill could be impaired.\nAs of December 31, 2015 goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet totaled $3.9 million. In light of the decline in the market price of our common stock during the third quarter of 2015, we performed an interim goodwill impairment test as of September 30, 2015. Based on the results of that test, we determined that the goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet was not impaired. However, if the market price of our common stock experiences further and sustained declines from current levels, or if other events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of YuMe below its respective carrying value, all or a portion of the $3.9 million of goodwill may be impaired in future periods. Other events or circumstances that could reduce the fair value of YuMe include (i) an adverse change in macroeconomic conditions; (ii) negative changes in the advertising technology market; (iii) increased cost factors that have a negative effect on our earnings and cash flows; (iv) negative or overall declining financial performance compared with our actual or projected results of relevant prior periods; and (v) other events such as changes in our management, or other key personnel, our strategy, or our customers. Any impairment charges that we may incur in the future could be material to our results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock:\nAn active trading market for our common stock may not be sustained and investors may not be able to resell their shares at or above the price at which they purchased them.\nWe have a limited history as a public company. An active trading market for our shares may not be sustained. In the absence of an active trading market for our common stock, investors may not be able to sell their common stock at or above the price they paid or at the time that they would like to sell. In addition, an inactive market may impair our ability to raise capital by selling shares and may impair our ability to acquire other companies or technologies by using our shares as consideration, which, in turn, could harm our business.\nThe trading price of the shares of our common stock is likely to remain volatile, and purchasers of our common stock could incur substantial losses.\nOur stock price has been and is likely to remain volatile. Since shares of our common stock were sold in our initial public offering in August 2013 at a price of $9.00 per share, our stock price has ranged from $2.35 to $12.08 through February 29, 2016. The stock market in general and the market for technology companies in particular have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. As a result of this volatility, investors may not be able to sell their common stock at or above the price paid for the shares. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including:\n\u2022\nActual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results;\n\u2022\nChanges in financial estimates by us or by any securities analysts who might cover our stock;\n\u2022\nConditions or trends in our industry;\n\u2022\nStock market price and volume fluctuations of other publicly traded companies and, in particular, those that operate in the advertising, Internet or media industries;\n\u2022\nAnnouncements by us or our competitors of new product or service offerings, significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships or divestitures;\n\u2022\nAnnouncements of investigations or regulatory scrutiny of our operations or lawsuits filed against us;\n\u2022\nCapital commitments;\n\u2022 Business disruption and costs related to stockholder activism;\n\u2022\nAdditions or departures of key personnel; and\n\u2022\nSales of our common stock, including sales by our directors and officers or specific stockholders.\nIn addition, in the past, stockholders have initiated class action lawsuits against technology companies following periods of volatility in the market prices of these companies' stock. If litigation is instituted against us, we could incur substantial costs and divert management's attention and resources.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock is likely to respond to the presence or absence of equity research published about us and our business, and to the content of any such research. If no or few equity research analysts elect to provide research coverage of our common stock, the lack of research coverage may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. The price of our stock could decline if one or more equity research analysts downgrade our stock or issue other unfavorable commentary or research. If one or more equity research analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nA sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time. This could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well.\nWe had approximately 34.5 million shares of common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2015. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time. If our stockholders sell, or the market perceives that our stockholders intend to sell, substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly.\nAs of December 31, 2015, approximately 10.1 million shares of common stock subject to options or other equity awards issued or reserved for future issuance under our equity incentive plans have been registered under registration statements on Form S-8 and, subject to grants, vesting arrangements and exercise of options and the restrictions of Rule 144 in the case of our affiliates, may become available for sale in the public market.\nAdditionally, the holders of an aggregate of approximately 5.3 million shares of common stock have rights, subject to some conditions, to require us to file one or more registration statements covering their shares or to include their shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other stockholders. If we were to register these shares for resale, they could be freely sold in the public market. Further, the stockholders may decide to sell such shares without registration. If these additional shares are sold, or if it is perceived that they will be sold, in the public market, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nProvisions in our corporate charter documents and under Delaware law may prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to change our management and hinder efforts to acquire a controlling interest in us, and the market price of our common stock may be lower as a result.\nThere are provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws that may make it difficult for a third party to acquire, or attempt to acquire, control of our company, even if a change in control was considered favorable by you and other stockholders. For example, our board of directors has the authority to issue shares of preferred stock, and to fix the price, rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of the preferred stock without any further vote or action by our stockholders. The issuance of shares of preferred stock may delay or prevent a change in control transaction. As a result, the market price of our common stock and the voting and other rights of our stockholders may be adversely affected. An issuance of shares of preferred stock may result in the loss of voting control to other stockholders.\nOur charter documents also contain other provisions that could have an anti-takeover effect, including that our board of directors is divided into three classes with staggered three-year terms and stockholders are not be able to remove directors other than for cause, take actions by written consent or call a special meeting of stockholders. In addition, stockholders are required to give advance notice to nominate directors or submit proposals for consideration at stockholder meetings.\nIn addition, we are subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which regulates corporate acquisitions by prohibiting Delaware corporations from engaging in specified business combinations with particular stockholders of those companies. These provisions could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control transaction. They could also have the effect of discouraging others from making tender offers for our common stock, including transactions that may be in your best interests. These provisions may also prevent changes in our management or limit the price that investors are willing to pay for our stock.\nConcentration of ownership of our common stock among our existing executive officers, directors and principal stockholders may prevent new investors from influencing significant corporate decisions.\nOur executive officers, directors and current beneficial owners of 5% or more of our common stock and their respective affiliates, in aggregate, beneficially own approximately 49% of our outstanding common stock. These persons, acting together, are able to significantly influence all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election and removal of directors and any merger or other significant corporate transactions. The interests of this group of stockholders may not coincide with our interests or the interests of other stockholders.\nActions of activist stockholders against us could be disruptive and costly and the possibility that activist stockholders may wage proxy contests or gain representation on or control of our Board of Directors could cause uncertainty about the strategic direction of our business.\nStockholders may from time to time engage in proxy solicitations, advance stockholder proposals or board nominations or otherwise attempt to effect changes, assert influence or acquire some level of control over us. While our Board of Directors and management team strive to maintain constructive, ongoing communications with all of the Company\u2019s stockholders, including activist stockholders, and welcomes their views and opinions with the goal of enhancing value for all stockholders, including any suggestions they may have for enhancing the depth and breadth of our Board, activist campaigns that contest, or conflict with, our strategic direction or seek changes in the composition of our Board could have an adverse effect on us because:\n\u2022\nResponding to proxy contests and other actions by activist stockholders can disrupt our operations, be costly and time-consuming, and divert the attention of our Board and senior management from the pursuit of business strategies, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition;\n\u2022\nPerceived uncertainties as to our future direction as a result of changes to the composition of our Board may lead to the perception of a change in the direction of the business, instability or lack of continuity which may be exploited by our competitors, cause concern to our current or potential clients, may result in the loss of potential business opportunities and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners;\n\u2022\nThese types of actions could cause significant fluctuations in our stock price based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business; and\n\u2022\nIf individuals are elected to our Board with a specific agenda, it may adversely affect our ability to effectively implement our business strategy and create additional value for our stockholders.\nBecause we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future, capital appreciation, if any, will be your sole source of gains.\nWe have not declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock to date. We currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business. In addition, the terms of any existing or future debt agreements may preclude us from paying dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.", "PERMNO": 14087, "SIC": 7310, "TIC": "YUME"}
