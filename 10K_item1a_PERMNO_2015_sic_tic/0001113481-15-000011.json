You should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below in addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could fall. In addition to the risk factors identified under the captions below, the operation and results of our business are subject to risks and uncertainties identified elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as general risks and uncertainties such as those relating to general economic conditions and demand in the market for our products.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Results\nOur business is very dependent on the commercial success of Angiomax. If Angiomax does not continue to generate significant revenues, our business may be materially harmed.\nAngiomax has accounted for substantially all of our revenue since we began selling this product in 2001. We expect revenue from Angiomax to continue to account for the significant majority of our revenue in 2015. The commercial success of Angiomax depends upon:\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain market exclusivity for Angiomax in the United States through the enforcement of the \u2018727 patent and the \u2018343 patent during the period following the expiration of the patent term of the \u2018404 patent on December 15, 2014 and the six month pediatric exclusivity on June 15, 2015 through at least May 1, 2019, the date on which we agreed APP may sell a generic version of Angiomax. If we lose our appeal of the adverse court decision we received in our patent infringement litigation with Hospira or if Mylan prevails in its appeal of the court decision we received in our patent infringement litigation with Mylan, or if we receive an adverse decision in any other patent infringement litigation relating to the \u2018727 patent or the \u2018343 patent, Angiomax could be subject to generic competition prior to May 1, 2019, and possibly as early as June 15, 2015;\n\u2022\nthe continued acceptance by regulators, physicians, patients and other key decision-makers of Angiomax as a safe, therapeutic and cost-effective alternative to heparin and other products used in current practice or currently being developed;\n\u2022\nour ability to further develop Angiomax and obtain marketing approval of Angiomax for use in additional patient populations and the clinical data we generate to support expansion of the product label;\n\u2022\nthe overall number of PCI procedures performed;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our third-party supply and manufacturing partners to provide us with sufficient quantities of Angiomax;\n\u2022\nthe impact of competition from existing competitive products and from competitive products that may be approved in the future;\n\u2022\nthe continued safety and efficacy of Angiomax;\n\u2022\nto what extent and in what amount government and third-party payers cover or reimburse for the costs of Angiomax; and\n\u2022\nour success and the success of our international distributors in selling and marketing Angiomax in Europe and in other countries outside the United States, particularly in light of the expiration of our principal patents covering Angiomax in Europe in 2015.\nWe continue to develop Angiomax for use in additional patient populations, including patients with structural heart disease, patients undergoing PEI. We may not be successful in developing Angiomax and obtaining marketing approval of Angiomax for these additional patient populations. However, even if we are successful in obtaining approval for the use of Angiomax in additional patient populations, our ability to sell Angiomax for use in these additional patient populations may not result in higher revenue or income on a continuing basis.\nAs of December 31, 2014, our inventory of Angiomax was $68.3 million, and we had inventory-related purchase commitments totaling $20.1 million for 2015 and no commitments for 2016 for Angiomax bulk drug substance. If sales of Angiomax were to decline, we could be required to make an allowance for excess or obsolete inventory, increase our accrual for product returns or increase our deferred tax valuation allowance, or we could incur other costs related to operating our business, each of which could negatively impact our results of operations and our financial condition.\nDepending upon our success in obtaining regulatory approvals, we may commercially launch and commence sales of up to five of our products and products in development in the United States by the end of 2015. If we are not successful with the commercial launches of these products and products in development or experience significant delays in doing so, our business likely would be materially harmed.\nWe commercially launched Orbactiv in the United States in October 2014 and plan to launch PreveLeak in the United States in 2015. Subject to receiving approval of regulatory submissions that we have made for cangrelor, IONSYS, Raplixa and RPX-602, we plan to commercially launch these registration stage product candidates in the United States by the end of 2015. We may also commercially launch or relaunch by ourselves or through arrangements with third parties up to five of our products and products in development in Europe by the end of 2015, subject to receiving regulatory approval. The commercial launches of this number of products in such a short period of time will require significant efforts from us and the devotion of substantial resources as we will need to finalize regulatory submissions, work with regulatory authorities in their evaluation of our submissions, have manufactured sufficient quantities of product to commence commercial sales and establish the commercial infrastructure necessary to commercially launch these products and products in development.\nOur ability to successfully commercially launch these products and products in development will depend on our ability to:\n\u2022\nmake regulatory submissions and obtain regulatory approvals in the timeframes anticipated;\n\u2022\ntrain our existing sales force to market and sell the products that are to be sold by it;\n\u2022\ntrain, deploy and support a qualified sales force to market and sell Orbactiv, Minocin IV and other infectious disease products;\n\u2022\nsecure formulary approvals at our hospital customers;\n\u2022\nhave third parties manufacture the products in sufficient quantities;\n\u2022\nimplement and maintain agreements with wholesalers, distributors and group purchasing organizations;\n\u2022\nreceive adequate levels of coverage and reimbursement for these products from governments and third-party payers;\n\u2022\ndevelop and execute marketing and sales strategies and programs for the products.\nWe expect that the revenues from these products and products in development will represent a significant portion of our revenues in the future, particularly if and when Angiomax becomes subject to generic competition. As a result, if we are unable to successfully commercialize these products and products in development, our business, results of operations and financial condition likely would be materially harmed.\nWe may need to raise additional capital. If we are unable to obtain such capital on favorable terms or at all, we may not be able to execute on our business plans and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe expect to devote substantial financial resources to our research and development efforts, clinical trials, nonclinical and preclinical studies and regulatory approvals and to our commercialization and manufacturing programs associated with our products and our products in development. We also will require cash to pay interest on the $275.0 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 1.375% Convertible Senior Notes due 2017, which we refer to as the 2017 notes, and the $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 2.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2022, which we refer to as the 2022 notes, and to make principal payments on the 2017 notes and the 2022 notes at maturity or upon conversion. In addition, as part of our business development strategy, we generally structure our license agreements and acquisition agreements so that a significant portion of the total license or acquisition cost is contingent upon the successful achievement of specified development, regulatory or commercial milestones. As a result, we will require cash to make payments upon achievement of these milestones under the license agreements and acquisition agreements to which we are a party. Upon the closing of the Recothrom transaction in February 2015, we paid BMS approximately $127.7 million, including approximately $39.3 million for inventory. In addition, we have agreed to pay BMS up to an additional $4.9 million upon the delivery of certain additional inventory following the closing, subject to specified terms and conditions. In addition, upon the closing of the Annovation transaction in February 2015, we paid approximately $28.4 million in cash to Annovation\u2019s equityholders. We may be required to pay Annovation's equityholders up to an additional $26.3 million upon achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones, and we may be required to pay other third parties up to $6.5 million upon achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones. We may also have to make contingent cash payments upon the achievement of specified development, regulatory or commercial milestones of up to:\n\u2022\n$49.4 million due to the former equityholders of Targanta and up to $25.0 million in additional payments to other third parties for the Targanta transaction;\n\u2022\n$189.3 million due to the former equityholders of Incline and up to $113.0 million in additional payments to other third parties for the Incline transaction;\n\u2022\n$140.0 million for the ProFibrix transaction;\n\u2022\n$315.7 million for the Rempex transaction;\n\u2022\n$112.0 million for the Tenaxis transaction;\n\u2022\n$170.0 million for the license and collaboration agreement with Alnylam;\n\u2022\n$422.0 million due to our licensing of MDCO-216 from Pfizer; and\n\u2022\n$54.5 million due to our licensing of cangrelor from AstraZeneca.\nOur total potential milestone payment obligations related to development, regulatory and commercial milestones for our products and products in development under our license agreements and acquisition agreements, assuming all milestones are achieved in accordance with the terms of these agreements, would be approximately $1,624.0 million. Of this amount, approximately $180.0 million relates to development milestones, $482.0 million relates to regulatory approval milestones and $962.0 million relates to commercial milestones.\nIn addition, of the total potential milestone payment obligations, based on our earliest anticipated timeline for the achievement of development, regulatory and commercial milestones, we expect that we would make total milestone payments under our license agreements and acquisition agreements of up to $294.0 million during the remainder of 2015. The majority of these anticipated payments for 2015 relate to the achievement of regulatory approval milestones for cangrelor, IONSYS, Raplixa, RPX-602, and\nPreveLeak, and the remainder of these payments relate to the achievement of development and commercial milestones for our other products in development.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe extent to which Angiomax is commercially successful globally;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain market exclusivity for Angiomax in the United States through the enforcement of the \u2018727 patent and the \u2018343 patent during the period following the expiration of the patent term of the \u2018404 patent on December 15, 2014 and the six month pediatric exclusivity on June 15, 2015 through at least May 1, 2019, the date on which we agreed APP may sell a generic version of Angiomax. If we lose our appeal of the adverse court decision we received in our patent infringement litigation with Hospira or if Mylan prevails in its appeal of the court decision we received in our patent infringement litigation with Mylan, or if we receive an adverse decision in any other patent infringement litigation relating to the \u2018727 patent or the \u2018343 patent, Angiomax could be subject to generic competition prior to May 1, 2019, and possibly as early as June 15, 2015;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which our submissions and planned submissions for regulatory approval of products in development are approved on a timely basis, if at all;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which our products other than Angiomax and our products in development are commercially successful in the United States;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which we are successful in our efforts to commercialize our products and products in development if and when approved outside the United States;\n\u2022\nthe consideration paid by us and to be paid by us in connection with acquisitions and licenses of development-stage compounds, clinical-stage product candidates, approved products, or businesses, and in connection with other strategic arrangements;\n\u2022\nthe progress, level, timing and cost of our research and development activities related to our clinical trials and non-clinical studies with respect to Angiomax, Cleviprex, Orbactiv and our products in development;\n\u2022\nthe cost and outcomes of regulatory submissions and reviews for approval of our approved products in additional countries and for additional indications, and of our products in development globally;\n\u2022\nwhether we develop and commercialize our products in development on our own or through licenses and collaborations with third parties and the terms and timing of such arrangements, if any;\n\u2022\nthe continuation or termination of third-party manufacturing, distribution and sales and marketing arrangements;\n\u2022\nthe size, cost and effectiveness of our sales and marketing programs globally;\n\u2022\nthe amounts of our payment obligations to third parties as to our products and products in development; and\n\u2022\nour ability to defend and enforce our intellectual property rights.\nIf our existing cash resources, together with revenues that we generate from sales of our products and other sources, are insufficient to satisfy our funding requirements due to lower than anticipated sales of our marketed products, particularly if Angiomax becomes subject to generic competition in the United States earlier than May 1, 2019, or due to higher than anticipated costs associated with product launches, investments in research and development or otherwise, we likely will need to sell additional equity or debt securities or seek additional financing through other arrangements to increase our cash resources. Any sale of additional equity or debt securities may result in dilution to our stockholders. Public or private financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we seek to raise funds through collaboration or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may be required to relinquish rights to products, products in development or technologies that we would not otherwise relinquish or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. Moreover, our ability to obtain additional debt financing may be limited by the 2017 notes and the 2022 notes, market conditions or otherwise. Further, we may seek additional financing to fund our acquisitions of development stage compounds, clinical stage product candidates and approved products and/or the companies that have such products, and we may not be able to obtain such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to obtain additional financing, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate one or more of our planned\nresearch, development and commercialization activities, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIf we seek to raise additional capital by selling equity or debt securities or through other arrangements in the future, our stockholders could be subject to dilution and we may become subject to financial restrictions and covenants, which may limit our activities.\nIf we seek to acquire any development-stage compounds, clinical-stage product candidates, approved products, or businesses or determine that raising capital would be in our interest and in the interest of our stockholders, we may seek to sell equity or debt securities or seek financings through other arrangements. Any sale of equity or debt securities may result in dilution to our stockholders and increased liquidity requirements. Debt financing may involve covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt or making capital expenditures. Our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants could be dependent on our future performance, which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors, including factors that are beyond our control such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and changes in the level of competition. Failure to comply with the financial restrictions and covenants would adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur revenue in the United States from sales of our products is completely dependent on our sole source distributor, ICS, and our revenue outside the United States is substantially dependent on a limited number of international distributors. If the buying patterns of ICS or these international distributors for our products are not consistent with underlying hospital demand, then our revenue will be subject to fluctuation from quarter to quarter based on these buying patterns and not underlying demand for the products. Any change in these buying patterns could adversely affect our financial results and our stock price.\nWe distribute all of the products we sell in the United States through a sole source distribution model. Under this model, we currently sell these products to our sole source distributor, ICS. ICS then sells these products to a limited number of national medical and pharmaceutical wholesalers with distribution centers located throughout the United States and, in certain cases, directly to hospitals. We expect that we will also sell most of our future products in the United States through the same sole source distribution model. Our revenue from sales of these products in the United States is exclusively from sales to ICS pursuant to our agreement with them. In connection with a reduction in marketing, sales and distribution fees payable to ICS, in October 2010 we amended our agreement with ICS to extend the ICS payment terms under our distribution agreement with them from 30 days to 45 days, which can be further extended to 49 days if ICS pays by wire transfer. The amendment has caused, and we expect to continue to cause, an increase in accounts receivable. As a result of our relationship with ICS, we expect that our revenue will continue to be subject to fluctuation from quarter to quarter based on the buying patterns of ICS, which may be independent of underlying hospital demand.\nIn some countries outside the European Union and in a few countries in the European Union, we sell Angiomax to international distributors and these distributors then sell Angiomax to hospitals. Our reliance on a small number of distributors for international sales of Angiomax could cause our revenue to fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on the buying patterns of these distributors, independent of underlying hospital demand.\nIf inventory levels at ICS or at our international distributors become too high, these distributors may seek to reduce their inventory levels by reducing purchases from us, which could have a material and adverse effect on our revenue in periods in which such purchase reductions occur.\nWe may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future acquisitions or product licenses and integration of these acquisitions and any products and product candidates acquired or licensed may disrupt our business and management.\nWe have in the past and may in the future acquire or license additional development-stage compounds, clinical-stage product candidates, approved products, technologies or businesses. For example, recently we acquired Annovation, Incline, ProFibrix, Rempex,Tenaxis and the Recothrom product and related assets from BMS, and we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Alnylam to develop, manufacture and commercialize RNAi therapeutics targeting the PCSK9 gene for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia and other human diseases. We may not realize the anticipated benefits of an acquisition, license, or collaboration, each of which involves numerous risks. These risks include:\n\u2022\ndifficulty in integrating the operations, products or product candidates and personnel of an acquired company;\n\u2022\nentry into markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions;\n\u2022\nfailure to successfully further develop the acquired or licensed business, product, compounds, programs or technology or to achieve strategic objectives, including commercializing and marketing successfully the development stage compounds and clinical stage candidates that we acquire or license;\n\u2022\ndisruption of our ongoing business and distraction of our management and employees from other opportunities and challenges;\n\u2022\ninadequate or unfavorable clinical trial results from acquired or contracted for products in development;\n\u2022\ninability to retain personnel, key customers, distributors, vendors and other business partners of the acquired company, or acquired or licensed product or technology;\n\u2022\npotential failure of the due diligence processes to identify significant problems, liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges of an acquired company, or acquired or licensed product or technology, including but not limited to, problems, liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges with respect to intellectual property, product quality, revenue recognition or other accounting practices, employee, customer or partner disputes or issues and other legal and financial contingencies and known and unknown liabilities;\n\u2022\nliability for activities of the acquired company or licensor before the acquisition or license, including intellectual property infringement claims, violations of laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities, and other known and unknown liabilities;\n\u2022\nexposure to litigation or other claims in connection with, or inheritance of claims or litigation risk as a result of, an acquisition or license, including but not limited to, claims from terminated employees, customers, former stockholders or other third-parties; and\n\u2022\ndifficulties in the integration of the acquired company's departments, systems, including accounting, human resource and other administrative systems, technologies, books and records, and procedures, as well as in maintaining uniform standards, controls, including internal control over financial reporting required by the Sarbanes\u2212Oxley Act of 2002 and related procedures and policies.\nAcquisitions and licensing arrangements are inherently risky, and ultimately, if we do not complete an announced acquisition or license transaction or integrate an acquired business, or an acquired or licensed product or technology successfully and in a timely manner, we may not realize the benefits of the acquisition or license to the extent anticipated and the perception of the effectiveness of our management team and our company may suffer in the marketplace. In addition, even if we are able to achieve the long-term benefits associated with our strategic transactions, our expenses and short-term costs may increase materially and adversely affect our liquidity and short-term profitability. Further, if we cannot successfully integrate acquired businesses, or acquired or licensed products or technologies we may experience material negative consequences to our business, financial condition or results of operations. Future acquisitions or licenses could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, or amortization expenses, or impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, and restructuring charges, any of which could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe have a history of net losses and may not achieve profitability in future periods or maintain profitability on an annual basis.\nWe have incurred net losses in many years and on a cumulative basis since our inception. As of December 31, 2014, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $77.1 million. We expect to make substantial expenditures to further develop and commercialize our products, including costs and expenses associated with research and development, clinical trials, nonclinical and preclinical studies, regulatory approvals and commercialization. We anticipate needing to generate greater revenue in future periods from our marketed products and from our products in development in order to achieve and maintain profitability in light of our planned expenditures. If we are unable to generate greater revenue, we may not achieve profitability in future periods, and may not be able to maintain any profitability we do achieve. Our ability to generate future revenue will be substantially dependent on our ability to maintain market exclusivity for Angiomax. If we fail to achieve profitability or maintain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis within the time frame expected by investors or securities analysts, the market price of our common stock may decline.\nRisks Related to Our Notes\nWe have incurred substantial indebtedness, and our leverage and maintenance of high levels of indebtedness may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Servicing this debt, including the 2017 notes and the 2022 notes, will require a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay the 2017 notes, the 2022 notes or our other debt.\nWe have incurred a significant amount of indebtedness. Our maintenance of this level of indebtedness could have adverse consequences, including:\n\u2022\nrequiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to the payment of interest on, and principal of, our debt, which will reduce the amounts available to fund working capital, capital expenditures, product development efforts and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic, industry and market conditions;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing in the future;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we compete; and\n\u2022\nplacing us at a possible competitive disadvantage to less leveraged competitors and competitors that have less debt, better debt servicing options or better access to capital resources.\nIn addition, our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance the 2017 notes or the 2022 notes depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt, including the notes. If we are unable to generate cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be unfavorable to us or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at the time we seek to refinance such indebtedness. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations.\nWe may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of the 2017 notes or the 2022 notes or to repurchase the 2017 notes or the 2022 notes upon a fundamental change, and our future debt may contain limitations on our ability to pay cash upon conversion or repurchase of the 2017 notes or 2022 notes.\nHolders of the 2017 notes and the 2022 notes will have the right to require us to repurchase their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change, as defined in the applicable indenture, at a repurchase price equal to 100% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, as described in the applicable indenture. In addition, upon conversion of the 2017 notes and the 2022 notes, we will be required to make with respect to each $1,000 in principal amount of notes converted cash payments of at least the lesser of $1,000 and the sum of the daily conversion values as described in the applicable indenture. However, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to repurchase notes, to pay the notes at maturity or to pay cash upon conversions of notes. In addition, our ability to repurchase notes or to pay cash upon conversions of notes may be limited by law, by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our existing indebtedness (including, in the case of the 2017 notes, the 2022 notes) and future indebtedness. Our failure to repurchase notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the applicable indenture or to pay any cash payable on future conversions of the notes as required by the applicable indenture would constitute a default under the applicable indenture. A default under the applicable indenture governing the 2017 notes or the 2022 notes, respectively, or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our existing indebtedness (including, in the case of the 2017 notes, the 2022 notes) and future indebtedness. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the notes or make cash payments upon conversions thereof.\nThe conditional conversion feature of the 2017 notes or the 2022 notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nIn the event the conditional conversion feature of the 2017 notes or the 2022 notes is triggered, holders of such notes will be entitled to convert the notes at any time during specified periods at their option, which are set forth in the applicable indenture. If one or more holders elect to convert their notes, we would be required, with respect to each $1,000 principal amount of notes, to make cash payments equal to the lesser of $1,000 and the sum of the daily conversion values, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules\nto reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.\nThe accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash, such as the 2017 notes and the 2022 notes, could have a material effect on our reported financial results.\nUnder Accounting Standards Codification 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options, which we refer to as ASC 470-20, an entity must separately account for the liability and equity components of the convertible debt instruments that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion (such as the 2017 notes and the 2022 notes) in a manner that reflects the issuer\u2019s economic interest cost. The effect of ASC 470-20 on the accounting for the 2017 notes and the 2022 notes is that the equity component is required to be included in the additional paid in capital section of stockholders\u2019 equity on our consolidated balance sheet, and the value of the equity component would be treated as original issue discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the 2017 notes and the 2022 notes. As a result, we will be required to record a greater amount of non-cash interest expense in current periods presented as a result of the amortization of the discounted carrying value of the notes to their face amount over the term of the 2017 notes and the 2022 notes. We will report lower net income in our financial results because ASC 470-20 will require interest to include both the current period\u2019s amortization of the debt discount and the instrument\u2019s coupon interest, which could adversely affect our reported or future financial results, the market price of our common stock and the trading price of the 2017 notes and 2022 notes.\nIn addition, under certain circumstances, convertible debt instruments that may be settled entirely or partly in cash (such as the 2017 notes and 2022 notes) are currently accounted for utilizing the treasury stock method, the effect of which is that the shares issuable upon conversion of the notes are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share except to the extent that the conversion value of the notes exceeds their principal amount. Under the treasury stock method, for diluted earnings per share purposes, the transaction is accounted for as if the number of shares of common stock that would be necessary to settle such excess are issued. We cannot be sure that the accounting standards in the future will continue to permit the use of the treasury stock method. If we are unable to use the treasury stock method in accounting for the shares issuable upon conversion of the 2017 notes or the 2022 notes, then our diluted earnings per share would be adversely affected.\nWe may incur substantially more debt or take other actions which would intensify the risks discussed above.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional debt in the future, some of which may be secured debt. We and our subsidiaries are not restricted under the terms of the applicable indenture governing the 2017 notes or the 2022 notes from incurring additional debt, securing existing or future debt, recapitalizing our debt or taking a number of other actions that are not limited by the terms of the applicable indenture governing the 2017 notes or the 2022 notes that could have the effect of diminishing our ability to make payments on the notes when due.\nRisks Related to Commercialization\nWe face substantial competition, which may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing competing products before or more successfully than we do.\nOur industry is highly competitive. Competitors in the United States and other countries include major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology firms, universities and other research institutions. Many of our competitors are substantially larger than we are and have substantially greater research and development capabilities and experience, and greater manufacturing, marketing and financial resources, than we do.\nOur competitors may develop, market or license products or novel technologies that are more effective, safer, more convenient or less costly than any that have been or are being developed or sold by us, or may obtain marketing approval for their products from the FDA or equivalent foreign regulatory bodies more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours.\nThere are well established products, including in many cases generic products, that are approved and marketed for the indications for which our products are approved for and the indications for which we are developing our products in development. In addition, competitors are developing products for such indications. Set forth in the risk factors that follow this risk factor is additional information regarding competition for our three marketed products that generate or are expected to generate a significant portion of our revenue, Angiomax, Recothrom and Orbactiv. A description of the competition for our other products and products in development is included under the caption \u201cPart I, Item 1. Business-Competition\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe compete, in the case of our approved and marketed products, and expect to compete, in the cases of our products in development, on the basis of product efficacy, safety, ease of administration, price and economic value compared to drugs used\nin current practice or currently being developed. If we are not successful in demonstrating these attributes, physicians and other key healthcare decision makers may choose other products over our products, switch from our products to new products or choose to use our products only in limited circumstances, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAngiomax faces significant competition from all categories of anticoagulant drugs, which may limit the use of Angiomax and adversely affect our revenue.\nDue to the incidence and severity of cardiovascular diseases, the market for anticoagulant therapies is large and competition is intense. There are a number of anticoagulant drugs currently on the market, awaiting regulatory approval or in development, including orally administered agents. Angiomax competes with, or may compete with in the future, these anticoagulant drugs to the extent Angiomax and any of these anticoagulant drugs are approved for the same or similar indications.\nWe have positioned Angiomax to compete primarily with heparin and treatment regimens combining heparin and GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors. Because heparin is generic and inexpensive and has been widely used for many years, physicians and medical decision-makers may be hesitant to adopt Angiomax instead of heparin. GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors include ReoPro from Eli Lilly and Company and Johnson & Johnson/Centocor, Inc., Integrilin from Merck & Co., Inc., and Aggrastat from Cardiome Pharma Corp. and MediCure Inc. Although their use may have decreased in recent years, GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors are widely used and some physicians believe they offer superior efficacy to Angiomax. Physicians and medical decision-makers may choose to use heparin combined with GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors due to their years of experience with this combination therapy, reluctance to change existing hospital protocols and pathways and results of clinical trials or nonclinical studies by us or third parties relating to Angiomax. For instance, we believe that the data presented in March 2014 from the HEAT-PPCI, an open-label, single-center randomized controlled trial that compared unfractionated heparin versus bivalirudin in primary PCI and reported findings of increased complications following primary PCI with bivalirudin versus heparin, has caused some physicians and medical decision-makers, principally in Europe, to choose to use heparin instead of Angiomax, which has adversely affected our sales of Angiomax. In addition, we believe that pricing pressure from third-party payers has caused some physicians and medical decision-makers to choose to use heparin due to its cost. Physicians\u2019 and medical decision-makers\u2019 resistance to the use of Angiomax could adversely affect our revenue.\nIn some circumstances, Angiomax competes with other anticoagulant drugs for the use of hospital financial resources. For example, many U.S. hospitals receive a fixed reimbursement amount per procedure for the angioplasties and other treatment procedures they perform. As this amount is not based on the actual expenses the hospital incurs, hospitals may choose to use either Angiomax or other anticoagulant drugs or a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor but not necessarily more than one of these drugs. If hospitals do not choose Angiomax in these instances, our revenue will be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to maintain our market exclusivity for Angiomax in the United States as a result of our inability to enforce our U.S. patents covering Angiomax, Angiomax could become subject to generic competition in the United States earlier than we anticipate. We have agreed that APP may sell a generic version of Angiomax beginning May 1, 2019 or earlier under certain conditions, and that Teva may sell a generic version of Angiomax beginning June 30, 2019, or earlier under certain conditions. However, we remain in patent infringement litigation with other abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, filers. If we lose our appeal of the adverse court decision we received in our patent infringement litigation with Hospira or if Mylan prevails in its appeal of the court decision we received in our patent infringement litigation with Mylan, or if we receive an adverse decision in any other patent infringement litigation relating to the \u2018727 patent or the \u2018343 patent, Angiomax could be subject to generic competition prior to May 1, 2019, and possibly as early as June 15, 2015. Competition from generic equivalents that would be sold at a price that is less than the price at which we currently sell Angiomax could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and operating results. We believe that, in anticipation of a possible adverse court decision for our company in our Angiomax patent litigation, some buyers of Angiomax may reduce, delay or forego purchases of Angiomax.\nEagle has announced that it is developing bivalirudin as a ready to use liquid formulation. Eagle has announced that it expects to submit a 505(b)(2) NDA for the product in the second quarter of 2015 and is seeking to begin commercial sales of the product in the United States in 2016.\nRecothrom faces significant competition from all classes of topical hemostats and related sealant products, which may limit the use of Recothrom and adversely affect our revenue.\nRecothrom is a surgical hemostat that is applied topically during surgery to stop bleeding. There are a number of different classes of topical hemostats and surgical sealants used to prevent or stop bleeding, including:\n\u2022\nmechanical hemostats, such as absorbable gelatin sponge, collagen, cellulose, or polysaccharide-based hemostats applied as sponges, fleeces, bandages, or microspheres, which do not contain thrombin or any other active biologic compounds;\n\u2022\nactive hemostats, which are thrombin products that may be derived from bovine or human pooled plasma purification or human recombinant manufacturing processes;\n\u2022\nflowable hemostats, which consist of a granular bovine or porcine gelatin component that is mixed with saline or reconstituted thrombin to form a semi-solid, flowable putty;\n\u2022\nfibrin sealants, which consist of thrombin and fibrinogen that can be sprayed or applied via patch directly to the bleeding surface; and\n\u2022\nsurgical sealants, which can be composed of glutaraldehyde and bovine serum albumin, polyethylene glycol polymers, and cyanoacrolates.\nThe choice of a surgical hemostat or sealant depends on the surgical procedure, type and severity of bleeding, surgeon preference, price and availability of products within the operating room or hospital.\nRecothrom competes primarily with other active hemostats (bovine thrombin and human plasma-derived thrombin). Recothrom is the only topical thrombin that is not derived from bovine or human pooled plasma and can be used as a stand-alone product or with gelatin in sponge or granular form. Currently, there are two other stand-alone topical thrombin products commercially available in the United States, THROMBIN-JMI\u00ae, a bovine derived thrombin marketed by Pfizer, and EVITHROM\u00ae, a human pooled plasma thrombin marketed by Ethicon, Inc., a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson. In addition, Baxter International, Inc. markets the GELFOAM Plus Hemostasis Kit, which is Pfizer Inc.'s GELFOAM sterile sponge co-packaged with human plasma-derived thrombin. Further, a number of companies, including Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer and Baxter International, Inc., currently market other hemostatic agents that may compete with Recothrom, including mechanical hemostats such as gelatin and collagen pads, flowable hemostats and fibrin sealants. Many of these competitive hemostatic agents are relatively inexpensive and have been widely used for many years.\nConsequently, some physicians and hospital formulary decision-makers may be hesitant to adopt Recothrom. The active hemostat class has seen minor usage contraction recently while the flowable hemostats and fibrin sealants have shown growth. If physicians do not accept the potential advantages of Recothrom or resist the use of Recothrom due to either custom or cost containment measures, or the active hemostat class continues to decline, our revenues from Recothrom could be adversely affected.\nOrbactiv faces significant competition from branded and generic drugs treating ABSSSI, which may limit the use of Orbactiv and adversely affect our anticipated revenues.\nOrbactiv is an intravenous antibiotic approved by the FDA for the treatment of ABSSSI, caused or suspected to be caused by susceptible gram-positive bacteria, including MRSA.\nCompetition in the market for therapeutic products that address serious gram-positive bacterial infections is intense. In particular, there are a variety of available therapies marketed for the treatment of ABSSSI. Some of these products are branded and subject to patent protection, and others are available on a generic basis. Many of these approved products, including vancomycin, ceftaroline (Teflaro), clindamycin (Cleocin), daptomycin (Cubicin) and linezolid (Zyvox) are well established therapies and are widely accepted by physicians, patients and hospital decision-makers. Additionally, insurers and other third-party payers may encourage the use of generic products. Vancomycin, for instance, which is sold in a relatively inexpensive generic form, has been widely used for over 50 years, is the most frequently used IV antibiotic, and we believe, based on our market research, is prescribed to approximately two-thirds of all hospitalized ABSSSI patients. If physicians and hospital decision-makers do not accept the potential advantages of Orbactiv, or are otherwise hesitant or slow to adopt Orbactiv, our anticipated revenues could be adversely affected.\nThere are also a number of products recently approved or in clinical development by third parties to treat ABSSSI. Recently approved products include Sivextro from Cubist Pharmaceuticals, Inc (now a subsidiary of Merck & Co, Inc.), Dalvance from Durata Therapeutics, Inc. (now a subsidiary of Actavis plc) and Vibativ from Theravance Biopharma, Inc. Additionally, several companies have products in development that, if approved, may compete with Orbactiv, including Cempra, Inc., Debiopharm Group (through acquisition of Affinium Pharmaceuticals), Melinta Therapeutics, Inc. (formerly Rib-X Pharmaceuticals, Inc.), Paratek Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Nabriva Therapeutics AG and Furiex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (a subsidiary of Actavis plc). If any of these product candidates or any other products developed by our competitors are more effective, safer, more convenient or less costly than Orbactiv, or would otherwise render Orbactiv obsolete or non-competitive, our anticipated revenues from Orbactiv could be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to successfully identify and acquire or license development stage compounds, clinical stage product candidates or approved products and develop or commercialize those compounds and products, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nOur business strategy is based on us selectively licensing or acquiring and then successfully developing and commercializing development stage compounds, clinical stage product candidates and approved products. Because we have only the limited internal scientific research capabilities that we acquired in some of our acquisitions and we do not anticipate establishing additional scientific research capabilities, we are dependent upon pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and other researchers to sell or license to us development stage compounds, clinical stage product candidates or approved products. Since 2008, for instance, we have acquired Targanta, Incline, ProFibrix, Rempex, Tenaxis, Annovation, and the Recothrom product and related assets from BMS, licensed marketing rights to the ready-to-use formulation of Argatroban, licensed development and commercialization rights to MDCO-216, MDCO-157 and ALN-PCSsc, and licensed the non-exclusive rights to sell and distribute ten acute care generic products. The success of this business strategy depends upon our ability to identify, select and acquire or license pharmaceutical products that meet the criteria we have established. However, the acquisition and licensing of pharmaceutical products is a competitive area. A number of more established companies, which have acknowledged strategies to license and acquire products, may have competitive advantages over us due to their size, available cash flows and institutional experience. In addition, we may compete with emerging companies taking similar or different approaches to product acquisition. Therefore, we may not be able to acquire or license the rights to additional product candidates or approved products on terms that we find acceptable, or at all.\nBecause of the intense competition for these types of product candidates and approved products, the cost of acquiring, in-licensing or otherwise obtaining rights to such candidates and products has grown dramatically in recent years and are often at levels that we cannot afford or that we believe are not justified by market potential. Any acquisition or license of product candidates or approved products that we pursue may not result in any short or long term benefit to us. We may incorrectly judge the value or worth of an acquired or licensed product candidate or approved product. Even if we succeed in acquiring product candidates, we may not be successful in developing them and obtaining marketing approval for them, manufacturing them economically or commercializing them successfully. We have previously acquired or licensed rights to clinical or development stage compounds and, after having conducted development activities, determined not to devote further resources to those compounds. For example, in October 2012, we voluntarily discontinued our clinical trials and further development of MDCO-2010, which we had acquired in connection with our acquisition of Curacyte Discovery GmbH in August 2008, in response to serious unexpected patient safety issues encountered during a clinical trial. Similarly, following our review of data from the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic study of several doses of MDCO-157 and oral clopidogrel in healthy volunteers, we elected not to proceed with the further development of MDCO-157, which we had licensed from CyDex Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\nIn addition, our future success would depend in part on our ability to manage any required growth associated with some of these acquisitions and licenses. Any acquisition might distract resources from the development of our existing products in development and could otherwise negatively impact sales of our other marketed products. Furthermore, the development or expansion of any licensed or acquired product candidate or approved product may require a substantial capital investment by us, and we may not have these necessary funds to do so.\nIf we are unable to identify and acquire additional promising candidates or to develop and commercialize successfully those candidates we have, we will not be able to implement our business strategy and our business, operating results and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected.\nIf we are not able to convince hospitals to include our products on their approved formulary lists, our revenues may not meet expectations and our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nHospitals establish formularies, which are lists of drugs approved for use in the hospital. If a drug is not included on the formulary, the ability of our engagement partners and engagement managers to promote and sell the drug may be limited or denied. For example, in connection with the launch of Cleviprex, we experienced difficulties in getting Cleviprex included on hospitals' formulary lists, in part because hospital formularies may limit the number of intravenous antihypertensive drugs in each drug class, and revenues from Cleviprex were adversely affected. If we fail to secure and maintain formulary inclusion for our products on favorable terms or are significantly delayed in doing so, we may have difficulty achieving market acceptance of our products and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to negotiate and maintain satisfactory arrangements with group purchasing organizations with respect to the purchase of our products, our sales, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nOur ability to sell our products to hospitals in the United States depends in part on our relationships with group purchasing organizations, or GPOs. Many existing and potential customers for our products become members of GPOs. GPOs negotiate\npricing arrangements and contracts, sometimes on an exclusive basis, with medical supply manufacturers and distributors. These negotiated prices are then made available to a GPO's affiliated hospitals and other members. If we are not one of the providers selected by a GPO, affiliated hospitals and other members may be less likely to purchase our products, and if the GPO has negotiated a strict sole source, market share compliance or bundling contract for another manufacturer's products, we may be precluded from making sales to members of the GPO for the duration of the contractual arrangement. Our failure to renew contracts with GPOs may cause us to lose market share and could have a material adverse effect on our sales, financial condition and results of operations. We cannot assure you that we will be able to renew these contracts at the current or substantially similar terms. If we are unable to keep our relationships and develop new relationships with GPOs, our competitive position may suffer.\nIf the number of PCI procedures performed decreases, sales of Angiomax may be negatively impacted.\nThe commercial success of Angiomax depends, in part, on the overall number of PCI procedures performed. The number of PCI procedures performed in the United States declined in 2007 due in part to the reaction to data from a clinical trial that was published in March 2007 in the New England Journal of Medicine entitled \u201cClinical Outcomes Utilizing Revascularization and Aggressive Drug Evaluation,\u201d or \u201cCOURAGE\u201d, and to the controversy regarding the use of drug-eluting stents. Since 2007, PCI procedure volume has remained similar to the 2007 levels and has not returned to the level of PCI procedures performed prior to the 2007 decline. With ongoing economic pressures on our hospital customers, PCI procedure volume might further decline and might not return to its previous levels. Because PCI procedures are the primary procedures during which Angiomax is used, a decline in the number of procedures may negatively impact sales of Angiomax, possibly materially.\nIf we are unable to successfully develop our business infrastructure and operations, our ability to generate future product revenue will be adversely affected and our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nOur ability to support the sales and marketing of our products in the United States and globally will depend on our ability to properly scale our internal organization and infrastructure to accommodate the development and, upon approval, commercialization of our products and products in development. To manage our existing and planned future growth and the increasing breadth and complexity of our activities, we need to properly invest in personnel, infrastructure, information management systems and other operational resources. If we are unable to scale global operations successfully and in a timely manner, the growth of our business may be limited. Developing our business infrastructure and operations may be more difficult, more expensive or take longer than we anticipate. We may also need to revise our strategy for developing the proper infrastructure and operations periodically. In the fourth quarter of 2014, we implemented a reorganization of our European operations, including a workforce reduction and the consolidation of European sites, for which we recorded, in the aggregate, a one-time charge of approximately $9.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. If we are not able to successfully market and sell our products globally, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nFuture development of our business infrastructure andoperations could strain our operational, human and financial resources. In order to manage the development of our business infrastructure and global operations, we must:\n\u2022\ncontinue to improve operating, administrative, and information systems;\n\u2022\naccurately predict future personnel and resource needs to meet contract commitments;\n\u2022\ntrack the progress of ongoing projects; and\n\u2022\nattract and retain qualified management, sales, professional, scientific and technical operating personnel.\nIf we do not take these actions and are not able to manage our business, then our operations may be less successful than anticipated.\nThe success of our global operations may be adversely affected by international risks and uncertainties. If these operations are not successful, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nOur future profitability will depend in part on our ability to grow and ultimately maintain our product sales in foreign markets, particularly in Europe. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we had $36.6 million in sales outside of the United States and we have historically encountered difficulty in selling Angiomax outside of the United States. Our foreign operations subject us to additional risks and uncertainties, particularly because we have limited experience in marketing, servicing and distributing our products or otherwise operating our business outside of the United States. These risks and uncertainties include:\n\u2022\npolitical and economic determinations that adversely impact pricing or reimbursement policies;\n\u2022\nour customers' ability to obtain reimbursement for procedures using our products in foreign markets;\n\u2022\ncompliance with complex and changing foreign legal, tax, accounting and regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nlanguage barriers and other difficulties in providing long-range customer support and service;\n\u2022\nlonger accounts receivable collection times;\n\u2022\nsignificant foreign currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenues;\n\u2022\ntrade restrictions and restrictions on direct investment by foreign entities;\n\u2022\nreduced protection of intellectual property rights in some foreign countries; and\n\u2022\nthe interpretation of contractual provisions governed by foreign laws in the event of a contract dispute.\nOur foreign operations could also be adversely affected by export license requirements, the imposition of governmental controls, political and economic instability, trade restrictions, changes in tariffs and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations.\nIf reimbursement by government payers or other third-party payers is not available or limited for our products, pricing is delayed or set at unfavorable levels or access to our products is reduced or terminated by governmental and other third-party payers, our ability to generate revenue would be adversely affected.\nAcceptable levels of coverage and reimbursement of drug treatments by government payers, such as Medicare and Medicaid programs, private health insurers and other organizations, have a significant effect on our ability to successfully commercialize our products. Reimbursement in the United States, Europe or elsewhere may not be available for any products we may develop or, if already available, may be decreased in the future. We may not get reimbursement or reimbursement may be limited if government payers, private health insurers and other organizations are influenced by the prices of existing drugs in determining whether our products will be reimbursed and at what levels. For example, the availability of numerous generic antibiotics at lower prices than branded antibiotics, such as Orbactiv, could substantially affect the likelihood of reimbursement and the level of reimbursement for Orbactiv. If reimbursement is not available or is available only at limited levels, we may not be able to commercialize our products, or may not be able to obtain a satisfactory financial return on our products.\nIn certain countries, particularly the countries of the European Union, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals and the level of reimbursement are subject to governmental control. In some countries, pricing and reimbursement are set with limited, if any, participation in the process by the marketing authorization holder. In addition, it can take an extended period of time after the receipt of initial approval of a product to establish and obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. Reimbursement approval also may be required at the individual patient level, which can lead to further delays. In addition, in some countries, it may take an extended period of time to collect payment even after reimbursement has been established. If prices are set at unsatisfactory levels, such prices may negatively impact our revenues from sales in those countries. An increasing number of countries are taking initiatives to attempt to reduce large budget deficits by focusing cost-cutting efforts on pharmaceuticals for their state-run health care systems. These international price control efforts have impacted all regions of the world, but have been most drastic in the European Union. Further, a number of European Union countries use drug prices from other countries of the European Union as \u201creference prices\u201d to help determine pricing in their own countries. Consequently, a downward trend in drug prices for some countries could contribute to similar occurrences elsewhere. If reimbursement of our future products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, we may be unable to achieve or sustain profitability.\nThird-party payers, including Medicare and Medicaid increasingly are challenging prices charged for and the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services and they increasingly are limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for drugs. If these third-party payers do not consider our products to be economically beneficial compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products at a profit. Third-party payers may provide coverage, but place stringent limitations on such coverage, such as requiring alternative treatments to be tried first. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid health care costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. For example, in a recent final rule regarding the Medicare Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System, CMS finalized a new \u201cbundling\u201d policy that will affect reimbursement for a number of medicines prescribed in connection with\ncertain Medicare hospital outpatient services, including PCI, beginning on January 1, 2015. The medicines affected by this policy include, among others, Angiomax. This particular policy is one example of a broader trend in health care in which the government and other payors are seeking to move from individualized \u201cfee for service\u201d payments toward a system focused on \u201cbundled\u201d payments for more comprehensive packages of services and episodes of care. Also, the trend toward managed health care in the United States and the changes in health insurance programs may result in lower prices for pharmaceutical products and health care reform.\nThe PPACA may also have a significant impact on pricing as the legislation contains a number of provisions that are intended to reduce or limit the growth of healthcare costs. The provisions of the PPACA could, among other things, increase pressure on pricing and, as a result, the number of procedures that are performed. Since the PPACA was enacted, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted. In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding. In addition to federal legislation, state legislatures and foreign governments have also shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. The establishment of limitations on patient access to our drugs, adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures in new jurisdictions or programs, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures could adversely impact our business and future results. If governmental organizations and third-party payers do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not reimburse providers or consumers of our products or, if they do, the level of reimbursement may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis.\nUse or misuse of our products may result in serious injuries or even death to patients and may subject us to significant claims for product liability. If we are unable to obtain insurance at acceptable costs and adequate levels or otherwise protect ourselves against potential product liability claims, we could be exposed to significant liability.\nOur business exposes us to potential significant product liability risks which are inherent in the testing, manufacturing, marketing and sale of human healthcare products. Product liability claims might be made by patients in clinical trials, consumers, health care providers or pharmaceutical companies or others that sell our products. These claims may be made even with respect to those products that are manufactured in licensed and regulated facilities or otherwise possess regulatory approval for commercial sale or study.\nThese claims could expose us to significant liabilities that could prevent or interfere with the development or commercialization of our products. Product liability claims could require us to spend significant time and money in litigation or pay significant damages. With respect to our commercial sales and our clinical trials, we are covered by product liability insurance in the amount of $10.0 million per occurrence and $10.0 million annually in the aggregate on a claims-made basis. This coverage may not be adequate to cover all or any product liability claims that we face\nAs we continue to commercialize our products, we may wish to increase our product liability insurance. Product liability coverage is expensive. In the future, we may not be able to maintain or obtain such product liability insurance on reasonable terms, at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to product liability claims.\nOur reliance on government funding for Carbavance adds uncertainty to our research and commercialization efforts with respect to Carbavance.\nWe expect that a significant portion of the funding for the development of Carbavance will come from a contract with BARDA. BARDA is entitled to terminate our BARDA contract for convenience at any time, in whole or in part, and is not required to provide continued funding beyond amounts currently obligated under the existing contract, and there can be no assurance that our BARDA contract will not be terminated. Changes in government budgets and agendas may result in a decreased and deprioritized emphasis on supporting the development of antibacterial products such as Carbavance. If our BARDA contract is terminated or suspended, or if there is any reduction or delay in funding under our BARDA contract, we may be forced to seek alternative sources of funding, which may not be available on non-dilutive terms, terms favorable to us or at all. If alternative sources of funding are not available, we may be forced to suspend or terminate development activities related to Carbavance.\nOur reliance on government funding for Carbavance may impose requirements that increase the costs of commercialization and production of Carbavance developed under that government-funded program.\nOur BARDA contract includes provisions that reflect the U.S. government\u2019s substantial rights and remedies, many of which are not typically found in commercial contracts, including powers of the government to:\n\u2022\nunilaterally reduce or modify the government\u2019s obligations under such contracts, including by imposing equitable price adjustments, without the consent of the other party;\n\u2022\ncancel multi-year contracts and related orders if funds for contract performance for any subsequent year become unavailable;\n\u2022\ndecline, in whole or in part, to exercise an option to renew the contract;\n\u2022\nclaim rights to data, including intellectual property rights, developed under such contracts;\n\u2022\naudit contract-related costs and fees, including allocated indirect costs;\n\u2022\nsuspend the contractor from receiving new contracts pending resolution of alleged violations of procurement laws or regulations in the event of wrongdoing by us;\n\u2022\ntake actions that result in a longer development timeline than expected;\n\u2022\ndirect the course of a development program in a manner not chosen by the government contractor;\n\u2022\nimpose U.S. manufacturing requirements for products that embody inventions conceived or first reduced to practice under such contracts;\n\u2022\nsuspend or debar the contractor from doing future business with the government or a specific government agency;\n\u2022\npursue criminal or civil remedies under the False Claims Act, False Statements Act and similar remedy provisions specific to government agreements; and\n\u2022\nlimit the government\u2019s financial liability to amounts appropriated by the U.S. Congress on a fiscal-year basis, thereby leaving some uncertainty about the future availability of funding for a program even after it has been funded for an initial period.\nWe may not have the right to prohibit the U.S. government from using certain technologies funded by the government and developed by us related to Carbavance, and we may not be able to prohibit third party companies, including our competitors, from using those technologies in providing products and services to the U.S. government. The U.S. government generally takes the position that it has the right to royalty-free use of technologies that are developed under U.S. government contracts.\nIn addition, government contracts normally contain additional requirements that may increase our costs of doing business, reduce our profits, and expose us to liability for failure to comply with these terms and conditions. These requirements include, for example:\n\u2022\nspecialized accounting systems unique to government contracts;\n\u2022\npotential liability for price adjustments or recoupment of government funds after such funds have been spent;\n\u2022\npublic disclosures of certain non-proprietary contract information, which may enable competitors to gain insights into our research program; and\n\u2022\nmandatory socioeconomic compliance requirements, including labor standards, non-discrimination and affirmative action programs and environmental compliance requirements.\nAs a U.S. government contractor, we are subject to financial audits and other reviews by the U.S. government of our costs and performance under our BARDA contract, as well as our accounting and general business practices related to our BARDA contract. Based on the results of its audits, the government may adjust our contract-related costs and fees, including allocated indirect costs.\nLaws and regulations affecting government contracts, including our BARDA contract, make it more costly and difficult for us to successfully conduct our business. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in significant civil and criminal penalties and adversely affect our business.\nWe must comply with numerous laws and regulations relating to the administration and performance of our BARDA contract. Among the most significant government contracting regulations are:\n\u2022\nthe Federal Acquisition Regulation, or FAR, and agency-specific regulations supplemental to the FAR, which comprehensively regulate the procurement, formation, administration and performance of government contracts;\n\u2022\nthe business ethics and public integrity obligations, which govern conflicts of interest and the hiring of former government employees, restrict the granting of gratuities and funding of lobbying activities and incorporate other requirements such as the Anti-Kickback Act, the Procurement Integrity Act, the False Claims Act and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;\n\u2022\nexport and import control laws and regulations; and\n\u2022\nlaws, regulations and executive orders restricting the exportation of certain products and technical data.\nIn addition, U.S. government agencies such as the Department of Health and Human Services, or DHHS, and the Defense Contract Audit Agency, or DCAA, routinely audit and investigate government contractors for compliance with applicable laws and standards. These agencies review a contractor\u2019s performance under its contracts, including contracts with BARDA, cost structure and compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards.\nThese agencies also review the adequacy of, and a contractor\u2019s compliance with, its internal control systems and policies, including the contractor\u2019s purchasing, property, estimating, compensation and management information systems. Any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be paid, while such costs already paid must be refunded. If we are audited and such audit uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including:\n\u2022\ntermination of any government contracts, including our BARDA contract;\n\u2022\nsuspension of payments;\n\u2022\nfines; and\n\u2022\nsuspension or prohibition from conducting business with the U.S. government.\nIn addition, we could suffer serious reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us, which could cause our stock price to decrease.\nWe may not be able to manage our business effectively if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel and consultants.\nOur industry has experienced a high rate of turnover of management personnel in recent years. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2014, Brent Furse, Executive Vice President, Chief Customer Officer, and Cees Heiman, Executive Vice President, Chief Innovation Officer, departed from our company. We are highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel for the acquisition, development and commercialization activities we conduct or sponsor. If we lose one or more of the members of our senior management, including our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Clive A. Meanwell, our President and Chief Financial Officer, Glenn P. Sblendorio, or other key employees or consultants, our ability to implement successfully our business strategy could be seriously harmed. Our ability to replace these key employees may be difficult and may take an extended period of time because of the limited number of individuals in our industry with the breadth of skills and experience required to acquire, develop and commercialize products successfully. Competition to hire from this limited pool is intense, and we may be unable to hire, train, retain or motivate such additional personnel.\nRisks Related to our Dependence on Third Parties for Manufacturing, Research and Development, and Distribution Activities\nWe do not have manufacturing or supply capabilities and are completely dependent on third parties for the manufacture and supply of our products, other than for PreveLeak. We depend on a limited number of suppliers for the production of bulk drug substance for our products and products in development and to carry out fill-finish activities, other than for PreveLeak. If any of these suppliers does not or cannot fulfill its manufacturing or supply obligations to us, our ability to meet commercial demands for our products and to conduct clinical trials of our products and products in development could be impaired and our business could be harmed.\nWe do not manufacture any of our products or products in development, other than PreveLeak, and do not plan to develop any capacity to manufacture them. We currently rely on a limited number of manufacturers and other third parties for bulk substance and to carry out fill-finish activities for our products and products in development, other than PreveLeak. We expect to continue this manufacturing strategy for all of our other products and products in development for the foreseeable future.\nIn the event that any third-party is unable or unwilling to carry out its respective manufacturing or supply obligations or terminates or refuses to renew its arrangements with us, we may be unable to obtain alternative manufacturing or supply on commercially reasonable terms on a timely basis or at all. In such cases, the third-party manufacturers have made no commitment to supply the drug product to us on a long-term basis and could reject our purchase orders. Only a limited number of manufacturers are capable of manufacturing our products and products in development. Consolidation within the pharmaceutical manufacturing industry could further reduce the number of manufacturers capable of producing our products, or otherwise affect our existing contractual relationships.\nIf we were required to transfer manufacturing processes to other third-party manufacturers and we were able to identify an alternative manufacturer, we would still need to satisfy various regulatory requirements. Satisfaction of these requirements could cause us to experience significant delays in receiving an adequate supply of our products and products in development and could be costly. Moreover, we may not be able to transfer processes that are proprietary to the manufacturer. Any delays in the manufacturing process may adversely impact our ability to meet commercial demands for our products on a timely basis, which could reduce our revenue, and to supply product for clinical trials of our products and products in development, which could affect our ability to complete clinical trials of our products and products in development on a timely basis.\nIf third parties on whom we rely to manufacture and support the development and commercialization of our products do not fulfill their obligations or we are unable to establish or maintain such arrangements, the development and commercialization of our products may be terminated or delayed, and the costs of development and commercialization may increase.\nOur development and commercialization strategy involves entering into arrangements with corporate and academic collaborators, contract research organizations, distributors, third-party manufacturers, licensors, licensees and others to conduct development work, manage or conduct our clinical trials, manufacture our products and market and sell our products outside of the United States. We do not have the expertise or the resources to conduct many of these activities on our own and, as a result, are particularly dependent on third parties in many areas.\nWe may not be able to maintain our existing arrangements with respect to the commercialization or manufacture of our products or establish and maintain arrangements to develop, manufacture and commercialize our products in development or any additional product candidates or products we may acquire on terms that are acceptable to us. Any current or future arrangements for development and commercialization may not be successful. If we are not able to establish or maintain agreements relating to our products, our products in development or any additional products or product candidates we may acquire, our results of operations would be materially adversely affected.\nThird parties may not perform their obligations as expected. The amount and timing of resources that third parties devote to developing, manufacturing and commercializing our products are not within our control. Our collaborators may develop, manufacture or commercialize, either alone or with others, products and services that are similar to or competitive with the products that are the subject of the collaboration with us. Furthermore, our interests may differ from those of third parties that manufacture or commercialize our products. Our collaborators may reevaluate their priorities from time to time, including following mergers and consolidations, and change the focus of their development, manufacturing or commercialization efforts. Disagreements that may arise with these third parties could delay or lead to the termination of the development or commercialization of our product candidates, or result in litigation or arbitration, which would be time consuming and expensive.\nIf any third party that manufactures or supports the development or commercialization of our products breaches or terminates its agreement with us, or fails to commit sufficient resources to our collaboration or conduct its activities in a timely manner, or fails to comply with regulatory requirements, such breach, termination or failure could:\n\u2022\ndelay or otherwise adversely impact the manufacturing, development or commercialization of our products, our products in development or any additional products or product candidates that we may acquire or develop;\n\u2022\nrequire us to seek a new collaborator or undertake unforeseen additional responsibilities or devote unforeseen additional resources to the manufacturing, development or commercialization of our products; or\n\u2022\nresult in the termination of the development or commercialization of our products.\nOur reliance on third-party manufacturers and suppliers to supply our products and products in development may increase the risk that we will not have appropriate supplies of our products or our products in development, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nReliance on third-party manufacturers and suppliers entails risks to which we would not be subject if we manufactured products or products candidates ourselves, including:\n\u2022\nreliance on the third party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance;\n\u2022\nthe possible breach of the manufacturing or supply agreement by the third party; and\n\u2022\nthe possible termination or non-renewal of the agreement by the third party, based on its own business priorities, at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us.\nFor example, in December 2009 and March 2010, we conducted voluntary recalls of manufactured lots of Cleviprex due to the presence of visible particulate matter at the bottom of some vials that were manufactured for us by a third party. As a result, we were not able to supply the market with Cleviprex or sell Cleviprex from the first quarter of 2010 until April 2011. In addition, in December 2011 Eagle, the licensor and sole supplier of ready-to-use Argatroban, conducted a voluntary recall of the product due to the presence of particulate matter in some vials. As a result, we were not able to sell ready-to-use Argatroban from December 2011 to April 2012. In April 2012, we re-commenced selling ready-to-use Argatroban to existing and new customers.\nOur products and products in development may compete with products and products in development of third parties for access to manufacturing facilities. If we are not able to obtain adequate supplies of our products and products in development, it will be more difficult for us to compete effectively, market and sell our approved products and develop our products in development.\nOur manufacturers are subject to ongoing, periodic, unannounced inspection by the FDA and corresponding state and foreign agencies or their designees to evaluate compliance with the FDA's current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, regulations and other governmental regulations and corresponding foreign standards. We cannot be certain that our present or future manufacturers will be able to comply with cGMP regulations and other FDA regulatory requirements or similar regulatory requirements outside the United States. We do not control compliance by our manufacturers with these regulations and standards. Failure of our third-party manufacturers or us to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us, including fines and other monetary penalties, injunctions, civil penalties, failure of regulatory authorities to grant marketing approval of our products in development, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, suspension of clinical trials, license revocation, seizures or recalls of products in development or products, interruption of production, warning letters, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could significantly and adversely affect supplies of our products and products in development.\nWe may depend on collaborations with third parties for the development and commercialization of certain of our products in development. If those collaborations are not successful, we may not be able to capitalize on the market potential of these products in development.\nWe may seek to develop and commercialize certain of our products in development through a variety of types of collaboration arrangements. Our likely collaborators for any marketing, distribution, development, licensing or broader collaboration arrangements include large and mid-size pharmaceutical companies, regional and national pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies. Other than our collaboration arrangement with Alnylam, we are not currently a party to any such arrangement and we may not be able to enter into any similar arrangements on a timely basis, on favorable terms or at all. Our ability to enter into such arrangements with respect to products in development that are subject to licenses may be limited by the terms of those licenses. If we do enter into any such arrangements with any third parties in the future, we will likely have limited control over the amount and timing of resources that our collaborators dedicate to the development or commercialization of our products in development. Our ability to generate revenues from these arrangements will depend on our collaborators\u2019 abilities to successfully perform the functions assigned to them in these arrangements.\nCollaborations involving our products in development could pose a number of risks to us, including:\n\u2022\ncollaborators have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to these collaborations;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may not pursue development and commercialization of our products in development or may elect not to continue or renew development or commercialization programs based on clinical trial results, changes in the collaborators\u2019\nstrategic focus or available funding, or external factors such as an acquisition that diverts resources or creates competing priorities;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial program, stop a clinical trial or abandon a product candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials or require a new formulation of a product candidate for clinical testing;\n\u2022\ncollaborators could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with our products in development if the collaborators believe that competitive products are more likely to be successfully developed or can be commercialized under terms that are more economically attractive than ours;\n\u2022\na collaborator with marketing and distribution rights to one or more products may not commit sufficient resources to the marketing and distribution of such product or products;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our intellectual property or proprietary information or otherwise expose us to potential litigation;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may expose us to litigation and potential liability;\n\u2022\ndisputes may arise with respect to the ownership of intellectual property developed pursuant to our collaborations;\n\u2022\ndisputes may arise between the collaborators and us that result in the delay or termination of the research, development or commercialization of our products or products in development or that result in costly litigation or arbitration that diverts management attention and resources; and\n\u2022\ncollaborations may be terminated and, if terminated, may result in a need for additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of the applicable products and products in development.\nCollaboration agreements may not lead to development or commercialization of products in development in the most efficient manner or at all. If a collaborator of ours were to be involved in a business combination, the continued pursuit and emphasis on our product development or commercialization program could be delayed, diminished or terminated.\nIf we use hazardous and biological materials in a manner that causes injury or violates applicable law, we may be liable for damages or subject to fines and penalties.\nWe conduct research and development activities that involve the controlled use of potentially hazardous substances, including chemical, biological and radioactive materials and viruses. In addition, our operations produce hazardous waste products. Federal, state and local laws and regulations in the United States and Canada govern the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous materials. We may incur significant additional costs to comply with applicable laws in the future. Also, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from hazardous materials and we may incur liability as a result of any such contamination or injury. In the event of an accident, we could be held liable for damages or penalized with fines, and the liability could exceed our resources. We have only limited insurance for liabilities arising from hazardous materials. Compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations is expensive, and current or future environmental regulations may restrict our research, development and production efforts, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Matters\nIf we do not obtain regulatory approvals for our products in development in any jurisdiction or for our products in any additional jurisdictions, we will not be able to market our products and products in development in those jurisdictions and our ability to generate additional revenue could be materially impaired.\nWe must obtain approval from the FDA in order to sell our products in development in the United States and from foreign regulatory authorities in order to sell our products in development in other countries. In addition, we must obtain approval from foreign regulatory authorities in order to sell our U.S.-approved products in other countries.\nWe have a pipeline of acute and intensive care hospital products in development, including our four registration stage product candidates, cangrelor, IONSYS, Raplixa, and RPX-602, for which we have submitted applications for regulatory approval in the United States. We cannot be assured that we will make our planned submissions when we anticipate, that the submissions will be accepted for filing, or that the applicable regulatory authorities will approve our applications on a timely basis or at all.\nDeveloping and obtaining regulatory approval for product candidates is a lengthy process, often taking a number of years, is uncertain and is expensive. All of the product candidates that we are developing, or may develop in the future, require research and development, preclinical studies, nonclinical testing and clinical trials prior to seeking regulatory approval and commencing commercial sales. In addition, we may need to address a number of technological challenges in order to complete development of our product candidates. As a result, the development of product candidates may take longer than anticipated or not be successful at all.\nAny regulatory approval we ultimately obtain may limit the indicated uses for the product or subject the product to restrictions or post-approval commitments that render the product commercially non-viable. Securing regulatory approval requires the submission of extensive non-clinical and clinical data, information about product manufacturing processes and inspection of facilities and supporting information to the regulatory authorities for each therapeutic indication to establish the product's safety and efficacy. If we are unable to submit the necessary data and information, for example, because the results of clinical trials are not favorable, or if the applicable regulatory authority delays reviewing or does not approve our applications, we will be unable to obtain regulatory approval. Delays in obtaining or failure to obtain regulatory approvals may:\n\u2022\ndelay or prevent the successful commercialization of any of the products or product candidates in the jurisdiction for which approval is sought;\n\u2022\ndiminish our competitive advantage; and\n\u2022\ndefer or decrease our receipt of revenue.\nThe regulatory review and approval process to obtain marketing approval takes many years and requires the expenditure of substantial resources. This process can vary substantially based on the type, complexity, novelty and indication of the product involved. Regulatory authorities have substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that data are insufficient for approval and require additional pre-clinical, clinical or other studies. In addition, varying interpretations of the data obtained from pre-clinical and clinical testing could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval of a product. Moreover, recent events, including complications experienced by patients taking FDA-approved drugs, have raised questions about the safety of marketed drugs and may result in new legislation by the U.S. Congress or foreign legislatures and increased caution by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities in reviewing applications for marketing approval.\nCertain of our products in development have experienced regulatory and/or clinical setbacks in the past, including cangrelor and IONSYS. For example, in February 2014, the FDA Cardiovascular and Renal Drugs Advisory Committee advised against approval of cangrelor for use in patients undergoing PCI or those that require bridging from oral antiplatelet therapy to surgery. On April 30, 2014, the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter regarding our NDA for cangrelor. For the PCI indication, the FDA stated that the NDA cannot be approved at the present time. The FDA suggested that we perform a series of clinical data analyses of the CHAMPION PHOENIX study, review certain processes regarding data management, and provide bioequivalence information on the clopidogrel clinical supplies for the CHAMPION trials. For the BRIDGE indication, the FDA concluded that a prospective, adequate and well-controlled study in which outcomes such as bleeding are studied would be required to provide the clinical data necessary to assess the benefit-risk relationship in this indication. The FDA also provided additional comments for us to address, stating that the comments are not currently approvability issues, but could affect labeling. In December 2014, we submitted our response to the Complete Response Letter with respect to the PCI indication only and, in the response, we withdrew our request for approval for the BRIDGE indication. The FDA accepted our resubmission and provided a PDUFA date in June 2015. No assurances can be made that our response to the Complete Response Letter will be adequate. In addition, no assurances can be made with respect to our ability to obtain regulatory approval and to commercially develop cangrelor, and we may only be able to do so after conducting further trials responsive to the FDA's concerns, which could be costly and which we may choose not conduct. In September 2014, we received the Day 180 List of Outstanding Issues from the CHMP regarding our MAA for cangrelor in the European Union. The LOI contained one major objection regarding the benefit-risk relationship of cangrelor. A Scientific Advisory Group (SAG) meeting was convened on December 1, 2014, and we submitted to the CHMP our response to the LOI in December 2014.\nIn addition, subsequent to the FDA\u2019s acceptance for filing of the sNDA for IONSYS, we received in November 2014 a Discipline Review Letter from the FDA with respect to our sNDA for IONSYS. A Discipline Review Letter is a letter the FDA uses to convey early thoughts on possible deficiencies in a marketing approval application. In the letter, the FDA identified deficiencies in the results of human factors validation studies of IONSYS that we had included in the sNDA. Human factors validation studies focus on the interactions between people and devices to evaluate use-related risks and confirm that users can use the device safely and effectively. Based on discussions with the FDA, we implemented additional risk mitigations to reduce use errors associated with IONSYS and conducted additional human factors validation studies to support these mitigations. We submitted the results of the human factors validation studies to the FDA in January 2015, which we believe will be sufficient time\nto enable the FDA to review the results as part of our sNDA submission without causing a delay in the PDUFA date. However, there can be no assurance that the results of the studies will be satisfactory to the FDA or that there will be no delay in the PDUFA date.\nThe procedures to obtain marketing approvals vary among countries and can involve additional clinical trials or other pre-filing requirements. The time required to obtain foreign regulatory approval may differ from that required to obtain FDA approval. The foreign regulatory approval process may include all the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval, or different or additional risks. We may not obtain foreign regulatory approvals on a timely basis, if at all. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by the regulatory authorities in other countries, and approval by one foreign regulatory authority does not ensure approval by the FDA or regulatory authorities in other foreign countries. We may not be able to file for regulatory approvals and may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize our products and products in development in any market.\nWe cannot expand the indications for which we are marketing our products unless we receive regulatory approval for each additional indication. Failure to expand these indications will limit the size of the commercial market for our products.\nIn order to market our products for expanded indications, we will need to conduct appropriate clinical trials, obtain positive results from those trials and obtain regulatory approval for such proposed indications. Obtaining regulatory approval is uncertain, time-consuming and expensive. The regulatory review and approval process to obtain marketing approval for a new indication can take many years and require the expenditure of substantial resources. This process can vary substantially based on the type, complexity, novelty and indication of the product involved. The regulatory authorities have substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application. Alternatively, they may decide that any data submitted is insufficient for approval and require additional pre-clinical, clinical or other studies, which studies could require the expenditure of substantial resources. Even if we undertook such studies, we might not be successful in obtaining regulatory approval for these indications or any other indications in a timely manner or at all. In addition, varying interpretations of the data obtained from pre-clinical and clinical testing could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval of a new indication for a product. If we are unsuccessful in expanding the product label of our products, the size of the commercial market for our products will be limited.\nFor example, in May 2008, we received a non-approvable letter from the FDA with respect to an sNDA that we submitted to the FDA seeking approval of an additional indication for Angiomax for the treatment of patients with ACS in the emergency department. In its May 2008 letter, the FDA indicated that the basis of their decision involved the appropriate use and interpretation of non-inferiority trials, including the ACUITY trial. If we determine to pursue this indication or other indications for Angiomax, the FDA may require that we conduct additional studies of Angiomax, which studies could require the expenditure of substantial resources. Even if we undertook such studies, we might not be successful in obtaining regulatory approval for these indications or any other indications in a timely manner or at all. If we are unsuccessful in expanding the Angiomax product label, the size of the commercial market for Angiomax will be limited.\nClinical trials of product candidates are expensive and time-consuming, and the results of these trials are uncertain. If we are unable to conduct clinical trials that demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates on a timely basis, then our costs of developing the product candidates may increase and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates on a timely basis or at all.\nBefore we can obtain regulatory approvals to market any product for a particular indication, we will be required to complete pre-clinical studies and extensive clinical trials in humans to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of such product for such indication.\nClinical testing is expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and is uncertain as to outcome. Success in pre-clinical testing or early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful, and interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results. An unexpected result in one or more of our clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing. For example, in October 2012, we voluntarily discontinued our Phase 2b dose-ranging study of MDCO-2010, a serine protease inhibitor which we were developing to reduce blood loss during surgery, in response to serious unexpected patient safety issues encountered during the trial. Further, in November 2009, we discontinued enrollment in our Phase 3 clinical trials of cangrelor prior to completion after the independent Interim Analysis Review Committee for the program reported to us that the efficacy endpoints of the trial program would not be achieved.\nWe may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, the clinical trial process that could delay or prevent us from receiving regulatory approval or commercializing our products in development, including:\n\u2022\nour clinical trials may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical trials which even if undertaken cannot ensure we will gain approval;\n\u2022\ndata obtained from pre-clinical testing and clinical trials may be subject to varying interpretations, which could result in the FDA or other regulatory authorities deciding not to approve a product in a timely fashion, or at all;\n\u2022\nthe cost of clinical trials may be greater than we currently anticipate;\n\u2022\nregulators, ethics committees or institutional review boards may not authorize us to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site;\n\u2022\nwe, or the FDA or other regulatory authorities, might suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that participating patients are being exposed to unacceptable health risks. For example, we have in the past voluntarily suspended enrollment in one of our clinical trials to review an interim analysis of safety data from the trial; and\n\u2022\nthe effects of our product candidates may not be the desired effects or may include undesirable side effects or the product candidates may have other unexpected characteristics.\nThe rate of completion of clinical trials depends in part upon the rate of enrollment of patients. Patient enrollment is a function of many factors, including the size of the patient population, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for the trial, the existence of competing clinical trials and the availability of alternative or new treatments. In particular, the patient population targeted by some of our clinical trials may be small. Delays in patient enrollment in any of our current or future clinical trials may result in increased costs and program delays.\nIf we or the contract manufacturers manufacturing our products and products in development fail to comply with the extensive regulatory requirements to which we, our contract manufacturers and our products and products in development are subject, our products could be subject to restrictions or withdrawal from the market, the development of our product candidates could be jeopardized, and we could be subject to penalties.\nThe research, testing, manufacturing, labeling, safety, advertising, promotion, storage, sales, distribution, import, export and marketing, among other things, of our products, both before and after approval, are subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the United States, Europe and elsewhere throughout the world. Both before and after approval of a product, quality control and manufacturing procedures must conform to cGMP. Regulatory authorities, including the FDA, periodically inspect manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP. Our failure or the failure of contract manufacturers to comply with the laws administered by the FDA, the EMA or other governmental authorities could result in, among other things, any of the following:\n\u2022\ndelay in approving or refusal to approve a product;\n\u2022\nproduct recall or seizure;\n\u2022\nsuspension or withdrawal of an approved product from the market;\n\u2022\ndelays in, suspension of or prohibition of commencing, clinical trials of products in development;\n\u2022\ninterruption of production;\n\u2022\noperating restrictions;\n\u2022\nuntitled or warning letters;\n\u2022\ninjunctions;\n\u2022\nfines and other monetary penalties;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of civil or criminal penalties;\n\u2022\ndisruption of importing and exporting activities; and\n\u2022\nunanticipated expenditures.\nWe may incur significant liability if it is determined that we are promoting the \u201coff-label\u201d use of any of our products.\nPhysicians may prescribe drug products for uses that are not described in the product's labeling and that differ from those approved by the FDA or other applicable regulatory agencies. Off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Although the FDA and other regulatory agencies do not regulate a physician's choice of treatments, the FDA and other regulatory agencies do restrict communications on the subject of off-label use. Companies may not promote drugs for off-label uses. The FDA and other regulatory and enforcement authorities actively enforce laws and regulations prohibiting promotion of off-label uses and the promotion of products for which marketing approval has not been obtained. A company that is found to have promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability, including civil and administrative remedies as well as criminal sanctions.\nNotwithstanding the regulatory restrictions on off-label promotion, the FDA and other regulatory authorities allow companies to engage in truthful, non-misleading, and non-promotional scientific exchange concerning their products. We engage in medical education activities and communicate with investigators and potential investigators regarding our clinical trials. If the FDA or another regulatory or enforcement authority determines that our communications regarding our marketed products are not in compliance with the relevant regulatory requirements and that we have improperly promoted off-label uses, we may be subject to significant liability, including civil and administrative remedies as well as criminal sanctions.\nIf we do not comply with federal, state and foreign laws and regulations relating to the health care business, we could face substantial penalties.\nWe and our customers are subject to extensive regulation by the federal government, and the governments of the states and foreign countries in which we may conduct our business. In the United States, the laws that directly or indirectly affect our ability to operate our business include the following:\n\u2022\nthe Federal Anti-Kickback Law, which prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce either the referral of an individual or furnishing or arranging for a good or service for which payment may be made under federal health care programs such as Medicare and Medicaid;\n\u2022\nother Medicare laws and regulations that prescribe the requirements for coverage and payment for services performed by our customers, including the amount of such payment;\n\u2022\nthe Federal False Claims Act, which imposes civil and criminal liability on individuals and entities who submit, or cause to be submitted, false or fraudulent claims for payment to the government;\n\u2022\nthe Federal False Statements Act, which prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items or services; and\n\u2022\nvarious state laws that impose similar requirements and liability with respect to state healthcare reimbursement and other programs.\nIf our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws and regulations described above or any other law or governmental regulation to which we or our customers are or will be subject, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Similarly, if our customers are found to be non-compliant with applicable laws, they may be subject to sanctions, which could also have a negative impact on us. Any penalties, damages, fines, curtailment or restructuring of our operations would adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses, divert our management's attention from the operation of our business and damage our reputation.\nFailure to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, as well as the anti-bribery laws of the nations in which we conduct business, could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences.\nWe are subject to the FCPA, which generally prohibits U.S. companies from engaging in bribery or other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business and requires companies to maintain accurate books and records and internal controls, including at foreign-controlled subsidiaries. In addition, we are subject to other anti-bribery laws of the nations in which we conduct business that apply similar prohibitions as the FCPA. Our employees or other agents may engage in prohibited conduct without our knowledge under our policies and procedures and the FCPA and other anti-bribery laws that we may be subject to for which we may be held responsible. If our employees or other agents are found to have engaged in\nsuch practices, we could suffer severe penalties and other consequences that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe production of fentanyl hydrochloride, used in IONSYS is highly regulated through an annual allocation quota made by the Drug Enforcement Administration, or DEA, in the United States and our specific allocation by the DEA could significantly limit the development, production or sale of IONSYS.\nFentanyl hydrochloride is subject to the DEA\u2019s production and procurement quota scheme where the DEA establishes annually an aggregate quota for how much fentanyl may be produced in total in the United States based on an estimate of the quantity needed to meet legitimate scientific and medicinal needs that is then allocated among individual companies based on applications submitted annually by these individual companies to request an individual production and procurement quotas. These applications generally require substantial evidence and documentation of expected legitimate medical and scientific needs before the DEA makes its decision in allocating annual quotas to those manufacturers. The aggregate production quotas and individual production and procurement quotas may be adjusted from time to time during the year, although the DEA has substantial discretion in whether or not to make such adjustments. The DEA may choose to set the aggregate fentanyl hydrochloride quota lower than the total amount requested by the companies.\nWhile it is possible to petition the DEA for an increase in the annual aggregate quota allocated to us after it is fixed, there is no guarantee that the DEA would act favorably upon such a petition. Our production and procurement quota of fentanyl hydrochloride may not be sufficient to meet commercial demand or clinical development needs. Any delay or refusal by the DEA in establishing the production and/or procurement quota or a reduction in our quota for fentanyl or a failure to increase it over time as we anticipate could delay or stop the development, production or sale of IONSYS or cause us to fail to achieve our expected operating results, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to maintain our market exclusivity for Angiomax in the United States as a result of our inability to enforce our U.S. patents covering Angiomax, Angiomax could be subject to generic competition earlier than we anticipate. Generic competition for Angiomax would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe principal U.S. patents covering Angiomax include the '404 patent, the '727 patent and the '343 patent. The '404 patent was set to expire in March 2010, but the term was extended to December 15, 2014 by the PTO under the Hatch-Waxman Act. As a result of our study of Angiomax in the pediatric setting, we are entitled to a six-month period of pediatric exclusivity following expiration of the '404 patent. In the second half of 2009, the PTO issued to us the '727 patent and the '343 patent, covering a more consistent and improved Angiomax drug product and the processes by which it is made. The '727 patent and the '343 patent are set to expire in July 2028. In response to Paragraph IV Certification Notice letters we received with respect to abbreviated new drug applications, or ANDAs, filed by a number of parties with the FDA seeking approval to market generic versions of Angiomax, we have filed lawsuits against the ANDA filers alleging patent infringement of the '727 patent and '343 patent.\nIn September 2011, we settled our patent infringement litigation with Teva. In connection with the Teva settlement we entered into a license agreement with Teva under which we granted Teva a non-exclusive license under the '727 patent and '343 patent to sell a generic bivalirudin for injection product under a Teva ANDA in the United States beginning June 30, 2019 or earlier under certain conditions.\nIn January 2012, we settled our patent infringement litigation with APP. In connection with the APP settlement, we entered into a license agreement with APP under which we granted APP a non-exclusive license under the '727 patent and '343 patent to sell a generic bivalirudin for injection product under an APP ANDA in the United States beginning on May 1, 2019. In certain limited circumstances, the license to APP could include the right to sell a generic bivalirudin product under our NDA for Angiomax in the United States beginning on May 1, 2019 or, in certain limited circumstances, on June 30, 2019 or on a date prior to May 1, 2019.\nWe remain in infringement litigation involving the \u2018727 patent and \u2018343 patent with the other ANDA filers, as described in Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. On July 12, 2013, the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware in our patent infringement litigation with Hospira issued its Markman decision as to the claim construction of the \u2018727 patent and the \u2018343 patent. The district court\u2019s decision varied from the other Markman decisions that we have received in our other patent infringement litigations. On July 22, 2013, we filed a motion for reconsideration of the district court\u2019s claim\nconstruction ruling on the grounds that the district court (i) impermissibly imported process limitations disclosed in a preferred embodiment into the claims, (ii) improperly transformed product claims into product-by-process claims, (iii) improperly rendered claim language superfluous and violated the doctrine of claim differentiation, and (iv) improperly construed limitations based on validity arguments that have not yet been presented. On August 22, 2013, the district court denied the motion for reconsideration. A three day bench trial was held in September 2013 and a post-trial briefing was completed in December 2013. On March 31, 2014, the district court issued its trial opinion. With respect to patent validity, the district court held that the \u2018727 and \u2018343 patents were valid on all grounds. Specifically, the district court found that Hospira had failed to prove that the patents were either anticipated and/or obvious. The district court further held that the patents satisfied the written description requirement, were enabled and were not indefinite. With respect to infringement, based on its July 2013 Markman decision, the district court found that Hospira\u2019s ANDAs did not meet the \u201cefficient mixing\u201d claim limitation and thus did not infringe the asserted claims of the \u2018727 and \u2018343 patents. The district court found that the other claim limitations in dispute were present in Hospira\u2019s ANDA products. The district court entered a final judgment on April 15, 2014. On May 9, 2014, we filed a Notice of Appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. On May 23, 2014, Hospira filed a notice of cross-appeal. We filed our opening appeal brief on August 13, 2014. Hospira filed its opening appeal brief on September 26, 2014 asserting that the claim constructions and non- infringement findings were correct. Hospira also seeks to overturn the finding of patent validity. Briefing was completed in December 2014. An oral argument before the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has been scheduled for March 5, 2015. If our appeal is not successful or Hospira\u2019s cross-appeal is successful, then Angiomax could be subject to generic competition earlier than anticipated, possibly as early as June 15, 2015, the date of the expiration of the patent term of the '404 patent and the six month pediatric exclusivity, including from Hospira\u2019s generic bivalirudin, as well as potentially Teva\u2019s and APP\u2019s generic bivalirudin products.\nIn our patent infringement litigation with Mylan, we completed a six day trial directed to the validity and infringement of the \u2018727 patent in June 2014. On October 27, 2014, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois issued an opinion and order finding that Mylan\u2019s ANDA product infringes all of the asserted claims of the \u2018727 patent. The district court further found that Mylan failed to prove that the same asserted claims of the \u2018727 patent are invalid or unenforceable. Specifically, the district court found that Mylan failed to prove its allegations of anticipation, obviousness, non-enablement and unenforceability due to inequitable conduct. On October 28, 2014 and November 13, 2014, Mylan filed Notices of Appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. On November 25, 2014, we filed a Notice of Cross-Appeal of the district court\u2019s summary judgment of noninfringement of the asserted claims of the \u2018343 patent that it had issued on December 16, 2013 and the district court\u2019s Markman Order on August 6, 2012. We expect that appellate briefing will be completed by the end of May 2015 and that the district court will schedule oral arguments after briefing has been completed. If we receive an adverse decision on Mylan\u2019s appeals, then Angiomax could be subject to generic competition earlier than anticipated, including from Mylan\u2019s generic bivalirudin, as well as potentially Teva\u2019s and APP\u2019s generic bivalirudin products. For additional details regarding our ongoing patent infringement litigation with Mylan, see Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThere can be no assurance as to the outcome of our infringement litigation. If we are unable to maintain our market exclusivity for Angiomax in the United States as a result of our inability to enforce our U.S. patents covering Angiomax, Angiomax could become subject to generic competition in the United States earlier than May 1, 2019 and as early as June 15, 2015, the date of expiration of the patent term of the '404 patent and the six month pediatric exclusivity. Competition from generic equivalents that would be sold at a price that is less than the price at which we currently sell Angiomax would have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nFollowing our settlements with Teva and APP, we submitted the settlement documents for each settlement to the FTC and the DOJ. The FTC and the DOJ could seek to challenge our settlements with Teva and APP, or a third party could initiate a private action under antitrust or other laws challenging our settlements with Teva and APP. While we believe our settlements are lawful, we may not prevail in any such challenges or litigation, in which case the other party might obtain injunctive relief, remedial relief, or such other relief as a court may order. In any event, we may incur significant costs in the event of an investigation or in defending any such action and our business and results of operations could be materially impacted if we fail to prevail against any such challenges.\nIf we breach any of the agreements under which we license rights to products or technology from others, we could lose license rights that are material to our business or be subject to claims by our licensors.\nWe license rights to products and technology that are important to our business, and we expect to enter into additional licenses in the future. For instance, we have exclusively licensed patents and patent applications relating to each of our products and products in development. Under these agreements, we are subject to a range of commercialization and development, sublicensing, royalty, patent prosecution and maintenance, insurance and other obligations.\nAny failure by us to comply with any of these obligations or any other breach by us of our license agreements could give the licensor the right to terminate the license in whole, terminate the exclusive nature of the license or bring a claim against us for damages. Any such termination or claim, particularly relating to our agreements with respect to Angiomax, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or business. Even if we contest any such termination or claim and are ultimately successful, such dispute could lead to delays in the development or commercialization of potential products and result in time-consuming and expensive litigation or arbitration. In addition, on termination we may be required to license to the licensor any related intellectual property that we developed.\nIf we are unable to obtain or maintain protection for the intellectual property relating to our products, the value of our products will be adversely affected.\nThe patent positions of pharmaceutical companies like us are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual issues. We cannot be certain that our patents and patent applications, including our own and those that we have rights through licenses from third parties will adequately protect our intellectual property. Our success protecting our intellectual property depends significantly on our ability to:\n\u2022\nobtain and maintain U.S. and foreign patents, including defending those patents against adverse claims;\n\u2022\nsecure patent term extension for the patents covering our approved products;\n\u2022\nprotect trade secrets;\n\u2022\noperate without infringing the proprietary rights of others; and\n\u2022\nprevent others from infringing our proprietary rights.\nWe may not have any additional patents issued from any patent applications that we own or license. If additional patents are granted, the claims allowed may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. In addition, issued patents that we own or license may be challenged in contested proceedings such as opposition, derivation, reexamination, inter partes review, post-grant review or interference proceedings and may be narrowed, invalidated or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing similar products or limit the length of term of patent protection we may have for our products. We may not be able to obtain patent term extension to prolong the terms of the principal patents covering our approved products. Changes in patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property or narrow the scope of our patent protection.\nIn addition, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled on several patent cases in recent years, either narrowing the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances or weakening the rights of patent owners in certain situations. This combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents, once obtained, and with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future. Depending on decisions by the U.S. Congress, the federal courts, and the PTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents that we might obtain in the future.\nOur patents also may not afford us protection against competitors with similar technology. Because patent applications in the United States and many foreign jurisdictions are typically not published until eighteen months after filing, or in some cases not at all, and because publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind actual discoveries, neither we nor our licensors can be certain that others have not filed or maintained patent applications for technology used by us or covered by our pending patent applications without our being aware of these applications.\nWe exclusively license patents and patent applications for each of our products and products in development, for which we own the patents and patent applications, and we license on a non-exclusive basis the acute care generic products from APP which are not covered by any patents or patent applications. The patents covering our approved products and our products in development are currently set to expire at various dates:\nAngiomax. The principal U.S. patents covering Angiomax include the \u2018404 patent, the \u2018727 patent and the \u2018343 patent. The \u2018404 patent covers the composition of matter of Angiomax. The \u2018404 patent was set to expire in March 2010, but the term was extended to December 15, 2014 by the PTO under the Hatch-Waxman Act. As a result of our study of Angiomax in the pediatric setting, we are entitled to a six-month period of pediatric exclusivity following expiration of the '404 patent.\nIn the second half of 2009, the PTO issued to us the '727 patent and the '343 patent, covering a more consistent and improved Angiomax drug product and the processes by which it is made. The '727 patent and the '343 patent are set to expire in July 2028 and are also entitled to a six-month period of pediatric exclusivity following expiration of the patents. In response to Paragraph IV Certification Notice letters we received with respect to ANDAs filed with the FDA seeking approval to market generic versions of Angiomax, we have filed lawsuits against the ANDA filers alleging patent infringement of the '727 patent and '343 patent. In September 2011, we settled our patent infringement litigation with Teva. In connection with the settlement, we entered into a license agreement with Teva under which we granted Teva a non-exclusive license under the '727 patent and '343 patent to sell a generic bivalirudin for injection product under a Teva ANDA in the United States beginning June 30, 2019 or earlier under certain conditions. The license agreement also contains a grant by Teva to us of an exclusive (except as to Teva) license under Teva\u2019s bivalirudin patents and right to enforce Teva\u2019s bivalirudin patents. In January 2012, we settled our patent infringement litigation with APP. In connection with the settlement, we entered into a license agreement with APP under which we granted APP a non-exclusive license under the '727 patent and '343 patent to sell a generic bivalirudin for injection product under an APP ANDA in the United States beginning on May 1, 2019. In addition, in certain limited circumstances, the license to APP could include the right to sell a generic bivalirudin product under our NDA for Angiomax in the United States beginning on May 1, 2019 or, in certain limited circumstances, on June 30, 2019 or on a date prior to May 1, 2019. We remain in infringement litigation involving the '727 patent and '343 patent with other ANDA filers. In our litigation with Hospira, we have appealed the decision of the district court that Hospira\u2019s ANDA did not infringe the asserted claims of the \u2018727 and \u2018343 patents. In our litigation with Mylan, Mylan has appealed the district court's finding that Mylan\u2019s ANDA product infringes the asserted claims of the \u2018727 patent, and we have appealed the district court's summary judgment of noninfringement of the asserted claims of the '343 patent. If we are unable to maintain our market exclusivity for Angiomax in the United States through enforcement of our U.S. patents covering Angiomax, as a result of an adverse decision in our patent litigation or otherwise, including if we lose our appeal in our litigation with Hospira or if Mylan prevails in its appeal, Angiomax could be subject to generic competition earlier than May 1, 2019, and possibly as early as June 15, 2015, the date of expiration of the patent term of the \u2018404 patent and the six month pediatric exclusivity.\nOur patent infringement litigation involving the '727 patent and '343 patent is described in more detail in Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn Europe, the principal patent covering Angiomax expires in August 2015. This patent covers the composition of matter of Angiomax.\nRecothrom. In February 2015, we acquired from BMS its portfolio of patents and patent applications pertaining to Recothrom's pharmaceutical formulations and methods of manufacturing. The expiration dates of these patents range from July 2015 to February 2029 in the United States. Prior to the acquisition of BMS's portfolio of patents and patent applications pertaining to Recothrom, BMS also filed and we are currently prosecuting a number of patent applications relating to Recothrom in the United States and in foreign countries. We believe that, as a biologic, Recothrom is entitled to regulatory exclusivity as a \u201creference product\u201d in the United States expiring in January 2020. Although the FDA has issued draft guidance documents, to date it has not issued any regulations or final guidance explaining how it will implement the abbreviated BLA or biosimilar provisions enacted in 2010 under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, including the exclusivity provisions for reference products. As a result, it is possible that the FDA will decide to interpret the provisions in such a way that Recothrom is not considered to be a reference product for the purposes of the statute or to be entitled to any period of regulatory exclusivity. Moreover, even if Recothrom is considered to be a reference product eligible for such exclusivity, that exclusivity will not prevent other companies from filing full BLAs for competing versions of Recothrom, including competing recombinant thrombin products. As a result, if such companies can complete and the FDA permits the submission of and approves such full BLAs, competing products may get onto the market before the regulatory exclusivity period for Recothrom expires in January 2020.\nCleviprex. The principal U.S. patent for Cleviprex is U.S. Patent No. 5,856,346 or the '346 patent. The '346 patent was set to expire in January 2016, but the term was extended to January 2021 by the PTO under the Hatch-Waxman Act. We also have an issued patent, U.S. Patent No. 8,658,676, or the '676 patent, which covers the Cleviprex formulation and is set to expire in October 2031. We have filed for patent term extensions, also known as supplementary protection certificates, in European countries where we have received regulatory approval and expect to file for supplementary protection certificates in other European countries as we receive approvals. In Europe, the principal patent covering Cleviprex was set to expire in November 2014, but the term has been extended to November 2019 in most European countries where Cleviprex has been approved via a supplementary protection certificate. The European patent office has also issued to us a patent covering compositions of matter of Cleviprex having certain stability profiles, which will expire in July 2029. In addition, we have filed and are currently prosecuting a number of patent applications relating to Cleviprex covering compositions of matter and uses in the United States, Europe and other foreign countries.\nReady-to-Use Argatroban. We exclusively licensed from Eagle rights to two U.S. patents covering certain formulations of Argatroban. Our exclusive license is limited to the United States and Canada. The patents are set to expire in September 2027. In February 2012, we were notified that Sandoz had submitted an ANDA seeking permission to market its second generic version\nof ready-to-use Argatroban prior to the expiration of these patents. On March 29, 2012, Eagle, which directed and controlled the enforcement of its intellectual property rights with respect to ready-to-use Argatroban, filed suit against Sandoz in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey for infringement of its ready-to-use Argatroban patents. In November 2012, Eagle advised us that it entered into a settlement agreement with Sandoz, and as part of the settlement, Eagle agreed to give Sandoz the right to introduce an authorized generic version of ready-to-use Argatroban. Sandoz currently markets two ready-to-use generic formulations of Argatroban.\nCangrelor. We have issued patents directed to cangrelor pharmaceutical compositions which expire in 2017 and 2018 if no patent term extension is obtained. We have also filed and are currently prosecuting a number of patent applications related to cangrelor.\nOrbactiv. The principal patent for Orbactiv in both the United States and Europe is set to expire in November 2015. We have filed for a patent term extension for this patent in the United States. We also have issued patents directed to the process of making Orbactiv. These patents are set to expire in 2017 if no patent term extension is obtained. We also have a U.S. patent covering the use of Orbactiv in treating certain skin infections that expires in August 2029. We have also filed and are prosecuting a number of patent applications relating to Orbactiv and its uses.\nRaplixa. As a result of our acquisition of ProFibrix, we acquired a portfolio of patents and patent applications, including patents licensed from Quadrant Drug Delivery Limited, or Quadrant. One U.S. patent licensed from Quadrant covers the composition of matter of Raplixa and is set to expire in May 2017 if no patent term extension is obtained. We also have an issued U.S. patent, U.S. Patent No. No. 8,846,105, which covers Raplixa suitable for certain applications that expires in January 2031. We have also filed and are prosecuting a number of patent applications related to the use and production of Raplixa. As a biologic, we believe Raplixa is entitled to receive 12 years of regulatory exclusivity as a \"reference product\" in the United States and 10 years of regulatory exclusivity in Europe from the date of the initial marketing approval of Raplixa, if approved.\nIONSYS. As a result of our acquisition of Incline, we acquired a portfolio of patents and patent applications covering the IONSYS device and its uses. Some of these patents and patent applications were exclusively licensed from ALZA. The expiration dates of patents covering the IONSYS device and its use range from June 2015 to June 2032 in the United States. In Europe, the expiration date of patents covering the IONSYS device range from May 2016 to September 2021. We are also currently prosecuting patent applications relating to IONSYS in the United States and in certain foreign countries.\nMDCO-216. We are maintaining a number of U.S. patents with respect to MDCO-216, including patents that claim the use of MDCO-216 in certain disease indications. One of these U.S. patents is directed to the use of MDCO-216 for the treatment of ACS and is set to expire in October 2024 if no patent term extension is obtained. We are also prosecuting a number of patent applications related to the use of MDCO-216 in Europe and other foreign countries. As a biologic, we believe MDCO-216 is entitled to receive 12 years of regulatory exclusivity as a \"reference product\" in the United States and 10 years of regulatory exclusivity in Europe from the date of the initial marketing approval of MDCO-216, if approved.\nABP-700. In connection with our acquisition of Annovation, we obtained an exclusive license from The General Hospital Corporation pertaining to certain patents and patent applications covering ABP-700 and its analogs. These patent applications, some of which are jointly owned by Annovation and The General Hospital Corporation, are currently being prosecuted by The General Hospital Corporation in the United States and in certain foreign countries.\nALN-PCS. We have exclusively licensed from Alnylam patents covering RNAi therapeutics targeting PCSK9 for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia and other human diseases for purposes of developing and commercializing such RNAi therapeutics. Some of these patents are directed to general RNAi technology and expire between 2016 and 2028 in the United States. Other patents are directed to specific compositions of the PCSK9 product being developed under our license from Alnylam and to methods of treatment using such PCSK9 product and expire in May 2027 in the United States. In addition, Alnylam has filed and is prosecuting a number of patent applications in the United States and in certain foreign countries.\nCarbavance. As a result of our acquisition of Rempex, we acquired a portfolio of patent applications covering the composition of matter of Carbavance and its formulation and use. The principal U.S. patent for Carbavance is set to expire in August 2031 if no patent term extension is obtained. A corresponding patent application is pending in Europe and other foreign countries. In addition, we are currently prosecuting other patent applications relating to Carbavance\u2019s composition of matter and its use in the United States and in certain foreign countries.\nPreveLeak. As a result of our acquisition of Tenaxis, we acquired a portfolio of patents and patent applications covering PreveLeak, its uses and the process of making PreveLeak. The expiration dates of these U.S. patents range from September 2022\nto December 2028. In Europe, we have an issued patent covering PreveLeak which expires in December 2028. We are also currently prosecuting patent applications relating to PreveLeak in the United States and in certain foreign countries.\nWe plan to file applications for patent term extension for our products in development upon their approval. If we do not receive patent term extensions for the periods requested by us or at all, our patent protection for our products in development could be limited.\nWe are a party to a number of lawsuits that we brought against pharmaceutical companies that have notified us that they have filed ANDAs seeking approval to market generic versions of Angiomax. We cannot predict the outcome of these lawsuits. Involvement in litigation, regardless of its outcome, is time-consuming and expensive and may divert our management's time and attention. During the period in which these matters are pending, the uncertainty of their outcome may cause our stock price to decline. An adverse result in these matters whether appealable or not, will likely cause our stock price to decline. Any final, unappealable, adverse result in these matters will likely have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial conditions and cause our stock price to decline.\nIn addition to seeking to enforce our patent rights, we have in the past and may in the future seek to enforce our other intellectual property rights, including, for example, our trademark rights in order to prevent third parties from using the same or confusingly similar trademarks. We may not be successful in enforcing such rights and preventing such use. Further, certain of our trademark rights are licensed to us by third parties and, in certain circumstances, on a non-exclusive basis, which does not afford us the right to prevent third parties from using such trademarks. Failure to adequately pursue and enforce our intellectual property rights could damage our brands, enable others to compete with our products and impair our competitive position.\nIf upon expiration of our agreement with Lonza Braine, Lonza Braine breaches our agreement and fails to transfer the technology that was used to develop the Chemilog process, we would be unable to employ the Chemilog process to manufacture Angiomax bulk drug substance, which could cause us to experience delays in the manufacturing process and increase our manufacturing costs in the future.\nOur agreement with Lonza Braine for the supply of Angiomax bulk drug substance requires that Lonza Braine transfer the technology that was used to develop the Chemilog process to a secondary supplier of Angiomax bulk drug substance or to us or an alternate supplier at the expiration of the agreement, which is currently scheduled to occur in September 2016, but is subject to automatic renewals of consecutive three-year periods unless either party provides notice of non-renewal at least one year prior to the expiration of the initial term or any renewal term. If Lonza Braine fails or is unable to transfer successfully this technology, we would be unable to employ the Chemilog process to manufacture our Angiomax bulk drug substance, which could cause us to experience delays in the manufacturing process and increase our manufacturing costs in the future.\nIf we are not able to keep our trade secrets confidential, our technology and information may be used by others to compete against us.\nWe rely significantly upon unpatented proprietary technology, information, processes and know-how. We seek to protect this information by confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants and other third-party contractors, as well as through other security measures. We may not have adequate remedies for any breach by a party to these confidentiality agreements or invention assignment agreements. In addition, our competitors may learn or independently develop our trade secrets. If our confidential information or trade secrets become publicly known, they may lose their value to us.\nIf we infringe or are alleged to infringe intellectual property rights of third parties, our business may be adversely affected.\nOur research, development and commercialization activities, as well as any product candidates or products resulting from these activities, may infringe or be claimed to infringe patents or patent applications under which we do not hold licenses or other rights. Third parties may own or control these patents and patent applications in the United States and abroad. These third parties could bring claims against us or our collaborators that would cause us to incur substantial expenses and, if successful against us, could cause us to pay substantial damages. Further, if a patent infringement suit were brought against us or our collaborators, we or they could be forced to stop or delay research, development, manufacturing or sales of the product or product candidate that is the subject of the suit.\nAs a result of patent infringement claims, or in order to avoid potential claims, we or our collaborators may choose or be required to seek a license from the third party and be required to pay license fees or royalties or both. These licenses may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Even if we or our collaborators were able to obtain a license, the rights may be nonexclusive, which could result in our competitors gaining access to the same intellectual property. Ultimately, we could be prevented from commercializing a product, or be forced to cease some aspect of our business operations, if, as a result of actual or threatened\npatent infringement claims, we or our collaborators are unable to enter into licenses on acceptable terms. This could harm our business significantly.\nThere has been substantial litigation and other proceedings regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. In addition to infringement claims against us, we may become a party to other patent litigation and other proceedings, including interference proceedings declared by the PTO and opposition proceedings in the European Patent Office, regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our products and technology. Patent litigation and other proceedings may also absorb significant management time. The cost to us of any patent litigation or other proceeding, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their substantially greater financial resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace. Patent litigation and other proceedings may also absorb significant management time.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nFluctuations in our operating results could affect the price of our common stock.\nOur operating results may vary from period to period based on factors including the amount and timing of sales of and underlying hospital demand for our products, our customers' buying patterns, the timing, expenses and results of clinical trials, announcements regarding clinical trial results and product introductions by us or our competitors, the availability and timing of third-party reimbursement, including in Europe, sales and marketing expenses and the timing of regulatory approvals. If our operating results do not meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors as a result of these or other factors, the trading price of our common stock will likely decrease.\nThe warrant transactions and the derivative transactions that we entered into in connection with the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions may affect the price of our common stock.\nIn connection with the sale of the 2017 notes, we entered into convertible note hedge and warrant transactions with several of the initial purchasers of the 2017 notes, their affiliates and other financial institutions, whom we refer to as hedge counterparties. Upon settlement, the warrants could have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share and the market price of our common stock to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock exceeds the then applicable strike price of the warrants. However, subject to certain conditions, we may elect to settle all of the warrants in cash.\nIn connection with establishing their hedges of the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions, the hedge counterparties or their affiliates entered into various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock. These parties may modify their hedge positions in the future by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the 2017 notes (and are likely to do so during any observation period related to a conversion of the 2017 notes). These activities could cause a decrease or avoid an increase in the market price of our common stock.\nOur stock price has been and may in the future be volatile. This volatility may make it difficult for you to sell common stock when you want or at attractive prices.\nOur common stock has been and in the future may be subject to substantial price volatility. From January 1, 2013 to February 27, 2015, the last reported sale price of our common stock ranged from a high of $40.39 per share to a low of $20.36 per share. The value of your investment could decline due to the effect upon the market price of our common stock of any of the following factors, many of which are beyond our control:\n\u2022\napproval or rejection of submissions for marketing approval for our products and products in development;\n\u2022\nregulatory actions by the FDA or a foreign jurisdiction limiting or revoking the use of our products or products in development;\n\u2022\nchanges in securities analysts' estimates of our financial performance;\n\u2022\nchanges in valuations of similar companies;\n\u2022\nvariations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nacquisitions and strategic partnerships;\n\u2022\nannouncements of technological innovations or new commercial products by us or our competitors or the filing of ANDAs, NDAs or BLAs for products competitive with ours;\n\u2022\nannouncements of results of clinical trials or nonclinical studies by us or third parties relating to our products, products in development or those of our competitors or of regulatory proceedings by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe timing, amount and receipt of revenue from sales of our products and margins on sales of our products;\n\u2022\nchanges in governmental regulations;\n\u2022\ndevelopments in patent rights or other proprietary rights, particularly with respect to our U.S. Angiomax patents;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which Angiomax is commercially successful globally;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain market exclusivity for Angiomax in the United States through the enforcement of the '727 patent and the '343 patent during the period following the expiration of the patent term of the '404 patent on December 15, 2014 and the six month pediatric exclusivity on June 15, 2015 through at least May 1, 2019, the date on which we agreed APP may sell a generic version of Angiomax. If we lose our appeal of the adverse court decision we received in our patent infringement litigation with Hospira or if Mylan prevails in its appeal of the court decision we received in our patent infringement litigation with Mylan, or if we receive an adverse decision in any other patent infringement litigation relating to the \u2018727 patent or the \u2018343 patent, Angiomax could be subject to generic competition prior to May 1, 2019, and possibly as early as June 15, 2015;\n\u2022\ndevelopments in our ongoing litigation and significant new litigation;\n\u2022\ndevelopments or issues with our contract manufacturers;\n\u2022\nchanges in our management; and\n\u2022\ngeneral market conditions.\nWe believe that period-to-period comparisons of our financial results will not necessarily be indicative of our future performance. If our revenues in any particular period do not meet expectations, we may not be able to adjust our expenditures in that period, which could cause our operating results to suffer. If our operating results in any future period fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price may fall by a significant amount.\nThe stock markets in general, and The NASDAQ Global Select Market and the market for biopharmaceutical companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations recently. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. These broad market and industry factors may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.\nWe are currently subject to securities class action litigation and may be subject to similar or other litigation in the future, which may divert management\u2019s attention and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn February 2014, a class action lawsuit was filed against us and certain of our current and former officers alleging, among other things, that we and certain of our current and former officers violated federal securities laws because we and certain current and former officers allegedly made misrepresentations or did not make proper disclosures regarding the results of clinical trials which tested the efficacy and safety of cangrelor. The plaintiffs seek unspecified monetary damages on behalf of the putative class and an award of costs and expenses, including attorney\u2019s fees. The class action lawsuit is described in more detail in Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWhile we believe we have meritorious defenses, we cannot predict the outcome of this lawsuit. There may be additional suits or proceedings brought in the future. Monitoring and defending against legal actions, whether or not meritorious, is time-consuming for our management and detracts from our ability to fully focus our internal resources on our business activities, and we cannot predict how long it may take to resolve these matters. In addition, we may incur substantial legal fees and costs in connection with\nlitigation. Although we have insurance, coverage could be denied or prove to be insufficient. We are not currently able to estimate the possible cost to us from this lawsuit, as it is currently at an early stage, and we cannot be certain how long it may take to resolve or the possible amount of any damages, if any, that we may be required to pay. We have not established any reserves for any potential liability relating to this lawsuit. It is possible that we could, in the future, incur judgment or enter into settlement of claims for monetary damages. A decision adverse to our interests on this lawsuit could result in the payment of substantial damages and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the uncertainty of the currently pending lawsuit could lead to more volatility in our stock price.\nOur corporate governance structure, including provisions in our certificate of incorporation and by-laws and Delaware law, may prevent a change in control or management that security holders may consider desirable.\nThe General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and our certificate of incorporation and by-laws contain provisions that might enable our management to resist a takeover of our company or discourage a third party from attempting to take over our company. These provisions include\n\u2022\nSection 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which provides that we may not enter into a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in the manner prescribed in Section 203;\n\u2022\nour board of directors has the authority to issue, without a vote or action of stockholders, up to 5,000,000 shares of a new series of preferred stock and to fix the price, rights, preferences and privileges of those shares, each of which could be superior to the rights of holders of our common stock;\n\u2022\nour directors are elected to staggered terms, which prevents our entire board of directors from being replaced in any single year;\n\u2022\nour directors may be removed only for cause and then only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75% of the votes which all stockholders would be entitled to cast in any annual election of directors;\n\u2022\nthe size of our board of directors is determined by resolution of the board of directors;\n\u2022\nany vacancy on our board of directors, however occurring, including a vacancy resulting from an enlargement of our board, may only be filled by vote of a majority of our directors then in office, even if less than a quorum;\n\u2022\nonly our board of directors, the chairman of the board or our president may call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u2022\nour by-laws may be amended, altered or repealed by (i) the affirmative vote of a majority of our directors, subject to any limitations set forth in the by-laws, or (ii) the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75% of the votes which all the stockholders would be entitled to cast in any annual election of directors;\n\u2022\nstockholders must provide us with advance notice, and certain information specified in our by-laws, in connection with nominations or proposals by such stockholder for consideration at an annual meeting;\n\u2022\nstockholders may not take any action by written consent in lieu of a meeting; and\n\u2022\nour certificate of incorporation may only be amended or repealed by the affirmative vote of a majority of our directors and the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75% of the votes which all the stockholders would be entitled to cast in any annual election of directors (and plus any separate class vote that might in the future be required pursuant to the terms of any series of preferred stock that might be outstanding at the time any of these amendments are submitted to stockholders).\nThese provisions could have the effect of delaying, deferring, or preventing a change in control of us or a change in our management that stockholders may consider favorable or beneficial. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock or our other securities.\nOur business could be negatively affected as a result of the actions of activist shareholders.\nProxy contests have been waged against many companies in the biopharmaceutical industry over the last few years. If faced with a proxy contest, we may not be able to successfully defend against the contest, which would be disruptive to our business. Even if we are successful, our business could be adversely affected by a proxy contest because:\n\u2022\nresponding to proxy contests and other actions by activist shareholders may be costly and time-consuming and may disrupt our operations and divert the attention of management and our employees;\n\u2022\nperceived uncertainties as to our future direction may result in our inability to consummate potential acquisitions, collaborations or in-licensing opportunities and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners; and\n\u2022\nif individuals are elected to our board of directors with a specific agenda different from ours, it may adversely affect our ability to effectively and timely implement our strategic plan and create additional value for our stockholders.", "PERMNO": 88545, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "MDCO"}
