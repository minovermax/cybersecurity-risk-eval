RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report and the exhibits hereto, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business. Our business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. This section contains forward-looking statements. You should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements at the end of Item 1 and Item 7 of this Annual Report.\nIf we are unable to successfully expand our product lines through internal research & development and acquisitions, our business may be materially and adversely affected.\nContinued growth of our business depends on our maintaining a pipeline of profitable new products and successful improvements to our existing products. This requires accurate market analysis and carefully targeted application of intellectual and financial resources toward technological innovation or acquisition of new products. The creation and adoption of technological advances is only one step. We must also efficiently develop the technology into a product which confers a competitive advantage, represents a cost effective solution or provides improved patient care. Finally, as a part of the regulatory process of obtaining marketing clearance for new products, we conduct and participate in numerous clinical trials, the results of which may be unfavorable, or perceived as unfavorable by the market, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe risks of missteps and set backs are an inherent part of the innovation and development processes in the medical device industry.\nIf we are unable to successfully grow our business through business relationships and acquisitions, our business may be materially and adversely affected.\nPromising partnerships and acquisitions may not be completed for reasons such as competition among prospective partners or buyers, our inability to reach satisfactory terms, or the need for regulatory approvals. Any acquisition that we complete may be dilutive to earnings and require the investment of significant resources. The economic environment may constrain our ability to access the capital needed for acquisitions and other capital investments.\nA significant portion of our revenue derives from the sale of blood collection supplies. Future declines in the number of blood collection procedures may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSales to blood collectors represented 43.3% of our consolidated disposables revenues in fiscal 2015. In certain markets, changes in medical protocols and the development of less invasive, lower blood loss procedures has reduced the number of transfusions of red blood cells, which has in turn led to a decline in the number of blood collection procedures. This is particularly true in the United States where we saw collections decline by approximately 10% in fiscal 2014 and 2015, however we expect this trend to moderate in fiscal 2016. If we are unable to gain and maintain higher market share, lower procedure levels could result in lower net revenues and higher product costs.\nConsolidation of the healthcare providers and blood collectors has increased demand for price concessions and caused the exclusion of suppliers from significant market segments, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe costs of healthcare in the United States have risen significantly over the past decade. Numerous initiatives and reform by legislators, regulators and third-party payers to curb these costs has reduced reimbursement rates which is causing hospitals to consolidate into larger integrated delivery networks and group purchasing organizations in an effort to reduce administrative costs and increase purchasing power. This consolidation has resulted in greater pricing pressure on suppliers, decreased average selling prices and a greater number of sole source relationships. This pressure impacts our Hospital and Blood Center businesses.\nThe expansion among hospitals in the United States of group purchasing organizations, integrated delivery networks and large single accounts directly puts price pressure on our Hospital business. It also puts price pressure on our United States Blood Center customers who are also facing reduced demand for red cells. Our Blood Center customers have responded to this pressure by creating their own group purchasing organizations and resorting to single source tenders to create incentives for suppliers, including us, to significantly reduce prices.\nWe expect that market demand, government regulation, third-party reimbursement policies, government contracting requirements and societal pressures will continue to change the worldwide healthcare industry, resulting in further business consolidations and alliances among our customers and competitors. This may exert further downward pressure on the prices of our products and adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nQuality problems with our processes, goods, and services could harm our reputation for producing high-quality products and erode our competitive advantage, sales, and market share.\nQuality is extremely important to us and our customers due to the serious and costly consequences of product failure. Our quality certifications are critical to the marketing success of our products and services. If we fail to meet these standards or fail to adapt to evolving standards, our reputation could be damaged, we could lose customers, and our revenue and results of operations could decline.\nAs approximately half of our revenue comes from outside the United States, we are subject to currency fluctuation, geopolitical risk, economic volatility, anti-corruption laws, export and import restrictions, local regulatory authorities and the laws and medical practices in foreign jurisdictions.\nWe do business in over 100 countries and have distributors in approximately 90 countries. This exposes us to currency fluctuation, geopolitical risk, economic volatility, anti-corruption laws, export and import restrictions, local regulatory authorities and the laws and medical practices in foreign jurisdictions.\nIf there are sanctions or restrictions on the flow of capital which prevent product importation or receipt of payments in Russia or China, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur international operations are governed by the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and other similar anti-corruption laws in other countries. Generally, these laws prohibit companies and their business partners or other intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign governments and government officials in order to obtain or retain business. Global enforcement of such anti-corruption laws has increased in recent years, including aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings. While we have an active compliance program and various other safeguards to discourage impermissible practices, we have distributors in 90 countries, several of which are considered high risk for corruption. As a result, our global operations carry some risk of unauthorized impermissible activity on the part of one of our distributors, employees, agents or consultants. Any alleged or actual violation could subject us to government scrutiny, severe criminal or civil fines, or sanctions on our ability to export product outside the U.S., which could adversely affect our reputation and financial condition.\nExport of U.S. technology or goods manufactured in the United States to some jurisdictions requires special U.S. export authorization or local market controls that may be influenced by factors, including political dynamics, outside our control.\nFinally, any other significant changes in the competitive, legal, regulatory, reimbursement or economic environments of the jurisdictions in which we conduct our international business could have a material impact on our business.\nAn interruption in our ability to manufacture our products or an inability to obtain key components or raw materials may adversely affect our business.\nCertain key products are manufactured at single locations, with limited alternate facilities. If an event occurs that results in damage to one or more of our facilities, we may be unable to manufacture the relevant products at previous levels or at all. In addition, for reasons of quality assurance or cost effectiveness, we purchase certain finished goods, components and raw materials from sole suppliers, notably JMS Co. Ltd., Kawasumi Laboratories and Sanmina Corporation. Due to the stringent regulations and requirements of the FDA and other similar non-U.S. regulatory agencies regarding the manufacture of our products, we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for certain components or materials. A reduction or interruption in manufacturing, or an inability to secure alternative sources of raw materials or components, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIf we are unable to meet our debt obligations or experience a disruption in our cash flows, it could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, ability to complete our share repurchase program or cost of borrowing.\nWe have $429.4 million in debt outstanding at March 28, 2015 which was incurred to acquire the whole blood business. The obligations to pay interest and repay the borrowed amounts may restrict our ability to adjust to adverse economic conditions, our ability to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisition or other general corporate requirements. The interest rate on the loan is variable and subject to change based on market forces. Fluctuations in interest rates could adversely affect our profitability and cash flows.\nIn addition, as a global corporation we have significant cash reserves held in foreign countries. These balances may not be immediately available to repay our debt.\nOur credit facilities contain financial covenants that require us to maintain specified financial ratios and make interest and principal payments. If we are unable to satisfy these covenants, we may be required to obtain waivers from our lenders and no assurance can be made that our lenders would grant such waivers on favorable terms, or at all, and we could be required to repay any borrowed amounts on short notice.\nAs a medical device manufacturer we are subject to a number of laws and regulations. Non-compliance with those laws or regulations could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe manufacture, distribution and marketing of our products are subject to regulation by the FDA and other non-United States regulatory bodies. We must obtain specific regulatory clearance prior to selling any new product or service, a process which is costly and time consuming. If we are unable to obtain the necessary regulatory clearance we will be unable to introduce new enhanced product. Our operations are also subject to continuous review and monitoring by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. Failure to substantially comply with applicable regulations could subject our products to recall or seizure by government authorities, or an order to suspend manufacturing activities. If our products were determined to have design or manufacturing flaws, this could result in their recall or seizure. Either of these situations could also result in the imposition of fines.\nMany of our competitors have significantly greater financial means and resources, which may allow them to more rapidly develop new technologies and more quickly address changes in customer requirements.\nOur ability to remain competitive depends on a combination of factors. Certain factors are within our control such as reputation, regulatory approvals, patents, unpatented proprietary know-how in several technological areas, product quality, safety, cost effectiveness and continued rigorous documentation of clinical performance. Other factors are outside of our control such as regulatory standards, medical standards, reimbursement policies and practices, and the practice of medicine.\nLoss of a significant customer could adversely affect our business.\nIn fiscal 2015, although no one customer represented more than 10% of our revenues, our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 48.1% of our revenue. If any of our largest customers materially reduce their purchases from us or terminate their relationship with us for any reason, we could experience an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nWe may not realize the expected benefits from our Value Creation and Capture initiatives; our plans will result in higher short-term expenses and require more cash expenditures.\nIn May 2013, we announced a multi-year Value Creation and Capture initiatives which is intended to reduce our manufacturing costs by changing our current manufacturing footprint and supply chain strategy. This program has reduced manufacturing costs and improved supply chain efficiency and we expect further benefits upon completion. However, there are no assurances these further cost savings or supply chain efficiencies will be achieved, and completion of the program could introduce risks such as management distraction, business disruption, and attrition beyond our planned reduction in workforce and reduced employee productivity which may reduce our revenue or increase our costs. In addition, the activities involve the relocation of several product lines to new manufacturing facilities. During these transitions, we may experience challenges in transferring production to the new locations, additional costs, or unacceptable quality. These may lead to additional working capital, warranty or inventory costs. Finally, implementing the program will result in charges and expenses that impact our operating results and increase our level of capital expenditures. We expect the investment in this program to be completed in fiscal 2016.\nCurrent or worsening economic conditions may adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nA portion of our trade accounts receivable outside the United States include sales to government-owned or supported healthcare systems in several countries, which are subject to payment delays. Payment is dependent upon the financial stability and creditworthiness of those countries\u2019 national economies. Worsening economic conditions may lead to the rationing of care or reduced order patterns. Although, we have not incurred significant losses on government receivables to date, we continually evaluate all government receivables for potential collection risks associated with the availability of government funding and reimbursement practices. If the financial condition of customers or the countries\u2019 healthcare systems deteriorate such that their ability to make payments is uncertain, allowances may be required in future periods.\nAs a global corporation, we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations.\nInternational revenues and expenses account for a substantial portion of our operations and we intend to continue expanding our presence in international markets. In fiscal 2015, our international revenues accounted for 45.6% of our total revenues. The exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates takes different forms. Reported revenues, as well as manufacturing and operational costs denominated in foreign currencies by our international businesses, fluctuate due to exchange rate movement when translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. Fluctuations in exchange rates could adversely affect our profitability in U.S. dollars of products and services sold by us into international markets, where payment for our products and services and related manufacturing and operational costs is made in local currencies.\nWe may record future goodwill impairment charges or other asset impairment charges, which could materially adversely impact our results of operations.\nGoodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually in accordance with ASC Topic 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, or on an interim basis between annual tests when events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying value. We perform our annual impairment test on the first day of the fiscal fourth quarter. We first perform a qualitative test and if necessary, perform a quantitative test. The quantitative test is based on a discounted cash flow analysis or other valuation techniques, such as the market approach. We review intangible assets subject to amortization at least annually or more frequently if certain conditions arise to determine if any adverse conditions exist that would indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable, or that a change in the remaining useful life is required. If an impairment indicator exists, we test the intangible asset for recoverability.\nGoodwill impairment charges or other asset impairment charges could materially adversely impact our results of operations in the period in which they are recorded. Refer to Critical Accounting Policies within our Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of key assumptions used in our testing.\nWe are subject to the risks associated with communicable diseases. A significant outbreak of a disease could reduce the demand for our products and affect our ability to provide our customers with products and services.\nAn eligible donor\u2019s willingness to donate is affected by concerns about their personal health and safety. Concerns about communicable diseases (such as pandemic flu, SARS, or HIV) could reduce the number of donors, and accordingly reduce the demand for our products for a period of time. A significant outbreak of a disease could also affect our employees\u2019 ability to work, which could limit our ability to produce product and service our customers.\nThere is a risk that the Company\u2019s intellectual property may be subject to misappropriation in some countries.\nCertain countries, particularly China, do not enforce compliance with laws that protect intellectual property (\u201cIP\u201d) rights with the same degree of vigor as is available under the U.S. and European systems of justice. Further, certain of the Company\u2019s IP rights are not registered in China, or if they were, have since expired. This may permit others to produce copies of products in China that are not covered by currently valid patent registrations. There is also a risk that such products may be exported from China to other countries.\nIn order to aggressively protect our IP throughout the world, we have a program of patent disclosures and filings in markets where we conduct significant business. While we believe this program is reasonable and adequate, the risk of loss is inherent in litigation as different legal systems offer different levels of protection to IP, and it is still possible that even patented technologies may not be protected absolutely from infringement.\nPending and future intellectual property litigation could be costly and disruptive to us.\nWe operate in an industry that is susceptible to significant intellectual property litigation. This type of litigation is expensive, complex and lengthy and its outcome is difficult to predict. Patent litigation may result in adverse outcomes and could significantly divert the attention of our technical and management personnel.\nThe technologies that support our products are the subject of active patent prosecution.\nThere is a risk that one or more of our products may be determined to infringe a patent held by another party. If this were to occur we may be subject to an injunction or to payment of royalties, or both, which may adversely affect our ability to market the affected product(s). In addition, competitors may patent technological advances which may give them a competitive advantage or create barriers to entry.\nWe sell our products in certain emerging economies.\nThere are risks with doing business in emerging economies, such as Brazil, Russia, India and China. These economies tend to have less mature product regulatory systems, and more volatile financial markets. In addition, the government controlled health care system's ability to invest in our products and systems may abruptly shift due to changing government priorities or funding capacity. Our ability to sell products in these economies is dependent upon our ability to hire qualified employees or agents to represent our products locally, and our ability to obtain and maintain the necessary regulatory approvals in a less mature regulatory environment. If we are unable to retain qualified representatives or maintain the necessary regulatory approvals, we will not be able to continue to sell products in these markets. We are exposed to a higher degree of financial risk if we extend credit to customers in these economies.\nIn many of the international markets in which we do business, including certain parts of Europe, South America, the Middle East, Russia and Asia, our employees, agents or distributors offer to sell our products in response to public tenders issued by various governmental agencies.\nThere is additional risk in selling our products through agents or distributors, particularly in public tenders. If they misrepresent our products, do not provide appropriate service and delivery, or commit a violation of local or U.S. law, our reputation could be harmed, and we could be subject to fines, sanctions or both.\nWe have a complex global supply chain which includes key sole source suppliers.\nWe have a complex global supply chain which involves integrating key suppliers and our manufacturing capacity into a global movement of components and finished goods.\nWe have certain key suppliers, including JMS Co. Ltd. (\"JMS\"), Kawasumi Laboratories (\"Kawasumi\") and Sanmina Corporation, who have their own complex supply chains. JMS and Kawasumi make certain finished goods and important sub components in locations throughout Asia. We have engaged Sanmina Corporation to be the sole manufacturer of certain equipment as part of our manufacturing network optimization activities.\nAny disruption to one or more of our suppliers\u2019 production or delivery of sufficient volumes of subcomponents conforming to our specifications could disrupt or delay our ability to deliver finished products to our customers. For example, we purchase components in Asia for use in manufacturing in the United States, Puerto Rico, Mexico and Scotland. We also regularly ship finished goods from the United States, Puerto Rico, Mexico and Scotland to Europe and Asia.\nPlastics are the principal component of our disposables, which are the main source of our revenues. Any change in the price, composition or availability of the plastics we purchase could adversely affect our business.\nWe have three risks with this key raw material: price, composition and availability.\nIncreases in the price of petroleum derivatives could result in corresponding increases in our costs to procure plastic raw materials. Increases in the costs of other commodities may affect our procurement costs to a lesser degree.\nThe composition of the plastic we purchase is also important. Today, we purchase plastics which contain phthalates, which are used to make plastic malleable. Should plastics with phthalates become unavailable due to regulatory changes, we may be required to obtain new FDA or foreign approvals for a number of products.\nWhile we have not experienced shortages in the past, any interruption in the supply for certain plastics could have a material impact on our business by limiting our ability to manufacture and sell the products which represent a significant portion of our revenues.\nOur products are made with materials which are subject to regulation by governmental agencies.\nEnvironmental regulations may prohibit the use of certain compounds in products we market and sell in regulated markets. If we are unable to substitute suitable materials into our processes, our manufacturing operations may be disrupted. In addition, we may be obligated to disclose the origin of certain materials used in our products, including but not limited to, metals mined from locations which have been the site of human rights violations.\nWe are entrusted with sensitive personal information relating to surgical patients, blood donors, employees and other persons in the course of operating our business and serving our customers.\nGovernment agencies require that we implement measures to ensure the integrity and security of such personal data and, in the event of a breach of protocol, we inform affected individuals. If our systems are not properly designed or implemented, or should suffer a breach of security or an intrusion (e.g., \u201chacking\u201d) by unauthorized persons, the Company\u2019s reputation could be harmed, and it could incur costs and liabilities to affected persons and enforcement agencies.\nWe rely on the proper function, availability and security of information technology systems to operate our business and to serve our customers and a cyber-attack or other breach of these systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe rely on information technology systems to process, transmit, and store electronic information in our day-to-day operations. Similar to other large multi-national companies, the size and complexity of our information technology systems makes them vulnerable to a cyber-attack, malicious intrusion, breakdown, destruction, loss of data privacy, or other significant disruption. Our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect, and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving systems and regulatory standards, the increasing need to protect patient and customer information, and changing customer patterns. In addition, third parties may attempt to hack into our products to obtain data relating to patients with our products or\nour proprietary information. Any failure by us to maintain or protect our information technology systems and data integrity, including from cyber-attacks, intrusions or other breaches, could result in the unauthorized access to patient data and personally identifiable information, theft of intellectual property or other misappropriation of assets, or otherwise compromise our confidential or proprietary information and disrupt our operations. Any of these events, in turn, may cause us to lose existing customers, have difficulty preventing, detecting, and controlling fraud, have disputes with customers, physicians, and other health care professionals, be subject to legal claims and liability, have regulatory sanctions or penalties imposed, have increases in operating expenses, incur expenses or lose revenues as a result of a data privacy breach or theft of intellectual property, or suffer other adverse consequences, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe operate in an industry susceptible to significant product liability claims.\nOur products are relied upon by medical personnel in connection with the treatment of patients and the collection of blood from donors. In the event that patients or donors sustain injury or death in connection with their condition or treatment, we, along with others, may be sued, and whether or not we are ultimately determined to be liable, we may incur significant legal expenses. These claims may be brought by individuals seeking relief on their own behalf or purporting to represent a class. In addition, product liability claims may be asserted against us in the future based on events we are not aware of at the present time.\nIn addition, such litigation could damage our reputation and, therefore, impair our ability to market our products, obtain professional or product liability insurance, or increase the cost of such insurance. While we believe that our current product liability insurance coverage is sufficient, there is no assurance that such coverage will be adequate to cover incurred liabilities or that we will be able to obtain acceptable product and professional liability coverage in the future.", "PERMNO": 76837, "SIC": 3841, "TIC": "HAE"}
