{"cik": "1109196", "company": "MABVAX THERAPEUTICS HOLDINGS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-04-02", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors.\nOur business faces significant risks, some of which are set forth below to enable readers to assess, and be appropriately apprised of, many of the risks and uncertainties applicable to the forward-looking statements made in this Annual Report. You should carefully consider these risk factors as each of these risks could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. If any of the events or circumstances described in the following risks actually occurs, our business may suffer, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and our financial condition or results of operations could be harmed. Given these risks and uncertainties, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. These risks should be read in conjunction with the other information set forth in this Annual Report. There may be additional risks faced by our business, though we do believe that the risks set forth below reflect the more important ones.\nRisks Relating to Our Financial Condition\nWe will be required to raise additional funds to finance our operations and remain a going concern; we may not be able to do so when necessary, and/or the terms of any financings may not be advantageous to us, requiring cutbacks in personnel.\nOur operations to date have consumed substantial amounts of cash. Negative cash flows from our operations are expected to continue over at least the next several years. Our cash needs are highly dependent on the progress of our product development programs, particularly, the results of our preclinical and clinical studies and those of our partners, the cost, timing and outcomes of regulatory approval for our product candidates, and the rate of recruitment of patients in our human clinical trials. In addition, the further development of our ongoing clinical trials will depend on upcoming analysis and results of those studies and our financial resources at that time.\nAlthough we raised approximately $9.4 million, net of offering costs, during 2017, through various financings and offerings, and an additional $2.7 million, net of offering costs in the first quarter of 2018, we will require future additional capital infusions including public or private financing, strategic partnerships or other arrangements with organizations that have capabilities and/or products that are complementary to our own capabilities and/or products, in order to continue the development of our product candidates. As of April 2, 2018, we have sufficient cash to fund operations through April 2018 assuming we do not complete any strategic or financing transactions between now and the end of April 2018. We are exploring and evaluating strategic options with the goal of maximizing stockholder value, and currently working with our financial advisor Greenhill & Co., to assist us with our efforts to complete one or more strategic transactions.\nOur ongoing capital requirements will depend on numerous factors, including: the progress and results of preclinical testing and clinical trials of our product candidates under development; the costs of complying with the FDA and other domestic and foreign regulatory agency requirements, the progress of our research and development programs and those of our partners; the time and costs expended and required to obtain any necessary or desired regulatory approvals; the resources that we devote to manufacturing expenditures; our ability to enter into licensing arrangements, including any unanticipated licensing arrangements that may be necessary to enable us to continue our development and clinical trial programs; the costs and expenses of filing, prosecuting and, if necessary, enforcing our patent claims, or defending against possible claims of infringement by third-party patent or other technology rights; the cost of commercialization activities and arrangements, if any, that we undertake; and, if and when approved, the demand for our products, which demand depends in turn on circumstances and uncertainties that cannot be fully known, understood or quantified unless and until the time of approval, including the range of indications for which any product is granted approval. If we are unable to raise additional capital, then we may have to substantially curtail our clinical trials which could slow the progress in the development of our products.\nWe are required to obtain the consent of an existing investor, or the Lead Investor, to certain future transactions, which may hinder our ability to obtain future financing.\nSince July 8, 2014, we have been subject to restrictions on financing and other material transactions of the Company that require the consent of a lead investor in our offerings (the \u201cLead Investor\u201d). Additionally, we granted the Lead Investor in our public offering in May 2017 (the \u201cMay 2017 Public Offering\u201d) the right of consent to approve future (i) issuances of our securities, (ii) equity or debt financings and (iii) sales of any development product assets currently held by us, subject to certain exceptions, if such securities are sold at price below $7.50 per share and for as long as the Lead Investor in the offering holds 50% or more of the shares of Series G Convertible Preferred Stock (the \u201cSeries G Preferred Stock\u201d) purchased by the Lead Investor in this offering (the \u201cMay 2017 Consent Right\u201d). On October 18, 2017, the Lead Investor exchanged its Series G Preferred Stock for Series L Convertible Preferred Stock (the \u201cSeries L Preferred Stock\u201d), retaining the May 2017 Consent Right. All other prior consent rights of the Lead Investor have been superseded by the May 2017 Consent Right.\nShould the May 2017 Consent Right be required in connection with future offerings, we may be required again to provide additional consideration, including, but not limited to, consideration in the form of cash and/or additional shares of our capital stock and/or securities convertible into or exercisable for shares of our capital stock, in order to obtain the May 2017 Consent Right. If we are unable to obtain the May 2017 Consent Right when necessary for future offerings, we may be unable to raise additional funds. An inability to raise additional funds could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, ability to conduct our business and on the price of our common stock.\nThe terms of our secured debt facility require us to meet certain operating and financial covenants and place restrictions on our operating and financial flexibility. If we raise additional capital through debt financing, the terms of any new debt could further restrict our ability to operate our business.\nEffective in January 2016, we entered into a $10 million loan and security agreement with Oxford Finance LLC, or Oxford Finance, that is secured by a lien covering substantially all of our assets, excluding intellectual property. December 31, 2017, we had an outstanding principal balance of approximately $3.6 million. The option to draw the second $5 million expired on September 30, 2016. The loan and security agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default. The affirmative covenants include, among others, covenants requiring us to maintain our legal existence and governmental approvals, deliver certain financial reports and maintain insurance coverage. The negative covenants include, among others, restrictions on transferring collateral, changing our business, incurring additional indebtedness, engaging in mergers or acquisitions, paying dividends or making other distributions, making investments and creating other liens on our assets, in each case subject to customary exceptions. As of December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with all the covenants. If we default under the loan agreement, the lenders may accelerate all of our repayment obligations and take control of our pledged assets, potentially requiring us to renegotiate our agreement on terms less favorable to us or to immediately cease operations. Further, if we are liquidated, the lender\u2019s right to repayment would be senior to the rights of the holders of our common stock and preferred stock to receive any proceeds from the liquidation. The lenders could declare a default upon the occurrence of any event that they interpret as a material adverse change as defined under the loan agreement, thereby requiring us to repay the loan immediately or to attempt to reverse the declaration of default through negotiation or litigation. Any declaration by the lenders of an event of default could significantly harm our business and prospects and could cause the price of our common stock to decline. If we raise any additional debt financing, the terms of such additional debt could further restrict our operating and financial flexibility.\nWe have a history of losses, and we anticipate that we will continue to incur losses in the future; our auditors have included in their audit report an explanatory paragraph as to substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe have experienced net losses every year since our inception and, as of December 31, 2017, had an accumulated deficit of $111,053,637. Our auditors have included in their audit report a \u201cgoing concern\u201d explanatory paragraph as to substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern that assumes the realization of our assets and the satisfaction of our liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. Until such time as we have completed more than one license agreement for our technology, and assuming we have sufficient funding from such licenses and financing transactions to continue to sustain operations, we anticipate continuing to incur substantial additional losses over at least the next several years due to, among other factors, expenses related to the following: continuing Phase I clinical trials of MVT-5873 in combination with a chemotherapy agent and MVT-1075 as a radioimmunotherapy agent, for the treatment of various cancers, preclinical testing of follow-on antibody candidates, investor and public relations, SEC compliance efforts, anticipated research and development activities and the general and administrative expenses associated with each of these activities. We have not yet commercialized any product candidates. Our ability to attain profitability will depend upon our ability to enter into material revenue generating license arrangements, develop and commercialize products that are effective and commercially viable, to obtain regulatory approval for the manufacture and sale of our products and to license or otherwise market our products successfully. We may never achieve profitability, and even if we do, we may not be able to sustain being profitable. If we are unable to obtain additional capital we may be forced to license, sell or terminate our activities with respect to promising technologies which may require us to agree to disadvantageous terms that will prevent us from realizing the potential value from the results of our efforts and expenditures.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nIf we are unable to obtain required regulatory approvals, we will be unable to market and sell our product candidates.\nOur product candidates are subject to extensive governmental regulations relating to development, clinical trials, manufacturing, oversight of clinical investigators, recordkeeping and commercialization. Rigorous preclinical testing and clinical trials and an extensive regulatory review and approval process are required to be successfully completed in the United States and in each foreign jurisdiction in which we offer our products before a new drug or other product can be sold in such jurisdictions. Satisfaction of these and other regulatory requirements is costly, time consuming, uncertain, and subject to unanticipated delays. The time required to obtain approval by the FDA, or the regulatory authority in such other jurisdictions is unpredictable and often exceeds five years following the commencement of clinical trials, depending upon the complexity of the product candidate and the requirements of the applicable regulatory agency.\nIn connection with the clinical development of our product candidates, we face risks that:\n\u25cf\nthe product candidate may not prove to be safe and efficacious;\n\u25cf\npatients may die or suffer serious adverse effects for reasons that may or may not be related to the product candidate being tested;\n\u25cf\nwe may fail to maintain adequate records of observations and data from our clinical trials, to establish and maintain sufficient procedures to oversee, collect data from, and manage clinical trials, or to monitor clinical trial sites and investigators to the satisfaction of the FDA or other regulatory agencies;\n\u25cf\nthe results of later-phase clinical trials may not confirm the results of earlier clinical trials; and\n\u25cf\nthe results from clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical significance or clinical benefit-to-risk ratio required by the FDA or other regulatory agencies for marketing approval.\nOnly a small percentage of product candidates for which clinical trials are initiated receive approval for commercialization. Furthermore, even if we do receive regulatory approval to market a product candidate, any such approval may be subject to limitations such as those on the indicated uses for which we may market a product candidate.\nOur product candidates have not completed sufficient clinical trials to obtain regulatory approval and may never demonstrate sufficient safety and efficacy in order to do so.\nOur product candidates are in the clinical and pre-clinical stages of development. To achieve profitable operations, we alone, or in collaboration with others, must successfully license, develop, manufacture, introduce and market our products. The time frame necessary to achieve market success for any individual product, whether we or our potential strategic partners develop, is long and uncertain. The products we are currently developing will require significant additional research, development and preclinical and clinical testing prior to application for commercial use or sale. Several companies in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries have suffered significant setbacks in clinical trials, even after showing promising results in early or later-stage studies or clinical trials. Although we have obtained some favorable results to-date in preclinical studies and clinical trials of certain of our potential products, such results may not be indicative of results that will ultimately be obtained in or throughout such clinical trials, and clinical trials may not show any of our products to be safe or capable of producing a desired result. Additionally, we may encounter problems in our clinical trials that may cause us to delay, suspend or terminate those clinical trials.\nFurther, our research or product development efforts may not be successfully completed, any compounds we currently have under development may not be successfully developed into drugs, may not receive regulatory approval on a timely basis, if at all, and competitors may develop and bring to market products or technologies that render our potential products obsolete. If any of these events occur, our business would be materially and adversely affected.\nIf clinical trials or regulatory approval processes for our product candidates are prolonged, delayed or suspended, we may be unable to commercialize our product candidates on a timely basis, which would require us to incur additional costs and delay our receipt of any revenue from potential product sales.\nWe cannot predict whether we, or our strategic partners if our product candidates are licensed, will encounter problems with any of our completed, ongoing or planned clinical trials that will cause us or any regulatory authority to delay or suspend those clinical trials or delay the analysis of data derived from them. Several events, including any of the following, could delay the completion of our ongoing and planned clinical trials and negatively impact our ability to obtain regulatory approval for, and to market and sell, a particular product candidate:\n\u25cf\nconditions imposed on us by the FDA or another foreign regulatory authority regarding the scope or design of our clinical trials;\n\u25cf\ndelays in obtaining, or our inability to obtain, required approvals from institutional review boards or other reviewing entities at clinical sites selected for participation in our clinical trials;\n\u25cf\ninsufficient supply of our product candidates or other materials necessary to conduct and complete our clinical trials;\n\u25cf\nslow enrollment and retention rate of subjects in our clinical trials;\n\u25cf\nserious and unexpected drug-related side effects related to the product candidate being tested; and\n\u25cf\ndelays in meeting manufacturing and testing standards required for production of clinical trial supplies.\nCommercialization of our product candidates may be delayed by the imposition of additional conditions on our clinical trials by the FDA or any other applicable foreign regulatory authority or the requirement of additional supportive studies by the FDA or such foreign regulatory authority. In addition, clinical trials require sufficient patient enrollment, which is a function of many factors, including the size of the patient population, the nature of the trial protocol, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the availability of effective treatments for the relevant disease, the conduct of other clinical trials that compete for the same patients as our clinical trials, and the eligibility criteria for our clinical trials. Our failure to enroll patients in our clinical trials could delay the completion of the clinical trial beyond its expectations. In addition, the FDA could require us to conduct clinical trials with a larger number of subjects than we may have projected for any of our product candidates. We may not be able to enroll a sufficient number of patients in a timely or cost-effective manner. Furthermore, enrolled patients may drop out of our clinical trials, which could impair the validity or statistical significance of the clinical trials.\nWe do not know whether our clinical trials will begin as planned, will need to be restructured, or will be completed on schedule, if at all. Delays in our clinical trials will result in increased development costs for our product candidates, and our financial resources may be insufficient to fund any incremental costs. In addition, if our clinical trials are delayed, our competitors may be able to bring products to market before we do and the commercial viability of our product candidates could be limited. In cases where an outside party, such as the NCI conducts a clinical trial on our behalf, we may not have direct involvement in discussions with the FDA regarding the factors discussed above.\nWe are substantially dependent on the success of our product candidates, MVT-5873, MVT-1075 and MVT-2163, and we cannot provide any assurance that any of our product candidates will be commercialized.\nTo date, our focus and the investment of a significant portion of our efforts and financial resources has been in the development of our product candidates, MVT-5873, MVT-1075, and MVT-2163, which are in clinical development. Our future success depends heavily on our ability to successfully license, manufacture, develop, obtain regulatory approval, and commercialize these product candidates, which may never occur. Before commercializing either product candidate, we or any potential strategic partner will require additional clinical trials and regulatory approvals for which there can be no guarantee that we or our potential strategic partners will be successful. We currently generate no revenues from our product candidates, and we may never be able to develop, license or commercialize a marketable drug.\nOur product candidates will remain subject to ongoing regulatory review even if they receive marketing approval, and if we or our potential strategic partners fail to comply with continuing regulations, we or our strategic partners could lose these approvals and the sale of any of our approved commercial products could be suspended.\nEven if we receive regulatory approval to market a product candidate, the manufacturing, labeling, packaging, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion, and record keeping related to the product will remain subject to extensive regulatory requirements. If we fail to comply with the regulatory requirements of the FDA and other applicable domestic and foreign regulatory authorities or discover any previously unknown problems with any approved product, manufacturer, or manufacturing process, we could be subject to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions, including:\n\u25cf\nrestrictions on the products, manufacturers, or manufacturing processes;\n\u25cf\nwarning letters;\n\u25cf\ncivil or criminal penalties;\n\u25cf\nfines;\n\u25cf\ninjunctions;\n\u25cf\nproduct seizures or detentions;\n\u25cf\npressure to initiate voluntary product recalls;\n\u25cf\nsuspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals; and\n\u25cf\nrefusal to approve pending applications for marketing approval of new products or supplements to approved applications.\nOur industry is highly competitive, and our product candidates may become obsolete.\nWe are engaged in a rapidly evolving field. Competition from other pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies and research and academic institutions is intense and likely to increase. Many of those companies and institutions have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do. Those companies and institutions also have substantially greater experience in developing products, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approval and in manufacturing and marketing pharmaceutical products. Our competitors may succeed in obtaining regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we do. Competitors have developed or are in the process of developing technologies that are, or in the future may be, the basis for competitive products. We are aware of potential competitors developing products similar to our sarcoma vaccine, ovarian cancer vaccine and pancreatic cancer antibodies product candidates. Our competitors may succeed in developing products that are more effective and/or cost competitive than those we are developing, or that would render our product candidates less competitive or even obsolete. In addition, one or more of our competitors may achieve product commercialization or patent protection earlier than we do, which could materially adversely affect our business.\nIf physicians and patients do not accept our future products, or our potential strategic partner\u2019s products, or if the market for indications for which any product candidate is approved is smaller than expected, we may be unable to generate significant revenue, if any.\nEven if any of our product candidates obtain regulatory approval, they may not gain market acceptance among physicians, patients, and third-party payers. Physicians may decide not to recommend our treatments for a variety of reasons including:\n\u25cf\ntiming of market introduction of competitive products;\n\u25cf\ndemonstration of clinical safety and efficacy compared to other products;\n\u25cf\ncost-effectiveness;\n\u25cf\nlimited or no coverage by third-party payers;\n\u25cf\nconvenience and ease of administration;\n\u25cf\nprevalence and severity of adverse side effects;\n\u25cf\nrestrictions in the label of the drug;\n\u25cf\nother potential advantages of alternative treatment methods; and\n\u25cf\nineffective marketing and distribution support of its products.\nIf any of our product candidates are approved, but fail to achieve market acceptance or such market is smaller than anticipated, we may not be able to generate significant revenue and our business would suffer.\nAs we evolve from a company that is primarily involved in clinical development to a company that is also involved in licensing and commercialization, we may encounter difficulties in expanding our operations successfully.\nAs we or our potential strategic partners advance our product candidates through clinical trials, we will need to expand our development, regulatory, manufacturing, marketing and sales capabilities and may need to further contract with third parties to provide these capabilities. As our operations expand, we likely will need to manage additional relationships with such third parties, as well as additional collaborators, distributors, marketers and suppliers.\nMaintaining third party relationships for these purposes will impose significant added responsibilities on members of our management and other personnel. We must be able to: manage our development efforts effectively; recruit and train sales and marketing personnel; manage our participation in the clinical trials in which our product candidates are involved effectively; and improve our managerial, development, operational and finance systems, all of which may impose a strain on our administrative and operational infrastructure.\nIf we enter into arrangements with third parties to perform sales, marketing or distribution services, any product revenues that we receive, or the profitability of these product revenues to us, are likely to be lower than if we were to market and sell any products that we develop without the involvement of these third parties. In addition, we may not be successful in entering into arrangements with third parties to license, sell and market our products or in doing so on terms that are favorable to us. We likely will have little control over such third parties, and any of them may fail to devote the necessary resources and attention to sell and market our products effectively. If we do not establish sales and marketing capabilities successfully, either on our own or in collaboration with third parties, we will not be successful in commercializing our products.\nThe uncertainty associated with pharmaceutical reimbursement and related matters may adversely affect our business.\nMarket acceptance and sales of any one or more of our product candidates will depend on reimbursement policies and may be affected by future healthcare reform measures in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions. Government authorities and third-party payers, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which drugs they will cover and establish payment levels. We cannot be certain that reimbursement will be available for any of our product candidates. Also, we cannot be certain that reimbursement policies will not reduce the demand for, or the price paid for, our products. If reimbursement is not available or is available on a limited basis, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any product candidates that we develop.\nIn the United States, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, also called the Medicare Modernization Act, or MMA, changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products. The legislation established Medicare Part D, which expanded Medicare coverage for outpatient prescription drug purchases by the elderly but provided authority for limiting the number of drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class. The MMA also introduced a new reimbursement methodology based on average sales prices for physician-administered drugs.\nThe United States and several foreign jurisdictions are considering, or have already enacted, a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. Among policy makers and payers in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access to healthcare. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry is significantly affected by major legislative initiatives. We expect to experience pricing pressures in connection with the sale of any products that it develops due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations and additional legislative proposals.\nMoreover, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act, or collectively, ACA, is intended to reduce the cost of health care and substantially change the way health care is financed by both government and private insurers. While we cannot predict what impact on federal reimbursement policies this legislation will have in general or on our business specifically, the ACA may result in downward pressure on pharmaceutical reimbursement, which could negatively affect market acceptance of, and the price we charge for, any products we develop that receive regulatory approval.\nOur ability to generate product and/or licensing revenues will be diminished if our therapies sell for inadequate prices or patients are unable to obtain adequate levels of reimbursement.\nOur ability or our potential strategic partners\u2019 abilities to commercialize our therapies, alone or with collaborators, will depend in part on the extent to which reimbursement will be available from private health maintenance organizations and health insurers and other healthcare payers. Significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products. Healthcare payers are challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. Cost control initiatives could decrease the price that we would receive for any products in the future, which would limit our revenue and profitability. Government and other healthcare payers increasingly attempt to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for drugs and therapeutics. We might need to conduct post-marketing studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of any future products to such payers\u2019 satisfaction. Such studies might require us to commit a significant amount of management time and financial and other resources. Our future products might not ultimately be considered cost-effective. Even if one of our product candidates is approved by the FDA, insurance coverage may not be available, and reimbursement levels may be inadequate, to cover such therapies. If government and other healthcare payers do not provide adequate coverage and reimbursement levels for one of our products, once approved, market acceptance of such product could be reduced.\nWe only have a limited number of employees to manage and operate our business.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had a total of 11 full-time employees. Our focus on limiting cash utilization requires us to manage and operate our business in a highly efficient manner. We cannot assure you that we will be able to retain adequate staffing levels to run our operations and/or to accomplish all the objectives that we otherwise would seek to accomplish.\nWe depend heavily on our executive officers, directors, and principal consultants and the loss of their services would materially harm our business.\nWe believe that our success depends, and will likely continue to depend, upon our ability to retain the services of our current executive officers, directors, principal consultants and others. In addition, we have established relationships with universities, hospitals and research institutions, which have historically provided, and continue to provide, us with access to research laboratories, clinical trials, facilities and patients. The loss of the services of any of these individuals or institutions would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur internal computer systems, or those of our third-party service providers, licensees, licensors, collaborators or other contractors or consultants, may fail or suffer security breaches, which could result in a material disruption in our business and operations.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our current and future service providers, licensees, licensors, collaborators and other contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. While we are not aware of any such material system failure, accident or security breach to date, if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our development programs and our business operations. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed, on-going or future clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significant costs to recover or reproduce the data. Likewise, we rely on third parties to manufacture our drug candidates and conduct clinical trials, and similar events relating to their computer systems could also have a material adverse effect on our business. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liabilities and the further development and commercialization of our product candidates could be delayed.\nDue in part to our limited financial resources, we may fail to select or capitalize on the most scientifically, clinically or commercially promising or profitable indications or therapeutic areas for our product candidates or those that are in-licensed, and/or we may be unable to pursue the clinical trials that we would like to pursue.\nWe have limited technical, managerial and financial resources to determine the indications on which we should focus the development efforts related to our product candidates. Due to our limited available financial resources, we may have curtailed clinical development programs and activities that might otherwise have led to more rapid progress of our product candidates through the regulatory and development processes.\nWe may make incorrect determinations with regard to the indications and clinical trials on which to focus the available resources that we do have. Furthermore, we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain adequate staffing levels to run our operations and/or to accomplish all of the objectives that we otherwise would seek to accomplish. Our decisions to allocate our research, management and financial resources toward particular indications or therapeutic areas for our product candidates may not lead to the development of viable commercial products and may divert resources from better opportunities. Similarly, our decisions to delay or terminate drug development programs may also cause us to miss valuable opportunities.\nIf the third parties on which we rely for the conduct of our clinical trials and results do not perform our clinical trial activities in accordance with good clinical practices and related regulatory requirements, we may be unable to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates.\nWe use independent clinical investigators and other third-party service providers to conduct and/or oversee the clinical trials of our product candidates and expect to continue to do so for the foreseeable future. We rely heavily on these parties for successful execution of our clinical trials. Nonetheless, we are responsible for confirming that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the FDA\u2019s requirements and our general investigational plan and protocol.\nThe FDA requires us and our clinical investigators to comply with regulations and standards, commonly referred to as good clinical practices, for conducting and recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the trial participants are adequately protected. Our reliance on third parties that we do not control does not relieve us of these responsibilities and requirements. Third parties may not complete activities on schedule or may not conduct our clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or the respective trial plans and protocols. The failure of these third parties to carry out their obligations could delay or prevent the development, approval and commercialization of our product candidates or result in enforcement action against us.\nWe have limited manufacturing capacity and have relied on, and expect to continue to rely on, third-party manufacturers to produce our product candidates.\nWe do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of clinical or commercial quantities of our product candidates, and we lack the resources and the capabilities to do so. As a result, we currently rely, and expect to rely for the foreseeable future, on third-party manufacturers to supply our product candidates. Reliance on third-party manufacturers entails risks to which we would not be subject if we manufactured our product candidates or products ourselves, including:\n\u25cf\nreliance on third-parties for manufacturing process development, regulatory compliance and quality assurance;\n\u25cf\nlimitations on supply availability resulting from capacity and scheduling constraints of third-parties;\n\u25cf\nthe possible breach of manufacturing agreements by third-parties because of factors beyond our control; and\n\u25cf\nthe possible termination or non-renewal of the manufacturing agreements by the third-party, at a time that is costly or inconvenient to us.\nIf we do not maintain our key manufacturing relationships, we may fail to find replacement manufacturers or develop our own manufacturing capabilities, which could delay or impair our ability to obtain regulatory approval for our products and substantially increases our costs or deplete profit margins, if any. If we do find replacement manufacturers, we may not be able to enter into agreements with them on terms and conditions favorable to us and there could be a substantial delay before new facilities could be qualified and registered with the FDA and other foreign regulatory authorities.\nThe FDA and other foreign regulatory authorities require manufacturers to register manufacturing facilities. The FDA and corresponding foreign regulators also inspect these facilities to confirm compliance with current cGMPs. Contract manufacturers may face manufacturing or quality control problems causing drug substance production and shipment delays or a situation where the contractor may not be able to maintain compliance with the applicable cGMP requirements. Any failure to comply with cGMP requirements or other FDA, EMA and comparable foreign regulatory requirements could adversely affect our clinical research activities and our ability to develop our product candidates and market our products following approval.\nOur current and anticipated future dependence upon others for the manufacture of our product candidates may adversely affect our future profit margins and our ability to develop our product candidates and commercialize any products that receive regulatory approval on a timely basis.\nIf product liability lawsuits are successfully brought against us, we may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of our product candidates and any products that we may develop.\nThe testing and marketing of medical products entail an inherent risk of product liability. Although we are not aware of any historical or anticipated product liability claims or specific causes for concern, if we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit commercialization of our product candidates and any products that we may develop. In addition, product liability claims may also result in withdrawal of clinical trial volunteers, injury to our reputation and decreased demand for any products that we may commercialize. We currently carry product liability insurance that covers our clinical trials up to a $5.0 million annual aggregate limit. We will need to increase the amount of coverage if and when we have a product that is commercially available. If we are unable to obtain sufficient product liability insurance at an acceptable cost, potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of any products that we may develop, alone or with corporate partners.\nWe have been, and in the future may be, subject to securities class action lawsuits and stockholder derivative actions. These, and potential similar or related litigation, could result in substantial damages and may divert management\u2019s time and attention from our business.\nWe have been, and may in the future be, the target of securities class actions or stockholder derivative claims. Any such actions or claims could result in substantial damages and may divert management\u2019s time and attention from our business.\nRisks Related to our Intellectual Property\nIt is difficult and costly to protect our proprietary rights, and we may not be able to ensure their protection.\nWe have been issued patents, applied for other patents, and intend on continuing to seek additional patent protection for our families of antibodies from our antibody development program, our vaccines, methods of use and other compounds that we discover. However, any or all of such compounds, methods or new uses of known compounds may not be subject to effective patent protection. Further, the development of regimens for the administration of our vaccines, which involve specifications for the frequency, timing and amount of dosages, has been, and we believe may continue to be, important to our efforts, although those processes, as such, may not be patentable. In addition, our issued patents may be declared invalid or our competitors may find ways to avoid the claims in the patents.\nOur commercial success will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection, protect our trade secrets and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others. Our commercial success will also depend, in part, on our ability to market our product candidates during the term of our patent protection. For example, certain patents including in foreign countries within our portfolio expired in 2014 and can no longer be relied on for protection in those countries. As of April 2, 2018, we were the exclusive licensee or sole assignee of 14 granted United States patents, 3 pending United States patent applications, and 19 pending foreign patent applications. The patent position of pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms like us are generally highly uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions, resulting in both an apparent inconsistency regarding the breadth of claims allowed in United States patents and general uncertainty as to their legal interpretation and enforceability. No absolute policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in biopharmaceutical patents has emerged to date in the United States or in many foreign jurisdictions. Changes in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States and foreign jurisdictions may diminish the value of our intellectual property. Accordingly, we cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be enforced in the patents that we currently own or that may be issued from the applications we have filed or may file in the future or that we have licensed or may license from third parties, including MSK for the vaccine antigen patents. Further, if any patents we obtain or license are deemed invalid or unenforceable, it could impact our ability to commercialize or license our technology. Thus, patent applications assigned or exclusively licensed to us may not result in patents being issued, any issued patents assigned or exclusively licensed to us may not provide us with competitive protection or may be challenged by others, and the current or future granted patents of others may have an adverse effect on our ability to do business and achieve profitability.\nOne of our issued US patents is directed to a candidate antibody product that will expire in 2034. A second US patent directed to a candidate antibody will expire in 2035. Other previously filed antibody patent applications will, if issued, have patent expiration dates depending on country and filing date between 2034 and 2038. It is possible that the term of the antibody patent and certain patents issuing from the antibody patent applications may be extended for a portion of the time the candidate product was under regulatory review. Patents covering components of the sarcoma vaccine will expire in 2022. Patents covering the polyvalent ovarian vaccine will expire between 2019 and 2025. We believe that our product candidates are eligible for Orphan Drug designation from FDA depending on the indication for which it is approved by FDA. Each product that receives an Orphan Drug designation would be eligible for up to 7 additional years of patent protection.\nThe degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain because legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep our competitive advantage. For example:\n\u25cf\nothers may be able to make compounds that are similar to our vaccines and monoclonal antibody-based candidates and any future product candidates we may seek to develop but that are not covered by the claims of our patents;\n\u25cf\nif we encounter delays in our clinical trials, the period during which we could market our vaccines and monoclonal antibody-based candidates under patent protection would be reduced;\n\u25cf\nwe might not have been the first to conceive, make or disclose the inventions covered by our patents or pending patent applications;\n\u25cf\nwe might not have been the first to file patent applications for these inventions;\n\u25cf\nany patents that we obtain may be invalid or unenforceable or otherwise may not provide us with any competitive advantages; or\n\u25cf\nthe patents of others may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nDue to the patent laws of a country, or the decisions of a patent examiner in a country, or our own filing strategies, we may not obtain patent coverage for all the product candidates that may be disclosed or methods involving these candidates that may be disclosed in the parent patent application. We plan to pursue divisional patent applications and/or continuation patent applications in the United States and many other countries to obtain claim coverage for inventions that were disclosed but not claimed in the parent patent application, but may not succeed in these efforts.\nComposition of matter patents on the active biological component are generally considered to be the strongest form of intellectual property protection for biopharmaceutical products, as such patents generally provide protection without regard to any method of use. We cannot be certain that the claims in our patent applications covering composition-of-matter of our candidates will be considered patentable by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, courts in the United States or by the patent offices and courts in foreign countries. Method of use patents protect the use of a product for the method recited in the claims. This type of patent does not prevent a competitor from making and marketing a product that is identical to our product for an indication that is outside the scope of the patented method. Moreover, even if competitors do not actively promote their product for our targeted indications, physicians may prescribe these products \u201coff-label.\u201d Although off-label prescriptions may infringe or contribute to or induce the infringement of method of use patents, the practice is common and such infringement is difficult to prevent or prosecute. Interference proceedings provoked by third parties or brought by the USPTO may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to our patents or patent applications or those of our collaborators or licensors. An unfavorable outcome could require us to cease using the related technology or to attempt to license rights to it from the prevailing party. Our business could be harmed if the prevailing party does not offer us a license on commercially reasonable terms. Litigation or interference proceedings may fail, resulting in harm to our business, and, even if successful, may result in substantial costs and distract our management and other employees.\nThere have been numerous changes to the patent laws and proposed changes to the rules of the USPTO, which may have a significant impact on our ability to protect our technology and enforce our intellectual property rights. For example, the America Invents Act signed into law in September 2011 that codifies several significant changes to the U.S. patent laws, including, among other things, changing from a \u201cfirst to invent\u201d to a \u201cfirst inventor to file\u201d system, limiting where a patent holder may file a patent suit, replacing interference or \u201cfirst to invent\u201d proceedings with derivation proceedings and creating inter partes review and post-grant opposition proceedings to challenge the validity of patents after they have been issued. The effects of these changes are currently unclear as the USPTO only recently has adopted regulations implementing the changes, the courts have yet to address most of these provisions, and the applicability of the act and new regulations on specific patents and patent applications discussed herein have not been determined and would need to be reviewed.\nPeriodic maintenance fees on any issued patent are due to be paid to the USPTO and foreign patent agencies in several stages over the lifetime of the patent. The USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with several procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. While an inadvertent lapse can in many cases be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. Noncompliance events that could result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application include, but are not limited to, failure to respond to official actions within prescribed time limits, non-payment of fees and failure to properly legalize and submit formal documents. In such an event, our competitors might be able to enter the market, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe also rely on trade secrets to protect our technology, especially where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. Although we use reasonable efforts to protect our trade secrets, our employees, consultants, contractors, licensees, licensors, outside scientific collaborators and other advisors may unintentionally or willfully disclose our information such that our competitors may obtain it. Enforcing a claim that a third party illegally obtained and is using any of our trade secrets is expensive and time consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. Moreover, our competitors may independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how, such as new therapies, including therapies for the indications we are targeting. If others seek to develop similar therapies, their research and development efforts may inhibit our ability to conduct research in certain areas where we seek to expand our intellectual property portfolio and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nMoreover, because some of the basic research relating to one or more of our patent applications and/or patents were performed at various universities and/or funded by grants, one or more universities, employees of such universities and/or grantors could assert that they have certain rights in such research and any resulting products. Further, others may independently develop similar products, may duplicate our products, or may design around our patent rights. In addition, as a result of the assertion of rights by a third-party or otherwise, we may be required to obtain licenses to patents or other proprietary rights of others in or outside of the United States. Any licenses required under any such patents or proprietary rights may not be made available on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we do not obtain such licenses, we could encounter delays in product market introductions during our attempts to design around such patents or could find that the development, manufacture or sale of products requiring such licenses is foreclosed. In addition, we could incur substantial costs in defending suits brought against us or in connection with patents to which we hold licenses or in bringing suit to protect our own patents against infringement.\nWe require employees and the institutions that perform our preclinical and clinical trials to enter into confidentiality agreements with us. Those agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to a party to any such agreement during the relationship with us be kept confidential and not be disclosed to third-parties, except in specific circumstances. Any such agreement may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or other confidential information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information.\nWith respect to our vaccine programs we have in-licensed rights from third parties. If these license agreements terminate or expire, we may lose the licensed rights to some or all our vaccine product candidates. We may not be able to continue to develop them or, if they are approved, market or commercialize them.\nWe depend on license agreements with third-parties for certain intellectual property rights relating to our product candidates, including, but not limited to, the license of certain intellectual property rights from MSK. In general, our license agreements require us to make payments and satisfy performance obligations to keep these agreements in effect and retain our rights under them. These payment obligations can include upfront fees, maintenance fees, milestones, royalties, patent prosecution expenses, and other fees. These performance obligations typically include diligence obligations. If we fail to pay, be diligent or otherwise perform as required under our license agreements, we could lose the rights under the patents and other intellectual property rights covered by these agreements. If disputes arise under any of our in-licenses, including our in-licenses from MSK, we could lose our rights under these agreements. Any such dispute may not be resolvable on favorable terms, or at all. Whether or not any disputes of this kind are favorably resolved, our management\u2019s time and attention and our other resources could be consumed by the need to attend to these disputes and our business could be harmed by the emergence of such a dispute.\nIf we lose our rights under these agreements, we might not be able to develop any related product candidates further, or following regulatory approval, if any, we might be prohibited from marketing or commercializing these product candidates. For example, patents previously licensed to us might, after termination of an agreement, be used to stop us from conducting these activities.\nWe are dependent on MSK for the establishment of our intellectual property rights related to the vaccine program, and if MSK has not established our intellectual property rights with sufficient scope to protect our vaccine candidates, we may have limited or no ability to assert intellectual property rights to our vaccine candidates.\nUnder our agreement with MSK, MSK was responsible for establishing the intellectual property rights to the vaccine antigen conjugates, mixtures of vaccine antigen conjugates that make up polyvalent vaccine candidates and methods of use. As we were not responsible for the establishment of our intellectual property rights to these vaccine antigen conjugates, mixtures of vaccine antigen conjugates and methods of use, we have less visibility into the strength of our intellectual property rights to our vaccine candidates than if we had been responsible for the establishment of these rights. If MSK did not establish those rights so they are of sufficient scope to protect the vaccine candidates, then we may not be able to prevent others from using or commercializing some or all of our vaccine candidates, and others may be able to assert intellectual property rights in our vaccine candidates and prevent us from further pursuing the development and commercialization of our vaccine candidates.\nWe may not obtain exclusive rights to intellectual property created as a result of our strategic collaborative agreements.\nWe are party to collaborative research agreements, such as with Rockefeller University and MSK, and expect to enter into agreements with other parties in the future, each of which involve research and development efforts. Under certain circumstances we may not have exclusive rights to jointly developed intellectual property and would have to license the collaborative partner\u2019s interest in the jointly developed intellectual property to obtain exclusive rights. We may not be able to license our collaborative partner\u2019s interest or license their interest at reasonable terms. If we are unable to license their interest we would not have exclusive rights to the jointly developed intellectual property and, in some collaborations, the collaborative partner may be free to license their interest in the jointly developed intellectual property to a competitor. In other collaborations, if we are unable to license the collaborative partner\u2019s interest we may not have sufficient rights to practice the jointly developed intellectual property. Such provisions to the jointly developed intellectual property may limit our ability to gain commercial benefit from some of or all of the intellectual property we jointly develop with our collaborative partners and may lead to costly or time-consuming disputes with parties with whom we have collaborative relationships over rights to certain innovations or with other third parties that may result from the activities of the collaborative arrangements.\nWe may incur substantial costs as a result of litigation or other proceedings relating to patent and other intellectual property rights and we may be unable to enforce or protect our rights to, or use, our technology.\nIf we choose to go to court to stop another party from using the inventions claimed in any patents we obtain, that individual or company has the right to ask the court to rule that such patents are invalid or should not be enforced. These lawsuits are expensive and would consume time and resources and divert the attention of managerial and scientific personnel even if we were successful in stopping the infringement of such patents or sustaining their validity and enforceability. In addition, there is a risk that the court will decide that such patents are not valid and that we do not have the right to enforce them. There is also the risk that, even if the validity of such patents is upheld, the court will refuse to stop the other party on the grounds that such other party\u2019s activities do not infringe such patents. In addition, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and the Supreme Court of the U.S. continue to address issues under the United States patent laws, and the decisions of those and other courts could adversely affect our ability to sustain the validity of our issued or licensed patents and obtain new patents.\nFurthermore, a third party may claim that we or our manufacturing or commercialization partners or customers are using inventions covered by the third party\u2019s patent rights and may go to court to stop us or our partners and/or customers from engaging in our operations and activities, including making or selling our vaccine and monoclonal antibody-based candidates and any future product candidates we may seek to develop. These lawsuits are costly and could affect our results of operations and divert the attention of managerial and scientific personnel. There is a risk that a court would decide that we or our commercialization partners or customers are infringing the third party\u2019s patents and would order us or our partners or customers to stop the activities covered by the patents. In that event, we or our commercialization partners or customers may not have a viable way around the patent and may need to halt commercialization or use of the relevant product. In addition, there is a risk that a court will order us or our partners or customers to pay the other party damages for having violated the other party\u2019s patents or obtain one or more licenses from third parties, which may be impossible or require substantial time and expense. We cannot predict whether any license would be available at all or whether it would be available on commercially reasonable terms. Furthermore, even in the absence of litigation, we may need to obtain licenses from third parties to advance our research or allow commercialization of our candidates, and we have done so from time to time. We may fail to obtain any of these licenses at a reasonable cost or on reasonable terms, if at all. In such events, we would be unable to further develop and commercialize one or more of our drug candidates, which could harm our business significantly. In the future, we may agree to indemnify our commercial partners and/or customers against certain intellectual property infringement claims brought by third parties which could increase our financial expense, increase our involvement in litigation and/or otherwise materially adversely affect our business.\nBecause of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation, which could adversely affect our intellectual property rights and our business. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nThe pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have produced a proliferation of patents, and it is not always clear to industry participants, including us, which patents cover various types of products or methods of use. The coverage of patents is subject to interpretation by the courts, and the interpretation is not always uniform. If we are sued for patent infringement, we would need to demonstrate that our products or methods either do not infringe the patent claims of the relevant patent or that the patent claims are invalid or unenforceable, and we may not be able to do this. Proving invalidity or unenforceability is difficult. For example, in the United States, proving invalidity requires a showing of clear and convincing evidence to overcome the presumption of validity enjoyed by issued patents.\nBecause some patent applications in the United States may be maintained in secrecy until the patents are issued, because patent applications in the United States and many foreign jurisdictions are typically not published until eighteen months after filing, because searches and examinations of patent applications by the USPTO and other patent offices may not be comprehensive, and because publications in the scientific literature often lag behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that others have not filed patent applications for technology covered by our patents or pending applications. Our competitors may have filed, and may in the future file, patent applications and may have obtained patents covering technology similar to ours. Any such patents or patent application may have priority over our patent applications, which could further require us to obtain or license rights to issued patents covering such technologies. If another party has obtained a U.S. patent or filed a U.S. patent application on inventions similar to ours, we may have to participate in a proceeding before the USPTO or in the courts to determine which patent or application has priority. The costs of these proceedings could be substantial, and it is possible that our application or patent could be determined not to have priority, which could adversely affect our intellectual property rights and business.\nWe have received confidential and proprietary information from collaborators, prospective licensees and other third parties. In addition, we employ individuals who were previously employed at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies. We may be subject to claims that we or our employees, consultants or independent contractors have improperly used or disclosed confidential information of these third parties or our employees\u2019 former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial cost and be a distraction to our management and employees. If we are not successful, our ability to continue our operations and our business could be materially, adversely affected.\nSome of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex intellectual property litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources. In addition, any uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our operations, on our ability to hire or retain employees, or otherwise on our business.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) is conducting an investigation and examination pursuant to Section 8(e) of the Securities Act, relating to certain of the Company\u2019s registration statements (and amendments thereto) which could negatively affect the perception of the Company, the price of our common stock, and the ability to raise capital on attractive terms, if at all.\nOn January 29, 2018, the Company received notice that the SEC is conducting an investigation and examination pursuant to Section 8(e) of the Securities Act, relating to certain of the Company\u2019s registration statements (and amendments thereto) which could negatively affect the price of our common stock and ability to raise capital on attractive terms, if at all. On February 2, 2018, the SEC followed up with a subpoena to produce documents by April 9, 2018, in connection with its investigation. The Company intends to cooperate fully with the SEC\u2019s examination. At this time the Company cannot predict when such investigation will be complete or what the SEC findings would be. The Company cannot predict how the current investigation or its eventual outcome will affect how the Company is perceived by the market, potential partners and potential investors. The Company expects that it may not be able to file new registration statements or use existing registration statements until the SEC has completed its investigation. Without an effective registration statement or ability to file new registration statements, the options for the Company being able to raise capital will be limited to private investments, if any, which could be more dilutive to the Company\u2019s stockholders than a registered offering. Without the ability to raise capital on attractive terms, if at all, and assuming the Company is unable to license or sell any of its technologies to raise non-dilutive capital in the next few months, the Company may be forced to make additional reductions in spending and personnel, extend payment terms with suppliers, liquidate assets where possible, suspend or curtail planned programs or make concessions to financial terms in out-licensing intellectual property and/or sale of assets. Any or all of these actions, if taken, could jeopardize the value of existing assets, the Company, and ability to continue as a going concern, as further discussed in Item 7. \u201c-Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d and in Note 1. \u201cNature of Operations and Basis of Presentation\u201d in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation, our amended and restated by-laws and Delaware law could deter a change of our management which could discourage or delay offers to acquire us; certain restrictions in our agreements with existing stockholders could also discourage or delay offers to acquire us.\nCertain provisions of Delaware law and of our restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, and amended and restated by-laws, could discourage or make it more difficult to accomplish a proxy contest or other change in our management or the acquisition of control by a holder of a substantial amount of our voting stock. It is possible that these provisions could make it more difficult to accomplish, or could deter, transactions that stockholders may otherwise consider to be in their best interests or in our best interests. These provisions include:\n\u25cf\nestablishing a classified board of directors requiring that members of the board be elected in different years, which lengthens the time needed to elect a new majority of the board;\n\u25cf\nauthorizing the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that could be issued by our Board of Directors to increase the number of outstanding shares or change the balance of voting control and thwart a takeover attempt;\n\u25cf\nprohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors, which would otherwise allow for less than a majority of stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\u25cf\nlimiting the ability of stockholders to call special meetings of the stockholders;\n\u25cf\nprohibiting stockholder action by written consent and requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders; and\n\u25cf\nestablishing 90 to 120-day advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors and for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\nThe rights of our common stockholders are limited by and subordinate to the rights of the holders of Series D Preferred Stock, Series E Preferred Stock, Series I Preferred Stock, Series J Preferred Stock, Series K Preferred Stock, Series L Preferred Stock and Series M Preferred Stock; these rights may have a negative effect on the value of shares of our common stock.\nAs of April 2, 2018, the holders of our Series D Convertible Preferred Stock (the \u201cSeries D Preferred Stock\u201d), Series E Convertible Preferred Stock (the \u201cSeries E Preferred Stock\u201d), Series I Convertible Preferred Stock (the \u201cSeries I Preferred Stock\u201d), Series J Convertible Preferred Stock (the \u201cSeries J Preferred Stock\u201d), Series K Convertible Preferred Stock (the \u201cSeries K Preferred Stock\u201d), Series L Preferred Stock and Series M Convertible Preferred Stock (the \u201cSeries M Preferred Stock\u201d) have rights and preferences generally superior to those of the holders of common stock. The existence of these superior rights and preferences may have a negative effect on the value of shares of our common stock. These rights are more fully set forth in the Series D Preferred Stock certificate of designations, Series E Preferred Stock certificate of designations, Series I Preferred Stock certificate of designations, Series J Preferred Stock certificate of designations, Series K Preferred Stock certificate of designations, Series L Preferred Stock certificate of designations, and Series M Preferred Stock certificate of designations, respectively, and include, but are not limited to the right to receive a liquidation preference, prior to any distribution of our assets to the holders of our common stock, in an amount equal to $0.01 per share or $441 for the Series D Preferred Stock, $0.01 per share or $333 for the Series E Preferred Stock, $0.01 per share or $6,456 for the Series I Preferred Stock, $687.50 per share or approximately $531,252 for the Series J Preferred Stock, $0.01 per share or $632 for the Series K Preferred Stock, $100.00 per share or approximately $4.6 million for the Series L Preferred Stock, and $300 per share or approximately $1.5 million for the Series M Preferred Stock.\nWe may not be able to maintain compliance for continued listing on The NASDAQ Capital Market and a delisting of our stock could make it more difficult for investors to sell their shares\nOur common stock was approved for listing on The NASDAQ Capital Market in August 2016 where it continues to be listed. The listing rules of The NASDAQ Capital Market require the Company to meet certain requirements. These continued listing standards include specifically enumerated criteria, such as:\n\u25cf\na $1.00 minimum closing bid price;\n\u25cf\nstockholders\u2019 equity of $2.5 million;\n\u25cf\n500,000 shares of publicly-held common stock with a market value of at least $1 million;\n\u25cf\nround-lot stockholders; and\n\u25cf\ncompliance with The NASDAQ Capital Market\u2019s corporate governance requirements, as well as additional or more stringent criteria that may be applied in the exercise of The NASDAQ Capital Market\u2019s discretionary authority.\nOn March 5, 2018, we received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of The NASDAQ Capital Market notifying us that the Company has regained compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) as a result of maintaining the $1.00 minimum closing bid price for at least ten trading days prior to the March 5, 2018 deadline for continued listing. The Company regained compliance with the minimum bid price maintenance requirement as a result of completing, on February 16, 2018, the Continued Listing Reverse Split. We had previously received written notification from The NASDAQ Capital Market regarding the Company\u2019s non-compliance with the minimum bid price requirements set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) and we were afforded 180 calendar days, or until March 5, 2018, for the Company to regain compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). As a result of regaining compliance with the minimum bid price, The NASDAQ Capital Market has informed us that this matter is now closed. There is no guarantee that we will continue to successfully maintain compliance with the minimum bid price.\nContinued listing is also contingent on our continued compliance with all other listing requirements other than for the minimum bid price. As of December 31, 2017, our stockholders\u2019 equity was $1,130,440, which was approximately $1,369,560 below the continued listing maintenance requirement of stockholders\u2019 equity of $2.5 million. In February 2018, we were able to raise $2.7 million in additional capital. However, there can be no assurance that The NASDAQ Capital Market will give us credit for financing transactions that we have been able to achieve subsequent to December 31, 2017, to enable continued listing on The NASDAQ Capital Market.\nIf we fail to comply with The NASDAQ Capital Market\u2019s continued listing standards, we may be delisted and our common stock will trade, if at all, only on the over-the-counter market, such as the OTC Bulletin Board or OTCQX market, and then only if one or more registered broker-dealer market makers comply with quotation requirements. In addition, delisting of our common stock could depress our stock price, substantially limit liquidity of our common stock and materially adversely affect our ability to raise capital on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nFinally, delisting of our common stock would likely result in our common stock becoming a \u201cpenny stock\u201d under the Exchange Act. The principal result or effect of being designated a \u201cpenny stock\u201d is that securities broker-dealers cannot recommend the shares but must trade it on an unsolicited basis. Penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document prepared by the SEC, which specifies information about penny stocks and the nature and significance of risks of the penny stock market. A broker-dealer must also provide the customer with bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and sales person in the transaction, and monthly account statements indicating the market value of each penny stock held in the customer\u2019s account. In addition, the penny stock rules require that, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules; the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser\u2019s written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the trading activity in the secondary market for shares that become subject to those penny stock rules. Under such circumstances, shareholders may find it more difficult to sell, or to obtain accurate quotations, for our common stock, and our common stock would become substantially less attractive to certain purchasers such as financial institutions, hedge funds and other similar investors.\nFuture sales of our securities, or the perception in the markets that these sales may occur, could depress our stock price.\nAdditional equity financings or other share issuances by us, including shares issued in connection with strategic alliances and corporate partnering transactions, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. As of April 2, 2018, we had 5,477,488 shares held by our existing shareholders available for resale pursuant to Rule 144 or resale registration statements, upon conversion of Series D Preferred Stock, Series E Preferred Stock, Series I Preferred Stock, Series J Preferred Stock, Series K Preferred Stock and Series L Preferred Stock, and an additional 666,667 shares could become available for resale in August 2018 pursuant to Rule 144, or sooner if pursuant to a resale registration statement, upon conversion of Series M Preferred Stock. Sales by existing stockholders of a large number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that additional sales could occur could cause the market price of our common stock to drop. Moreover, to the extent that additional shares of our outstanding stock are registered, or otherwise become eligible for resale, and are sold, or the holders of such shares are perceived as intended to sell them, this could further depress the market price of our common stock. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to raise capital or make acquisitions through the issuance of additional shares of our common stock or other equity securities.\nIf we do not progress in our programs as anticipated, our stock price could decrease.\nFor planning purposes, we estimate the timing of a variety of clinical, regulatory and other milestones, such as when a certain product candidate will enter clinical development, when a clinical trial will be completed or when an application for regulatory approval will be filed. Our estimates are based on present facts and a variety of assumptions. Many of the underlying assumptions are outside of our control. If milestones are not achieved when we estimated that they would be, investors could be disappointed, and our stock price may decrease.\nOur stock price may be volatile; you may not be able to resell your shares at or above your purchase price.\nOur stock prices and the market prices for securities of biotechnology companies in general have been highly volatile, with recent significant price and volume fluctuations, and may continue to be highly volatile in the future. For example, during the year ended December 31, 2017, our common stock traded between $1.28 per share and $10.76 per share. The following factors, in addition to other risk factors described in this section, may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock, some of which are beyond our control:\n\u25cf\ndevelopments regarding, or the results of, our clinical trials;\n\u25cf\nannouncements of technological innovations or new commercial products by our competitors or us;\n\u25cf\nour issuance of equity or debt securities, or disclosure or announcements relating thereto;\n\u25cf\ndevelopments concerning proprietary rights, including patents;\n\u25cf\ndevelopments concerning our collaborations;\n\u25cf\npublicity regarding actual or potential medical results relating to products under development by our competitors or us;\n\u25cf\nregulatory developments in the United States and foreign countries;\n\u25cf\nlitigation;\n\u25cf\neconomic and other external factors or other disaster or crisis; or\n\u25cf\nperiod-to-period fluctuations in our financial results.\nOur common stock may be affected by limited trading volume and price fluctuations which could adversely impact the value of our common stock.\nWhile there has been relatively active trading in our common stock over the past twelve months, there can be no assurance that an active trading market in our common stock will be maintained. Our common stock has experienced, and is likely to experience in the future, significant price and volume fluctuations which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock without regard to our operating performance. In addition, we believe that factors such as quarterly fluctuations in our financial results and changes in the overall economy or the condition of the financial markets could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially. These fluctuations may also cause short sellers to periodically enter the market in the belief that we will have poor results in the future. We cannot predict the actions of market participants and, therefore, can offer no assurances that the market for our common stock will be stable or appreciate over time.\nThe number of shares of issued and outstanding common stock as of April 2, 2018, represents approximately 45% of our fully diluted shares of common stock. Additional issuances of shares of common stock upon conversion and/or exercise of preferred stock, options to purchase common stock and warrants to purchase common stock will cause substantial dilution to existing stockholders.\nAt April 2, 2018, we had 8,961,840 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. Up to an additional 6,144,155 shares may be issued upon conversion of our Series D Preferred Stock, Series E Preferred Stock, Series I Preferred Stock, Series J Preferred Stock, Series K Preferred Stock, Series L Preferred Stock; and Series M Preferred Stock; 1,278,243 shares issuable upon exercise of warrants at a weighted average price of $8.12; 951,161 shares upon exercise of all outstanding options to purchase our common stock at a weighted average price of $13.98; and 34,247 shares issuable upon vesting of restricted stock units granted, resulting in a total of up to 17,369,646 shares that may be issued and outstanding. The issuance of any and all of the 8,407,806 shares issuable upon exercise or conversion of our outstanding convertible securities will cause substantial dilution to existing stockholders and may depress the market price of our common stock.\nIf our common stock is not listed on a national securities exchange, compliance with applicable state securities laws may be required for subsequent offers, transfers and sales of the shares of common stock offered hereby.\nThe securities offered hereby are being offered pursuant to one or more exemptions from registration and qualification under applicable state securities laws. Because our common stock is listed on The NASDAQ Capital Market, we are not required to register or qualify in any state the subsequent offer, transfer or sale of the common stock. If our common stock is delisted from The NASDAQ Capital Market and is not eligible to be listed on another national securities exchange, subsequent transfers of the shares of our common stock offered hereby by U.S. holders may not be exempt from state securities laws. In such event, it will be the responsibility of the holder of shares or warrants to register or qualify the shares for any subsequent offer, transfer or sale in the United States or to determine that any such offer, transfer or sale is exempt under applicable state securities laws.\nYou will experience future dilution as a result of future equity offerings\nWe may in the future offer additional shares of our common stock or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock. Although no assurances can be given that we will consummate a financing, in the event we do, or in the event we sell shares of common stock or other securities convertible into shares of our common stock in the future, additional and substantial dilution will occur. In addition, investors purchasing shares or other securities in the future could have rights superior to investors in this offering.", "PERMNO": 88572, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "MBVXQ"}
