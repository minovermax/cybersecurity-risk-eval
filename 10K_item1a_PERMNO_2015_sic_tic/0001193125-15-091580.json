{"cik": "1089872", "company": "GAIAM, INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nWe wish to caution you that there are risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to be materially different from those indicated by forward looking statements that we make from time to time in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, news releases, reports, proxy statements, registration statements and other written communications as well as oral forward looking statements made from time to time by our representatives. These risks and uncertainties include those risks described below of which we are presently aware. Historical results are not necessarily an indication of the future results. The risk factors below discuss important factors that could cause our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows to be materially adversely affected.\nWe may be subject to litigation which, if adversely determined, could cause us to incur substantial losses.\nFrom time to time during the normal course of operating our businesses, we are subject to various litigation claims and legal disputes. Some of the litigation claims may not be covered under our insurance policies, or our insurance carriers may seek to deny coverage. As a result, we might also be required to incur significant legal fees, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial position. In addition, because we cannot accurately predict the outcome of any action, it is possible that, as a result of current and/or future litigation, we will be subject to adverse judgments or settlements that could significantly reduce our earnings or result in losses. We are preparing to enter into arbitration with Cinedigm Corp. (\u201cCinedigm\u201d) in connection with the sale of a subsidiary to Cinedigm. The outcome of the arbitration process cannot be predicted at this time. The ultimate resolution of the dispute could have a material impact to the Company, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nChanges in general economic conditions could have a material impact on our business\nChanges in overall economic conditions that impact consumer spending could impact our results of operations. Future economic conditions affecting disposable income such as employment levels, consumer confidence, credit availability, business conditions, stock market volatility, inflation, acts of terrorism, threats of war, and interest and tax rates could reduce consumer spending or cause consumers to shift their spending away from our products. If the economic conditions and performance of the retail and media environment worsen, we may experience material adverse impacts on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIncreased competition could impact our financial results\nWe believe that the healthy lifestyles market includes thousands of small, local and regional businesses. Some smaller businesses may be able to more effectively personalize their relationships with customers, thereby gaining a competitive advantage. Although we believe that we do not compete directly with any single company that offers our entire range of merchandise and services, within each category we have competitors and we may face competition from new entrants. Some of our competitors or our potential competitors may have greater financial and marketing resources and greater brand recognition. In addition, larger, well-established and well-financed entities may acquire, invest in or form joint ventures with our competitors. Increased competition from these or other competitors could negatively impact our business.\nChanging consumer preferences may have an adverse effect on our business\nWe target consumers who assign high value to personal development, healthy lifestyles, responsible media, and the environment. A decrease of consumer interest in purchasing goods and services that promote the values we espouse would materially and adversely affect our customer base and sales revenues and, accordingly, our financial prospects. Further, consumer preferences and product trends are difficult to predict. Our future success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to changes in consumer preferences and we may not respond in a timely or commercially appropriate manner to such changes. Failure to anticipate and respond to changing consumer preferences and product trends could lead to, among other things, lower sales of our products, increased merchandise returns and lower margins, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur strategy of offering branded products could lead to inventory risk and higher costs\nAn important part of our strategy is to feature branded products. These products are sold under our brand names and are manufactured to our specifications. We expect our reliance on branded merchandise to increase. The use of branded merchandise requires us to incur costs and risks relating to the design and purchase of products, including submitting orders earlier and making longer initial purchase commitments.\nIn addition, the use of branded merchandise limits our ability to return unsold products to vendors, which can result in higher markdowns in order to sell excess inventory. Our commitment to customer service typically results in our keeping a high level of merchandise in stock so we can fill orders quickly. Consequently, we run the risk of having excess inventory, which may also contribute to higher markdowns. Our failure to successfully execute a branded merchandise strategy or to achieve anticipated profit margins on these goods, or a higher than anticipated level of overstocks, may materially adversely affect our revenues.\nWe offer our customers liberal merchandise return policies. Our consolidated financial statements include a reserve for anticipated merchandise returns, which is based on historical return rates. It is possible that actual returns may increase as a result of factors such as the introduction of new merchandise, changes in merchandise mix or other factors. Any increase in our merchandise returns will correspondingly reduce our revenues and profits.\nAcquisitions and new initiatives may harm our financial results\nWe have historically expanded our operations in part through strategic acquisitions and through new initiatives that we generate. We cannot accurately predict the timing, size and success of these efforts. Our acquisition and new initiative strategies involve significant risks that could inhibit our growth and negatively impact our operating results, including the following: our ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates or new initiatives at acceptable prices; our ability to complete the acquisitions of candidates that we identify or develop our new initiatives; our ability to compete effectively for available acquisition opportunities; increases in asking prices by acquisition candidates to levels beyond our financial capability or to levels that would not result in the returns required by our acquisition criteria; diversion of management\u2019s attention to expansion efforts; unanticipated costs and contingent liabilities associated with acquisitions and new initiatives; failure of acquired businesses or new initiatives to achieve expected results; our failure to retain key customers or personnel of acquired businesses and difficulties entering markets in which we have no or limited experience. In addition, the size, timing and success of any future acquisitions and new initiatives may cause substantial fluctuations in our operating results from quarter to quarter. Consequently, our operating results for any quarter may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for any subsequent quarter or for a full fiscal year. These fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock.\nThe loss of the services of our key personnel could disrupt our business\nWe depend on the continued services and performance of our senior management and other key personnel, particularly Jirka Rysavy and Lynn Powers, who intends to retire once a replacement is identified and transitioned into Gaiam. A loss of one or more of the members of our senior management or key personnel, without suitable replacements, could severely and negatively impact our operations. Our strategy of allowing the management teams of some acquired companies to continue to exercise significant management responsibility for those companies makes it important that we retain key employees, particularly the sales and creative teams, of the companies we might acquire. Hiring qualified management is difficult due to the limited number of qualified professionals in the industry in which we operate. Failure to attract and retain personnel, particularly management personnel, could materially harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur founder and chairman Jirka Rysavy has voting control over our company\nMr. Rysavy holds 100% of our 5,400,000 outstanding shares of Class B common stock and also owns 648,682 shares of Class A common stock. The shares of Class B common stock are convertible into shares of Class A common stock at any time. Each share of Class B common stock has ten votes per share, and each share of Class A common stock has one vote per share. Consequently, Mr. Rysavy holds approximately 75% of our voting stock and, thus, is able to exert substantial influence over us and to control matters requiring approval by our shareholders, including the election of directors, increasing our authorized capital stock, or a merger or sale of substantially all of our assets. As a result of Mr. Rysavy\u2019s control of us, no change of control can occur without Mr. Rysavy\u2019s consent.\nOur success depends on the value of our brand\nBecause of our reliance on sales of proprietary products, our success depends on our brand. Building and maintaining recognition of our brand are important for attracting and expanding our customer base. If the value of our brand were adversely affected, we cannot be certain that we would be able to attract new customers, retain existing customers or encourage repeat purchases, and if the value of our brand were to diminish, our revenues, results of operations and prospects would be adversely affected.\nOur future cash flows may not be sufficient to meet our obligations and we may have difficulty obtaining financing\nOur cash balance at December 31, 2014 was $15.8 million. We presently do not have any financing arrangements in place to assist us in meeting our obligations. There can be no assurance in the future whether we will generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet our obligations or whether we would be able to secure financing or other sources of funds, such as from the sale of our shelf registration stock, should the need arise.\nProduct liability claims against us could result in adverse publicity and potentially significant monetary damages\nAs a seller of consumer products, we may face product liability claims in the event that use of our products results in injuries. If such injuries or claims of injuries were to occur, we could incur monetary damages and our business could be adversely affected by any resulting negative publicity. The successful assertion of product liability claims against us also could result in potentially significant monetary damages and, if our insurance protection is inadequate to cover these claims, could require us to make significant payments from our own resources.\nWe are dependent on third party suppliers for the success of our proprietary products\nWe are dependent on the success of our proprietary products, and we rely on a select group of manufacturers to provide us with sufficient quantities to meet our customers\u2019 demands in a timely manner, produce these products in a humane and safe environment for both their workers and the planet, maintain quality standards consistent with our brand, and meet certain pricing guarantees. Our overseas sourcing arrangements carry risks associated with products manufactured outside of the U.S., including political unrest and trade restrictions, currency fluctuations, transportation difficulties, work stoppages, and other uncertainties. In addition, a number of our suppliers are small companies, and some of these vendors may not have sufficient capital, resources or personnel to maintain or increase their sales to us or to meet our needs for commitments from them. The failure of our suppliers to provide sufficient quantities of our proprietary products could decrease our revenues, increase our costs, and damage our customer service reputation.\nWe rely on communications and shipping networks to deliver our products\nGiven our emphasis on customer service, the efficient and uninterrupted operation of order-processing and fulfillment functions is critical to our business. To maintain a high level of customer service, we rely heavily on a number of different outside service providers, such as printers, telecommunications companies and delivery companies. Any interruption in services from our principal outside service providers, including delays or disruptions resulting from labor disputes, power outages, human error, adverse weather conditions or natural disasters, could materially adversely affect our business. In addition, freight carriers must ship products that we source overseas to our distribution center, and a work stoppage or political unrest could adversely affect our ability to fulfill our customer orders.\nInformation systems upgrades or integrations may disrupt our operations or financial reporting\nWe continually evaluate and upgrade our management information systems, which are critical to our business. These systems assist in processing orders, managing inventory, purchasing and shipping merchandise on a timely basis, responding to customer service inquiries, and gathering and analyzing operating data by business segment, customer, and stock keeping unit (a specific identifier for each different product). We are required to continually update these systems. Furthermore, if we acquire other companies, we will need to integrate the acquired companies\u2019 systems with ours, a process that could be time-consuming and costly. If our systems cannot accommodate our growth or if they fail, we could incur substantial expenses and our business could be adversely affected.\nAdditionally, success in e-commerce depends upon our ability to provide a compelling and satisfying shopping experience. To remain competitive, we must continue to enhance and improve the responsiveness, functionality and features of our online technology, and if we are unable to do this, our business could be adversely affected.\nA material security breach could cause us to lose sales, damage our reputation or result in liability to us\nOur computer servers may be vulnerable to computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins and similar disruptions. We may need to expend significant additional capital and other resources to protect against a security breach or to alleviate problems caused by any breaches. Our relationships with our customers may be adversely affected if the security measures that we use to protect personal information such as credit card numbers are ineffective. We currently rely on security and authentication technology that we license from third parties. We may not succeed in preventing all security breaches and our failure to do so could adversely affect our business.\nOur systems may fail or limit user traffic, which would cause us to lose sales\nWe support a portion of our business through our call center in Louisville, Colorado. Even though we have back up arrangements, we are dependent on our ability to maintain our computer and telecommunications equipment in this center in effective working order and to protect against damage from fire, natural disaster, power loss, telecommunications failure or similar events. In addition, growth of our customer base may strain or exceed the capacity of our computer and telecommunications systems and lead to degradations in performance or systems failure. We have experienced capacity constraints and failure of information systems in the past that have resulted in decreased levels of service delivery or interruptions in service to customers for limited periods of time. Although we continually review and consider upgrades to our technical infrastructure and provide for system redundancies and backup power to limit the likelihood of systems overload or failure, substantial damage to our systems or a systems failure that causes interruptions for a number of days could adversely affect our business. Additionally, if we are unsuccessful in updating and expanding our infrastructure, including our call center, our ability to grow may be constrained.\nGovernment regulation of the Internet and E-commerce is evolving and unfavorable changes could harm our business\nWe are subject to general business regulations and laws, as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the Internet and E-commerce. Such existing and future laws and regulations may impede the growth of the Internet or other online services. These regulations and laws may cover taxation, user privacy, pricing, content, copyrights, distribution, consumer protection, the provision of online payment services and quality of products and services. Many of the fundamental statutes and regulations applicable to our business were established before the adoption and growth of the Internet and e-commerce. There is lack of clarity on how existing laws and regulations governing issues such as property ownership, sales and other taxes and personal privacy apply to the Internet and E-commerce. Unfavorable resolution of these issues may harm our business.\nSpecifically, the application of indirect taxes (such as sales and use tax, value-added tax (VAT), goods and services tax, business tax and gross receipt tax) to e-commerce businesses such as ours and our customers is a complex and evolving issue. In many cases, it is not clear how existing tax laws and regulations apply to the Internet and E-commerce. In addition, governments are increasingly looking for ways to increase revenues, which has resulted in discussions about tax reform and other legislative action to increase tax revenues, including through indirect taxes. We generally collect sales taxes only on sales to residents of states in which we have nexus. Currently, we collect sales taxes on certain sales to residents of California, Colorado, Illinois, New York, New Jersey, Ohio, and Texas. A number of legislative proposals have been made at the federal, state and local level, and by foreign governments, that would impose additional taxes on the sale of goods and services over the Internet and certain states and other jurisdictions have taken measures to tax Internet-related activities. If legislation is enacted that requires us to collect taxes on sales to residents of other states or jurisdictions, sales in our direct to consumer businesses may be adversely affected. Further, a successful assertion by one or more states or other jurisdictions requiring us to collect taxes where we do not do so could result in substantial tax liabilities, including for past sales, as well as penalties and interest.\nWe may face legal liability for the content contained on our websites\nWe could face legal liability for defamation, negligence, copyright, patent or trademark infringement, personal injury or other claims based on the nature and content of materials that we publish or distribute on our websites. If we are held liable for damages for the content on our websites, our business may suffer. Further, one of our goals is for our websites to be trustworthy and dependable providers of information and services. Allegations of impropriety, even if unfounded, could therefore have a material adverse effect on our reputation and our business.\nRelying on our centralized fulfillment center could expose us to losing revenue\nPrompt and efficient fulfillment of our customers\u2019 orders is critical to our business. Our facility near Cincinnati, Ohio handles a portion of our fulfillment functions and some customer-service related operations, such as returns processing. Many of our orders are filled and shipped from the Cincinnati facility. The balance is shipped by third party fulfillment centers or directly from suppliers. Because we rely on a centralized fulfillment center, our fulfillment functions could be severely impaired in the event of fire, extended adverse weather conditions, transportation difficulties or natural disasters. Because we recognize revenue only when we ship orders, interruption of our shipping could diminish our revenues.\nWe may face quarterly and seasonal fluctuations that could harm our business\nOur revenue and results of operations have fluctuated and will continue to fluctuate on a quarterly basis as a result of a number of factors, including the timing of catalog offerings, timing of orders from retailers, recognition of costs or net sales contributed by new merchandise, fluctuations in response rates, fluctuations in paper, production and postage costs and expenses, merchandise returns, adverse weather conditions that affect distribution or shipping, shifts in the timing of holidays and changes in our merchandise mix. In particular, our net sales and profits have historically been higher during the fourth quarter holiday season. We believe that this seasonality will continue in the future.\nPostage and shipping costs may increase and therefore increase our expenses\nWe ship our products, catalogs, and lifestyle publications to consumers and the cost of shipping is a material expenditure. Postage and shipping prices increase periodically and can be expected to increase in the future. Any inability to secure suitable or commercially favorable prices or other terms for the delivery of our merchandise and catalogs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is subject to reporting requirements that continue to evolve and change, which could continue to require significant compliance effort and resources\nBecause our Class A common stock is publicly traded, we are subject to certain rules and regulations of federal, state and financial market exchange entities charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded. These entities, including the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the NASDAQ, periodically issue new requirements and regulations and legislative bodies also review and revise applicable laws. As interpretation and implementation of these laws and rules and promulgation of new regulations continues, we will continue to be required to commit significant financial and managerial resources and incur additional expenses.", "PERMNO": 87321, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "GAIA"}
