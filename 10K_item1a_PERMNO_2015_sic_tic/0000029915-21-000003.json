RISK FACTORS\nThe factors described below represent the Corporation's principal risks.\nCOVID-19 PANDEMIC - RELATED RISKS\nPublic Health Crisis: A public health crisis or global outbreak of disease, including the pandemic caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) has had, and could continue to have, a negative effect on the Corporation's manufacturing operations, supply chain and workforce, creating disruptions that could continue to have a substantial negative impact on the Corporation\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nUCC sells substantially all of its products to TDCC in order to simplify the worldwide customer interface process and, as a result, the Corporation is subject to many of the same global risk factors facing TDCC, including those presented by COVID-19. The pandemic caused by COVID-19 has impacted all geographic regions where UCC's products are produced and sold. The global, regional and local spread of COVID-19 has resulted in significant global mitigation measures, including government-directed quarantines, social distancing and shelter-in-place mandates, travel restrictions and/or bans, and restricted access to certain corporate facilities and manufacturing sites. Uncertainty with respect to the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, coupled with oil price fluctuations due in part to the global spread of COVID-19 and the continued increase in global cases, has contributed to the volatility of financial markets. While the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic in key geographic regions and end-markets cannot be reasonably estimated at this time, impacts to the Corporation include, but are not limited to: a decrease in demand for certain Corporation products; price declines; reduced profitability; supply chain disruptions impeding the Corporation\u2019s ability to ship and/or receive product; temporary idling or permanent closure of select manufacturing facilities and/or manufacturing assets; asset impairment charges; interruptions or limitations to manufacturing operations imposed by local, state or federal governments; workforce absenteeism and distraction; labor shortages; increased cyber security risk and data accessibility disruptions due to remote working arrangements; and workforce reductions. Additional risks may include, but are not limited to: shortages of key raw materials; additional asset impairment charges; increased obligations related to the Corporation\u2019s pension and other postretirement benefit plans; and tax valuation allowances. Disruptions and market volatility resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic have had and could continue to have a substantial negative impact on the Corporation\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. The adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Corporation may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this \"Risk Factors\" section.\nMACROECONOMIC RISKS\nGlobal Economic Considerations: The Corporation operates in a global, competitive environment, which gives rise to operating and market risk exposure.\nThe Corporation sells substantially all of its products to TDCC, which operates in a competitive, global environment, and competes worldwide for sales. Increased levels of competition could result in lower prices or lower sales volume, which could have a negative impact on the Corporation's results of operations. Sales of TDCC's products are also subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations, trade agreements, import and export controls, and duties and tariffs. The imposition of additional regulations, controls and duties and tariffs or changes to bilateral and regional trade agreements could result in lower sales volume, which could negatively impact the Corporation's results of operations.\nEconomic conditions around the world, and in certain industries in which the Corporation and TDCC do business, also impact sales price and volume. As a result, market uncertainty or an economic downturn in the geographic regions or industries in which UCC products are sold could reduce demand for these products and result in decreased sales volume, which could have a negative impact on UCC's results of operations.\nFinancial Flexibility: Market conditions could reduce TDCC's financial flexibility, which could impact the financial flexibility of the Corporation.\nAdverse economic conditions could reduce TDCC's flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions or to fund capital expenditures or working capital needs. The economic environment could result in a contraction in the availability of credit in the marketplace and reduce sources of liquidity for TDCC and could result in higher borrowing costs. Since TDCC is a service provider, material debtor, and the major customer of the Corporation, reduced financial flexibility for TDCC could potentially impact the financial flexibility of the Corporation.\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefits: Increased obligations and expenses related to the Corporation's defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plan could negatively affect UCC's financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Corporation has defined benefit pension plans and an other postretirement benefit plan (the \"plans\") in the United States. The assets of the Corporation's funded plans are primarily invested in fixed income securities, equity securities of U.S. and foreign issuers and alternative investments, including investments in real estate, private equity and absolute return strategies. Changes in the market value of plan assets, investment returns, discount rates, mortality rates, regulations and the rate of increase in compensation levels and health care cost trends may affect the funded status of the Corporation's plans and could cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost, future funding requirements of the plans and the funded status of the plans. A significant increase in the Corporation's obligations or future funding requirements could have a negative impact on the Corporation's results of operations and cash flows for a particular period and on the Corporation's financial position.\nSupply/Demand Balance: Earnings generated by the Corporation vary based in part on the balance of supply relative to demand within the industry.\nThe balance of supply relative to demand within the industry may be significantly impacted by the addition of new capacity, especially for basic commodities where capacity is generally added in large increments as world-scale facilities are built. This may disrupt industry balances and result in downward pressure on prices due to the increase in supply, which could negatively impact the Corporation's results of operations.\nLEGAL AND REGULATORY RISKS\nEnvironmental Compliance: The costs of complying with evolving regulatory requirements could negatively impact the Corporation's financial results. Actual or alleged violations of environmental laws or permit requirements could result in restrictions or prohibitions on plant operations, substantial civil or criminal sanctions, as well as the assessment of strict liability and/or joint and several liability.\nThe Corporation is subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations, rules and ordinances relating to pollution, protection of the environment, climate change, greenhouse gas emissions and the generation, storage, handling, transportation, treatment, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and waste materials. At December 31, 2020, the Corporation had accrued obligations of $133 million ($132 million at December 31, 2019) for probable environmental remediation and restoration costs, including $18 million ($20 million at December 31, 2019) for the remediation of Superfund sites. This is management's best estimate of the costs for remediation and restoration with respect to environmental matters for which the Corporation has accrued liabilities, although it is reasonably possible that the ultimate cost with respect to these particular matters could range up to approximately two and a half times that amount. Costs and capital expenditures relating to environmental, health or safety matters are subject to evolving regulatory requirements and depend on the timing of the promulgation and enforcement of specific standards which impose the requirements. Moreover, changes in environmental regulations could inhibit or interrupt the Corporation's operations, or require modifications to its facilities. Accordingly, environmental, health or safety regulatory matters could result in significant unanticipated costs or liabilities. For additional information, see Part II, Item 7. Other Matters, Environmental Matters in Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nLitigation: The Corporation is party to a number of claims and lawsuits arising out of the normal course of business with respect to commercial matters, including product liability, governmental tax and regulation disputes, and other actions.\nThe Corporation is involved in a number of legal proceedings and claims with both private and governmental parties. These cover a wide range of matters, including, but not limited to: product liability; trade regulation; governmental tax and regulatory proceedings; health, safety and environmental matters; employment matters; patent infringement; contracts; and commercial litigation. With the exception of the possible effect of the asbestos-related liability described below, it is the opinion of the Corporation's management that the possibility is remote that the aggregate of all such claims and lawsuits will have a material adverse impact on the Corporation's consolidated financial statements.\nThe Corporation is and has been involved in a large number of asbestos-related suits filed primarily in state courts during the past four decades. At December 31, 2020, the Corporation's total asbestos-related liability for pending and future claims, including future defense and processing costs, was $1,098 million ($1,165 million at December 31, 2019). See Notes 1 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on asbestos-related matters.\nHealth and Safety: Increased concerns regarding the safe use of chemicals and plastics in commerce and their potential impact on the environment have resulted in more restrictive regulations and could lead to new regulations.\nConcerns regarding the safe use of chemicals and plastics in commerce and their potential impact on health and the environment reflect a growing trend in societal demands for increasing levels of product safety and environmental protection. These concerns could manifest themselves in stockholder proposals, preferred purchasing, delays or failures in obtaining or retaining regulatory approvals and continued pressure for more stringent regulatory intervention and litigation. These concerns could also influence public perceptions, the viability or continued sales of the Corporation's products, the Corporation's reputation and the cost to comply with regulations. In addition, terrorist attacks and natural disasters have increased concerns about the security and safety of chemical production and distribution. These concerns could have a negative impact on the Corporation's results of operations.\nLocal, state, federal and foreign governments continue to propose new regulations related to the security of chemical plant locations and the transportation of hazardous chemicals, which could result in higher operating costs.\nPlastic Waste: Increased concerns regarding plastic waste in the environment, consumers selectively reducing their consumption of plastic products due to recycling concerns, or new or more restrictive regulations and rules related to plastic waste could reduce demand for the Corporation\u2019s plastic products and could negatively impact the Corporation\u2019s financial results.\nLocal, state, federal and foreign governments have been increasingly proposing and in some cases approving bans on certain plastic-based products including single-use plastics, plastic straws and utensils. In addition, plastics have faced increased public scrutiny due to negative coverage of plastic waste in the environment, including the world\u2019s oceans. Substantially all of the Corporation's sales are to TDCC, which is one of the world\u2019s largest producers of plastics. Therefore, increased regulation on the use of plastics could cause reduced demand for the Corporation\u2019s polyethylene products which could negatively impact the Corporation's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOPERATIONAL RISKS\nRaw Materials: Availability of purchased feedstocks and energy, and the volatility of these costs, impact the Corporation's operating costs and add variability to earnings.\nPurchased feedstock and energy costs account for a substantial portion of the Corporation's total production costs and operating expenses. The Corporation purchases hydrocarbon raw materials including ethane, propane, butane and naphtha as feedstocks. The Corporation also purchases certain monomers, primarily ethylene and propylene, to supplement internal production, as well as other raw materials. The Corporation purchases natural gas, primarily to generate electricity, and purchases electric power to supplement internal generation.\nFeedstock and energy costs generally follow price trends in crude oil and natural gas, which are sometimes volatile. Ultimately, the ability to pass on underlying cost increases is dependent on market conditions. Conversely, when feedstock and energy costs decline, selling prices generally decline as well. As a result, volatility in these costs could impact the Corporation's results of operations.\nWhile the Corporation expects abundant and cost-advantaged supplies of natural gas liquids (\"NGLs\") in the United States to persist for the foreseeable future, if NGLs become significantly less advantaged than crude oil-based feedstocks, it could have a negative impact on the Corporation's results of operations and future investments. Also, if the Corporation's key suppliers of feedstocks and energy are unable to provide the raw materials required for production, it could have a negative impact on the Corporation's results of operations.\nOperational Event: A significant operational event could negatively impact the Corporation's results of operations.\nAs a diversified chemical manufacturing company, the Corporation's operations, the transportation of products, cyber-attacks, pandemics or severe weather conditions and other natural phenomena (such as freezing, drought, hurricanes, earthquakes, tsunamis, floods, etc.) could result in an unplanned event that could be significant in scale and could negatively impact operations, neighbors or the public at large, which could have a negative impact on the Corporation's results of operations.\nMajor hurricanes have caused significant disruption in UCC's operations on the U.S. Gulf Coast, logistics across the region, and the supply of certain raw materials, which had an adverse impact on volume and cost for some of UCC's products. Due to the Corporation's substantial presence on the U.S. Gulf Coast, similar severe weather conditions or other natural phenomena in the future could negatively impact UCC's results of operations.\nCyber Threat: The risk of loss of the Corporation's intellectual property, trade secrets or other sensitive business information or disruption of operations could negatively impact the Corporation's financial results.\nCyber-attacks or security breaches could compromise confidential, business critical information, cause a disruption in the Corporation's operations or harm the Corporation's reputation. The Corporation has attractive information assets, including intellectual property, trade secrets and other sensitive, business critical information. While the Corporation has a comprehensive cyber-security program that is continuously reviewed, maintained and upgraded, a significant cyber-attack could result in the loss of critical business information and/or could negatively impact operations, which could have a negative impact on the Corporation's financial results.", "PERMNO": 15659, "SIC": 2860, "TIC": "DOW2"}
