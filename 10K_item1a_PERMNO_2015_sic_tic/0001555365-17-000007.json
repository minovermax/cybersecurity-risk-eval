{"cik": "1555365", "company": "WHITEWAVE FOODS Co", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-02-24", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nIn evaluating and understanding us and our business, you should carefully consider the risks described below, in conjunction with all of the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d contained in Part II, Item 7. If any of the events or circumstances described in the following risk factors actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and future prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nRisk Related to Our Pending Merger with Danone S.A.\nWe may not be able to complete our merger with Danone S.A. and uncertainty concerning completion of the merger may adversely affect our business operations and financial results.\nAs described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, on July 6, 2016, we signed a merger agreement with Danone S.A. and July Merger Sub, Inc., a subsidiary of Danone, pursuant to which we will merge with July Merger Sub and become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Danone. The closing of the merger is subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions, including the expiration or termination of all applicable waiting periods under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act (\u201cHSR Act\u201d). The United States Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d) continues to review the merger under the HSR Act. As we previously announced, each of WhiteWave and Danone elected on January 6, 2017 to extend the Long Stop Date under the merger agreement by 90 days to facilitate the completion of the DOJ\u2019s review. We are targeting completion of the merger in first quarter 2017, although there can be no assurance regarding timing of completion of regulatory processes. We cannot be certain that we will be able to satisfy or obtain a waiver of the other conditions to completion of the merger, in which case the merger may not be completed.\nIf the merger is not completed for any reason, including as a result of a failure to obtain regulatory clearance, our ongoing business and relationships may be adversely affected and the price of our common stock may be negatively impacted.\nIn addition, the merger agreement may be terminated by the Company or Danone under certain circumstances. If the merger agreement is terminated under certain specified circumstances, we will be required to pay Danone a termination fee of $310.0 million.\nThe restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to the consummation of the merger, and the uncertainties and risks concerning completion of the merger, may cause our business, sales, operations and financial results to suffer during the executory period or in the event the merger is not completed. The merger agreement requires us to conduct business in the ordinary course, subject to specific limitations, which may delay or prevent us from undertaking business opportunities that, absent the merger agreement, we might have pursued. The announcement of the merger and any delay in completing the merger may divert management\u2019s attention from ongoing business operations, affect our ability to retain or recruit key employees and negatively impact our business relationships with customers and suppliers. In addition, the nature, cost and outcome of pending and future litigation and other legal proceedings, including any such proceedings related to the merger and instituted against us and others, may be material.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe face significant competition, which could reduce our sales and profits.\nWe face significant competition in each of our product categories, and further consolidation in the industry would likely increase competition. Increased competition can reduce our sales due to loss of market share or because we reduce prices to respond to competitive and customer pressures. Competitive pressures also may restrict our ability to increase prices, including in response to commodity and other cost increases. Our competitors may be able to introduce innovative products more quickly or market\ntheir products more successfully than we can, which could cause our growth rate in certain categories to be slower than we expected and could cause us to lose sales. Our competitors also may choose to compete based on price and promotions, which may impact our volume growth, profitability and market share. Our profits could decrease if a reduction in prices or increased costs are not counterbalanced with increased sales volume.\nIn most of our product categories, our branded products compete not only with other widely advertised branded products, but also with regional brands and with generic and private label products that are generally sold at lower prices. A consumer shift towards more private label, lower-priced, or other value offerings could result in us reducing pricing, increasing marketing or other expenditures, or losing market share. We also compete, particularly in our premium dairy and organic salads, fruits and vegetables categories, with producers of non-organic products, which usually have lower operational costs. As a result, non-organic producers can offer conventional products to customers at lower costs than organic products. This could cause us to lower our prices, resulting in lower profitability or, in the alternative, cause us to lose market share if we fail to lower prices.\nErosion of the reputation of one or more of our leading brands could reduce our sales and profits.\nThe majority of our net sales are from sales of our branded products, including Silk, International Delight, Horizon Organic, LAND O LAKES, Earthbound Farm, So Delicious, Wallaby, Vega, Alpro, and Provamel, and growth in our business has resulted primarily from the strength of these brands. To succeed in promoting and enhancing brand value, we need to meet and exceed consumers\u2019 expectations for high-quality and innovative products. Our brand value could diminish significantly if, for example, there is adverse publicity about our products (whether or not valid), we are required to recall our products, we fail to maintain the quality of our products, our products fail to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences, consumers believe that we have acted in an irresponsible manner or our products are not available. The growing use of social and digital media by consumers, us and third parties increases the speed and extent that information or misinformation and opinions can be shared. Negative posts or comments about WhiteWave, our brands or our products on social or digital media could seriously damage our brands and reputation. If we do not maintain the favorable perception of our brands, our sales and profits could be negatively impacted.\nIn addition, the reputation of our brands may suffer if any trademarks associated with our products are perceived negatively by consumers. For example, certain of our products are marketed under trademarks we have licensed from third parties, such as LAND O LAKES, Almond Joy, Cold Stone Creamery, Cinnabon, Dunkin Donuts, Hershey\u2019s, TruMoo, and YORK, and we are unable to control the quality of other products that third parties produce and market under those trademarks and trade names. Our results of operations could be negatively affected if the reputation of one or more of our brands suffers damage due to real or perceived quality issues with our products, or if we are found to have violated any applicable laws or regulations.\nOur financial success depends on our ability to successfully predict changes in consumer preferences and develop successful new products in response.\nConsumer preferences evolve over time and the success of our products depends on our ability to identify the tastes and dietary habits of consumers and to offer products that appeal to their preferences and address their concerns. Recent trends in consumer preferences that may impact us include:\n\u2022\ndietary trends and increased attention to nutritional values, such as the sugar, fat, protein, fiber or calorie content;\n\u2022\nconcerns about obesity and the health effects of specific ingredients and nutrients, such as sugar and other sweeteners, GMO ingredients, gluten, dairy, soybeans, nuts, oils, vitamins, fiber and minerals; and\n\u2022\nincreasing awareness of the environmental and social effects of product production.\nThe development and introduction of new products could require substantial R&D and other expenditures, including capital investment and marketing and slotting investments. If our products fail to meet consumer preferences, or we fail to introduce new and improved products on a timely basis, then the return on that investment will be less than anticipated and our strategy to grow sales and profits through product innovations and extensions will be less successful.\nWe are subject to the risk of product contamination and product liability claims, which could harm our reputation, force us to recall products and incur substantial costs.\nWe may be liable if the consumption of any of our products causes injury, illness or death to consumers. We may need to recall some of our products if we discover tampering by unauthorized parties; mislabeling; cross contamination of ingredients that are allergens; or product contamination or spoilage, including the presence of foreign objects, substances, chemicals, other agents, or residues introduced during the growing, production, storage, handling or transportation phases. In addition, we will voluntarily recall products in the event of contamination or damage. We also may be subject to liability if our products or operations violate applicable laws or regulations, including environmental, health, and safety requirements. A significant product liability judgment or a widespread product recall may negatively impact our sales and profitability due to the costs of the recall, the destruction of\nproduct inventory, product availability, competitive reaction, customer reaction and consumer attitudes. Even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that our products caused injury, illness or death could adversely affect our reputation.\nOur product advertising also could make us the target of claims relating to false or deceptive advertising under U.S. federal and state laws, including the consumer protection statutes of some states, or laws of other jurisdictions in which we operate. These types of claims or liabilities might not be covered by insurance or by any rights of indemnity or contribution that we may have against others. In addition, we have agreed with certain customers to provide defense and indemnification for certain types of these claims. Even if a product liability, consumer fraud, or other claim is found to be without merit or is otherwise unsuccessful, the negative publicity surrounding such assertions regarding our products or processes could materially and adversely affect our reputation and brand image, particularly in categories that are promoted as having strong health and wellness credentials. Any loss of consumer confidence in our product ingredients or in the safety and quality of our products would be difficult and costly to overcome.\nFailure to maintain sufficient internal production capacity or to enter into third-party agreements on terms that are beneficial for us may result in our inability to meet customer demand and/or may increase our operating costs and capital expenditures.\nWe rely on internal production capacity and third-party co-packers to fulfill our growing production needs. Certain of our production facilities are operating at high rates of utilization, and we may need to expand our production facilities or increase our reliance on third parties to provide production and supply services, commonly referred to as \u201cco-packing\u201d agreements, for a number of our products. A failure by us or our co-packers to comply with food safety, environmental, or other laws and regulations may disrupt our supply of products. In addition, we have experienced, and may experience, increased distribution and warehousing costs due to capacity constraints resulting from our growth. If we need to enter into additional co-packing, warehousing or distribution agreements in the future, we can provide no assurance that we would be able to find acceptable third party providers or enter into agreements on satisfactory terms or at all. In addition, we may need to expand our internal capacity, which could increase our operating costs and could require significant capital expenditures. If we cannot maintain sufficient production, warehousing and distribution capacity, either internally or through third party agreements, we may be unable to meet customer demand and/or our manufacturing, distribution and warehousing costs may increase, which could negatively affect our business.\nThe loss of any of our largest customers or the continued consolidation in the retail industry could negatively impact our sales and results of operations.\nOur largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., and its subsidiaries, including Sam\u2019s Club, accounted for 13.3% of our total net sales in 2016 and our top 10 customers, collectively, accounted for 49.0% of our total net sales in 2016. We have written agreements with some but not all of our customers, and the written agreements generally are terminable at will by the customer. The loss of any large customer, a material reduction in sales or a change in the mix of products we sell to a large customer for an extended period could negatively affect our sales and results of operations.\nIn addition, as the retail grocery trade continues to consolidate and mass marketers become larger, our large retail customers may seek to use their position to improve their profitability through lower pricing and increased promotional programs. If we are unable to benefit from the strength of our brands, and our marketing expertise, product innovation and category leadership positions to respond, our profitability or sales growth could be negatively affected. In addition, our customers sometimes award contracts based on competitive bidding, which could result in lower profits for contracts we win and the loss of business for contracts we lose.\nWe are increasingly dependent on information technology (\u201cIT\u201d).\nWe rely on IT networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit and store electronic and financial information, to manage a variety of business processes and activities, including order management, manufacturing, warehousing and logistics, and to comply with regulatory, legal and tax requirements. We also depend on our IT infrastructure for digital marketing activities and for electronic communications among our locations, personnel, customers and suppliers around the world. These IT systems, some of which are hosted and/or supported by third parties, may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases or components thereof, power outages, hardware failures, computer viruses, attacks by computer hackers or other cybersecurity risks, telecommunication failures, user errors, natural disasters, terrorist attacks or other catastrophic events. If any of our significant IT systems suffer severe or prolonged damage, disruption or shutdown, and our disaster recovery and business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, our product sales, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected, and we could experience delays in reporting our financial results.\nReduced availability or excess supply of raw materials and other inputs, as well as increased costs for our raw materials and other inputs, could adversely affect us.\nWe depend heavily on raw materials and other inputs, such as organic and conventional milk, butterfat, almonds, organic and non-genetically modified (\u201cnon-GMO\u201d) soybeans, sweeteners, and organic salads, fruits and vegetables, to produce our products and also on commodities, such as packaging, utilities, natural gas, resin and petroleum-based products, to package and distribute our products. We generally source our raw materials from third-party suppliers, and we are not assured of continued supply, pricing, or exclusive access to raw materials from any of these suppliers. In addition, a substantial portion of our raw materials are agricultural products, which are vulnerable to adverse weather conditions and natural disasters, such as severe rains, floods, droughts, frost, earthquakes, and pestilence. Adverse weather conditions and natural disasters also can lower dairy and crop yields and reduce supplies of these ingredients or increase their prices. Other events that adversely affect our third-party suppliers and that are out of our control, such as problems with our suppliers\u2019 businesses, finances, labor relations, costs, production, insurance, and reputation, could also impair our ability to obtain the raw materials and other inputs in the quantities we need and at economical prices. Over the past several years, we have experienced increased costs as a result of weather conditions and other events outside our and our suppliers\u2019 control and this may occur again in the future. In addition, due to the nature of agricultural products, we finalize our planting plan for organic greens and produce at least several months before sales of such products occur. If we do not accurately forecast our sales of organic greens and produce, or if our sales forecasts change after we finalize our planting plan, we may have excess produce that we will not be able to sell before it spoils. The costs of such spoiled produce is higher if we have procured the produce from third party growers under fixed commitment contracts, which we do during the winter growing season, rather than grow the produce ourselves.\nThe organic ingredients (including milk, organic salads, fruits and vegetables, other dairy-related products, and soybeans) and non-GMO ingredients for our products are less plentiful and available from fewer suppliers than their conventional counterparts. Competition with other manufacturers in the procurement of organic and non-GMO product ingredients may increase in the future if consumer demand for organic and non-GMO products increases. In addition, the dairy industry continues to experience periodic imbalances between supply and demand for organic raw milk. Industry regulation and the costs of organic farming compared to costs of conventional farming have impacted, and may continue to impact, the supply of organic raw milk in the market. Oversupply levels of organic raw milk can increase competitive pressure on our products and pricing, while supply shortages can cause product shortages and higher costs to us. Cost increases in raw materials and other inputs could cause our profits to decrease significantly compared to prior periods, as we may be unable to increase our prices to offset the increased cost of these raw materials and other inputs. We do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices, and the risk management procedures that we use may not always work as we intend (e.g., our hedged price could exceed the spot price on the date we actually take receipt of the commodity). If we are unable to obtain raw materials and other inputs for our products or offset any increased costs for such raw materials and inputs, our business could be negatively affected.\nImposition of new taxes or disagreements with tax or other governmental authorities could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe are subject to the tax laws and regulations of various federal, state and local governments in the United States, as well as tax laws and regulations in numerous foreign jurisdictions, which could impact our business operations and our acquisition of businesses in those jurisdictions. The computation of our worldwide income tax expense is complex as it is based on the laws of various taxing jurisdictions and requires significant judgment in the application of rules governing accounting for tax provisions under U.S. GAAP. Future changes in domestic or international tax laws and regulations could adversely affect our income tax liabilities. Recent developments, including potential corporate tax reform in the U.S. and its related international tax rules, the European Commission\u2019s investigations of the tax authorities in certain European countries regarding whether decisions made by these tax authorities comply with European Union rules on state aid, as well as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\u2019s project on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting, may result in changes to long-standing tax principles. Any such changes, in the U.S. or abroad, could adversely affect our effective tax rate or result in higher cash tax liabilities.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we may engage in transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are subject to reviews, examinations and investigations by tax and other governmental authorities both within and outside the United States. Economic and political pressures in various jurisdictions to increase tax revenues may make resolving tax disputes more difficult. The final determination of tax audits, investigations or any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax expense and accruals and could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements in the periods for which that determination is made.\nWe may not be able to successfully complete and integrate strategic acquisitions or establish and operate joint ventures.\nOne of our strategic growth initiatives has been to grow our business through the acquisition of new brands and the establishment of joint ventures in the United States and globally. We cannot be certain that we will successfully be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or joint venture partners and accurately assess their value, growth potential, strengths, weaknesses, contingent and other liabilities, and potential profitability, negotiate transactions on terms acceptable to us, achieve the desired\ntax results, particularly in foreign jurisdictions, that could ultimately impact the overall cost of the acquisition or the ultimate after tax profitability expected from the acquisition; or integrate any acquisitions that we complete.\nOur acquisition activities may present financial, managerial, and operational risks, such as diversion of management attention from existing businesses, difficulties integrating personnel and financial and other systems, inability to promptly ensure an effective control environment, and indemnities and potential disputes with the sellers. Any of these factors could affect our sales, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the acquired businesses or joint ventures may not achieve the level of sales or profitability that justify our investment in them, and an acquired business may have unidentified liabilities for which we, as a successor owner, may be responsible. We may be required to write down our investment if the business fails to achieve our financial expectations.\nOur international operations subject us to business risks that could cause our revenue and profitability to decline.\nBased upon current distribution, we estimate that our products are sold in over 50 countries worldwide. Sales to customers outside of the United States accounted for 19% and 18% of our total net sales in the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. In addition, we formed a joint venture in China that began producing and selling products in China at the end of 2014. Risks associated with our operations outside of the United States include:\n\u2022\ninterpretation of and compliance with legal and regulatory requirements in multiple jurisdictions that differ from those in the United States and change from time to time, such as tax, labor, and trade laws, food safety laws, antitrust and competition laws, and data privacy laws;\n\u2022\ndifficulties and costs associated with complying with U.S. laws and regulations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, applicable to entities with overseas operations;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in managing, and additional financial investments required to manage, operations outside the U.S. and ensuring consistent compliance with company policies and procedures;\n\u2022\nforeign currency exposures;\n\u2022\npolitical, social and economic instability;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of tariffs, quotas, trade barriers, other trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;\n\u2022\nincreased costs, disruptions in shipping or reduced availability of freight transportation; and\n\u2022\ndiminished protection of intellectual property in some countries.\nIf one or more of these business risks occur, our business and results of operations could be negatively affected.\nWe may face difficulties as we expand our operations into countries in which we have no prior operating experience.\nWe intend to grow our business by, among other things, introducing our brands and products into high-growth regions across the globe, including countries in which we currently do not operate. These regions may include less developed countries, which may be less politically, socially or economically stable and which may have less developed infrastructure and legal systems. In addition, it may be difficult for us to understand and accurately predict taste preferences and purchasing habits of consumers in these new geographic markets. Our inability to develop and offer products that appeal to local consumer preferences or to efficiently navigate the regulatory, distribution, personnel, technological and other differences in these new geographies, could have a material adverse effect on our profitability. In addition, commencing operations in new countries may present financial, managerial, and operational risks, such as diversion of management attention from existing businesses, difficulties managing personnel from afar and difficulties understanding and implementing new legal and regulatory requirements. Any of these factors could affect our sales, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur operations face foreign currency exchange exposure that could materially negatively impact our operating results.\nWe hold assets, incur liabilities, earn revenue and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, Mexican peso, Chinese yuan and the Brazilian real. Because our financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate our assets, liabilities, sales and expenses into U.S. dollars at the then-applicable exchange rates. Consequently, changes in the value of the U.S. dollar versus these non-U.S. currencies may negatively affect the value of these items in our financial statements, even if their value has not changed in their original currency. We may attempt to mitigate some of this risk with hedging and other activities; however our business nevertheless will remain subject to substantial foreign exchange risk from foreign currency translation exposure.\nAdverse weather conditions, natural disasters, crop disease, pests and other natural conditions can impose significant costs and losses on our business.\nAgricultural products are vulnerable to adverse weather conditions, including severe rains, drought and temperature extremes, floods and windstorms, which are quite common but difficult to predict. For example, parts of California have experienced drought, which have impacted the availability and cost of our raw materials, including almonds and dairy inputs. Agricultural products also are vulnerable to crop disease and to pests, which may vary in severity and effect, depending on the stage of production at the time of infection or infestation, the type of treatment applied and climatic conditions. Unfavorable growing conditions caused by these factors can reduce both crop size and crop quality and, in extreme cases, entire harvests may be lost. These factors may result in lower sales volume and, in the case of farms we manage, increased costs due to expenditures for additional farming techniques, the repair of infrastructure and the replanting of damaged or destroyed crops. Incremental costs, including transportation, may also be incurred if we need to find alternate short-term supplies of organic greens or other produce from other growers. These factors can increase costs, decrease revenues and lead to additional charges to earnings, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nDisruption of our supply or distribution chains could adversely affect our business.\nOur ability to make, move, and sell our products is critical to our success. Damage or disruption to our manufacturing, farming or distribution capabilities due to weather, natural disaster, fire or explosion, terrorism, pandemic, strikes, government actions, the financial or operational instability of key suppliers, distributors, warehousing, and transportation providers, or other reasons could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products. For example, the loss of any of our Europe Foods & Beverages segment\u2019s third-party distributors for local representation in Europe could negatively affect our business. In addition, most of our organic salads, fruits and vegetables, and plant-based frozen desserts are processed in a single facility, and damage or disruption to these facilities could impair our ability to process and sell those products. Disputes with significant suppliers or contract manufacturers, including disputes regarding pricing or performance, may also adversely affect our ability to manufacture and/or sell our products, as well as our business or financial results. Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, could adversely affect our business or financial results.\nChanges in our credit ratings may have a negative impact on our future financing costs or the availability of capital.\nSome of our indebtedness is rated by Standard & Poor\u2019s and Moody\u2019s Investors Service, and there are a number of factors beyond our control that could impact these ratings. Our credit ratings are currently considered to be below \u201cinvestment grade.\u201d Although the interest rates on our existing indebtedness are not impacted by changes in our credit ratings, such ratings or any rating downgrades may impair our ability to raise additional capital in the future on terms that are acceptable to us, may cause the value of our securities to decline and may have other negative implications with respect to our business.\nEconomic downturns could limit consumer demand for our products and negatively affect our sales and profitability.\nRetailers are increasingly offering private label products that compete with our products. Consumers\u2019 willingness to purchase our products will depend upon our ability to offer products that appeal to consumers at the right price. It is also important that our products are perceived to be of a higher quality than less expensive alternatives. If the difference in quality between our products and those of private label brands narrows, or if such difference in quality is perceived to have narrowed, then consumers may not buy our products. Furthermore, during periods of economic uncertainty, consumers may shift their purchases to lower-priced or private label products or forego certain purchases altogether. They also may reduce the number of organic and premium products that they purchase because organic and premium products generally have higher retail prices than their conventional counterparts. Lower consumer demand resulting from an economic downturn could decrease our sales volumes and negatively affect our results of operations.\nWe may need additional financing in the future, and we may not be able to obtain that financing.\nFrom time to time, we may need additional financing to support our business and pursue our growth strategy, including strategic acquisitions. Our ability to obtain additional financing, if and when required, will depend on investor demand, our operating performance, the condition of the capital markets, and other factors. We cannot assure you that additional financing will be available to us on favorable terms when required, or at all.\nOur substantial debt and financial obligations could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to incur additional debt.\nAs of January 31, 2017, we had approximately $2.2 billion of outstanding indebtedness, which excludes debt issuance costs. We also had additional borrowing capacity of approximately $819.4 million under our committed credit facilities, and these credit\nfacilities allow us, as borrower, to add one or more incremental term loan facilities and/or increase the commitments under the revolving credit facilities in an aggregate principal amount of up to $521.6 million, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions.\nOur debt levels and the terms of our financing arrangements:\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal of, and interest on, our debt, which will reduce the funds we have available for other purposes;\n\u2022\nmay limit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions, to fund growth or for general corporate purposes, especially if the ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating organizations were revised downward;\n\u2022\nmay limit our future ability to refinance our indebtedness on terms acceptable to us or at all;\n\u2022\nmay subject us to higher levels of indebtedness than our competitors, which may cause a competitive disadvantage for us and may reduce our flexibility in responding to increased competition;\n\u2022\nmay limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and market conditions or in funding our strategic growth plan; and\n\u2022\nimpose on us financial and operational restrictions.\nIf we are not able to repay or refinance our debt as it becomes due, we may be forced to take disadvantageous actions, including reducing spending on marketing, retail trade incentives, advertising and product innovation, reducing financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes, or otherwise dedicating an unsustainable level of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness.\nThe credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities contains various covenants that impose restrictions on us that may affect our ability to operate our business.\nThe credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities contains covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to:\n\u2022\nborrow money or guarantee debt\n\u2022\ncreate liens;\n\u2022\nmake specified types of investments and acquisitions\n\u2022\npay dividends on or redeem or repurchase stock\n\u2022\nenter into sale and leaseback transactions\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022\nsell assets or merge with other companies\nThese restrictions on the operation of our business could harm us by, among other things, limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, merger and acquisition opportunities, and other corporate opportunities. Various risks, uncertainties, and events beyond our control could affect our ability to comply with these covenants.\nLabor issues could adversely affect our business.\nAs of January 2017, approximately 28% of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements or works council representation. Our collective bargaining agreements are scheduled to expire at various times over the next five years. A strike, work slowdown, or other labor unrest could in some cases impair our ability to supply our products to customers, which could result in reduced revenue and customer claims, and may distract our management from focusing on our business and strategic priorities.\nWe purchase a portion of our organic greens and other fresh produce from third-party growers who grow these products in the United States. The personnel engaged for harvesting operations by these third-party growers and by us, typically include significant numbers of immigrants who are authorized to work in the United States. The availability and number of these workers may decrease if certain changes are enacted in U.S. immigration laws. A scarcity of available personnel to harvest agricultural products in the United States could increase our costs for those products or could lead to product shortages.\nOur intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products and brands.\nWe consider our intellectual property rights, particularly our trademarks, but also our patents, trade secrets, copyrights, and licenses, to be a significant and valuable aspect of our business. We attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret laws, as well as licensing agreements, third-party confidentiality, nondisclosure, and assignment agreements, and by policing third-party misuses of our intellectual property. Our failure to obtain or maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property rights, or any change in law or other changes that serve to lessen or remove the current legal protections of our intellectual property, may diminish our competitiveness and could materially harm our business.\nWe also face the risk of claims that we have infringed third parties\u2019 intellectual property rights. Any claims of intellectual property infringement, even those without merit, could be expensive and time consuming to defend, cause us to cease making, licensing, or using products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property, require us to redesign or rebrand our products or packaging, divert management\u2019s attention and resources, or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements to obtain the right to use a third party\u2019s intellectual property. Any royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. Additionally, a successful claim of infringement against us could result in our being required to pay significant damages, enter into costly license or royalty agreements, or stop the sale of certain products, any of which could have a negative effect on our results of operations.\nA failure to renew or a termination of our licenses for the use of other parties\u2019 intellectual property could result in the loss of significant sales.\nWe have entered into license agreements to use certain trademarks, service marks, and trade names, such as LAND O LAKES, Almond Joy, Cold Stone Creamery, Cinnabon, Dunkin Donuts, Hershey\u2019s, TruMoo and YORK, to brand and market some of our products. In addition, we have entered into a license agreement with DSM Nutritional Products, the owner of Martek Biosciences Corporation, to use products covered by a patent for supplementing certain of our premium dairy and soy products with DHA Omega-3. Most of these agreements are scheduled to expire at various dates in the future, and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to renew these licenses on acceptable terms upon expiration or at all or that we will be able to acquire new licenses to use other popular trademarks or proprietary products or processes. The termination or expiration of a license agreement would cause us to lose the sales and any associated profits generated pursuant to such license and in certain cases could result in an impairment charge for related intangible assets.\nLitigation or legal proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities and have a negative impact on our reputation.\nWe are party to various litigation claims and legal proceedings. We evaluate these litigation claims and legal proceedings to assess the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and to estimate, if possible, the amount of potential losses. Based on these assessments and estimates, we establish reserves or disclose the relevant litigation claims or legal proceedings, as appropriate. These assessments and estimates are based on the information available to management at the time and involve a significant amount of management judgment. Actual outcomes or losses may differ materially from our current assessments and estimates.\nOur business is subject to various environmental and health and safety laws and regulations, which may increase our compliance costs or subject us to liabilities.\nOur business operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters, including the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, and the National Organic Standards of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, as well as similar state and local statutes and regulations in the United States, Europe and in each of the countries in which we do business. These laws and regulations govern, among other things, air emissions and the discharge of wastewater and other pollutants, the use of refrigerants, the handling and disposal of hazardous materials, and the cleanup of contamination in the environment. We could incur significant costs, including fines, penalties and other sanctions, cleanup costs, and third-party claims for property damage or personal injury as a result of the failure to comply with, or liabilities under, environmental, health, and safety requirements. New legislation, as well as current federal and state regulatory initiatives relating to these environmental matters, could require us to replace equipment, install additional pollution controls, purchase various emission allowances, or curtail operations. These costs could negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nViolations of laws or regulations related to the food industry, as well as new laws or regulations or changes to existing laws or regulations related to the food industry, could adversely affect our business.\nThe food production and marketing industry is subject to a variety of federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations, including food safety requirements related to the ingredients, manufacture, processing, storage, marketing, advertising, labeling,\nand distribution of our products, as well as those related to worker health and workplace safety. Our activities, both in and outside of the United States, are subject to extensive regulation. We are regulated by, among other federal and state authorities, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d), the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d), and the U.S. Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, and Labor, as well as by similar authorities abroad within the regulatory framework of the European Union and its members, Canada, China and Latin America. Governmental regulations also affect taxes and levies, healthcare costs, energy usage, immigration, and other labor issues, all of which may have a direct or indirect effect on our business or those of our customers or suppliers. In addition, the marketing and advertising of our products could make us the target of claims relating to alleged false or deceptive advertising under federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations, and we may be subject to initiatives that limit or prohibit the marketing and advertising of our products to children. We are also subject to federal laws and regulations relating to our organic products and production. For example, as required by the National Organic Program (\u201cNOP\u201d), we rely on third parties to certify certain of our products and production locations as organic. Changes in these laws or regulations or the introduction of new laws or regulations could increase our compliance costs, increase other costs of doing business for us, our customers, or our suppliers, or restrict our actions, which could adversely affect our results of operations. In some cases, increased regulatory scrutiny could interrupt distribution of our products or force changes in our production processes and our products. If we are found to be in violation of applicable laws and regulations in these areas, we could be subject to civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, or recalls, as well as potential criminal sanctions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.", "PERMNO": 13916, "SIC": 2020, "TIC": "WWAV"}
