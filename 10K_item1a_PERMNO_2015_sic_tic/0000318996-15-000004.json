RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information in this report, the following factors should be considered in evaluating us and our business.\nOur business is cyclical and depends on conditions in the oil and natural gas industry, especially oil and natural gas prices and capital expenditures by oil and natural gas companies. Volatility in oil and natural gas prices, tight credit markets and disruptions in the U.S. and global economies and financial systems may adversely impact our business.\nPrices for oil and natural gas historically have been volatile and as a result of changes in the supply of, and demand for, oil and natural gas and other factors. These include changes resulting from. among other things, the ability of the Organization of Petroleum Export Countries (\u201cOPEC\u201d) to support oil prices, changes in the levels of oil and natural gas production in the United States, domestic and worldwide economic conditions and political instability in oil-producing countries. We depend on our customers' willingness to make capital expenditures to explore for, develop and produce oil and natural gas. Therefore, weakness in oil and natural gas prices (or the perception by our customers that oil and natural gas prices will decrease in the future) could result in a reduction in the utilization of our equipment and result in lower rates for our services.\nOur customers\u2019 willingness to undertake exploration and production activities depends largely upon prevailing industry conditions that are influenced by numerous factors over which we have no control, including:\n\u2022\nprices, and expectations about future prices, of oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\ndomestic and worldwide economic conditions;\n\u2022\ndomestic and foreign supply of and demand for oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nthe price and quantity of imports of foreign oil and natural gas including the ability of OPEC to set and maintain production levels for oil;\n\u2022\nthe cost of exploring for, developing, producing and delivering oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nthe level of excess production capacity, available pipeline, storage and other transportation capacity;\n\u2022\nlead times associated with acquiring equipment and products and availability of qualified personnel;\n\u2022\nthe expected rates of decline in production from existing and prospective wells;\n\u2022\nthe discovery rates of new oil and gas reserves;\n\u2022\nfederal, state and local regulation of exploration and drilling activities and equipment, material or supplies that we furnish;\n\u2022\npublic pressure on, and legislative and regulatory interest within, federal, state and local governments to stop, significantly limit or regulate hydraulic fracturing activities;\n\u2022\nweather conditions, including hurricanes that can affect oil and natural gas operations over a wide area and severe winter weather that can interfere with our operations;\n\u2022\npolitical instability in oil and natural gas producing countries;\n\u2022\nadvances in exploration, development and production technologies or in technologies affecting energy consumption;\n\u2022\nthe price and availability of alternative fuel and energy sources;\n\u2022\nuncertainty in capital and commodities markets; and\n\u2022\nchanges in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other major global currencies.\nA substantial decline in oil and natural gas prices generally leads to decreased spending by our customers. While higher oil and natural gas prices generally lead to increased spending by our customers, sustained high energy prices can be an impediment to economic growth, and can therefore negatively impact spending by our customers. Our customers also take into account the volatility of energy prices and other risk factors by requiring higher returns for individual projects if there is higher perceived risk. Any of these factors could affect the demand for oil and natural gas and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nSpending by exploration and production companies can also be impacted by conditions in the capital markets. Limitations on the availability of capital, or higher costs of capital, for financing expenditures may cause exploration and production companies to make additional reductions to capital budgets in the future even if oil prices remain at current levels or natural gas prices increase from current levels. Any such cuts in spending will curtail drilling programs as well as discretionary spending on well services, which may result in a reduction in the demand for our services, and the rates we can charge and the utilization of our assets. Moreover, reduced discovery rates of new oil and natural gas reserves, or a decrease in the development rate of reserves, in our market areas, whether due to increased governmental regulation, limitations on exploration and drilling activity or other factors, could also have a material adverse impact on our business, even in a stronger oil and natural gas price environment.\nWe may be unable to implement price increases or maintain existing prices on our core services.\nWe periodically seek to increase the prices of our services to offset rising costs and to generate higher returns for our stockholders. However, we operate in a very competitive industry and as a result, we are not always successful in raising, or maintaining our existing prices. Additionally, during periods of increased market demand, a significant amount of new service capacity, including new well service rigs, fluid hauling trucks, coiled tubing units and new fishing and rental equipment, may enter the market, which also puts pressure on the pricing of our services and limits our ability to increase or maintain prices. Furthermore, during periods of declining pricing for our services, we may not be able to reduce our costs accordingly, which could further adversely affect our profitability.\nEven when we are able to increase our prices, we may not be able to do so at a rate that is sufficient to offset such rising costs. In periods of high demand for oilfield services, a tighter labor market may result in higher labor costs. During such periods, our labor costs could increase at a greater rate than our ability to raise prices for our services. Also, we may not be able to successfully increase prices without adversely affecting our activity levels. The inability to maintain our prices or to increase our prices as costs increase could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nWe participate in a capital-intensive industry. We may not be able to finance future growth of our operations or future acquisitions.\nOur activities require substantial capital expenditures. If our cash flow from operating activities and borrowings under our 2011 Credit Facility (as defined below) are not sufficient to fund our capital expenditure budget, we would be required to fund these expenditures through debt or equity or alternative financing plans, such as refinancing or restructuring our debt or selling assets.\nOur ability to raise debt or equity capital or to refinance or restructure our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time, among other things. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. The terms of existing or future debt instruments may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. If debt and equity capital or alternative financing plans are not available or are not available on economically attractive terms, we would be required to curtail our capital spending, and our ability to grow our business and sustain or improve our profits may be adversely affected. Any of the foregoing consequences could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIncreased labor costs or the unavailability of skilled workers could hurt our operations.\nCompanies in our industry, including us, are dependent upon the available labor pool of skilled employees. We compete with other oilfield services businesses and other employers to attract and retain qualified personnel with the technical skills and experience required to provide our customers with the highest quality service. We are also subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act, which governs such matters as minimum wage, overtime and other working conditions, and which can increase our labor costs or subject us to liabilities to our employees. A shortage in the labor pool of skilled workers or other general inflationary pressures or changes in applicable laws and regulations could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain personnel and could require us to enhance our wage and benefits packages. Labor costs may increase in the future or we may not be able to reduce wages when demand and pricing falls, and such changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur future financial results could be adversely impacted by asset impairments or other charges.\nWe have recorded goodwill impairment charges and asset impairment charges in the past. We periodically evaluate our long-lived assets, including our property and equipment, indefinite-lived intangible assets, and goodwill for impairment. In performing these assessments, we project future cash flows on a discounted basis for goodwill, and on an undiscounted basis for other long-lived assets, and compare these cash flows to the carrying amount of the related assets. These cash flow projections are based on our current operating plans, estimates and judgmental assumptions. We perform the assessment of potential impairment on our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets at least annually in the fourth quarter, or more often if events and circumstances warrant. We perform the assessment of potential impairment for our property and equipment whenever facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable due to various external or internal factors. If we determine that our estimates of future cash flows were inaccurate or our actual results are materially different from what we have predicted, we could record additional impairment charges in future periods, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nWe have operated at a loss in the past and there is no assurance of our profitability in the future.\nHistorically, we have experienced periods of low demand for our services and have incurred operating losses. In the future, we may incur further operating losses and experience negative operating cash flow. We may not be able to reduce our costs, increase our revenues, or reduce our debt service obligations sufficient to achieve or maintain profitability and generate positive operating income in the future.\nOur business involves certain operating risks, which are primarily self-insured, and our insurance may not be adequate to cover all insured losses or liabilities we might incur in our operations.\nOur operations are subject to many hazards and risks, including the following:\n\u2022\naccidents resulting in serious bodily injury and the loss of life or property;\n\u2022\nliabilities from accidents or damage by our fleet of trucks, rigs and other equipment;\n\u2022\npollution and other damage to the environment;\n\u2022\nreservoir damage;\n\u2022\nblow-outs, the uncontrolled flow of natural gas, oil or other well fluids into the atmosphere or an underground formation; and\n\u2022\nfires and explosions.\nIf any of these hazards occur, they could result in suspension of operations, damage to or destruction of our equipment and the property of others, or injury or death to our or a third party's personnel.\nWe self-insure against a significant portion of these liabilities. For losses in excess of our self-insurance limits, we maintain insurance from unaffiliated commercial carriers. However, our insurance may not be adequate to cover all losses or liabilities that we might incur in our operations. Furthermore, our insurance may not adequately protect us against liability from all of the hazards of our business. As a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain of our insurance policies may substantially increase. In some instances, certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. We also are subject to the risk that we may be unable to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at a reasonable cost. If we were to incur a significant liability for which we were uninsured or for which we were not fully insured, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry, with intense price competition, which may intensify as our competitors expand their operations.\nThe market for oilfield services in which we operate is highly competitive and includes numerous small companies capable of competing effectively in our markets on a local basis, as well as several large companies that possess substantially\ngreater financial resources than we do. Contracts are traditionally awarded on the basis of competitive bids or direct negotiations with customers.\nThe principal competitive factors in our markets are product and service quality and availability, responsiveness, experience, technology, equipment quality, reputation for safety and price. The competitive environment has intensified as recent mergers among exploration and production companies have reduced the number of available customers. The fact that drilling rigs and other vehicles and oilfield services equipment are mobile and can be moved from one market to another in response to market conditions heightens the competition in the industry. We may be competing for work against competitors that may be better able to withstand industry downturns and may be better suited to compete on the basis of price, retain skilled personnel and acquire new equipment and technologies, all of which could affect our revenues and profitability.\nCompliance with new regulations regarding the use of \u201cconflict minerals\u201d could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our products.\nIn accordance with Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d) the SEC new disclosure requirements, which became effective in 2014, for manufacturers of products containing certain minerals which are mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries. These \u201cconflict minerals\u201d are commonly found in metals used in the manufacture of semiconductors. Manufacturers are also required to disclose their efforts to prevent the sourcing of such minerals and metals produced from them. One of our whole-owned subsidiaries manufactures certain products that are covered by these requirements. The implementation of these new regulations may limit the sourcing and availability of some of the metals used in the manufacture of our products. The regulations may also reduce the number of suppliers who provide conflict-free metals, and may affect our ability to obtain the metals in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Finally, some of our customers may elect to disqualify us as a supplier if we are unable to verify that the metals used in our products are free of conflict minerals.\nWe are subject to the economic, political and social instability risks of doing business in certain foreign countries.\nWe currently have operations based in Mexico, Colombia, Ecuador, the Middle East and Russia and we own a technology development and control systems business based in Canada. In the future, we may expand our operations into other foreign countries. As a result, we are exposed to risks of international operations, including:\n\u2022\nincreased governmental ownership and regulation of the economy in the markets in which we operate;\n\u2022\ninflation and adverse economic conditions stemming from governmental attempts to reduce inflation, such as imposition of higher interest rates and wage and price controls;\n\u2022\neconomic and financial instability of national oil companies;\n\u2022\nincreased trade barriers, such as higher tariffs and taxes on imports of commodity products;\n\u2022\nexposure to foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nexchange controls or other currency restrictions;\n\u2022\nwar, civil unrest or significant political instability;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on repatriation of income or capital;\n\u2022\nexpropriation, confiscatory taxation, nationalization or other government actions with respect to our assets located in the markets where we operate;\n\u2022\ngovernmental policies limiting investments by and returns to foreign investors;\n\u2022\nlabor unrest and strikes;\n\u2022\ndeprivation of contract rights; and\n\u2022\nrestrictive governmental regulation and bureaucratic delays.\nThe occurrence of one or more of these risks may:\n\u2022\nnegatively impact our results of operations;\n\u2022\nrestrict the movement of funds and equipment to and from affected countries; and\n\u2022\ninhibit our ability to collect receivables.\nOur wholly owned subsidiary, Geostream, provides drilling, workover and reservoir engineering services in Russia. Continued political instability, deteriorating macroeconomic conditions, economic sanctions and actual or threatened military action related to the annexation of the Ukrainian territory of Crimea could have a material adverse effect on our subsidiary\u2019s operations in the region and on the result of operations of our International segment.\nOur failure to comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) and similar laws may have a negative impact on our ongoing operations.\nOur ability to comply with the FCPA and similar laws is dependent on the success of our ongoing compliance program, including our ability to continue to manage our agents, affiliates and business partners, and supervise, train and retain competent employees. Our compliance program is also dependent on the efforts of our employees to comply with applicable law and our Business Code of Conduct. We could be subject to sanctions and civil and criminal prosecution as well as fines and penalties in the event of a finding of violation of the FCPA or similar laws by us or any of our employees.\nA Special Committee of our Board of Directors is currently investigating possible violations of the FCPA involving business activities of our operations in Russia and an allegation involving our Mexico operations that, if true, could potentially constitute a violation of certain of our policies, including our Code of Business Conduct, the FCPA and other applicable laws. The Special Committee\u2019s investigation, which also includes a review of certain aspects of the Company\u2019s operations in Colombia, as well as our other international locations, is ongoing. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings for a more detailed discussion of these investigations.\nWe have incurred, and may continue to incur, legal and other expenses in connection with the investigations and related compliance activities. In addition, our reputation and our ability to obtain new business or retain existing business from our current and potential clients in the relevant foreign jurisdictions could be adversely affected by the outcome of, or publicity relating to, the investigations, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nHistorically, we have experienced a high employee turnover rate. Any difficulty we experience replacing or adding workers could adversely affect our business.\nWe believe that the high turnover rate in our industry is attributable to the nature of oilfield services work, which is physically demanding and performed outdoors. As a result, workers may choose to pursue employment in fields that offer a more desirable work environment at wage rates that are competitive with ours. The potential inability or lack of desire by workers to commute to our facilities and job sites, as well as the competition for workers from competitors or other industries, are factors that could negatively affect our ability to attract and retain workers. We may not be able to recruit, train and retain an adequate number of workers to replace departing workers. The inability to maintain an adequate workforce could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be successful in implementing and maintaining technology development and enhancements. New technology may cause us to become less competitive.\nThe oilfield services industry is subject to the introduction of new drilling and completion techniques and services using new technologies, some of which may be subject to patent protection. As competitors and others use or develop new technologies in the future, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage. Further, we may face competitive pressure to implement or acquire certain new technologies at a substantial cost. Some of our competitors have greater financial, technical and personnel resources that may allow them to implement new technologies before we can. If we are unable to develop and implement new technologies or products on a timely basis and at competitive cost, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nA component of our business strategy is to incorporate the KeyView\u00ae system, our proprietary technology, into our well service rigs. The inability to successfully develop, integrate and protect this technology could:\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to improve our market position;\n\u2022\nincrease our operating costs; and\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to recoup the investments made in this technological initiative.\nThe loss of or a substantial reduction in activity by one or more of our largest customers could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOne customer accounted for more than 10% of our total consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014, and our ten largest customers represented approximately 47% of our consolidated revenues for the period. The loss of or a substantial reduction in activity by one or more of these customers could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nPotential adoption of future state or federal laws or regulations surrounding the hydraulic fracturing process could make it more difficult to complete oil or natural gas wells and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMany of our customers utilize hydraulic fracturing services during the life of a well. Hydraulic fracturing is the process of creating or expanding cracks, or fractures, in underground formations where water, sand and other additives are\npumped under high pressure into the formation. Although we are not a provider of hydraulic fracturing services, many of our services complement the hydraulic fracturing process.\nLegislation has been introduced in Congress to provide for broader federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing operations and the reporting and public disclosure of chemicals used in the fracturing process. Additionally, the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving diesel fuel under the Safe Drinking Water Act and in May 2012 issued draft guidance for fracturing operations that involved diesel fuels. If additional levels of regulation or permitting requirements were imposed through the adoption of new laws and regulations, our customers' business and operations could be subject to delays and increased operating and compliance costs, which could negatively impact the number of active wells in the marketplaces we serve. New regulations addressing hydraulic fracturing and chemical disclosure have been approved or are under consideration by a number of states and some municipalities have sought to restrict or ban hydraulic fracturing within their jurisdictions. The adoption of future federal, state or municipal laws regulating the hydraulic fracturing process could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that govern our operations.\nOur operations are subject to U.S. federal, state and local and foreign laws and regulations that impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the environment and establish standards for the handling, storage and disposal of waste materials, including toxic and hazardous wastes. To comply with these laws and regulations, we must obtain and maintain numerous permits, approvals and certificates from various governmental authorities. While the cost of such compliance has not been significant in the past, new laws, regulations or enforcement policies could become more stringent and significantly increase our compliance costs or limit our future business opportunities, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations pose risks of environmental liability, including leakage from our operations to surface or subsurface soils, surface water or groundwater. Some environmental laws and regulations may impose strict liability, joint and several liability, or both. Therefore, in some situations, we could be exposed to liability as a result of our conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred or the conduct of, or conditions caused by, third parties without regard to whether we caused or contributed to the conditions. Actions arising under these laws and regulations could result in the shutdown of our operations, fines and penalties, expenditures for remediation or other corrective measures, and claims for liability for property damage, exposure to hazardous materials, exposure to hazardous waste or personal injuries. Sanctions for noncompliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations also may include the assessment of administrative, civil or criminal penalties, revocation of permits, temporary or permanent cessation of operations in a particular location and issuance of corrective action orders. Such claims or sanctions and related costs could cause us to incur substantial costs or losses and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. Additionally, an increase in regulatory requirements on oil and natural gas exploration and completion activities could significantly delay or interrupt our operations.\nIncreasing regulatory expansion could adversely impact costs associated with our offshore Fishing and Rental Services.\nThe scope of regulation of our services may increase in light of the April 2010 Macondo accident and resulting oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, including possible increases in liabilities or funding requirements imposed by governmental agencies. In 2012, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, or \u201cBSEE\u201d, expanded its regulatory oversight beyond oil and gas operators to include service and equipment contractors. In addition, U.S. federal law imposes on certain entities deemed to be \u201cresponsible parties\u201d a variety of regulations related to the prevention of oil spills, releases of hazardous substances, and liability for removal costs and natural resource, real property and certain economic damages arising from such incidents. Some of these laws may impose strict and/or joint and several liability for certain costs and damages without regard to the conduct of the parties. As a provider of services and rental equipment for offshore drilling and workover services, we may be deemed a \u201cresponsible party\u201d under federal law. The implementation of such laws and the adoption and implementation of future regulatory initiatives, or the specific responsibilities that may arise from such initiatives may subject us to increased costs and liabilities, which could interrupt our operations or have an adverse effect on our revenue or results of operations.\nSevere weather could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur business could be materially and adversely affected by severe weather. Our customers' oil and natural gas operations located in Louisiana and parts of Texas may be adversely affected by hurricanes and tropical storms, resulting in reduced demand for our services. Furthermore, our customers' operations may be adversely affected by seasonal weather conditions. Adverse weather can also directly impede our own operations. Repercussions of severe weather conditions may include:\n\u2022\ncurtailment of services;\n\u2022\nweather-related damage to facilities and equipment, resulting in suspension of operations;\n\u2022\ninability to deliver equipment, personnel and products to job sites in accordance with contract schedules; and\n\u2022\nloss of productivity.\nThese constraints could delay our operations and materially increase our operating and capital costs. Unusually warm winters may also adversely affect the demand for our services by decreasing the demand for natural gas.\nAcquisitions and divestitures - we may not be successful in identifying, making and integrating acquisitions or limiting ongoing costs associated with the operations we divest.\nAn important component of our growth strategy is to make acquisitions that will strengthen our core services or presence in selected markets. The success of this strategy will depend, among other things, on our ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates, to negotiate acceptable financial and other terms, to timely and successfully integrate acquired business or assets into our existing businesses and to retain the key personnel and the customer base of acquired businesses. Any future acquisitions could present a number of risks, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nincorrect assumptions regarding the future results of acquired operations or assets or expected cost reductions or other synergies expected to be realized as a result of acquiring operations or assets;\n\u2022\nfailure to successfully integrate the operations or management of any acquired operations or assets in a timely manner;\n\u2022\nfailure to retain or attract key employees;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management's attention from existing operations or other priorities;\n\u2022\nthe inability to implement promptly an effective control environment;\n\u2022\npotential impairment charges if purchase assumptions are not achieved or market conditions decline;\n\u2022\nthe risks inherent in entering markets or lines of business with which the company has limited or no prior experience; and\n\u2022\ninability to secure sufficient financing, sufficient financing on economically attractive terms, that may be required for any such acquisition or investment.\nOur business plan anticipates, and is based upon our ability to successfully complete and integrate, acquisitions of other businesses or assets in a timely and cost effective manner. Our failure to do so could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe also make strategic divestitures from time to time. In the case of divestitures, we may agree to indemnify acquiring parties for certain liabilities arising from our former businesses. These divestitures may also result in continued financial involvement in the divested businesses, including through guarantees, service level agreements, or other financial arrangements, following the transaction. Lower performance by those divested businesses could affect our future financial results if there is contingent consideration associated.\nCompliance with climate change legislation or initiatives could negatively impact our business.\nVarious state governments and regional organizations comprising state governments are considering enacting new legislation and promulgating new regulations governing or restricting the emission of greenhouse gases, or \u201cGHG\u201d, from stationary sources, which may include our equipment and operations. At the federal level, the EPA has already issued regulations that require us to establish and report an inventory of GHG emissions. The EPA also has established a GHG permitting requirement for large stationary sources and may lower the threshold of the permitting program, which could include our equipment and operations. Legislative and regulatory proposals for restricting GHG emissions or otherwise addressing climate change could require us to incur additional operating costs and could adversely affect demand for natural gas and oil. The potential increase in our operating costs could include new or increased costs to obtain permits, operate and maintain our equipment and facilities, install new emission controls on our equipment and facilities, acquire allowances to authorize our greenhouse gas emissions, pay taxes related to our GHG emissions and administer and manage a GHG emissions program.\nConservation measures and technological advances could reduce demand for oil and natural gas.\nFuel conservation measures, alternative fuel requirements, increasing consumer demand for alternatives to oil and natural gas, technological advances in fuel economy and energy generation could reduce demand for oil and natural gas. Moreover, incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources could reduce demand for oil and natural gas. Management cannot predict the impact of the changing demand for oil and natural gas services and products, and any major changes may have a material effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe amount of our debt and the covenants in the agreements governing our debt could negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations and business prospects.\nOur level of indebtedness, and the covenants contained in the agreements governing our debt, could have important consequences for our operations, including:\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under the agreement governing our indebtedness and increasing the risk that we may default on our debt obligations;\n\u2022\nrequiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to required payments on indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow for working capital, capital expenditures and other general business activities;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate purposes and other activities;\n\u2022\nlimiting management's flexibility in operating our business;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022\ndiminishing our ability to withstand successfully a downturn in our business or the economy generally;\n\u2022\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage against less leveraged competitors; and\n\u2022\nmaking us vulnerable to increases in interest rates, because certain of our debt will vary with prevailing interest rates.\nWe may be required to repay all or a portion of our debt on an accelerated basis in certain circumstances. If we fail to comply with the covenants and other restrictions in the agreements governing our debt, it could lead to an event of default and the consequent acceleration of our obligation to repay outstanding debt. Our ability to comply with debt covenants and other restrictions may be affected by events beyond our control, including general economic and financial conditions.\nIn particular, under the terms of our indebtedness, we must comply with certain financial ratios and satisfy certain financial condition tests, several of which become more restrictive over time and could require us to take action to reduce our debt or take some other action in order to comply with them. Our ability to satisfy required financial ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions, and we may not be able to continue to meet those ratios and tests in the future. A breach of any of these covenants, ratios or tests could result in a default under our indebtedness. If we default, lenders under our senior secured revolving credit facility will no longer be obligated to extend credit to us and they, as well as the trustee for our outstanding notes, could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under our 2011 Credit Facility or indentures, as applicable, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. The results of such actions would have a significant negative impact on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nWe may incur more debt and long-term lease obligations in the future.\nThe agreements governing our long-term debt restrict, but do not prohibit, us from incurring additional indebtedness and other obligations in the future. As of December 31, 2014, we had $748.4 million of total debt.\nAn increase in our level of indebtedness could exacerbate the risks described in the immediately preceding risk factor and the occurrence of any of such events could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and business prospects.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt service obligations.\nOur ability to make payments on our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures depends on our ability to generate cash in the future. This, to a certain extent, is subject to conditions in the oil and natural gas industry, general economic and financial conditions, competition in the markets in which we operate, the impact of legislative and regulatory actions on how we conduct our business and other factors, all of which are beyond our control. This risk could be exacerbated by any economic downturn or instability in the U.S. and global credit markets.\nOur business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our outstanding indebtedness. In addition, future borrowings may not be available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to repay our indebtedness or to fund our other capital needs. If our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our outstanding indebtedness, we may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as:\n\u2022\nrefinancing or restructuring our debt;\n\u2022\nselling assets;\n\u2022\nreducing or delaying acquisitions or capital investments, such as remanufacturing our rigs and related equipment; or\n\u2022\nseeking to raise additional capital.\nWe may not be able to implement alternative financing plans, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms or at all, and implementing any such alternative financing plans may not allow us to meet our debt obligations. In addition, a downgrade in our credit rating would make it more difficult for us to raise additional debt in the future. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations, or to obtain alternative financings, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects for growth.\nOur variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nBorrowings under our 2011 Credit Facility bear interest at variable rates, exposing us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash available for servicing our indebtedness would decrease.\nOur bylaws contain provisions that may prevent or delay a change in control.\nOur bylaws contain certain provisions designed to enhance the ability of our board of directors to respond to unsolicited attempts to acquire control of the Company. These provisions:\n\u2022\nestablish a classified board of directors, providing for three-year staggered terms of office for all members of our board of directors;\n\u2022\nset limitations on the removal of directors;\n\u2022\nenable our board of directors to set the number of directors and to fill vacancies on the board occurring between stockholder meetings; and\n\u2022\nset limitations on who may call a special meeting of stockholders.\nThese provisions may have the effect of entrenching management and may deprive investors of the opportunity to sell their shares to potential acquirers seeking control of the Company at a premium over prevailing prices. This potential inability to obtain a control premium could reduce the price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 63079, "SIC": 1381, "TIC": "KEGX"}
