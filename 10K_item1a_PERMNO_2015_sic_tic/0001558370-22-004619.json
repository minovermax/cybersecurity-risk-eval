Risks and uncertainties, in addition to those we describe below, that are not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks occur, our business and financial results could be harmed, and the price of our common stock could decline. You should also refer to the other information contained in this Annual Report, including our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related Notes.\nRisk Factors Summary\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Capital Requirements\n\u25cf We are a clinical stage company without any products that are approved for commercial sale and our business is dependent on the success of Ampion. If Ampion does not receive regulatory approval or is not successfully commercialized, our business, including our ability to generate revenues from product sales, is likely to be harmed.\n\u25cf We have incurred significant operating losses since inception, expect to incur net operating losses for the foreseeable future and may never achieve or sustain profitability.\n\u25cf We will need additional capital to fund our future operations. If we do not obtain the capital necessary to fund our operations, we will be unable to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval of, and commercialize Ampion and may need to cease operations.\n\u25cf Management has performed an analysis of our ability to continue as a going concern. Even though our current liquidity position is trending in a positive direction, that does not guarantee that management will not raise concerns about our ability to continue as a going concern in the future.\n\u25cf We may be limited in our ability to access sufficient ongoing funding through a public or private equity/debt offering(s), partnering license agreement(s) or other means to raise sufficient funds without stockholder approval.\n\u25cf Our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected by global health epidemics, including, but not limited to, the recent COVID-19 pandemic.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\n\u25cf We must obtain regulatory approvals before Ampion can be commercialized. If clinical trials of Ampion fail to satisfactorily demonstrate safety and efficacy to the FDA and other regulators, the FDA or other regulators may require additional clinical trials and we, or our collaborators, may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of Ampion.\n\u25cf Interim, topline, and preliminary data from our clinical trials that we announce or publish from time to time may change as more patient data becomes available and is subject to audit and verification procedures that could result in material changes in the final data.\n\u25cf Clinical drug development involves a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome. The clinical trials of our product candidates may not demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the FDA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities or otherwise produce positive results and the results of preclinical studies and early clinical trials may not be predictive of future results. We may incur additional costs or\nexperience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of our product candidates.\n\u25cf The regulatory approval processes of the FDA and other comparable foreign regulatory authorities are lengthy, time consuming and inherently unpredictable. If we are ultimately unable to obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates, we will be unable to generate product revenue and our business will be substantially harmed.\n\u25cf We received an SPA agreement from the FDA relating to our AP-013 study of Ampion to treat the signs and symptoms of severe OAK. This SPA agreement does not necessarily extend to the study as modified nor guarantee approval of Ampion or any other particular outcome from regulatory review.\n\u25cf Our pursuit of Ampion as a COVID-19 therapeutic treatment is at an early stage. Ampion may not successfully treat the virus and its consequences in a timely manner, if at all.\n\u25cf There can be no assurance that the product we are developing for the treatment of COVID-19 would be authorized under an EUA by the FDA if we were to decide to apply for an EUA. If we do not apply for an EUA or, if we do apply and no EUA is authorized or, once authorized, it is terminated, we will be required to issue a recall for product which was previously sold into the market, discontinue future sales of our product until we complete the drug approval process, which is lengthy and expensive.\n\u25cf If we experience delays or difficulties in the enrollment and/or maintenance of patients in clinical trials, our regulatory submissions or receipt of necessary marketing approvals could be delayed or prevented.\n\u25cf Relying on third-party suppliers may result in delays in our ongoing clinical trials and introduction of our product to the market.\n\u25cf If Ampion is commercialized, this does not assure acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors, or the medical community in general.\n\u25cf We have never commercialized a product candidate as a company before and currently lack the comprehensive, fully-staffed expertise, personnel and resources to successfully commercialize any products.\n\u25cf Government restrictions on pricing and reimbursement, as well as other healthcare payor cost-containment initiatives, may increase the difficulty and cost for us to obtain marketing approval for and commercialize our product candidates and may affect the prices we may set.\n\u25cf Lawsuits or investigations could divert our resources, result in substantial liabilities and reduce the commercial potential of Ampion.\n\u25cf We could face substantial competition from companies with considerably more resources and experience than we have, which may result in others discovering, developing, receiving approval for, or commercializing products before or more successfully than us.\n\u25cf If we do not receive marketing approval for Ampion, we may not realize the investment we have made in our manufacturing facility.\n\u25cf Our future success depends on our ability to retain key employees, consultants and advisors and to attract, retain, and motivate qualified personnel.\n\u25cf Uncertainties relating to recent changes in our management team may adversely affect our operations.\n\u25cf Our employees, board members, independent contractors, consultants, commercial collaborators, principal investigators, CROs, suppliers and vendors may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements, that results in a material negative impact to the Company.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\n\u25cf Our ability to compete may decline if we do not adequately protect our proprietary rights.\n\u25cf Confidentiality agreements with employees and others may not adequately prevent disclosure of our trade secrets and other proprietary information and may not adequately protect our intellectual property, which could limit our ability to compete.\n\u25cf A dispute concerning the infringement or misappropriation of our proprietary rights or the proprietary rights of others could be time consuming and costly, and an unfavorable outcome could harm our business.\n\u25cf Pharmaceutical patents and patent applications involve highly complex legal and factual questions, which, if determined adversely to us, could negatively impact our patent position.\n\u25cf From time to time we may need to license patents, intellectual property and proprietary technologies from third parties, which may be difficult or expensive to obtain.\n\u25cf We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\n\u25cf The price of our stock has been extremely volatile and may continue to be volatile and fluctuate substantially, which could result in substantial losses for purchasers of our common stock.\n\u25cf If we cannot continue to satisfy the NYSE American listing maintenance requirements and other rules, including the director independence requirements, our securities may be delisted, which could negatively impact the price of our securities.\n\u25cf A sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may cause the price of our common stock to decline.\n\u25cf Anti-takeover provisions in our charter and bylaws and in Delaware law could prevent or delay a change in control of Ampio.\n\u25cf If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports or publish unfavorable research or reports about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nGeneral Risk Factors\n\u25cf Business interruptions could limit our ability to operate our business.\n\u25cf If our security measures are compromised, or our information technology systems or those of our CROs, CMOs, vendors, contractors, consultants, or other third party partners fail or suffer security breaches, cyber-attacks, loss or leakage of data and other disruptions, this could result in a material disruption of our development programs, compromise sensitive information related to our business or other personal information or prevent us from accessing critical information, potentially exposing us to liability, harm our reputation, or otherwise adversely affecting our business.\n\u25cf Increased costs associated with corporate governance compliance may significantly impact our results of operations.\nFor a more complete discussion of the material risks facing our business, see below.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Capital Requirements\nWe are a clinical stage company without any products that are approved for commercial sale and our business is dependent on the success of Ampion. If Ampion does not receive regulatory approval or is not successfully commercialized, our business, including our ability to generate revenues from product sales, is likely to be harmed.\nWe do not have any products that are approved for commercial sale and may never be able to develop marketable products. A substantial portion of our business and future success depends solely on our ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval for and to successfully commercialize Ampion. We are devoting all of our resources to the development of Ampion. We cannot be certain that Ampion will be successful in ongoing or future clinical trials, Ampion may not receive regulatory approval or be successfully commercialized even if we receive regulatory approval. Since we do not have any products that are approved for commercial sale, we do not expect to generate revenues from product sales in the foreseeable future, if ever.\nWe have incurred significant operating losses since inception, expect to incur net operating losses for the foreseeable future and may never achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe are a pre-revenue development stage biopharmaceutical company that has not generated operating revenues or profits and have therefore incurred an accumulated deficit totaling $217.6 million as of December 31, 2021. We expect to continue generating operating losses for the foreseeable future but intend to limit the extent of these losses by entering into licensing, collaboration or similar type of agreements with one or more strategic partners, which may provide us with potential fixed or contingent licensing fees and/or milestone/royalty payments. We cannot be certain that any licensing or collaboration arrangements will be obtained, or that the terms of those arrangements will result in us receiving material revenues. To obtain revenues from Ampion, we must succeed, either alone or with others, in a range of challenging activities, including successful completion of all requisite clinical trials, filing of the BLA with the FDA, obtaining marketing approval, manufacturing and commercialization, satisfying any post-marketing requirements and obtaining appropriate levels of reimbursement from both private insurance and government payors. We, and/or our collaborators, may never succeed in these activities and, even if we do, or one of our collaborators does, we may never generate revenues that are significant enough to achieve profitability.\nWe will need additional capital to fund our future operations. If we do not obtain the capital necessary to fund our operations, we will be unable to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval of, and commercialize Ampion and may need to cease operations.\nDeveloping and commercializing biopharmaceutical products is a very time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete. We expect our expenses could increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we finalize our current clinical trials, prepare to file our Ampion BLA with the FDA and seek marketing approval for Ampion.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $33.9 million of cash and cash equivalents which we expect can fund our operations into the fourth quarter of 2023.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on, and could increase significantly as a result of, many factors including:\n\u25cf progress in and the costs of our clinical trials and research and development;\n\u25cf progress in and the costs of applying for regulatory approval for Ampion;\n\u25cf the costs of sustaining our corporate overhead requirements and hiring and retaining necessary personnel;\n\u25cf the scope, prioritization, and number of our research and development programs;\n\u25cf the achievement of milestones or occurrence of other developments that trigger payments under any collaboration agreements we obtain;\n\u25cf the extent to which we are obligated to reimburse, or are entitled to reimbursement of, clinical trial costs under future collaboration agreements, if any;\n\u25cf the costs involved in filing, prosecuting, enforcing, and defending patent claims and other intellectual property rights;\n\u25cf the costs of securing manufacturing arrangements for commercial production;\n\u25cf the costs of defending lawsuits and other claims by third parties or responding to various government agencies that we are required to report to or respond to inquiries from; and\n\u25cf the costs associated with obtaining directors and officers (\u201cD&O\u201d) insurance.\nUntil we can generate operating profit on an ongoing and reliable basis, we expect to satisfy our future ongoing cash and liquidity needs through one or more of the following: (i) third-party collaboration arrangements, (ii) private or public sales of our securities, which we expect will include our \u201cat-the-market\u201d (\u201cATM\u201d) equity program, or (iii) debt financings. We cannot be certain that additional funding and incremental working capital will be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all, or that it will exist in a timely and/or adequate manner to allow for the proper execution of our near and long-term business strategy. Further, in connection with the registered direct offering that we completed in December 2021, we were prohibited from issuing shares of common stock or any other securities convertible into, or exercisable, or exchangeable for, shares of common stock until March 16, 2022, and we are prohibited from utilizing our ATM equity offering program until May 15, 2022. Therefore, it is possible funds may not be available on terms and conditions acceptable to our management and stockholders due to these limitations.\nEven if we obtain requisite financing, it may be on terms not favorable to us, it may be costly and it may require us to agree to covenants or other provisions that will favor new investors over existing stockholders or other restrictions that may adversely affect our business. Additional funding, if obtained, may also result in significant dilution to our stockholders.\nManagement has performed an analysis of our ability to continue as a going concern. Even though our current liquidity position is trending in a positive direction, that does not guarantee that management will not raise concerns about our ability to continue as a going concern in the future.\nIn prior years, management raised concerns about our ability to continue as a going concern, and in addition, our independent registered public accounting firm expressed substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern in their report accompanying our audited financial statements. However, in December 2021, we finalized a registered direct offering that generated gross proceeds of $22.5 million, offset by offering-related costs of $1.8 million (see Note 10 to the Financial Statements), which contributed to a cash and cash equivalent balance of $33.9 million as of December 31, 2021. Furthermore, in February 2020, we entered into a Sales Agreement (\u201cSales Agreement\u201d) with two agents to implement an ATM equity offering program under which we, at our sole discretion and subject to certain exceptions, may issue and sell from time-to-time shares of our authorized common stock. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we sold shares pursuant to the ATM equity offering program, which yielded gross proceeds of $10.5 million, offset by offering-related costs of $0.5 million (see Note 10 to the Financial Statements). In connection with the registered direct offering that we completed in December 2021, we were prohibited from issuing shares of common stock or any other securities convertible into, or exercisable, or exchangeable for, shares of common stock until March 16, 2022, and we are prohibited from utilizing the ATM equity offering program until May 15, 2022. As a result of the registered direct offering and utilization of the ATM during the current year, we have significantly increased our liquidity, and we believe there is not substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for the twelve months following the date these financial statements are issued.\nOur current liquidity position does not guarantee that management will not raise concerns about our ability to continue as a going concern in the future. A \u201cgoing concern\u201d opinion could impair our ability to finance our operations through the sale and issuance of debt or equity securities or through bank financing. We believe that we will be able to raise additional equity or debt financing in the future; however, any future financing could be dilutive to our current stockholders. Our ability to continue as a going concern will depend on our ability to obtain additional financing. Additional capital may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all. If adequate financing is not available, we may be required to terminate or significantly curtail our operations or enter into arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain aspects of Ampion, or potential markets that we would not otherwise relinquish. If we are unable to achieve these goals, our business would be jeopardized, and we may not be able to continue operations.\nWe may be limited in our ability to access sufficient ongoing funding through a public or private equity/debt offering(s), partnering license agreement(s) or other means to raise sufficient funds without stockholder approval.\nNYSE American rules impose restrictions on our ability to raise funds through a private offering of our common stock, convertible debt or similar instruments without obtaining stockholder approval. Under NYSE American rules, an offering of 20% or more of our total shares outstanding at a price per share less than the greater of book or market value of the stock requires stockholder approval unless the offering qualifies as a \u201cpublic offering\u201d for purposes of the NYSE American rules.\nIn addition, under current SEC regulations, if immediately following the filing of this Annual Report, our non-affiliated public float is less than $75 million, and for so long as our non-affiliated public float is less than $75 million, the amount we will be able to raise through primary public offerings of securities in a twelve-month period using our shelf registration statement on Form S-3, which was declared effective by the SEC in May 2020, will be limited to an aggregate of one-third of our non-affiliated public float, which are referred to as the baby shelf rules.\nAs of February 15, 2022, our non-affiliated public float was approximately $113.8 million, based on 223,040,908 shares of outstanding common stock held by non-affiliates at a price of $0.51 per share, which was the last reported sale price our common stock on the NYSE American Market on February 15, 2022. While we do not anticipate that we will be subject to the baby shelf rules immediately after filing our Annual Report, we have been subject to the baby shelf rules in the past and it is possible that we will be subject to the baby shelf rules in the future. In such event, the amount of financing we could raise may be limited.\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected by global health epidemics, including, but not limited to, the recent COVID-19 pandemic.\nOutbreaks of epidemic, pandemic or contagious diseases, such as COVID-19, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In January 2020, the WHO announced a global health emergency because of COVID-19. In March 2020, the WHO declared the outbreak of COVID-19, a global pandemic, based on the rapid increase in exposure globally. Despite progress in vaccination efforts, global economic activity remains uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence. Further, in the first half of 2021, a new Delta variant of COVID-19 began to spread globally and caused an increase in COVID-19 cases in many places in the United States, and in November 2021, a new Omicron variant, which appears to be the most transmissible variant to date, was detected, which has since caused an increase in COVID-19 cases worldwide, including in the United States, and of which the potential severity is currently being evaluated. Public health officials and medical professionals have warned that COVID-19 cases may continue to spike due to the Delta variant and/or the Omicron variant, particularly if vaccination rates do not quickly increase or if additional, potent disease variants emerge. It is unclear how long the resurgence due to Delta or the resurgence due to Omicron will last, how severe the Delta resurgence or Omicron resurgence will be, and what safety measures governments will impose in response to the Delta resurgence or Omicron resurgence. Hospitalizations and deaths in large portions of the United States, mask mandates, social distancing, travel restrictions and stay-at-home orders may or may not be reinstated. Even before the increases in cases due to the Delta variant and the Omicron variant, many individuals remained cautious about resuming activities. The impact of the Delta variant and the Omicron variant cannot be predicted at this time, and could depend on numerous factors, including vaccination rates among the population, the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines against the Delta variant and the Omicron variant and the response by governmental bodies and regulators. The outbreak has and may continue to affect our operations and those of third parties on which we rely, including negatively impacting the conduct of current and projected clinical trials.\nFor example, the AP-013 study was initiated in June 2019 and was ongoing when the COVID-19 pandemic began. The AP-013 study was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, as was the case with many clinical studies being conducted at that time. The study was paused in April 2020 due to patient and site safety concerns about COVID-19, the inability of sites to complete the remaining 12-week efficacy and 24-week follow-up visits, or to support doing these by remote visits, and the resulting unanimous recommendation from the study\u2019s safety monitoring committee given the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on the conduct of the study.\nIn discussions with the FDA, the agency recommended that we identify subject information that was impacted by the pandemic during the AP-013 study and conduct a sensitivity analysis to detect potential bias related to the pandemic. Following this guidance, we initiated close-out of the study, locked the database, and conducted a preliminary analysis. Early in the first quarter of 2022, we completed these additional analyses and submitted the preliminary results in a Type C request to meet with the FDA. We cannot know the potential outcome of the review of these data by the FDA. The submission of data does not provide assurance that the FDA will agree that we are in position to file the BLA, that the FDA will accept our BLA for Ampion when submitted, or that our trial results will be adequate to support approval. Those issues are addressed during the review of the submitted application and are determined based on the adequacy and merit of the overall submission. Final determinations for marketing application approval are made after a complete review of the marketing application and are based on the entirety of the data provided in the application.\nIn addition, we believe Ampion may be able to treat the serious complications related to the COVID-19 outbreak, including the need for supplemental oxygen and the rapid onset of respiratory failure, termed ARDS or ALI, and we are pursuing new studies related to these life-threatening COVID-19 manifestations. Clinical trials for Ampion that address these serious complications could be impacted if the pandemic subsides or if there is not a sufficient number of COVID-19 patients located in the area where we perform clinical trials. Even though COVID-19 vaccinations and other therapeutics have been approved and have reduced overall mortality rate and severity of the illness, such measures do not eliminate the need for the development of a therapeutic, such as Ampion, to address the complications that arise from a COVID-19 infection.\nThe full extent of potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and product development, including our clinical trials, financial condition and the global economy will depend on future developments. Future developments are considered highly uncertain and cannot be predicted due to the nature of the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19, mutations of the COVID-19 virus and the actions to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact, among others. These effects could have a material adverse impact on our business, operations, financial condition and results of operations. Existing insurance coverage may not\nprovide protection for all, or any, costs that may arise from all such possible events. We continue to assess the impact of COVID-19 on our business operations, system supports and financial condition, but there can be no assurance that this analysis will enable us to avoid part or all of any impact from the spread of COVID-19 or its consequences, including downturns in business sentiment generally or in our sector in particular.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to limitation.\nUnder Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, substantial changes in our ownership may limit the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that could be utilized annually in the future to offset our taxable income. Specifically, this limitation may arise in the event of a cumulative change in ownership of our company of more than 50% within a three-year period. Any such annual limitation may significantly reduce the utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards before they expire. We believe it is likely that transactions that have occurred in the past, and other transactions that may occur in the future, could trigger an ownership change pursuant to Section 382, which could limit the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that could be utilized annually in the future to offset our taxable income, if any.\nFurther, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Act\u201d) changed the federal rules governing net operating loss carryforwards. For net operating loss carryforwards arising in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, the Tax Act limits a taxpayer\u2019s ability to utilize such carryforwards to 80% of taxable income. In addition, net operating loss carryforwards arising in tax years ending after December 31, 2017 can be carried forward indefinitely, but carryback is generally prohibited. Net operating loss carryforwards generated before January 1, 2018 will not be subject to the Tax Act\u2019s taxable income limitation and will continue to have a twenty-year carryforward period. The Coronavirus, Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (\u201cCARES Act\u201d) temporarily removed the 80% taxable income limit, reinstating it for tax years beginning after 2020. The CARES Act also allowed businesses to carry back net operating losses\u2019 arising in 2018, 2019 and 2020 to the five prior years. Nevertheless, our net operating loss carryforwards and other tax assets could expire before utilization and could be subject to limitations, which could harm our business, revenue, and financial results.\nWe will need to increase the size of our company and may not effectively manage our growth.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had 20 full-time employees. Of these employees, 15 are engaged in research or product development and clinical activities. In order to successfully implement our development and commercialization plans and strategies, we expect to need additional managerial, operational, sales, marketing, financial and other personnel. Future growth would impose significant added responsibilities on members of management, including:\n\u25cf identifying, recruiting, integrating, maintaining and motivating additional employees;\n\u25cf managing our internal development efforts effectively, including the FDA, EMA and other comparable foreign regulatory agencies\u2019 review process for our product candidates, while complying with any contractual obligations to contractors and other third parties we may have; and\n\u25cf improving our operational, financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures.\nOur future financial performance and our ability to successfully develop and, if approved, commercialize our product candidates will depend, in part, on our ability to effectively manage any future growth, and our management may also have to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from day-to-day activities in order to devote a substantial amount of time to managing these growth activities.\nWe currently rely, and for the foreseeable future will continue to rely, in substantial part on certain independent organizations, advisors and consultants to provide certain services, including key aspects of our research and development, clinical development and manufacturing. We cannot assure you that the services of independent organizations, advisors and consultants will continue to be available to us on a timely basis when needed, or that we can find qualified replacements. In addition, if we are unable to effectively manage our outsourced activities or if the quality or accuracy of the services provided by third-party service providers is compromised for any reason, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain marketing approval of our product candidates\nor otherwise advance our business. We cannot assure you that we will be able to manage our existing third-party service providers or find other competent outside contractors and consultants on economically reasonable terms, or at all.\nIf we are not able to effectively expand our organization by hiring new employees and/or engaging additional third-party service providers, we may not be able to successfully implement the tasks necessary to further develop and commercialize our product candidates and, accordingly, may not achieve our research, development and commercialization goals.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe must obtain regulatory approvals or authorizations before Ampion can be commercialized. If clinical trials of Ampion fail to satisfactorily demonstrate safety and efficacy to the FDA and other regulators, the FDA or other regulators may require additional clinical trials and we, or our collaborators, may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of Ampion.\nClinical trials are long, expensive, and unpredictable processes that can be subject to extensive delays. We cannot guarantee that any clinical studies will be conducted as planned or completed on schedule, if at all. It may take several years to complete clinical development necessary to commercialize a biologic, and delays or failure can occur at any stage. Success in pre-clinical testing and the results of earlier clinical trials do not necessarily predict clinical success, and larger and later-stage clinical studies may not produce the same results as earlier-stage clinical studies. In addition, clinical studies of potential products often reveal that it is not possible or practical to continue development efforts for these product candidates. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials even after promising results in earlier trials and we cannot be certain that we will not face similar setbacks. The design of a clinical trial can determine whether its results will support approval of a product for a desired indication and flaws in the design of a clinical trial may not become apparent until the clinical trial is well advanced or the results are being analyzed or reviewed.\nIn connection with clinical testing and trials, we face a number of risks, including, but not limited to the following:\n\u25cf Ampion is ineffective, or is considered inferior to existing approved medicines;\n\u25cf patients may die or suffer other adverse effects for reasons that may or may not be related to Ampion;\n\u25cf the results may not confirm the positive results of earlier testing or trials;\n\u25cf the results may not meet the level of statistical significance required by the FDA or other regulatory agencies to establish the safety and efficacy of Ampion; and\n\u25cf the FDA may require additional clinical testing and trials, which are costly and time consuming.\nIf we do not successfully complete clinical development, file our EUA or BLA and receive marketing authorization or approval from the FDA, we will be unable to market and sell products derived from Ampion and generate revenues. The AP-013 study results, together with prior OAK trials, may not be sufficient for FDA approval of a BLA for Ampion\u2019s treatment of severe OAK. The FDA may not deem the data sufficient to support an application for regulatory approval, or if the FDA requires additional clinical trials to support a BLA, the results may not necessarily be predictive of results of additional trials that may be needed before a BLA is submitted to the FDA. Likewise, the AP-017 and AP-019 study results may not be sufficient for FDA authorization of an EUA for Ampion\u2019s treatment of COVID-related illness. The FDA may not deem the data sufficient to support authorization, or if the FDA requires additional information to support an EUA, the results may not necessarily be predictive of the additional information that may be needed before an EUA is authorized by the FDA. Although there are a large number of biologics in the development stage in the United States and other countries, only a small percentage result in the submission of an EUA or BLA to the FDA, even fewer are authorized or approved for commercialization, and only a small number achieve widespread physician and consumer acceptance following regulatory approval. If our current clinical studies are substantially delayed or fail to satisfactorily\naddress the safety and effectiveness of Ampion in development, we may not receive regulatory authorization or approval of Ampion and our business and financial condition could be materially harmed.\nInterim, topline, and preliminary data from our clinical trials that we announce or publish from time to time may change as more patient data becomes available and is subject to audit and verification procedures that could result in material changes in the final data.\nFrom time to time, we have disclosed or may publicly disclose interim, topline, or preliminary data from our clinical trials, which is based on a preliminary analysis of then-available data, and the results and related findings and conclusions are subject to change following a more comprehensive review of the data related to the particular study or trial. We also make assumptions, estimations, calculations, and conclusions as part of our analyses of data, and we may not have received or had the opportunity to fully and carefully evaluate all data. As a result, the interim, topline, or preliminary results that we report may differ from future results of the same studies, or different conclusions or considerations may qualify such results, once additional data has been received and fully evaluated. Interim, topline, and preliminary data also remain subject to audit and verification procedures that may result in the final data being materially different from the preliminary data we previously published. As a result, such data should be viewed with caution until the final data are available. Adverse differences between preliminary, interim, or topline data and final data could significantly harm our business prospects.\nFurther, others, including regulatory agencies, may not accept or agree with our assumptions, estimates, calculations, conclusions, or analyses or may interpret or weigh the importance of data differently. This could impact the value of the particular program, the approvability, or the commercialization of the particular product candidate or product and our company in general. In addition, the information we choose to publicly disclose regarding a particular study or clinical trial is based on what is typically extensive information. You or others may not agree with what we determine is the material or otherwise appropriate information to include in our disclosure, and any information we determine not to disclose may ultimately be deemed significant with respect to future decisions, conclusions, views, activities or otherwise regarding a particular product, product candidate, or our business. If the interim, topline, or preliminary data that we report differ from actual results, or if others, including regulatory authorities, disagree with the methodologies used or the conclusions reached, our ability to obtain approval for, and commercialize, our product candidates and future product candidates may be harmed, which could harm our business, operating results, prospects, or financial condition.\nClinical drug development involves a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome. The clinical trials of our product candidates may not demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the FDA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities or otherwise produce positive results and the results of preclinical studies and early clinical trials may not be predictive of future results. We may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of our product candidates.\nClinical drug development is very expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and its ultimate outcome is uncertain. We cannot guarantee that any of our clinical trials will be conducted as planned or completed on schedule, if completed at all. Clinical trials can fail at any stage of testing and failure may result from a multitude of factors, including, among other things, flaws in study design, dose selection issues, placebo effects, patient enrollment criteria and failure to demonstrate favorable safety or efficacy traits. The outcome of preclinical studies and early-stage clinical trials may not be predictive of the success of later clinical trials. For example, our product candidates may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy in clinical development despite positive results in preclinical studies or having successfully advanced through initial clinical trials. We may also discover that the half-life of our product candidates or the required frequency of administration renders them unsuitable for the therapeutic applications we have chosen. As a result, we cannot assure you that any clinical trials that we conduct will demonstrate consistent or adequate efficacy and safety to support marketing approval.\nMany companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in late-stage clinical trials even after achieving promising results in preclinical testing and earlier-stage clinical trials, and we cannot be certain that we will not face similar setbacks. Moreover, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses, and many companies that have believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval of their drugs. Furthermore,\nthe failure of any of our product candidates to demonstrate safety and efficacy in any clinical trial could negatively impact the perception of our other product candidates and/or cause the FDA or other regulatory authorities to require additional testing before approving any of our product candidates.\nWe have experienced delays in completing our ongoing clinical trial(s) and may experience additional delays in initiating or completing additional clinical trials including, but not limited to, delays as a result of COVID-19. We may also experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, clinical trials that could delay or prevent receipt of marketing approval or our ability to commercialize our product candidates, including:\n\u2022 receipt of feedback from regulatory authorities that requires us to modify the design of our clinical trials;\n\u2022 clinical trial observations or results that require us to modify the design of our clinical trials;\n\u2022 negative or inconclusive clinical trial results that may require us to conduct additional clinical trials or abandon certain drug development programs;\n\u2022 obtaining approval from one or more institutional review boards (\u201cIRB\u201d);\n\u2022 the number of patients required for clinical trials being larger than anticipated, enrollment in these clinical trials being slower than anticipated or participants dropping out of these clinical trials at a higher rate than anticipated;\n\u2022 any failure or delay in reaching an agreement with CROs and clinical trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;\n\u2022 the suspension or termination of our clinical trials for various reasons, including non-compliance with regulatory requirements or a finding that our product candidates have undesirable side effects or other unexpected characteristics or risks;\n\u2022 changes to clinical trial protocol and/or analysis;\n\u2022 clinical sites deviating from trial protocol or dropping out of a trial;\n\u2022 the cost of clinical trials of our product candidates being greater than anticipated;\n\u2022 the supply or quality of our product candidates or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials of our product candidates being insufficient or inadequate;\n\u2022 subjects experiencing severe or unexpected drug-related adverse effects;\n\u2022 selection of clinical end points that require prolonged periods of clinical observation or analysis of the resulting data;\n\u2022 a facility manufacturing our product candidates, or any of their components, being ordered by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities to temporarily or permanently shut down due to violations of cGMP regulations or other applicable requirements, or infections or cross-contaminations of product candidates in the manufacturing process;\n\u2022 any changes to our manufacturing process that may be necessary or desired;\n\u2022 third-party clinical investigators losing the licenses or permits necessary to perform our clinical trials, not performing our clinical trials on our anticipated schedule or not performing our clinical trials consistent with the clinical trial protocol, GCP requirements or other regulatory requirements;\n\u2022 third-party contractors not performing data collection or analysis in a timely or accurate manner;\n\u2022 third-party contractors becoming debarred or suspended or otherwise penalized by the FDA or other government or regulatory authorities for violations of regulatory requirements, in which case we may need to find a substitute contractor, and we may not be able to use some or all of the data produced by such contractors in support of our marketing applications; and\n\u2022 regulators revising the requirements for approving our product candidates.\nIf we are required to conduct additional clinical trials or other testing of our product candidates beyond those that we currently contemplate, if we are unable to successfully complete clinical trials of our product candidates or other testing in a timely manner, if the results of these trials or tests are not positive or are only modestly positive or if there are safety concerns, we may incur unplanned costs, be delayed in seeking and obtaining marketing approval, if we receive such approval at all, receive more limited or restrictive marketing approval, be subject to additional post-marketing testing requirements or have the drug removed from the market after obtaining marketing approval.\nIf we experience delays in the completion of, or termination of, any clinical trial of our product candidates, the commercial prospects of our product candidates will be harmed, and our ability to generate product revenues from any of these product candidates will be delayed. Moreover, our product development costs will also increase if we experience delays in preclinical studies or clinical trials or in obtaining marketing approvals. We do not know whether any of our preclinical studies or clinical trials will begin as planned, will need to be restructured or will be completed on schedule, or at all. We may also determine we need to change the design or protocol of one or more of our clinical trials, which could result in increased costs and expenses and/or delays. Any delays in completing our clinical trials will increase our costs, slow down our product candidate development and approval process and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenues. In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, termination or suspension of, or a delay in the commencement or completion of, clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of a product candidate. Any delays to our clinical trials that occur as a result could shorten any period during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize our product candidates and our competitors may be able to bring products to market before we do, and the commercial viability of our product candidates could be significantly reduced. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition and prospects significantly.\nThe regulatory approval processes of the FDA and other comparable foreign regulatory authorities are lengthy, time consuming and inherently unpredictable. If we are ultimately unable to obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates, we will be unable to generate product revenue and our business will be substantially harmed.\nOur product candidates are and will continue to be subject to extensive governmental regulations relating to, among other things, research, testing, development, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, approval, recordkeeping, reporting, labeling, storage, packaging, advertising and promotion, pricing, marketing and distribution of drugs. Rigorous preclinical testing and clinical trials and an extensive regulatory approval process must be successfully completed in the United States and in many foreign jurisdictions before a new drug can be approved for marketing. Obtaining approval by the FDA and other comparable foreign regulatory authorities is costly, unpredictable, typically takes many years following the commencement of clinical trials and depends upon numerous factors, including the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidates involved. In addition, approval policies, regulations or the type and amount of clinical data necessary to gain approval may change during the course of a product candidate\u2019s clinical development and may vary among jurisdictions, which may cause delays in the approval or the decision not to approve an application. Regulatory authorities have substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that our data are insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical, clinical or other data. Even if we eventually complete clinical testing and receive approval for our product candidates, the FDA and other comparable foreign regulatory authorities may approve our product candidates for a more limited indication or a narrower patient population than we originally requested or may impose other prescribing limitations or warnings that limit the product\u2019s commercial potential. We have not submitted for, or obtained, regulatory approval for any product candidate, and it is possible that none of our product candidates will ever obtain regulatory approval.\nFurther, development of our product candidates and/or regulatory approval may be delayed for reasons beyond our control. Any product candidate we may develop may not progress through required clinical testing and obtain the regulatory approvals necessary for us to begin selling them.\nThe lengthy approval process, as well as the unpredictability of the results of clinical trials, may result in our failing to obtain regulatory approval to market any of our product candidates, which would significantly harm our business, results of operations and prospects. Any delay or failure in seeking or obtaining required approvals would have a material and adverse effect on our ability to generate revenue from any particular product candidates we are developing and for which we are seeking approval. Furthermore, any regulatory approval to market a drug may be subject to significant limitations on the approved uses or indications for which we may market, promote and advertise the drug or the labeling or other restrictions. In addition, the FDA has the authority to require a REMS plan or may impose other post-marketing requirements or restrictions as part of approving a New Drug Application, or after approval, which may impose further requirements or restrictions on the distribution or use of an approved drug. These requirements or restrictions might include limiting prescribing to certain physicians or medical centers that have undergone specialized training, limiting treatment to patients who meet certain safe-use criteria, requiring treated patients to enroll in a registry, or conducting further clinical trials. These limitations and restrictions may significantly limit the size of the market for the drug and affect reimbursement by third-party payors.\nWe are also subject to numerous foreign regulatory requirements governing, among other things, the conduct of clinical trials, manufacturing and marketing authorization, pricing and third-party reimbursement. The foreign regulatory approval process varies among countries, and generally includes all of the risks associated with FDA approval described above as well as risks attributable to the satisfaction of local regulations in foreign jurisdictions. Moreover, the time required to obtain approval may differ from that required to obtain FDA approval.\nInadequate funding for the FDA, the SEC and other relevant government agencies could hinder their ability to hire and retain key leadership and other personnel, thereby preventing new products and services from being developed or commercialized in a timely manner or otherwise prevent those agencies from performing normal regulatory functions on which the operation of our business may rely, which could negatively impact our business.\nThe ability of the FDA and comparable foreign authorities to review and approve new products can be affected by a variety of factors, including government budget and funding levels, ability to hire and retain key personnel and accept the payment of user fees, statutory, regulatory and policy changes, and the impact of crises that hinder its operations, such as COVID-19. Average review times at the agency have fluctuated in recent years as a result. In addition, government funding of the SEC and other government agencies on which our operations may rely, including those that fund research and development activities is subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable.\nDisruptions at the FDA and other agencies may also slow the time necessary for new drugs to be reviewed and/or approved by necessary government agencies, which would adversely affect our business. For example, in recent years, including in 2018 and 2019, the U.S. government shut down several times and certain regulatory agencies, such as the FDA and the SEC, had to furlough critical employees and stop critical activities. If a prolonged government shutdown occurs, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA to timely review and process our regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Further, future government shutdowns could impact our ability to access the public markets and obtain necessary capital in order to properly capitalize and continue our operations.\nThe results of clinical trials conducted at clinical trial sites outside the U.S. might not be accepted by the FDA, and data developed outside of a foreign jurisdiction similarly might not be accepted by such foreign regulatory authority.\nWe are currently conducting a subset of our AP-019 clinical trial outside of the U.S. and we may expand and conduct additional clinical trials outside the U.S. in the future. Although the FDA, or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may accept data from clinical trials conducted outside the relevant jurisdiction, acceptance of these data is subject to certain conditions. For example, the FDA requires that the clinical trial must be well designed and conducted and performed by qualified investigators in accordance with ethical principles such as an Institutional Review Board or ethics committee approval and informed consent. The FDA expects the clinical trial data to apply to the U.S. population\nand U.S. medical practice in ways that the FDA deems clinically meaningful. In addition, while these clinical trials are subject to the applicable local laws, acceptance of the data by the FDA will be dependent upon its determination that the trials were conducted consistent with all applicable U.S. laws and regulations. The FDA may not accept data from trials conducted outside of the U.S. as adequate support of a marketing application. Similarly, we must also ensure that any data submitted to foreign regulatory authorities adheres to their standards and requirements for clinical trials and there can be no assurance a comparable foreign regulatory authority would accept data from trials conducted outside of its jurisdiction.\nWe received an SPA agreement from the FDA relating to our AP-013 study of Ampion to treat the signs and symptoms of severe OAK. This SPA agreement does not guarantee approval of Ampion or any other particular outcome from regulatory review.\nWe requested agreement from the FDA under an SPA for our AP-013 study of Ampion, which we received in writing from the FDA in June 2019. The FDA\u2019s SPA process is designed to facilitate the FDA\u2019s review and approval of biologics by allowing the FDA to evaluate the proposed design and size of certain clinical trials that are intended to form the primary basis for determining a biologic\u2019s efficacy. Upon specific request by a clinical trial sponsor, the FDA will evaluate the protocol and respond to a sponsor\u2019s questions regarding, among other things, primary efficacy endpoints, trial conduct and data analysis. The FDA ultimately assesses whether the protocol design and planned analysis of the trial are acceptable to support regulatory approval of the product candidate with respect to the effectiveness of the indication studied. Based on their review, the FDA will then issue an SPA Agreement letter, or an SPA No Agreement letter.\nAs stated in the FDA\u2019s guidance for industry regarding SPAs (published in April 2018), an SPA agreement does not guarantee approval of a product candidate, even if the trial is conducted in accordance with the protocol. Moreover, the FDA may revoke or alter our SPA agreement in certain circumstances. In particular, an SPA agreement is not binding on the FDA if public health concerns emerge that were unrecognized at the time of the SPA agreement, other new scientific concerns arise regarding product safety or efficacy, we fail to comply with the agreed upon trial protocols, or the relevant data, assumptions, or information provided by us in our request for the SPA change are found to be false or omit relevant facts. In addition, even after an SPA agreement is finalized, the SPA agreement may be modified, and such modification will be deemed binding on the FDA review division, except under the circumstances described above, if the FDA and the sponsor agree in writing to modify the protocol and such modification is intended to improve the study. The FDA retains significant latitude and discretion in interpreting the terms of the SPA agreement and the data and results from any study that is the subject of the SPA agreement.\nThe AP-013 study was initiated in June 2019 and was ongoing when the COVID-19 pandemic began. The AP-013 study was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, as was the case with many clinical studies being conducted at that time. The study was paused in April 2020 due to patient and site safety concerns about COVID-19, the inability of sites to complete the remaining 12-week efficacy and 24-week follow-up visits, or to support doing these by remote visits, and the resulting unanimous recommendation from the study\u2019s safety monitoring committee given the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on the conduct of the study.\nIn discussions with the FDA, the agency recommended that we identify subject information that was impacted by the pandemic during the AP-013 study and conduct a sensitivity analysis to detect potential bias related to the pandemic. Following this guidance, we initiated close-out of the study, locked the database, and conducted a preliminary analysis. Early in the first quarter of 2022, we completed these additional analyses and submitted the preliminary results in a Type C request to meet with the FDA. We cannot know the potential outcome of the review of this data by the FDA. The submission of data does not provide assurance that the FDA will agree that we are in position to file the BLA, that the FDA will accept our BLA for Ampion when submitted, or that our trial results will be adequate to support approval. Those issues are addressed during the review of the submitted application and are determined based on the adequacy and merit of the overall submission. Final determinations for marketing application approval are made after a complete review of the marketing application and are based on the entirety of the data provided in the application. Any delay in or failure to obtain approval of our BLA for Ampion could materially impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur pursuit of Ampion as a COVID-19 therapeutic treatment is at an early stage. Ampion may not successfully treat the virus and its consequences in a timely manner, if at all.\nSince June 2020, we have commenced several clinical trials to determine the safety and efficacy for application of Ampion (i.e., inhaled and intravenous), as a therapeutic treatment for COVID-19. Our development of a COVID-19 treatment is in its early stages, and we may be unable to produce a drug that successfully treats COVID-19-related illness in a timely manner, if at all. We are also committing financial resources and personnel to the development of these COVID-19 treatments which may cause delays in or otherwise negatively impact our other development programs, despite uncertainties surrounding the longevity and extent of COVID-19 as a global health concern. Our business could be negatively impacted by our allocation of significant resources to a global health threat that is unpredictable and could rapidly dissipate or against which our treatments, if developed, may not be partially or fully effective. In addition, conducting a clinical trial of a COVID-19 treatment is challenging in the current environment due to a number of factors, including a large number of competitive clinical trials seeking to enroll COVID-19 patients, the heavy workload of existing hospital staff, variability in vaccination rates among the population, mutations of the COVID-19 virus and related illness in certain geographies, the difficulty and cost burden placed on hospitals of enrolling patients in intensive care or similar environments, and approval of other therapeutics, or use of previously-approved therapeutics for the treatment of COVID-19. These significant challenges may delay our clinical trials and may increase the costs of, or otherwise adversely affect, our clinical trials which could materially impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThere can be no assurance that our therapeutic treatments for COVID-19 would be authorized under an EUA by the FDA if we were to decide to apply for an EUA. If we do not apply for an EUA or, if we do apply and no EUA is authorized or, once authorized, it is terminated, we will be required to issue a recall for product which was previously sold into the market, discontinue future sales of our product until we complete the drug approval process, which is lengthy and expensive.\nWe may seek an EUA from the FDA. The FDA may authorize an EUA during certain types of public health emergencies if it determines that the potential benefits of a product outweigh the potential risks and if other regulatory criteria are met. There is no guarantee that we will apply for an EUA or, if we do apply that we will be able to obtain an EUA. If authorized, we will rely on the FDA policies and guidance in connection with the marketing and sale of our product. If these policies and guidance change unexpectedly and/or materially or if we misinterpret them, potential sales of our product could be adversely impacted.\nAn EUA authorizing the marketing and sale of our product will remain effective until the Secretary of HHS terminates the emergency use authorization declaration (with sufficient advance notice beforehand) or the product otherwise becomes approved. The FDA may also terminate the EUA if safety issues or other concerns about our product arise or if we fail to comply with the conditions of authorization. If we apply for an EUA, the failure to obtain such authorization or the termination of such an authorization, if obtained, could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. A separate regulatory filing is required to obtain full marketing approval and may require additional clinical trials.\nWe may apply for an EUA for the use of Ampion to treat COVID-19 induced respiratory distress in the United States, but the likelihood to be considered for such authorization depends on the status of the COVID-19 pandemic and the overall competitive landscape.\nA number of preventative vaccines and therapeutics have been approved for use in human populations by regulatory agencies in the U.S. and Europe. The anticipated effectiveness of these vaccines and therapeutics will likely limit the spread of COVID-19 and potentially reduce the market size for a COVID-19 treatment. Under such conditions, regulatory agencies may be less willing to consider expedited and shortened processes for review and may require submissions to be based on more than one clinical study.\nThe process for submitting and obtaining FDA authorization of an EUA can be expensive and lengthy. The FDA\u2019s review process can take several months or longer, and we may not be able to obtain EUA for the use of Ampion to treat COVID-19 induced respiratory distress on a timely basis, or at all. Even if a clinical trial is completed, there can be no assurance that the data generated during a clinical trial will meet the safety and effectiveness endpoints or otherwise produce results that will lead the FDA to grant authorization. The FDA\u2019s refusal of, or any significant delays in receiving\nan EUA, would have an adverse effect on our ability to expand our business. A separate regulatory filing is required to obtain full marketing approval and may require additional clinical trials.\nThere is significant competition in the search for a treatment for COVID-19.\nThere is significant competition, including from other companies and governmental organizations, to find treatments for COVID-19. Many of these entities have substantially greater resources (including capital and personnel) than we do and many of these entities are much further ahead in pursuit of a treatment than we are. Even if we are successful in demonstrating that Ampion is an effective treatment for COVID-19-induced respiratory distress, there is no guarantee that we will have the only effective treatment for COVID-19, that we will be able to get our treatment to market prior to our competitors or if we get our treatment to market that we will be profitable.\nIf we experience delays or difficulties in the enrollment and/or maintenance of patients in clinical trials, our regulatory submissions or receipt of necessary marketing approvals could be delayed or prevented.\nWe may not be able to initiate or continue clinical trials for our product candidates if we are unable to locate and enroll a sufficient number of eligible patients to participate in these trials to such trial\u2019s conclusion as required by the FDA, EMA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Patient enrollment is a significant factor in the timing of clinical trials. Our ability to enroll eligible patients may be limited or may result in slower enrollment than we anticipate.\nWe expect patient enrollment to be affected because our competitors have ongoing clinical trials for programs that are under development for the same indications as our product candidates and patients who would otherwise be eligible for our clinical trials could instead enroll in clinical trials of our competitors\u2019 programs. Patient enrollment for our current or any future clinical trials may be affected by other factors, including:\n\u25cf size and nature of the patient population;\n\u25cf perceived risks and benefits of novel, unproven approaches;\n\u25cf severity of the disease under investigation;\n\u25cf availability and efficacy of approved drugs for the disease under investigation;\n\u25cf patient eligibility criteria for the trial in question as defined in the protocol;\n\u25cf perceived risks and benefits of the product candidate under study;\n\u25cf clinicians\u2019 and patients\u2019 perceptions as to the potential advantages of the product candidate being studied in relation to other available therapies, including any new products that may be approved or other product candidates being investigated for the indications we are investigating;\n\u25cf patient referral practices of physicians;\n\u25cf the ability to monitor patients adequately during and after treatment;\n\u25cf the activities of key opinion leaders (KOLs) and patient advocacy groups;\n\u25cf proximity and availability of clinical trial sites for prospective patients; and\n\u25cf the risk that patients enrolled in clinical trials will drop out of the trials before completion or, because they may have an advanced disease, will not survive the full terms of the clinical trials.\nOur clinical trials have been, and may in the future be, affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. We are unable to predict with confidence the likelihood or duration of such patient enrollment delays and difficulties, whether related to COVID-\n19 or otherwise. If patient enrollment is delayed for an extended period of time, our clinical trials could be delayed or otherwise adversely affected.\nOur inability to enroll a sufficient number of patients for our clinical trials would result in significant delays or may require us to abandon one or more clinical trials altogether. Enrollment delays in our clinical trials may result in increased development costs for our product candidates and jeopardize our ability to obtain marketing approval for the sale of our product candidates. Furthermore, even if we are able to enroll a sufficient number of patients for our clinical trials, we may have difficulty maintaining participation in our clinical trials through the treatment and any follow-up periods.\nCompetition for patients in conducting clinical trials may prevent or delay product development and strain our limited financial resources.\nMany pharmaceutical companies are conducting clinical trials in patients with the disease indications that our potential drug products target. As a result, we must compete with them for clinical sites, physicians and the limited number of patients who fulfill the stringent requirements for participation in clinical trials. Also, due to the confidential nature of clinical trials, we do not know-how many of the eligible patients may be enrolled in competing studies and who are consequently not available to us for our clinical trials. Our clinical trials may be delayed or terminated due to the inability to enroll enough patients. Patient enrollment depends on many factors, including the size of the patient population, the nature of the trial protocol, the proximity of patients to clinical sites and the eligibility criteria for the study. The delay or inability to meet planned patient enrollment may result in increased costs and delays or termination of the trial, which could have a harmful effect on our ability to develop products.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials and perform data collection and analysis, which may result in costs and delays that prevent us from successfully commercializing Ampion.\nWe currently rely, and will rely in the future, on medical institutions, clinical investigators, contract research organizations, contract laboratories, and collaborators to perform data collection and analysis and other aspects of our clinical trials.\nOur clinical trials conducted by third parties may be delayed, suspended, or terminated if:\n\u25cf the third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or fail to meet regulatory obligations or expected deadlines;\n\u25cf we replace a third party; or\n\u25cf the quality or accuracy of the data obtained by third parties is compromised due to their failure to adhere to clinical protocols, regulatory requirements, or for other reasons.\nIn addition, our third parties are not our employees, and except for remedies available to us under our agreements with such third parties, we cannot control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to our on-going clinical, nonclinical and preclinical programs. If third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines, if they need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols, regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize Ampion. As a result, our results of operations and the commercial prospects for Ampion would be harmed, our costs could increase and our ability to generate revenues could be delayed or prevented.\nThird party performance failures may increase our development costs, delay our ability to obtain regulatory approval, and delay or prevent the commercialization of Ampion. If we seek alternative sources to provide these services, we may not be able to enter into replacement arrangements without incurring delays or additional costs. Though we attempt to carefully manage our ongoing relationships with our third parties, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter similar challenges or delays in the future or that these delays or challenges will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and prospects.\nThe production of Ampion depends on a limited source of supply that, when interrupted, may adversely affect our business.\nThe development of our product candidates depends on the availability of human serum albumin, which is a product that is derived from human blood. Any interruption in the supply of human serum albumin may adversely affect our business. In January 2022, the American Red Cross declared a national blood crisis for the first time. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a decline in donor turnout, cancellation of blood drives and staffing challenges causing a national blood shortage. Furthermore, regulations intended to reduce the risk of introducing infectious diseases in the blood supply (including COVID-19) could also result in a decreased pool of potential donors or integrity of inventory. Due to any pandemic, epidemic or outbreak in one or more regions in which our business operates, the portion of the donor pool that typically donates may be unable, or unwilling to donate, thereby significantly reducing the availability of blood supply. In addition, health and healthcare concerns among the public may result in a further decline in donations. If this crisis continues, we may experience disruptions in the supply of human serum albumin which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We cannot predict when the supply will stabilize.\nRelying on third-party suppliers may result in delays in our ongoing clinical trial and introduction of our product to the market.\nWe currently obtain the key components/raw materials needed to produce Ampion for our clinical trials from major suppliers in the industry and we continue to maintain strong relationships with those suppliers. Future clinical trials, if required, and FDA approval may be delayed if we are unable to obtain a sufficient quantity of the key components/raw materials needed to produce Ampion in a timely manner.\nSome of the primary materials used to make Ampion, including human serum albumin and other production materials, such as caps, vials and stoppers, are each supplied by a sole supplier, and the failure of those sole suppliers to timely supply sufficient items and materials necessary for the manufacture of Ampion could in turn disrupt our supply of Ampion. The reliance on a sole supplier, or limited number of suppliers, could result in delivery or quality problems or reduced control over product pricing, reliability, and performance, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Because we often do not account for a significant part of our suppliers' businesses, we may not have access to sufficient capacity from these suppliers in periods of high demand. In addition, since we generally do not have guaranteed supply arrangements with suppliers, we risk serious disruption to operations if an important supplier terminates product lines, changes business focus, or goes out of business.\nOnce regulatory approval is obtained, a marketed product and its suppliers and manufacturers are subject to continual review. The discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, supplier or manufacturer may result in restrictions on the product, supplier, or manufacturing facility, including withdrawal of the product from the market. Our key component/raw material suppliers are required to operate in accordance with cGMPs and applicable regulatory requirements per our quality agreements with each supplier. A failure of any of our contract suppliers to establish and follow cGMPs and applicable regulatory requirements, and to document their adherence to such practices, may lead to significant delays in the launch of Ampion into the market. Failure by third-party suppliers to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us or them, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, revocation or suspension of marketing approval for our product, seizures or recalls of our product, operating restrictions, and criminal prosecutions.\nOur product candidates may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval, limit the commercial profile of an approved label, or result in significant negative consequences following marketing approval, if any.\nUndesirable side effects caused by our product candidates could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in a more restrictive label or the delay or denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other comparable foreign authorities. Results of our trials could reveal a high and unacceptable severity and prevalence of these or other side effects. In such an event, our trials could be suspended or terminated, and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities could order us to cease further development of or deny approval of our product candidates for any or all targeted indications. The drug-related side effects could affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled\npatients to complete the trial or result in potential product liability claims. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition and prospects significantly.\nAdditionally, if we receive marketing approval for our product candidates, and we or others later identify undesirable side effects caused by such products, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:\n\u25cf regulatory authorities may withdraw approvals of such products;\n\u25cf regulatory authorities may require additional warnings on the label or impose other conditions;\n\u25cf we may be required to create a medication guide outlining the risks of such side effects for distribution to patients;\n\u25cf we could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients; and\n\u25cf our reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the particular product candidate or for particular indications of a product candidate, if approved, and could significantly harm our business, results of operations and prospects.\nIf Ampion is commercialized, this does not assure acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors, or the medical community in general.\nWe cannot be sure that Ampion, if and when approved for marketing, will be accepted by physicians, patients, third-party payors, or the medical community in general. Even if the medical community accepts a product as safe and efficacious for its indicated use, physicians may choose to restrict the use of the product if we or any collaborator are unable to demonstrate that, based on experience, clinical data, side-effect profiles, and other factors, our product is preferable to any existing medicines or treatments. We cannot predict the degree of market acceptance of Ampion once we receive marketing approval, which will depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf the clinical efficacy and safety of our product;\n\u25cf the approved labeling for our product and any required warnings;\n\u25cf the advantages and disadvantages of our product compared to alternative treatments;\n\u25cf our and any collaborator\u2019s ability to educate the medical community about the safety and effectiveness of our product;\n\u25cf the reimbursement policies of government and third-party payors pertaining to our product; and\n\u25cf the market price of our product relative to competing treatments.\nIf we do not achieve our projected development and commercialization goals in the timeframes we announce and expect, the commercialization of Ampion may be delayed, our business may be harmed, and our stock price may decline.\nWe frequently estimate for planning purposes the timing of the accomplishment of key scientific, clinical, regulatory, and other product development objectives. These milestones may include our expectations regarding the commencement or completion of scientific studies, clinical trials, the submission of regulatory filings, or commercialization objectives. From time to time, we may publicly announce the expected timing of some of these milestones, such as the completion of an ongoing clinical trial, the initiation of other clinical programs, submission of a BLA application, receipt of marketing approval, or a commercial launch of a product. The achievement of many of these milestones may be outside\nof our control. All of these milestones are based on a variety of assumptions which may cause the timing of achievement of the milestones to vary considerably from our estimates, including:\n\u25cf our available capital resources or capital constraints we experience;\n\u25cf the rate of progress, costs, and results of our clinical trials and research and development activities, including the extent of scheduling conflicts with participating clinicians and collaborators, and our ability to identify and enroll patients who meet clinical trial eligibility criteria;\n\u25cf our receipt of approvals by the FDA and other regulatory agencies and the timing thereof;\n\u25cf other actions, decisions, or rules issued by regulators;\n\u25cf our ability to access sufficient, reliable and affordable supplies of the compound used to manufacture Ampion;\n\u25cf the efforts of our collaborators with respect to the commercialization of our product; and\n\u25cf costs related to, and timing issues associated with, product manufacturing as well as sales and marketing activities.\nIf we fail to achieve announced milestones in the timeframes we announce and expect, our business and results of operations may be harmed, and the price of our stock may decline.\nWe have never commercialized a product candidate as a company before and currently lack the comprehensive, fully-staffed expertise, personnel and resources to successfully commercialize any products.\nWe have never commercialized a product candidate as a company. We may license certain rights with respect to our product candidates to collaborators and may rely on the assistance and guidance of those collaborators. For product candidates for which we retain commercialization rights and marketing approval, we will have to develop our own sales, marketing and supply organization or outsource these activities to a third party.\nFactors that may affect our ability to commercialize our product candidates, if approved, on our own include recruiting and retaining adequate numbers of effective sales, marketing, and market access personnel, developing and producing adequate educational and marketing programs to increase public acceptance of our approved product candidates, ensuring regulatory compliance of our company, all communications and materials in the promotional domain, employees and third parties under applicable healthcare laws, and other unforeseen costs associated with creating an independent sales and marketing organization. Developing a sales and marketing organization will be expensive and time-consuming and could delay the launch of our product candidates upon approval. We may not be able to build an effective sales and marketing organization. Alternatively, if we choose to collaborate, either globally or on a territory-by-territory basis, with third parties that have direct sales forces and established distribution systems, either to augment our own sales force and distribution systems or in lieu of our own sales force and distribution systems, we will be required to negotiate and enter into arrangements with such third parties relating to the proposed collaboration and such arrangements may prove to be less profitable than commercializing the product on our own. If we are unable to build our own distribution and marketing capabilities or to find suitable partners for the commercialization of our product candidates, we may not generate revenues from them or be able to reach or sustain profitability.\nWe might enter into agreements with third-party collaborators to commercialize Ampion, which may affect the sales of our product and our ability to generate revenues. If those collaborations are not successful, we may not be able to capitalize on the market potential of these product candidates.\nWe are not currently established to handle sales, marketing, and distribution of pharmaceutical products and may contract with, or license, third parties to market Ampion if we receive regulatory approvals. If we enter into any collaboration arrangements with any third parties, we will likely have limited control over the amount and timing of resources that our collaborators dedicate to the development or commercialization of our product candidates. Our ability to generate revenues from these arrangements will depend on our collaborators\u2019 abilities and efforts to successfully\nperform the functions assigned to them in these arrangements. Outsourcing sales and marketing in this manner may subject us to a variety of risks, including:\n\u25cf our inability to exercise control over sales and marketing activities and personnel;\n\u25cf collaborators may have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to, and the manner in which they perform their obligations under, these collaborations and may not perform their obligations as expected;\n\u25cf collaborators may deemphasize or not pursue development and commercialization of our product candidates or may elect not to continue or renew development or commercialization programs based on clinical trial results, changes in the collaborators\u2019 strategic focus, including as a result of a business combination or sale or disposition of a business unit or development function, or available funding or external factors such as an acquisition that diverts resources or creates competing priorities;\n\u25cf collaborators may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial program, stop a clinical trial or abandon a product candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials or require a new formulation of a product candidate for clinical testing;\n\u25cf collaborators could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with our product candidates if the collaborators believe that competitive products are more likely to be successfully developed or can be commercialized under terms that are more economically attractive than ours;\n\u25cf a collaborator with marketing and distribution rights to multiple products may not commit sufficient resources to the marketing and distribution of our product relative to other products;\n\u25cf collaborators may not provide us with timely and accurate information regarding development progress and activities under the collaboration or may limit our ability to share such information, which could adversely impact our ability to report progress to our investors and otherwise plan our own development of our product candidates;\n\u25cf failure or inability of contracted sales personnel to obtain access to or persuade adequate numbers of physicians to prescribe our product;\n\u25cf disputes may arise between the collaborators and us that result in the delay or termination of the research, development or commercialization of our product candidates or that result in costly litigation or arbitration that diverts management attention and resources;\n\u25cf unforeseen costs and expenses associated with sales and marketing;\n\u25cf collaborators may not have sufficient resources or decide not to devote the necessary resources due to internal constraints such as budget limitations, lack of human resources, or a change in strategic focus;\n\u25cf collaborators may believe our intellectual property or Ampion infringes on the intellectual property rights of others;\n\u25cf collaborators may not properly obtain, maintain, defend or enforce our intellectual property rights or may use our proprietary information and intellectual property in such a way as to invite litigation or other intellectual property related proceedings that could jeopardize or invalidate our proprietary information and intellectual property or expose us to potential litigation or other intellectual property related proceedings;\n\u25cf collaborators may own or co-own intellectual property covering our products that results from our collaborating with them, and in such cases, we would not have the exclusive right to develop or commercialize such intellectual property;\n\u25cf collaboration agreements may not lead to development or commercialization of product candidates in the most efficient manner or at all;\n\u25cf a collaborator\u2019s sales and marketing activities or other operations may not be in compliance with applicable laws resulting in civil or criminal proceedings.\n\u25cf collaborators may dispute their responsibility to conduct commercialization activities pursuant to the applicable collaboration, including the payment of related costs or the division of any revenues;\n\u25cf collaborators may decide to pursue a competitive product developed outside of the collaboration arrangement;\n\u25cf collaborators may delay the commercialization of Ampion in favor of commercializing another party\u2019s product candidate;\n\u25cf collaborators may decide to terminate or not to renew the collaboration for these or other reasons and, if terminated, this may result in a need for additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of the applicable product candidates; or\n\u25cf we may grant exclusive rights to our collaborators that would prevent us from collaborating with others.\nIf we are unable to partner with a third party that has adequate sales, marketing, and distribution capabilities, we may have difficulty commercializing Ampion, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and ability to generate product revenues.\nWe may need others to market and commercialize Ampion in international markets.\nIn the future, if appropriate regulatory approvals are obtained, we may commercialize Ampion in international markets. However, we have not currently decided how to commercialize Ampion in those markets. We may decide to build our own sales force or sell Ampion through third parties. If we decide to sell Ampion in international markets through a third party, we may not be able to enter into any marketing arrangements on favorable terms or at all. In addition, these arrangements could result in lower levels of income to us than if we marketed our product candidates entirely on our own. If we are unable to enter into a marketing arrangement for Ampion in international markets, we may not be able to develop an effective international sales force to successfully commercialize those products in international markets. If we fail to enter into marketing arrangements for Ampion and are unable to develop an effective international sales force, our ability to generate revenue would be limited.\nEven if we, or our collaborators, obtain marketing approvals for Ampion, in the future, Ampion could be subject to post-marketing restrictions or withdrawal from the market and we, and our collaborators, may be subject to substantial penalties if we, or they, fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if we, or they, experience unanticipated problems with our product following approval. The expenses and costs we will incur to comply with FDA post approval requirements could limit our financial resources for other development activities.\nEven if we receive marketing approval for Ampion, Ampion, as well as the manufacturing processes, post-approval studies and measures, labeling, advertising, and promotional activities for our product, among other things, will be subject to continual requirements of and review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration and listing requirements, requirements relating to manufacturing, quality control, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents, requirements regarding the distribution of samples to physicians and recordkeeping.\nEven if marketing approval of Ampion is granted, the approval may carry conditions that limit the market for our product or put our product at a competitive disadvantage relative to alternative therapies. A regulatory approval may further limit the indicated uses for which we can market a product or the patient population that may utilize the product. These restrictions could make it more difficult to market Ampion effectively, which could materially impair our ability to generate revenue.\nThe FDA may also impose requirements for costly post-marketing studies or clinical trials and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of a product. The FDA and other agencies, including the Department of Justice, closely regulate and monitor the post-approval marketing and promotion of products to ensure that they are manufactured, marketed, and distributed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. The FDA imposes stringent restrictions on manufacturers\u2019 communications regarding off-label use and if we, or our collaborators, do not market Ampion in accordance with the marketing approval received for a product\u2019s approved indications, we, or they, may be subject to warnings or enforcement action for off-label marketing. Violation of the FDCA, the Public Health Service Act, and other statutes, including the False Claims Act, relating to the promotion and advertising of prescription drugs may lead to investigations or allegations of violations of federal and state health care fraud and abuse laws and state consumer protection laws.\nDiscovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, judicial or administrative enforcement, warning letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors and civil or criminal penalties, among others. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product\u2019s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. The costs and expenses we may incur to comply with FDA post approval requirements could limit our financial resources for other development activities.\nGovernment restrictions on pricing and reimbursement, as well as other healthcare payor cost-containment initiatives may increase the difficulty and cost for us to obtain marketing approval for and commercialize our product and may affect the prices we may set.\nThe commercial success of Ampion will largely depend on the level of reimbursement rates from health maintenance, managed care, pharmacy benefit, government health administration authorities, private health coverage insurers, and other third-party payors. If reimbursement is not available, or is available only at limited levels, we, or our collaborators, may not be able to successfully commercialize Ampion. Even if coverage is provided, the approved reimbursement amount may not be high enough to allow us, or our collaborators, to establish or maintain pricing to realize a sufficient return on our or their investments.\nIn the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system, including cost-containment measures that may reduce or limit coverage and reimbursement for newly approved drugs and affect our ability to profitably sell any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. In particular, there have been and continue to be a number of initiatives at the U.S. federal and state levels that seek to reduce healthcare costs and improve the quality of healthcare.\nFor example, in March 2010, the Affordable Care Act was enacted in the United States. Among the provisions of the Affordable Care Act of importance to our potential product candidates are that it established an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents; expands eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs; increased the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program; created a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program; established a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and established a Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (\u201cCMS\u201d) to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending. There have been extensive judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. On August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 was signed into law, which, among other things, included reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2030, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, unless additional Congressional action is taken. In addition, on January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.\nFurther, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny in the United States of pharmaceutical pricing practices in light of the rising cost of prescription drugs. Such scrutiny has resulted in several recent congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. Legally mandated price controls on payment amounts by third-party payors or other restrictions could harm our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects. In addition, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other healthcare programs. This could reduce the ultimate demand for our product, if approved, or put pressure on our product pricing, which could negatively affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects.\nWe expect that the Affordable Care Act and other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, more rigorous coverage criteria, new payment methodologies and additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product. In addition, it is possible that additional governmental action will be taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from third-party payors. This could harm our or our collaborators\u2019 ability to market our product and generate revenues. Cost containment measures that health care payors and providers are instituting, and the effect of further health care reform could significantly reduce potential revenues from the sale of Ampion in the future, and could cause an increase in our compliance, manufacturing, or other operating expenses. In addition, in certain foreign markets, the pricing of prescription drugs is subject to government control and reimbursement may in some cases be unavailable. We believe that pricing pressures at the federal and state level, as well as internationally, will continue and may increase, which may make it difficult for us to sell our potential product that may be approved in the future at a price acceptable to us or any of our future collaborators.\nOur relationships with healthcare professionals, clinical investigators, CROs and third-party payors in connection with our current and future business activities may be subject to federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws, false claims laws, transparency laws, government price reporting, and health information privacy and security laws, which could expose us to significant losses, including, among other things, criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, exclusion from governmental healthcare programs, reputational harm, administrative burdens and diminished profits and future earnings.\nHealthcare providers and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Our current and future arrangements with healthcare professionals, clinical investigators, CROs, third-party payors and customers may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business, financial arrangements or relationships through which we research, as well as market, sell and distribute our products for which we obtain marketing approval. Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations may include the following:\n\u2022 the federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid;\n\u2022 the federal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, which can be enforced by private citizens through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, and civil monetary penalties laws, prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;\n\u2022 HIPAA prohibits, among other things, executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;\n\u2022 HIPAA, as amended by HITECH, and their implementing regulations, also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, on covered entities, which are health plans, healthcare clearinghouses, and certain health care providers, as those terms are defined by HIPAA, and their respective business associates and\nsubcontractors, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;\n\u2022 the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires applicable manufacturers of covered drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to annually report to CMS information regarding payments and other transfers of value to physicians, as well as information regarding ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family member;\n\u2022 analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers;\n\u2022 state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance regulations promulgated by the federal government and may require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers, marketing expenditures, or drug pricing;\n\u2022 state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales and medical representatives; and\n\u2022 state laws that govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nEfforts to ensure that our current and future business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare and data privacy laws and regulations will involve substantial ongoing costs and may require us to undertake or implement additional policies or measures. We may face claims and proceedings by private parties, and claims, investigations and other proceedings by governmental authorities, relating to allegations that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations, and it is possible that courts or governmental authorities may conclude that we have not complied with them, or that we may find it necessary or appropriate to settle any such claims or other proceedings. In connection with any such claims, proceedings, or settlements, we may be subject to significant penalties, including civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Defending against any such actions can be costly, time-consuming and may require significant financial and personnel resources. Therefore, even if we are successful in defending against any such actions that may be brought against us, our business may be impaired. Further, if any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business are found to not be in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs.\nOur current or former personnel, board members, independent contractors, consultants, commercial collaborators, principal investigators, CROs, suppliers and vendors may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements, that results in a material negative impact to the Company.\nWe are exposed to the risk that our current or former personnel, independent contractors, consultants, commercial collaborators, principal investigators, CROs, suppliers and vendors may engage in misconduct or other improper activities that results in a material negative impact to the Company. Such misconduct by these parties could include certain failures to comply with:\n\u25cf the laws and regulations of the FDA and non-U.S. regulators, including those laws requiring the reporting of true, complete and accurate information to such regulatory bodies;\n\u25cf manufacturing standards we have established;\n\u25cf healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations in the United States and similar foreign laws; or\n\u25cf laws requiring the accurate reporting of financial information or data or the disclosure of unauthorized activities to us.\nIn particular, sales, marketing, and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, misconduct, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs, and other business arrangements. Such misconduct could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and cause serious harm to the Company.\nOur business activities may be subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws of other countries in which we operate, as well as U.S. and certain foreign export controls, trade sanctions, and import laws and regulations. Compliance with these legal requirements could limit our ability to compete in foreign markets and subject us to liability if we violate them.\nOur business activities are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (\u201cFCPA\u201d), the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201, the U.S. Travel Act, and similar anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws, regulations or rules of other countries in which we operate. These laws generally prohibit companies and their employees, agents, representatives, business partners, and third-party intermediaries from, directly or indirectly, offering, promising, giving or authorizing others to give anything of value, either directly or indirectly, to recipients in the public or private sector in order to influence official action or otherwise obtain or retain business. Our business is heavily regulated and therefore involves significant interaction with public officials, including officials of non-U.S. governments. Additionally, in many other countries, hospitals are owned and operated by the government, and doctors and other hospital employees would be considered foreign officials under the FCPA. Recently, the SEC and DOJ have increased their FCPA enforcement activities with respect to biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. We sometimes leverage third parties to assist with the conduct of our business abroad. We, our employees, agents, representatives, business partners and third-party intermediaries may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities and may be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these employees, agents, representatives, business partners or third-party intermediaries even if we do not explicitly authorize such activities. We cannot assure you that all of our employees, agents, representatives, business partners and third-party intermediaries will not take actions in violation of applicable law for which we may be ultimately held responsible. As we increase our international sales and business activities, including the expansion of our clinical trial activities into foreign jurisdictions, our risks under these laws may increase.\nThese laws also require that we make and keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect the transactions of the corporation and that we devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls and compliance procedures designed to prevent violations of anti-corruption laws. There is no certainty that all of our employees, agents, representatives, business partners and third-party intermediaries, or those of our affiliates, will comply with applicable laws and regulations, for which we may be ultimately held responsible.\nViolations of these laws and regulations could result in whistleblower complaints, fines, severe civil or criminal sanctions, settlements, prosecution, enforcement actions, damages, adverse media coverage, investigations, loss of export privileges, disgorgement, and other remedial measures and prohibitions on the conduct of our business including our ability to offer our products in one or more countries. Responding to any investigation or action will likely result in a materially significant diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources and significant defense costs and other professional fees. As a general matter, investigations, enforcement actions and sanctions could damage our reputation, our brand, our international activities, our ability to attract and retain employees and our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition.\nIn addition, our products may be subject to U.S. and foreign export controls, trade sanctions and import laws and regulations. Governmental regulation of the import or export of our products, or our failure to obtain any required import or export authorization for our products, when applicable, could harm our international sales and adversely affect our revenue. Compliance with applicable regulatory requirements regarding the export of our products may create delays in the introduction of our products in international markets or, in some cases, prevent the export of our products to some countries altogether. Furthermore, U.S. export control laws and economic sanctions prohibit the shipment of certain products and services to countries, governments, and persons targeted by U.S. sanctions. If we fail to comply with export and import regulations and such economic sanctions, penalties could be imposed, including fines and/or denial of certain\nexport privileges. Moreover, any new export or import restrictions, new legislation or shifting approaches in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations, or in the countries, persons, or products targeted by such regulations, could result in decreased use of our products by, or in our decreased ability to export our products to, existing or potential customers with international operations. Any decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability to export or sell our products would likely adversely affect our business.\nLawsuits or investigations could divert our resources, result in substantial liabilities and reduce the commercial potential of Ampion.\nWe may be subject to legal or administrative proceedings and litigation in the future, which may be costly to defend and could materially harm our business, financial condition and operations. While we do not anticipate legal or administrative proceedings, the cost of responding to and defending ourselves in such proceedings could be costly and exceed our retention levels under our insurance program(s).\nAdditionally, the risk that we may be sued on product liability claims is inherent in the development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products. Side effects of, or manufacturing defects in, the product that we develop which is commercialized by us, or our collaborators could result in the deterioration of a patient\u2019s condition, injury, or even death. Once a product is approved for sale and commercialized, the likelihood of product liability lawsuits increases. Claims may be brought by individuals seeking relief for themselves or by individuals or groups seeking to represent a class. These lawsuits may divert our management from pursuing our business strategy and may be costly to defend. In addition, if we are held liable in any of these lawsuits, we may incur substantial liabilities and may be forced to limit or forgo further commercialization of Ampion.\nAlthough we maintain D&O insurance as well as general liability and product liability insurance, this insurance coverage only covers potential liabilities after our retention has been met and only to the extent of the insurance coverage, therefore, our insurance coverage may not fully cover potential liabilities. In addition, our inability to obtain or maintain sufficient insurance coverage at an acceptable cost or to otherwise protect against potential legal or administrative liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercial production and sale of Ampion, if and when it receives regulatory approval, which could in turn adversely affect our business. Lawsuits and investigations, or threats thereof, could also harm our reputation, which may adversely affect our collaborators\u2019 ability to commercialize our product successfully.\nAmpion is regulated by the FDA, and as such, may be subject to competition sooner than anticipated.\nWith the enactment of the BPCIA, an abbreviated pathway for the approval of biosimilar and interchangeable biological products was created. The abbreviated regulatory pathway established legal authority for the FDA to review and approve biosimilars, including the possible designation of a biosimilar as \u201cinterchangeable\u201d based on its similarity to an existing brand product. The BPCIA provides a period of exclusivity for products granted \u201creference product exclusivity,\u201d under which an application for a biosimilar product referencing such products cannot be approved by the FDA until 12 years after the original branded product is approved under a BLA.\nThis period of regulatory exclusivity does not apply to companies pursuing regulatory approval via their own traditional BLA, rather than via the abbreviated pathway. Therefore, if Ampion were to receive reference product exclusivity, a competitor may seek approval of a product candidate under a full BLA. In such a case, although the competitor would not enjoy the benefits of the abbreviated pathway for biosimilar approval created under the BPCIA, the FDA would not be precluded from making effective an approval of the competitor product pursuant to a BLA prior to the expiration of our 12-year period of market exclusivity.\nWe could face substantial competition from companies with considerably more resources and experience than we have, which may result in others discovering, developing, receiving approval for, or commercializing products before or more successfully than us.\nIf we develop an approved product, we cannot provide assurance it will be first to market, clinically superior or scientifically preferable to existing or future products and/or treatments developed or introduced by our competitors. Our ability to succeed in the future depends on our ability to discover, develop, and commercialize a pharmaceutical product that offers superior efficacy, convenience, tolerability, and safety when compared to existing, or a lack of demonstrated, treatment methodologies. Because our strategy is to develop a new product candidate primarily for the\ntreatment of conditions that affect a large patient population, our product is likely to compete with a number of existing medicines or treatments, and a large number of product candidates that are being developed by others.\nMany of our potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, personnel, and marketing resources than we do. In addition, many of these competitors have significantly greater resources devoted to product development and pre-clinical research. Our ability to compete successfully will depend largely on our ability to:\n\u25cf develop Ampion to be superior to other products in the market;\n\u25cf attract and retain qualified personnel;\n\u25cf obtain patent and/or other proprietary protection for Ampion;\n\u25cf obtain required regulatory approvals; and\n\u25cf obtain collaboration arrangements to commercialize Ampion.\nEstablished pharmaceutical companies devote significant financial resources to discovering, developing, or licensing novel compounds that could make Ampion obsolete. Our competitors may obtain patent protection, receive FDA approval, and commercialize medicines before us. Other companies are engaged in the discovery of compounds that may compete with Ampion.\nAny new product that competes with a currently approved treatment or medicine must demonstrate compelling advantages in efficacy, convenience, tolerability, and/or safety to address price competition and be commercially successful. If we are not able to compete effectively against our current and future competitors, our business will not grow, and our financial condition and operations will suffer.\nWe may expend our limited resources to pursue a particular product candidate or indication and fail to capitalize on product candidates or indications that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\nWe have limited financial and managerial resources. Therefore, we focus on research programs and product candidates that we identify for specific indications. If, due to our limited resources and access to capital, we prioritize development of certain product candidates that ultimately prove to be unsuccessful, we may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with other product candidates or for other indications that later prove to have greater commercial potential or a greater likelihood of success. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities. Our spending on current and future research and development programs and product candidates for specific indications may not yield any commercially viable products. If we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular product candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate through collaboration, licensing or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights to such product candidate.\nIf we do not receive marketing approval for Ampion, we may not realize the investment we have made in our manufacturing facility.\nIn May 2014, we commenced a 125-month lease of a multi-purpose facility containing approximately 19,000 square feet. We have built out this facility in anticipation of receiving approval of our BLA and commencing commercialization of Ampion for treatment of severe OAK. If the submission of our BLA for Ampion is significantly delayed, the FDA does not approve our BLA for Ampion, and/or does not approve of our manufacturing operation, we will not be able to manufacture Ampion for commercial sale in our facility and we will remain obligated to make payments under our lease, which is set to expire in 2024. Any delay or failure to receive BLA approval for Ampion could have a material adverse effect on the carrying value of the manufacturing facility as well as on our results of operations.\nThe manufacture of drugs is complex, and we, or any third-party manufacturers, may encounter difficulties in production. If there are any such difficulties, our ability to provide adequate supply of our product candidates for clinical trials or our products for patients, if approved, could be delayed or prevented.\nManufacturing drugs, especially in large quantities, is complex and may require the use of innovative technologies. Each lot of an approved drug product must undergo thorough testing for identity, strength, quality, purity and potency. Manufacturing drugs requires facilities specifically designed for and validated for this purpose, as well as sophisticated quality assurance and quality control procedures. Slight deviations anywhere in the manufacturing process, including filling, labeling, packaging, storage and shipping and quality control and testing, may result in lot failures or product recalls. When changes are made to the manufacturing process, we may be required to provide preclinical and clinical data showing the comparable quality and efficacy of the products before and after such changes. If we or any third-party manufacturers are unable to produce sufficient quantities for clinical trials or for commercialization as a result of these challenges, or otherwise, our development and commercialization efforts would be impaired, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nIn the unlikely instance we use hazardous and/or biological materials in a manner that causes injury or violates applicable law, we may be liable for damages or fines.\nThe activities conducted at our facility (i.e., research and development and manufacturing) may, from time to time, involve the controlled use of potentially hazardous substances, including, but not limited to, chemical and biological materials and hazardous waste products. Federal, state, and local laws and regulations govern the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous materials. If we experience a release of hazardous substances, it is possible that this release could cause personal injury or death, and require decontamination of the facility. In the unlikely event of an accident while manufacturing Ampion, we could be held liable for damages or face substantial penalties. We do not have any insurance for liabilities arising from the procurement, handling, or discharge of hazardous materials. Compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations, in the event of an accident, is expensive, and current or future environmental regulations may delay our research, development and production efforts, which could harm the financial condition of our business or impair our operations.\nWe currently, and from time to time in the future may, outsource portions of our internal business functions to third-party providers. Outsourcing these functions has significant risks, and our failure to manage these risks successfully could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe currently, and from time to time in the future may, outsource portions of our internal business functions to third-party providers including information technology, human resources, internal audit testing, legal services and certain calculations and other information that support our accounting and financial reporting, among other things. Third-party providers may not comply on a timely basis with all of our requirements or may not provide us with an acceptable level of service. In addition, our reliance on third-party providers could have significant negative consequences, including significant disruptions in our operations and significantly increased costs to undertake our operations. For example, any failure by the third-party providers that assist us with financial reporting to provide us with accurate information or implement and maintain effective controls may cause us to be unable to meet our reporting obligations as a publicly traded company and we could experience deficiencies in our operations that could have an adverse effect on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. As a result of our outsourcing activities, it may be more difficult for us to recruit and retain qualified employees for our business needs at any time and if we have a failure in our outsourced financial reporting activities, our independent registered public accounting firm may not be able to provide us with an unqualified report regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, which may cause investors to lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements and could result in a decrease in the value of our common stock. Our failure to successfully outsource any material portion of our business functions could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur future success depends on our ability to retain key employees, consultants and advisors and to attract, retain, and motivate qualified personnel.\nWe are highly dependent on our executive officers; the loss of whose services may adversely impact the achievement of our objectives. Recruiting and retaining other qualified employees, consultants, and advisors for our business, including scientific and technical personnel, will also be critical to our success. There is currently a shortage of skilled executives and scientific personnel in our industry, which is likely to continue. As a result, competition for skilled personnel is\nintense and the turnover rate can be high. We may not be able to attract and retain personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for individuals with similar skill sets. In addition, our current financial needs and potential benefit packages at other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies may make it more challenging to recruit and retain qualified personnel. The inability to recruit or the loss of the services of any executive, key employee, consultant, or advisor may impede the progress of our research, development and commercialization objectives.\nIn order to induce valuable employees to remain employed at Ampio, in addition to salary and cash incentives, we have provided stock options and restricted stock awards that vest over time. The value to employees of stock options that vest over time may be significantly affected by movements in our stock price that are beyond our control and may at any time be insufficient to counteract more lucrative offers from other companies.\nDespite our efforts to retain valuable employees, members of our management, scientific, and development teams have in the past and may in the future terminate their employment with us. The loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees and our inability to find suitable replacements could potentially harm our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations. We do not maintain \u201ckey man\u201d insurance policies on the lives of these individuals or any of our other employees. Our success also depends on our ability to continue to attract, retain, and motivate highly skilled junior, mid-level, and senior managers as well as junior, mid-level, and senior scientific and medical personnel.\nMany of the other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies that we compete against for qualified personnel have greater financial and other resources, different risk profiles and a longer history in the industry than we do. They may also provide more diverse opportunities and better chances for career advancement. Some of these characteristics may be more appealing to high quality candidates than what we can offer. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain high quality personnel, the rate and success at which we can discover, develop and commercialize Ampion will be limited.\nUncertainties relating to recent changes in our management team may adversely affect our operations.\nAs previously announced, we have recently experienced several changes to our senior management team which are designed to strengthen the management team and realign responsibilities while Michael Macaluso, our former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, undergoes medical treatment during a one-year medical leave of absence. While we expect to engage in an orderly transition process as we integrate newly appointed officers, we face a variety of risks and uncertainties relating to the lack of management continuity, including diversion of management attention from business concerns, failure to retain other key personnel or inability to hire new key personnel. These risks and uncertainties could result in operational and administrative inefficiencies and added costs, which could adversely impact our results of operations and stock price.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nOur ability to compete may decline if we do not adequately protect our proprietary rights.\nOur commercial success in the U.S. and abroad depends on obtaining and maintaining proprietary rights for Ampion including, but not limited to, its composition and uses. If our intellectual property rights are invalidated or circumvented, our business will be adversely affected. We must successfully defend these rights against third-party challenges. We will only be able to protect Ampion\u2019s proprietary composition and its uses from unauthorized use to the extent that valid and enforceable patents, or effectively protected trade secrets, cover them.\nOur ability to obtain patent protection for Ampion and its composition is uncertain due to a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf we may not be the first to make the inventions covered by pending patent applications or issued patents;\n\u25cf we may not be the first to file patent applications for Ampion or for its uses;\n\u25cf others may independently develop identical, similar, or alternative products or compositions;\n\u25cf our disclosures in patent applications may not be sufficient to meet the legal requirements for patentability in the U.S. or elsewhere;\n\u25cf any or all of our pending patent applications may not result in issued patents;\n\u25cf we may not seek or obtain patent protection in countries that may eventually provide us a significant business opportunity;\n\u25cf any patents issued to us may not provide adequate protection for commercially viable products, may not provide any competitive advantages, or may be successfully challenged by third parties;\n\u25cf our proprietary compositions may not be patentable;\n\u25cf others may design around our patent claims to produce competitive products which fall outside of the scope of our patents;\n\u25cf others may identify prior art which could invalidate our patents; and/or\n\u25cf the availability and length of patent term extension (\u201cPTE\u201d) under the Hatch-Waxman Act for approved products are subject to a number of factors and PTE could be unavailable or less than the maximum amount of 5 years for Ampion.\nEven if we have or obtain patents covering Ampion or its uses, patent terms, which are typically measured as 20 years from their original filing date, may be inadequate to protect our competitive position on our product candidates for an adequate amount of time. Obtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, documentary, fee payment and other requirements imposed by regulations and governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements. If the scope of any patent protection we obtain is not sufficiently broad, or if we lose any of our patent protection, our ability to prevent our competitors from commercializing similar or identical product candidates would be adversely affected.\nAdditionally, even if we have or obtain patents covering Ampion or its uses, we may still be barred from making, using and/or selling Ampion because of the patent rights of others. Intellectual property rights are complex and uncertain and therefore may subject us to infringement claims. Others have or may have filed, and in the future may file, patent applications covering compositions or products that are similar or identical to ours. There are many issued U.S. and foreign patents and pending patent applications relating to chemical compounds, biological compositions and therapeutic products, and some of these may relate to compositions we intend to commercialize. These could materially affect our ability to develop Ampion or sell our product if approved. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending applications unknown to us that may later result in issued patents that Ampion or its uses may infringe. These patent applications may have priority over patent applications filed by us.\nWe have conducted searches to identify patents or patent applications that may prevent us from obtaining patent protection for our compositions, that could limit the rights we have claimed in our patents and patent applications, or that could impact our freedom-to-operate with respect to Ampion. While our searches have not identified any patents or patent applications that are particularly relevant to Ampion, there may be issued patents, and/or currently pending applications that may later result in issued patents, not identified by our searches that Ampion or its uses may infringe.\nDisputes may arise regarding the source or ownership of our inventions. It is difficult to determine if and how such disputes would be resolved. Others may challenge the validity of our patents. If our patents are found to be invalid, we will lose the ability to exclude others from making, using and/or selling the compositions or uses addressed in those patents.\nConfidentiality agreements with employees and others may not adequately prevent disclosure of our trade secrets and other proprietary information and may not adequately protect our intellectual property, which could limit our ability to compete.\nBecause we operate in the highly technical field of drug discovery and development of therapies that can address inflammation and other conditions, we rely in part on trade secret protection to protect our proprietary technology and processes. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect and if we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed. We enter into confidentiality and intellectual property\nassignment agreements with our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers, and other advisors. These agreements generally require that the other party keep confidential, and not disclose to third parties, all confidential information developed by the party or made known to the party by us during the party\u2019s relationship with us. These agreements also generally provide that inventions conceived by the party while rendering services for us will be our exclusive property.\nHowever, these agreements may not be honored and may not effectively assign intellectual property rights to us. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally obtained and is using our trade secrets is difficult, expensive, and time consuming and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, courts outside the United States may be less willing to protect trade secrets. The failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive position.\nA dispute concerning the infringement or misappropriation of our proprietary rights or the proprietary rights of others could be time consuming and costly, and an unfavorable outcome could harm our business.\nThere is significant litigation in the pharmaceutical industry regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. Our commercial success depends significantly on our ability to operate without infringing the patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties. Claims by third parties that we infringe their patents and/or intellectual property rights may result in liability for damages or prevent or delay our developmental and commercialization efforts. While we are not currently subject to any pending intellectual property litigation, and are not aware of any such threatened litigation, we may be exposed to future litigation by third parties based on claims that Ampion, methods of making Ampion and/or methods of using Ampion infringe the intellectual property rights of others. There are many patents relating to pharmaceuticals used to treat inflammation. Some of these may encompass Ampion or components of Ampion. If our development activities are found to infringe any such patents, we may have to pay significant damages or seek licenses to such patents. A patentee could prevent us from using pharmaceuticals encompassed by their claims.\nFrom time to time, we may hire scientific personnel or consultants formerly employed by other companies involved in one or more areas similar to the activities conducted by us. Because of that, we may be subject to claims that we have wrongfully hired an employee from a competitor or that either we, or these individuals, have misappropriated one or more trade secrets from a competitor, that we/they have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged confidential information, or other similar claims as a result of prior affiliations.\nIf we become involved in litigation, it could consume a substantial portion of our managerial and financial resources, regardless of whether we win or lose. Our position as a relatively small company may cause us to be at a disadvantage in defending our intellectual property rights and in defending against infringement claims by third parties. We may not be able to afford the costs of litigation or, because of the expense and uncertainty of litigation, we may not be in a position to enforce our intellectual property rights against third parties. Any legal action against us or our collaborators could lead to:\n\u25cf payment of damages, potentially treble damages, if we are found to have willfully infringed a party\u2019s patent rights;\n\u25cf injunctive or other equitable relief that may effectively block our ability to further develop, commercialize, and sell Ampion; and/or\n\u25cf us or our collaborators having to enter into license arrangements that may not be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all.\nAs a result, we could be prevented from commercializing Ampion. Additionally, intellectual property litigation may lead to unfavorable publicity that harms our reputation and causes the market price of our common shares to decline.\nPharmaceutical patents and patent applications involve highly complex legal and factual questions, which, if determined adversely to us, could negatively impact our patent position.\nThe patent positions of pharmaceutical companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. For example, some of our patents and patent applications cover methods of using Ampion, while other patents and patent applications cover the composition of Ampion. The interpretation and breadth of claims allowed in some patents covering pharmaceutical compositions may be uncertain and difficult to determine and are often affected\nmaterially by the facts and circumstances that pertain to the patented composition and the related patent claims. The standards of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (\u201cUSPTO\u201d) and of foreign patent offices are sometimes uncertain and could change in the future. Consequently, the issuance and scope of patents cannot be predicted with certainty. Patents, if issued, may be challenged, revoked, invalidated, or circumvented. U.S. patents and patent applications may also be subject to interference proceedings, and U.S. patents may be subject to reexamination or other post-grant proceedings by the USPTO. Foreign patents may be subject to opposition or comparable proceedings in the corresponding foreign patent offices, which could result in either loss of the patent, rejection of the patent application or loss or reduction in the scope of one or more of the claims of the patent or patent application. In addition, such interference, reexamination and opposition proceedings may be costly. Accordingly, rights under any issued patents may not provide us with sufficient protection against competitive products or processes.\nIn addition, changes in, or different interpretations of, patent laws in the United States and foreign countries could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our product candidates, may permit others to use our discoveries or to develop and commercialize our technology and product without providing any compensation to us, or may limit the number of patents or claims we can obtain. The laws of some countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as U.S. law and those countries may lack adequate rules and procedures for defending our intellectual property rights. For example, some countries do not grant patent claims directed to methods of treating humans and, in these countries, patent protection may not be available at all to protect Ampion. In addition, U.S. patent laws may change, which could prevent or limit us from filing patent applications or patent claims to protect our products and/or compounds.\nIf we fail to obtain and maintain patent protection and trade secret protection for Ampion, its proprietary composition and its uses, we could lose our competitive advantage and the competition we face could increase, reducing any potential revenues and adversely affecting our ability to attain or maintain profitability.\nFrom time to time we may need to license patents, intellectual property and proprietary technologies from third parties, which may be difficult or expensive to obtain.\nWe may need to obtain licenses to patents and other proprietary rights held by third parties to successfully develop, manufacture and market Ampion. As an example, it may be necessary to use a third party\u2019s proprietary technology to reformulate our product candidate in order to improve upon the capabilities of the product candidate. If we are unable to timely obtain these licenses on reasonable terms, our ability to commercially exploit Ampion may be inhibited or prevented.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents on product candidates in all countries throughout the world is expensive. Our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the U.S. can be less extensive than those in the U.S. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the U.S. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the U.S., or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the U.S. or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and, further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection but where enforcement is not as strong as that in the U.S. These products may compete with our products in jurisdictions where we do not have any issued patents and our patent claims or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biopharmaceutical products, which could make it difficult for us or our licensors to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products against third parties in violation of our proprietary rights generally. The initiation of proceedings by third parties to challenge the scope or validity of our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial cost and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and any patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us or our licensors. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our\nintellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe price of our stock has been extremely volatile and may continue to be volatile and fluctuate substantially, which could result in substantial losses for purchasers of our common stock.\nThe price of our common stock has been extremely volatile and may continue to be so. The stock market in general and the market for pharmaceutical companies have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company. The following factors, in addition to the other risk factors described in this section, may also have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock:\n\u25cf any actual or perceived adverse developments in clinical trials for Ampion;\n\u25cf any actual or perceived difficulties or delays in obtaining regulatory approval of Ampion in the United States or other countries;\n\u25cf any finding that Ampion is not safe or effective, or any inability to demonstrate the clinical effectiveness of Ampion when compared to existing treatments;\n\u25cf any actual or perceived adverse developments in repurposed drug technologies, including any change in FDA policy or guidance on approval of repurposed drug technologies for new indications;\n\u25cf any announcements of developments with, or comments by, the FDA, the EMA, or other regulatory authorities with respect to our development of Ampion;\n\u25cf changes in laws or regulations applicable to Ampion, including but not limited to clinical trial requirements for approvals;\n\u25cf any announcements concerning our retention or loss of key employees;\n\u25cf our success or inability to obtain collaborators to conduct clinical trials, or commercialize Ampion once regulatory approval is obtained;\n\u25cf announcements of patent issuances or denials, product innovations, or introduction of new commercial products by our competitors that will compete with Ampion;\n\u25cf publicity regarding actual or potential study results or the outcome of regulatory reviews relating to the development of Ampion or our competitors\u2019 products;\n\u25cf announcements of the introduction of new products by our competitors;\n\u25cf announcements concerning product development results or intellectual property rights of others;\n\u25cf future issuances of common stock or other securities;\n\u25cf economic and other external factors beyond our control; and\n\u25cf sales of stock by us or by our stockholders.\nA significant drop in the price of our stock could expose us to the risk of securities class action lawsuits, which could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business.\nThe price of our stock may be vulnerable to manipulation, including through short sales.\nWe believe there has been and may continue to be substantial off-market transactions in derivatives of our stock, including short selling activity or related similar activities, which are beyond our control and which may be beyond the full control of the SEC and the Financial Institutions Regulatory Authority (\u201cFINRA\u201d). Short sales are transactions in which a market participant sells a security that it does not own. To complete the transaction, the market participant must borrow the security to make delivery to the buyer. The market participant is then obligated to replace the security borrowed by purchasing the security at the market price at the time of required replacement. If the price at the time of replacement is lower than the price at which the security was originally sold by the market participant, then the market participant will realize a gain on the transaction. Thus, it is in the market participant\u2019s interest for the market price of the underlying security to decline as much as possible during the period prior to the time of replacement. While SEC and FINRA rules prohibit some forms of short selling and other activities that may result in stock price manipulation, such activity may nonetheless occur without detection or enforcement. Significant short selling or other types of market manipulation could cause our stock trading price to decline, to become more volatile, or both.\nPrevious short selling efforts have impacted, and may in the future continue to impact, the value of our stock in an extreme and volatile manner to our detriment and the detriment of our stockholders. In addition, market participants with admitted short positions in our stock have published, and may in the future continue to publish, negative information regarding us and our management team on internet sites or blogs that we believe is inaccurate and misleading. We believe that the publication of this negative information has led, and may in the future continue to lead, to significant downward pressure on the price of our stock to our detriment and the further detriment of our stockholders. These and other efforts by certain market participants to manipulate the price of our common stock for their personal financial gain may cause our stockholders to lose a portion of their investment, may make it more difficult for us to raise equity capital when needed without significantly diluting existing stockholders, and may reduce demand from new investors to purchase shares of our stock.\nIf we cannot continue to satisfy the NYSE American listing maintenance requirements and other rules, including the director independence requirements, our securities may be delisted, which could negatively impact the price of our securities.\nOur common stock is listed on the NYSE American. However, we may become unable to continue to satisfy the listing maintenance requirements and rules. If we are unable to satisfy the NYSE American criteria for maintaining our listing, our securities could be subject to delisting. To qualify for continued listing on the NYSE American, we must remain in compliance. There can be no assurances that we will be able to continue to comply with the NYSE American listing requirements.\nIn order to maintain this listing, we must maintain certain share prices, financial and share distribution targets, including maintaining a minimum amount of stockholders\u2019 equity and a minimum number of public stockholders. In addition to these objective standards, the NYSE American may delist the securities of any issuer if, in its opinion, the issuer\u2019s financial condition and/or operating results appear unsatisfactory; if it appears that the extent of public distribution or the aggregate market value of the security has become so reduced as to make continued listing on the NYSE American inadvisable; if the issuer sells or disposes of principal operating assets or ceases to be an operating company; if an issuer fails to comply with the NYSE American\u2019s listing requirements; if an issuer's common stock sells at what the NYSE American considers a \u201clow selling price\u201d (generally trading below $0.20 per share for an extended period of time); or if any other event occurs or any condition exists which makes continued listing on the NYSE American, in its opinion, inadvisable.\nIf the NYSE American delists our securities, we could face significant consequences, including:\n\u25cf a limited availability for market quotations for our securities;\n\u25cf reduced liquidity with respect to our securities;\n\u25cf a determination that our common stock is a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d which will require brokers trading in our common stock to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly result in reduced trading;\n\u25cf activity in the secondary trading market for our common stock;\n\u25cf limited amount of news and analyst coverage; and\n\u25cf a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nIn addition, we would no longer be subject to the NYSE American rules, including rules requiring us to have a certain number of independent directors and to meet other corporate governance standards.\nA sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nIf our stockholders sell, or the market perceives that our stockholders intend to sell for various reasons, substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, including shares issued in connection with the exercise of outstanding options or warrants, the market price of our common stock could fall. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem reasonable or appropriate. We may become involved in securities class action litigation that could divert management\u2019s attention and harm our business.\nThe stock markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices for the common stock of biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies. These broad market fluctuations may cause the market price of our common stock to decline. In the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following a decline in the market price of its securities. This risk is especially relevant for us because biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies have experienced significant stock price volatility in recent years. We may become involved in this type of litigation again in the future. Litigation often is expensive and diverts management\u2019s attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter and bylaws and in Delaware law could prevent or delay a change in control of Ampio.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay, or prevent a merger or acquisition that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. These provisions include:\n\u25cf requiring supermajority stockholder voting to effect certain amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws;\n\u25cf restricting the ability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders; and\n\u25cf establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports or publish unfavorable research or reports about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us, our business, our market or our competitors. We currently have limited research coverage by securities and industry analysts. If other securities or industry analysts do not commence coverage of our company, the trading price for our stock could be negatively impacted. If one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases to cover us or fails to regularly publish reports on us, interest in our stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nWe have no plans to pay cash dividends on our common stock.\nWe have no plans to pay cash dividends on our common stock. We intend to invest future earnings, if any, to fund our growth. Any payment of future dividends will be at the discretion of our Board and will depend on, among other things, our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, level of indebtedness, statutory and contractual restrictions applying to the payment of dividends, and other considerations our Board deem relevant. Any future credit facilities or preferred stock financing we obtain may further limit our ability to pay cash dividends on our common stock.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nBusiness interruptions could limit our ability to operate our business.\nOur operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from computer viruses, human error, natural disasters, telecommunications failures, intentional acts of misappropriation, and similar events. We have not established a formal disaster recovery plan or back-up operations. Additionally, our business interruption insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for losses that occur. A significant business interruption could result in losses or damages and require us to curtail our operations.\nWhile we are not aware of any cybersecurity incidents, the cybersecurity landscape continues to evolve, and we may find it necessary to make further investments to protect our data and infrastructure.\nWe continuously work to install new, and upgrade existing, information technology systems and provide employee awareness training around phishing, malware, and other cyber risks to ensure that we are protected, to the greatest extent possible, against cyber risks and security breaches. Any actual or suspected security breach or other compromise of our security measures or those of our third-party vendors, whether as a result of hacking efforts, denial-of-service attacks, viruses, malicious software, break-ins, phishing attacks or otherwise, could harm our reputation and business, require us to expend significant capital and other resources to address the breach, and result in a violation of applicable laws, regulations or other legal obligations.\nAs cyber-attacks become more sophisticated, the need to develop our infrastructure to secure our business and customer data can lead to increased cybersecurity protection costs. Such costs may include making organizational changes, deploying additional personnel and protection technologies, training employees, and engaging third-party experts and consultants. These efforts come at the potential cost of revenues and human resources that could be utilized to continue to enhance our product offerings.\nIf our security measures are compromised, or our information technology systems or those of our CROs, CMOs, vendors, contractors, consultants, or other third party partners fail or suffer security breaches, cyber-attacks, loss or leakage of data and other disruptions, this could result in a material disruption of our development programs, compromise sensitive information related to our business or other personal information or prevent us from accessing critical information, potentially exposing us to liability, harming our reputation, or otherwise adversely affecting our business.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we may collect, process, store, and transmit proprietary, confidential, and sensitive information (including but not limited to intellectual property, trade secrets, proprietary business information, personal information, and protected health information). It is critical that we do so in a secure manner to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of such information. We depend on information technology and telecommunications systems for significant elements of our operations, and we have installed, and expect to expand, a number of enterprise software systems that affect a broad range of business processes and functional areas, including, for example, systems handling human resources, financial reporting and controls, customer relationship management, regulatory compliance, and other infrastructure operations. We face a number of risks relative to protecting this critical information, including loss of access risk, inappropriate use or disclosure, inappropriate modification, and the risk of our being unable to adequately monitor, audit, and modify our controls over our critical information. This risk extends to the third parties with whom we work, as we rely on a number of third parties to operate our critical business systems and process confidential, proprietary, and sensitive information.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, sensitive and confidential information maintained by our internal information technology systems and those of our CROs, CMOs, vendors, contractors, consultants, and other third party partners are potentially vulnerable to breakdown, service interruptions, system malfunction, accidents by our personnel or third party partners, natural disasters, terrorism, global pandemics, war and telecommunication and electrical failures, as well as security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our personnel or those of our CROs, CMOs, vendors, contractors, consultants, business partners and/or other third party partners, or from cyber-attacks by malicious third parties (including through viruses, worms, malicious code, malware, ransomware, denial-of-service attacks, social engineering and other means to affect service reliability and the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information),\nwhich may compromise our system infrastructure, or that of our CROs, CMOs, vendors, contractors, consultants, and other third party partners, or lead to data leakage.\nThe risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber-attacks or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, viruses, foreign governments, and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. The COVID-19 pandemic is generally increasing the attack surface available for exploitation, as more companies and individuals work online and work remotely, and as such, the risk of a cybersecurity incident potentially occurring, and our investment in risk mitigations against such an incident, is increasing. For example, there has been an increase in phishing and spam emails as well as social engineering attempts from \u201chackers\u201d hoping to use the recent COVID-19 pandemic to their advantage. We may not be able to anticipate all types of security threats, nor may we be able to implement preventive measures effective against all such security threats. The techniques used by cyber criminals change frequently, may not be recognized until launched, and can originate from a wide variety of sources, including outside groups such as external service providers, organized crime affiliates, terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments or agencies. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or those of our CROs, CMOs, vendors, contractors, consultants, and other third-party partners, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential, sensitive, or proprietary information, we could incur liability and reputational damage and the further development and commercialization of our product candidates, or any future product candidates, could be delayed. Any breach, loss or compromise of proprietary, sensitive, or confidential information may also subject us to civil fines and penalties, including under HIPAA and other relevant state and federal privacy laws in the United States.\nThe costs related to significant security breaches or disruptions could be material and exceed the limits of the cybersecurity insurance we maintain against such risks. If the information technology systems of our CROs, CMOs, vendors, contractors, consultants, and other third-party partners become subject to disruptions or security breaches, we may have insufficient recourse against such third parties and we may have to expend significant resources to mitigate the impact of such an event, and to develop and implement protections to prevent future events of this nature from occurring.\nWe cannot assure you that our data protection efforts and our investment in information technology will prevent significant breakdowns, data leakages, breaches in our systems, or those of our CROs, CMOs, vendors, contractors, consultants, and other third-party partners, or other cyber incidents that could have a material adverse effect upon our reputation, business, operations or financial condition. For example, if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, or those of our third-party CROs, CMOs, vendors and other contractors and consultants, it could result in a material disruption of our programs and the development of our product candidates could be delayed. In addition, the loss of clinical trial data for our product candidates could result in delays in our marketing approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. Furthermore, significant disruptions of our internal information technology systems or those of our third-party CROs, CMOs, vendors and other contractors and consultants, or security breaches could result in the loss, misappropriation and/or unauthorized access, use, or disclosure of, or the prevention of access to, confidential information (including trade secrets or other intellectual property, proprietary business information and personal information), which could result in financial, legal, business and reputational harm to us. For example, any such event that leads to unauthorized access, use, or disclosure of personal information, including personal information regarding our clinical trial subjects or personnel, could harm our reputation directly, compel us to comply with federal and/or state breach notification laws and foreign law equivalents, subject us to mandatory corrective action, and otherwise subject us to liability under laws and regulations that protect the privacy and security of personal information, which could result in significant legal and financial exposure and reputational damages that could potentially have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe are required to comply with laws, rules and regulations that require us to maintain the security of personal information. We may have contractual and other legal obligations to notify relevant stakeholders of security breaches. Failure to prevent or mitigate cyber-attacks could result in the unauthorized access to sensitive, confidential, or proprietary information. Most jurisdictions have enacted laws requiring companies to notify individuals, regulatory authorities and others of security breaches involving certain types of data. In addition, our agreements with CROs, CMOs, vendors, contractors, consultants, and other third-party partners may require us to notify them in the event of a security breach. Such mandatory disclosures are costly, could lead to negative publicity, may cause our customers to lose confidence in the effectiveness of our security measures and could require us to expend significant capital and other resources to respond to and/or alleviate problems caused by the actual or perceived security breach.\nThe costs to respond to a security breach and/or to mitigate any security vulnerabilities that may be identified could be significant, our efforts to address these issues may not be successful, and these issues could result in interruptions, delays, negative publicity, loss of customer trust, diminished use of our products as well as other harms to our business and our competitive position. Remediation of any potential security breach may involve significant time, resources, and expenses. Any security breach may result in regulatory inquiries, litigation or other investigations, and could affect our financial and operational condition.\nLitigation resulting from security breaches may adversely affect our business. Unauthorized access to our systems, networks, or physical facilities could result in litigation with our customers or other relevant stakeholders. These proceedings could force us to spend money in defense or settlement, divert management\u2019s time and attention, increase our costs of doing business, or adversely affect our reputation.\nWe may not have adequate insurance coverage for security incidents or breaches, including fines, judgments, settlements, penalties, costs, attorney fees and other impacts that arise out of incidents or breaches. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceeds available insurance coverage, or results in changes to insurance policies (including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements), could have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, we cannot be sure that our existing insurance coverage and coverage for errors and omissions will continue to be available on acceptable terms or that our insurers will not deny coverage as to any future claim. Our risks are likely to increase as we continue to expand, grow our customer base, and process, store, and transmit increasingly large amounts of proprietary and sensitive data.\nIncreased costs associated with corporate governance compliance may significantly impact our results of operations.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting, and other expenses due to our compliance with regulations and disclosure obligations applicable to us, including compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d), as well as rules implemented by the SEC, and the NYSE American. The SEC and other regulators have continued to adopt new rules and regulations and make additional changes to existing regulations that require our compliance. In July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (\u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d), was enacted. There are significant corporate governance and executive compensation related provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act that have required the SEC to adopt additional rules and regulations in these areas. Stockholder activism, the current political environment, and the current high level of government intervention and regulatory reform may lead to substantial new regulations and disclosure obligations, which may lead to additional compliance costs and impact, in ways we cannot currently anticipate, the manner in which we operate our business. Our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance programs and monitoring of public company reporting obligations, and as a result of the new corporate governance and executive compensation related rules, regulations, and guidelines prompted by the Dodd-Frank Act, and further regulations and disclosure obligations expected in the future, we will likely need to devote additional time and costs to comply with such compliance programs and rules. These rules and regulations will cause us to incur significant legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting. We continuously refine our disclosure controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that information required to be disclosed in reports under the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), is accumulated and communicated to our principal executive and financial officers. Our current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate and weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting may be discovered in the future. Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls could adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual independent registered public accounting firm attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, which we may be required to include in our periodic reports that we file with the SEC under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and could harm our operating results, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, or result in a restatement of our prior period financial statements. If we are not able to demonstrate compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our internal controls over financial reporting are not perceived as adequate, or we are unable to produce timely or accurate financial statements, investors may lose confidence in our operating results and the price of our common stock could decline.\nWe are required to comply with certain of the SEC rules that implement Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which requires management to certify financial and other information in our quarterly and annual reports and provide an annual management report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This assessment needs to include the disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by our management or our independent registered public accounting firm. During the evaluation and testing process, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting or if we are unable to complete our evaluation, testing, and any required remediation in a timely fashion, we will be unable to assert that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective.\nThese developments could make it more difficult for us to retain qualified members of our Board, qualified executive officers and/or qualified internal and independent auditors. We are presently evaluating and monitoring regulatory developments and cannot estimate the timing or magnitude of additional costs we may incur as a result. To the extent these costs are significant, our general and administrative expenses are likely to increase.", "PERMNO": 12789, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "AMPE"}
