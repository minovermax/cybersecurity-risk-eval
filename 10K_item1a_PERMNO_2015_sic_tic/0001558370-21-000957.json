In addition to the risks and uncertainties described below, we may face other risks and uncertainties, some of which may be unknown to us and some of which we may deem immaterial. The following review of important risk factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read in conjunction with other cautionary statements that are included herein or elsewhere. If one or more of these risks or uncertainties occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nSummary Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to a number of risks, including risks that may prevent us from achieving our business objectives or may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows. These risks are discussed more fully below and include, but are not limited to, risks related to:\nRisks Related to Our Operations\n\u25cf The COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u25cf A decline in coal prices;\n\u25cf Unfavorable economic and market conditions;\n\u25cf The effects of foreign and domestic trade policies;\n\u25cf Competition could put downward pressure on coal prices;\n\u25cf Our customers are continually evaluating alternative steel production technologies;\n\u25cf Any decrease in the coal consumption of electric power generators could result in less demand and lower prices for coal;\n\u25cf Our coal mining operations are subject to operating risks that are beyond our control;\n\u25cf Our inability to acquire additional coal reserves or our inability to develop coal reserves;\n\u25cf We may be unable to fund capital expenditures to maintain and grow our business;\n\u25cf Inaccuracies in our estimates of our coal reserves;\n\u25cf Credit pressures from banks, surety bond providers, or other counterparties to eliminate exposure to the coal industry;\n\u25cf Increases in the costs of mining and other industrial supplies;\n\u25cf Disruptions in the quantities of coal purchased from other third parties;\n\u25cf Changes in purchasing patterns in the coal industry;\n\u25cf Our ability to collect payments from our customers;\n\u25cf A defect in title or the loss of a leasehold interest in certain properties or surface rights;\n\u25cf The availability, reliability and cost-effectiveness of transportation facilities and fluctuations in transportation costs;\n\u25cf The loss of, or a significant reduction in, purchases by our largest customers;\n\u25cf We may incur losses as a result of certain marketing, trading and asset optimization strategies;\n\u25cf If we sustain cyber-attacks or other security breaches that disrupt our operations, or that result in the unauthorized release of proprietary or confidential information;\n\u25cf We may be unable to comply with the restrictions imposed by our Term Loan Debt Facility and other financing arrangements;\n\u25cf We may be unable to raise the funds necessary to repurchase our convertible notes for cash following a fundamental change, or to pay any cash amounts due upon conversion;\nRisks Related to Environmental, Other Regulations and Legislation\n\u25cf Extensive environmental regulations, including existing and potential future regulatory requirements relating to air emissions, affect our customers and could reduce the demand for coal as a fuel source;\n\u25cf Increase pressure from political and regulatory authorities, along with environmental activist groups, and lending and investment policies adopted by financial institutions and insurance companies to address concerns about the environmental impacts of coal combustion;\n\u25cf Our failure to obtain and renew permits necessary for our mining operations could negatively affect our business;\n\u25cf Federal or state regulatory agencies have the authority to order certain of our mines to be temporarily or permanently closed under certain circumstances;\n\u25cf Extensive environmental regulations impose significant costs on our mining operations, and future regulations could materially increase those costs or limit our ability to produce and sell coal;\n\u25cf If the assumptions underlying our estimates of reclamation and mine closure obligations are inaccurate;\n\u25cf Our operations may impact the environment or cause exposure to hazardous substances, and our properties may have environmental contamination;\n\u25cf Changes in the legal and regulatory environment could complicate or limit our business activities, increase our operating costs or result in litigation;\nRisks Related to Income Taxes\n\u25cf Our ability to use net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credits is subject to current limitation, and our ability to use net operating losses may be subject to additional limitations;\n\u25cf U.S. tax legislation may materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows;\nGeneral Risk Factors\n\u25cf International growth in our operations adds new and unique risks to our business; and\n\u25cf Our ability to operate our business effectively could be impaired if we lose key personnel or fail to attract qualified personnel.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected, and will continue to adversely affect, our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nThe coronavirus disease 2019 (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) pandemic has resulted in a widespread health crisis that has adversely affected businesses, economies and financial markets worldwide. The full impact of COVID-19 is unknown and rapidly evolving. Our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations have been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our profitability and the value of our coal reserves depend upon the prices we receive for our coal, which are largely dependent on prevailing market prices. Measures taken to address and limit the spread of the disease-such as stay-at-home orders, social distancing guidelines, and travel restrictions-have adversely affected the economies and financial markets of many countries, resulting in an economic downturn that has in turn negatively impacted, and may continue to negatively impact, global demand and prices for coal, as well as a widespread increase in unemployment that may further reduce demand and prices for coal. These conditions may lead to extreme volatility of coal prices, severely limited liquidity and credit availability and declining valuations of assets, which have adversely affected and will continue affecting our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nIn addition, the COVID-19 pandemic, and measures taken by governments, organizations, the Company and our customers to reduce its effects could potentially impact our employees, customers and suppliers. To date, multiple local, state and national governments have issued orders requiring businesses that do not conduct essential services to temporarily close their physical workplaces to employees and customers. Though we are currently deemed an essential\nbusiness and, as a result, are exempt from these orders, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and measures to prevent its spread could materially and adversely affect our businesses in a number of ways. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we experienced a significant increase in the number of COVID-19 cases in our workforce, in parallel to the trends seen in the counties in which we operate. For more information about the impact of the positive COVID-19 cases on our operations, see Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations- Operational Performance.\u201d The COVID-19 pandemic may significantly disrupt our workforce if a significant percentage of our employees are unable to work due to illness, quarantines, government actions, facility closures or fear of contracting COVID-19, which may result in more idling of continuous miner production shifts. Additionally, in the event that customers, contractors, employees or others were to allege that they contracted COVID-19, or otherwise suffered compensable losses arising out of a COVID-19 exposure or infection, because of actions we took or failed to take, we could face claims, lawsuits and potential legal liability. In addition to the reasonableness of our actions and efforts to comply with applicable COVID-19 guidance, our exposure and ultimate liability would depend upon the relationship between us and the person asserting claims, the nature of the claims asserted, applicability of workers\u2019 compensation, the availability of other insurance coverage and limitations on liability currently being considered, if enacted, at the state and federal level. Such disruptions and risks may continue or increase in the future, and could adversely affect, our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, including, but not limited to, those relating to coal prices; economic and market conditions; decreases in coal consumption; our ability to fund necessary capital expenditures; disruptions in the availability of mining and other industrial supplies; changes in purchasing patterns of our customers and their effects on our coal supply agreements; our reliance on key managers and employees; increase in cybersecurity risk due to remote working; and our ability to access the capital markets and obtain financing, insurance, and surety bonds upon favorable terms, among others.\nThe full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will impact our results is unknown and evolving, and will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. These include the severity, duration and spread of COVID-19, the success of actions taken by governments and health organizations to combat the disease and treat its effects, including additional remedial legislation, and the extent to which, and when, general economic and operating conditions recover. Accordingly, any resulting financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time but such amounts may be material.\nRisks Related to Our Operations\nCoal prices are subject to change based on a number of factors and can be volatile. If there is a decline in prices, it could materially and adversely affect our profitability and the value of our coal reserves.\nOur profitability and the value of our coal reserves depend upon the prices we receive for our coal. The contract prices we may receive in the future for coal depend upon factors beyond our control, including the following:\n\u25cf the domestic and foreign supply of and demand for coal;\n\u25cf the domestic and foreign demand for steel and electricity;\n\u25cf competition for production of steel from electric arc furnaces, which may limit demand for coking coal;\n\u25cf the quantity and quality of coal available from competitors;\n\u25cf competition for production of electricity from non-coal sources, including the price and availability of alternative fuels;\n\u25cf domestic and foreign air emission standards for coal-fueled power plants and blast furnaces and the ability to meet these standards;\n\u25cf adverse weather, climatic or other natural conditions, including unseasonable weather patterns;\n\u25cf domestic and foreign economic conditions, including economic slowdowns and the exchange rates of U.S. dollars for foreign currencies;\n\u25cf domestic and foreign legislative, regulatory and judicial developments, environmental regulatory changes or changes in energy policy and energy conservation measures that would adversely affect the coal\nindustry, such as legislation limiting carbon emissions or providing for increased funding and incentives for alternative energy sources;\n\u25cf the imposition of tariffs, quotas, trade barriers and other trade protection measures;\n\u25cf the proximity to, capacity of and cost of transportation and port facilities; and\n\u25cf technological advancements, including those related to hydrogen based steel production alternative energy sources, those intended to convert coal-to-liquids or gas and those aimed at capturing, using and storing carbon dioxide.\nDeclines in the prices we receive for our future coal sales contracts, could materially and adversely affect us by decreasing our profitability, cash flows, liquidity and the value of our coal reserves.\nUnfavorable economic and market conditions have adversely affected and may continue to affect our revenues and profitability.\nOur profitability depends, in large part, on conditions in the markets that we serve, which fluctuate in response to various factors beyond our control. The prices at which we sell our coal are largely dependent on prevailing market prices. We have experienced significant price volatility at times during the past several years as the demand for, and price of, coal has been subject to pressure for a variety of reasons, including reductions in domestic and international demand for metallurgical and thermal coal.\nWe are currently experiencing downturn related effects due to COVID-19 impacts. These conditions have, led to extreme volatility of prices, severely limited liquidity and credit availability, and resulted in declining valuations of assets. If there are downturns in economic conditions, our and our customers\u2019 businesses, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. There can be no assurance that our cost control actions and capital discipline, or any other actions that we may take, will be sufficient to offset any adverse effect these conditions may have on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe effects of foreign and domestic trade policies, actions or disputes on the level of trade among the countries and regions in which we operate could negatively impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nTrade barriers such as tariffs imposed by the United States could potentially lead to trade disputes with other foreign governments and adversely impact global economic conditions. For instance, as a result of a near term ban on Australian coal exports to China, traders and buyers have diverted cargoes into other markets around the world, including India and Europe which has negatively impacted the global demand for steel, and in turn, the demand for metallurgical coal. Further, in March 2018, the U.S. imposed a 25% tariff on all imported steel into the United States which could negatively impact the global demand for steel, and in turn, the demand for metallurgical coal. In addition, continued or worsening U.S.-China trade tensions may result in additional tariffs or other protectionist measures that materially, adversely affect foreign demand for our coal.\nIn addition, potential changes to international trade agreements, trade policies, trade concessions or other political and economic arrangements may benefit coal producers operating in countries other than the United States. We may not be able to compete on the basis of price or other factors with companies that in the future benefit from favorable foreign trade policies or other arrangements.\nCompetition could put downward pressure on coal prices and, as a result, materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nWe compete with numerous other domestic and foreign coal producers for domestic and international sales. Overcapacity and increased production within the coal industry, both domestically and internationally, and decelerating steel demand have at times, and could in the future, materially reduce coal prices and therefore materially reduce our revenues and profitability. In addition, our ability to ship our coal to international customers depends on port capacity, which is limited. Increased competition within the coal industry for international sales could result in us not being able to obtain throughput capacity at port facilities, or the rates for such throughput capacity increasing to a point where it is not economically feasible to export our coal.\nThe domestic coal industry has experienced consolidation in recent years, including consolidation among some of our major competitors. In addition, substantial overcapacity exists in the thermal coal industry and several other large coal companies have also filed, and others may file, bankruptcy proceedings which could enable them to lower their production costs and thereby reduce the price for coal. Consolidation in the coal industry or current or future bankruptcy proceedings of our coal competitors could adversely affect our competitive position.\nIn addition to competing with other coal producers, we compete generally with producers of other fuels, such as natural gas and subsidized renewables. Natural gas pricing has declined significantly in recent years. The decline in the price of natural gas has caused demand for coal to decrease and adversely affected the price of our coal. Sustained periods of low natural gas prices have also contributed to utilities phasing out or closing existing coal-fired power plants and continued low prices could eliminate construction of any new coal-fired power plants. This trend has, and could continue to have, a material adverse effect on demand and prices for our coal. Moreover, the construction of new pipelines and other natural gas distribution channels may increase competition within regional markets and thereby decrease the demand for and price of our coal.\nOur customers are continually evaluating alternative steel production technologies, which may reduce demand for our product.\nOur metallurgical coal is a premium High-Vol metallurgical coal for blast furnace steel producers. Premium High-Vol metallurgical coal commands a significant price premium over other forms of coal because of its value in use in blast furnaces for steel production. Premium High-Vol metallurgical coal is a scarce commodity and has specific physical and chemical properties which are necessary for efficient blast furnace operation. Alternative technologies are continually being investigated and developed with a view to reducing production costs or for other reasons, such as minimizing environmental or social impact. If competitive technologies emerge or are increasingly utilized that use other materials in place of our product or that diminish the required amount of our product, such as electric arc furnaces or pulverized coal injection processes, demand and price for our met coal might fall. Many of these alternative technologies are designed to use lower quality coals or other sources of carbon instead of higher cost High-Vol metallurgical coal. While conventional blast furnace technology has been the most economic large-scale steel production technology for a number of years, and while emergent technologies typically take many years to commercialize, there can be no assurance that over the longer term competitive technologies not reliant on High-Vol metallurgical coal could emerge which could reduce demand and price premiums for High-Vol metallurgical coal.\nAny decrease in the coal consumption of electric power generators could result in less demand and lower prices for coal, which could materially and adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.\nThermal coal accounted for 91% of our coal sales by volume and 56% of the coal sales revenue during 2020. The majority of these sales were to electric power generators. The amount of coal consumed for electric power generation is affected primarily by the overall demand for electricity, the availability, quality and price of competing fuels (particularly natural gas) for power generation and governmental regulations which may dictate an alternate source of fuel regardless of economics. Overall economic activity and the associated demand for power by industrial users can have significant effects on overall electricity demand and can be impacted by a number of factors. An economic slowdown can significantly slow the growth of electricity demand and could result in reduced demand for coal. For example, declines in the rate of growth currently being experienced related to the effects due to COVID-19 in countries such as China, India or other developing countries could further negatively impact the demand for U.S. coal and result in a continuing oversupply of coal in the marketplace. Weather patterns can also greatly affect electricity demand. Extreme temperatures, both hot and cold, cause increased power usage and, therefore, increase generating requirements from all sources. Mild temperatures, on the other hand, result in lower electrical demand, which allows generators to choose the source of power generation that is most cost efficient.\nGas-fueled generation has the potential to displace coal-fueled generation, particularly from older, less efficient coal-powered generators and this has occurred to date. We expect that many of the new power plants constructed in the United States to meet increasing demand for electricity generation will be fueled by natural gas because gas-fired plants are cheaper to construct and permits to construct these plants are easier to obtain as natural gas combustion is seen as having a lower environmental impact than coal combustion. In addition, state and federal mandates for increased use of\nelectricity from renewable energy sources also have an impact on the market for our coal. Several states have enacted legislative mandates requiring electricity suppliers to use renewable energy sources to generate a certain percentage of power. There have been numerous proposals to establish a similar uniform national standard, although none of these proposals have been enacted to date. The costs of certain renewable energy sources have become increasingly competitive to coal, and possible advances in technologies and incentives, such as tax credits, to enhance the economics of renewable energy sources could make these sources even more competitive. Any reduction in the amount of coal consumed by electric power generators could reduce the price of coal that we mine and sell, thereby reducing our revenues and materially and adversely affecting our business and results of operations.\nOur coal mining operations are subject to operating risks that are beyond our control, which could result in materially increased operating expenses and decreased production levels and could materially and adversely affect our profitability.\nWe conduct underground and surface mining operations. Certain factors beyond our control, including those listed below, could disrupt our coal mining operations, adversely affect production and shipments and increase our operating costs:\n\u25cf poor mining conditions resulting from geological, hydrologic or other conditions that may cause instability of highwalls or spoil piles or cause damage to nearby infrastructure or mine personnel;\n\u25cf a major incident at the mine site that causes all or part of the operations of the mine to cease for some period of time;\n\u25cf mining, processing and plant equipment failures and unexpected maintenance problems;\n\u25cf adverse weather and natural disasters, such as heavy rains or snow, flooding and other natural events affecting operations, transportation or customers, and public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u25cf the unavailability of raw materials, equipment (including heavy mobile equipment) or other critical supplies such as tires, explosives, fuel, lubricants and other consumables of the type, quantity and/or size needed to meet production expectations;\n\u25cf unexpected or accidental surface subsidence from underground mining;\n\u25cf accidental mine water discharges, fires, explosions or similar mining accidents;\n\u25cf delays or closures by third-parties that transport coal shipments; and\n\u25cf competition and/or conflicts with other natural resource extraction activities and production within our operating areas, such as coalbed methane extraction or oil and gas development.\nIf any of these conditions or events occurs, particularly at our Black Thunder and Leer mining complexes, which accounted for approximately 86% of the coal volume we sold and 70% of the revenue we generated in 2020, our coal mining operations may be disrupted and we could experience a delay or halt of production or shipments or our operating costs could increase significantly. In addition, if our insurance coverage is limited or excludes certain of these conditions or events, then we may not be able to recover for losses incurred as a result of such conditions or events, some of which may be substantial.\nOur inability to acquire additional coal reserves or our inability to develop coal reserves in an economically feasible manner may adversely affect our business.\nOur profitability depends substantially on our ability to mine and process, in a cost-effective manner, coal reserves that possess the quality characteristics desired by our customers. As we mine, our coal reserves deplete. As a result, our future success depends upon our ability to obtain, through acquisition or development of owned reserves, coal that is economically recoverable. If we fail to acquire or develop additional coal reserves, our existing reserves will eventually be depleted. We may not be able to obtain replacement reserves when we require them. If available, replacement reserves may not be available at favorable prices, or we may not be capable of mining those reserves at costs that are comparable with our existing coal reserves. In certain locations, leases for oil, natural gas and coalbed methane reserves are located on, or adjacent to, some of our reserves, potentially creating conflicting interests between us and lessees of those interests. Other lessees\u2019 rights relating to these mineral interests could prevent, delay or increase\nthe cost of developing our coal reserves. These lessees may also seek damages from us based on claims that our coal mining operations impair their interests.\nOur ability to obtain coal reserves in the future could also be limited by the availability of cash we generate from our operations or available financing, restrictions under our existing or future financing arrangements, competition from other coal producers, opportunities or the inability to acquire coal properties on commercially reasonable terms. Increased opposition from non-governmental organizations and other third parties may also lengthen, delay or adversely impact the acquisition process. If we are unable to acquire replacement reserves, our future production may decrease significantly and our operating results may be negatively affected. In addition, we may not be able to mine future reserves as profitably as we do at our current operations.\nTo maintain and grow our business, we will be required to make substantial capital expenditures which we may be unable to fund.\nOur business plan and strategy require substantial capital expenditures. Maintaining mines, expanding mines and related infrastructure and developing new mines such as Leer South are capital intensive. Specifically, the exploration, permitting and development of metallurgical coal reserves, the maintenance of machinery, equipment and facilities and compliance with safety, health and environmental laws and regulations require ongoing capital expenditures. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our production levels or generate sufficient cash flow, or that we will have access to sufficient financing to continue our production, exploration, permitting and development activities at or above our present levels and on our current or projected timelines, and we may be required to defer all or a portion of our capital expenditures. If we do not make sufficient or effective capital expenditures, we will be unable to maintain and grow our business. To fund our capital expenditures, we will be required to use cash from our operations, incur debt or sell additional equity securities. Our ability to obtain financing or our ability to access the capital markets for future equity or debt offerings may be limited by our financial condition at the time of any such financing or offering and the covenants in our existing debt agreements, as well as by general economic conditions, contingencies and uncertainties that are beyond our control. Our results of operations, business and financial condition may be materially adversely affected if we cannot make such capital expenditures.\nInaccuracies in our estimates of our coal reserves could result in decreased profitability from lower than expected revenues or higher than expected costs.\nOur future performance depends on, among other things, the accuracy of our estimates of our proven and probable coal reserves. We base our estimates of reserves on engineering, economic and geological data assembled, analyzed and reviewed by internal and third-party engineers and consultants. We update our estimates of the quantity and quality of proven and probable coal reserves annually to reflect the production of coal from the reserves, updated geological models and mining recovery data, the tonnage contained in new lease areas acquired and estimated costs of production and sales prices. There are numerous factors and assumptions inherent in estimating the quantities and qualities of, and costs to mine, coal reserves, including many factors beyond our control, including the following:\n\u25cf quality of the coal;\n\u25cf geological and mining conditions, which may not be fully identified by available exploration data and/or may differ from our experiences in areas where we currently mine;\n\u25cf the percentage of coal ultimately recoverable;\n\u25cf the assumed effects of regulation, including the issuance of required permits, taxes, including severance and excise taxes, and royalties, and other payments to governmental agencies;\n\u25cf assumptions concerning the timing for the development of the reserves;\n\u25cf assumptions concerning physical access to the reserves; and\n\u25cf assumptions concerning equipment and productivity, future coal prices, operating costs, including for critical supplies such as fuel, tires and explosives, capital expenditures and development and reclamation costs.\nAs a result, estimates of the quantities and qualities of economically recoverable coal attributable to any particular group of properties, classifications of reserves based on risk of recovery, estimated cost of production and\nestimates of future net cash flows expected from these properties as prepared by different engineers, or by the same engineers at different times, may vary materially due to changes in the above factors and assumptions. Actual production recovered from identified reserve areas and properties, and revenues and expenditures associated with our mining operations, may vary materially from estimates. Any inaccuracy in our estimates related to our reserves could result in decreased profitability from lower than expected revenues and/or higher than expected costs.\nThe coal industry has experienced increased credit pressures that could result in additional decisions by banks, surety bond providers, or other counterparties to reduce or eliminate their exposure to the coal industry, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur financial assurance obligations may increase or become more costly due to a number of factors, and surety bonds and letters of credit may not be available to us, particularly in light of some banks and insurance companies\u2019 announced unwillingness to support thermal coal companies. Alternative forms of financial assurance such as self-bonding are generally not available today and may be further restricted or eliminated in the future. Our failure to retain, or inability to obtain surety bonds, bank guarantees or letters of credit, or to provide a suitable alternative, could have a material adverse effect on us. That failure could result from a variety of factors including the following:\n\u25cf lack of availability, higher expense or unfavorable market terms of new surety bonds, bank guarantees or letters of credit; and\n\u25cf inability to provide or fund collateral for current and future third-party issuers of surety bonds, bank guarantees or letters of credit.\nBecause we are required by federal and state law to have these bonds in place before mining can commence or continue, our failure to maintain surety bonds, letters of credit or other guarantees or security arrangements would materially and adversely affect our ability to mine or lease coal. Although some of these credit pressures may be company-specific, many are directed to the coal industry in general due to the current overall negative sentiment toward the thermal coal industry.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had posted an aggregate of approximately $646.7 million in surety bonds and $85.5 million of letters of credit outstanding. Any further issuances of letters of credit to satisfy the increased collateral demands or any replacement bonds would immediately reduce the borrowing capacity under the Extended Securitization Facility and Inventory Facility.\nIncreases in the costs of mining and other industrial supplies, including steel-based supplies, diesel fuel and rubber tires, or the inability to obtain a sufficient quantity of those supplies, could negatively affect our operating costs or disrupt or delay our production.\nOur coal mining operations use significant amounts of steel, diesel fuel, explosives, rubber tires and other mining and industrial supplies. The cost of roof bolts we use in our underground mining operations depends on the price of scrap steel. We also use significant amounts of diesel fuel and tires for trucks and other heavy machinery, particularly at our Black Thunder mining complex. There has been some consolidation in the supplier base providing mining materials to the coal industry, such as suppliers of explosives in the U.S. and suppliers of both surface and underground equipment globally, that has limited the number of sources for these materials. If the prices of mining and other industrial supplies, particularly steel based supplies, diesel fuel and rubber tires, increase, our operating costs could be negatively affected. In addition, if we are unable to procure these supplies, our coal mining operations may be disrupted or we could experience a delay or halt in our production.\nDisruptions in the quantities of coal purchased from other third parties could temporarily impair our ability to fill customer orders or increase our operating costs.\nWe purchase coal from third parties that we sell to our customers. Operational difficulties at mines operated by third parties from whom we purchase coal, changes in demand from other coal producers and other factors beyond our control could affect the availability, pricing, and quality of coal purchased by us. Disruptions in the quantities of coal purchased by us could impair our ability to fill our customer orders or require us to purchase coal from other sources in\norder to satisfy those orders. If we are unable to fill a customer order or if we are required to purchase coal from other sources at higher prices and/or lower quality, in order to satisfy a customer order, we could lose existing customers and our operating costs could increase.\nOur profitability depends upon the coal supply agreements we have with our customers. Changes in purchasing patterns in the coal industry could make it difficult for us to extend our existing coal supply agreements or to enter into new agreements in the future.\nThe success of our businesses depends on our ability to retain our current customers, renew our existing customer contracts and solicit new customers. Our ability to do so generally depends on a variety of factors, including the quality and price of our products, our ability to market these products effectively, our ability to deliver on a timely basis and the level of competition that we face. If current customers do not honor current contract commitments, or if they terminate agreements or exercise force majeure provisions allowing for the temporary suspension of performance, our revenues will be adversely affected. Changes in the coal industry may cause some of our customers not to renew, extend or enter into new coal supply agreements or to enter into agreements to purchase fewer tons of coal or on different terms or prices than in the past. In addition, uncertainty caused by federal and state regulations, including under the U.S. Clean Air Act, could deter our customers from entering into coal supply agreements. Also, the availability and price of competing fuels, such as natural gas, could influence the volume of coal a customer is willing to purchase under contract.\nOur coal supply agreements typically contain force majeure provisions allowing the parties to temporarily suspend performance during specified events beyond their control. Most of our coal supply agreements also contain provisions requiring us to deliver coal that satisfies certain quality specifications, such as heat value, sulfur content, ash content, volatile matter, hardness and ash fusion temperature among others. These provisions in our coal supply agreements could result in negative economic consequences to us, including price adjustments, having to purchase replacement coal in a higher-priced open market, the rejection of deliveries or, in the extreme, contract termination. Our profitability may be negatively affected if we are unable to seek protection during adverse economic conditions or if we incur financial or other economic penalties as a result of these provisions of our coal supply agreements. For more information about our long-term coal supply agreements, you should see the section entitled \u201cLong-Term Coal Supply Arrangements\u201d under Item 1.\nOur ability to collect payments from our customers could be impaired if their creditworthiness deteriorates, and our financial position could be materially and adversely affected by the bankruptcy of any of our significant customers.\nOur ability to receive payment for coal sold and delivered depends on the continued creditworthiness of our customers. If we determine that a customer is not creditworthy, we may be able to withhold delivery under the customer\u2019s coal sales contract. If this occurs, we may decide to sell the customer\u2019s coal on the spot market, which may be at prices lower than the contracted price, or we may be unable to sell the coal at all. Furthermore, the bankruptcy of any of our significant customers could materially and adversely affect our financial position.\nIn addition, our customer base may change with deregulation as utilities sell their power plants to their non-regulated affiliates or third parties that may be less creditworthy, thereby increasing the risk we bear for customer payment default. Some power plant owners may have credit ratings that are below investment grade, or may become below investment grade after we enter into contracts with them. Furthermore, our metallurgical customers operate in a highly competitive and cyclical industry where their creditworthiness could deteriorate rapidly. In addition, competition with other coal suppliers could force us to extend credit to customers and on terms that could increase the risk of payment default. Customers in other countries may also be subject to other pressures and uncertainties that may affect their ability to pay, including trade barriers, exchange controls and local economic and political conditions.\nA defect in title or the loss of a leasehold interest in certain properties or surface rights could limit our ability to mine our coal reserves or result in significant unanticipated costs.\nWe conduct a significant part of our coal mining operations on properties that we lease. A title defect or the loss of a lease or surface rights could adversely affect our ability to mine the associated coal reserves. We may not verify title\nto our leased properties or associated coal reserves until we have committed to developing those properties or coal reserves. We may not commit to develop properties or coal reserves until we have obtained necessary permits and completed exploration. As such, the title to properties that we intend to lease or coal reserves that we intend to mine may contain defects prohibiting our ability to conduct mining operations. Similarly, our leasehold interests may be subject to superior property rights of other third parties. In order to conduct our mining operations on properties where these defects exist, we may incur unanticipated costs. In addition, some leases require us to produce a minimum quantity of coal and require us to pay minimum production royalties. Our inability to satisfy those requirements may cause the leasehold interest to terminate.\nThe availability, reliability and cost-effectiveness of transportation facilities and fluctuations in transportation costs could affect the demand for our coal or impair our ability to supply coal to our customers.\nWe depend upon barge, ship, rail, truck and belt transportation systems, as well as seaborne vessels and port facilities, to deliver coal to our customers. Disruptions in transportation services due to weather-related problems, mechanical difficulties, strikes, lockouts, bottlenecks, route closures and other events beyond our control could impair our ability to supply coal to our customers. Since we do not have long-term contracts with all transportation providers we utilize, decreased performance levels over longer periods of time could cause our customers to look to other sources for their coal needs. In addition, increases in transportation costs, including the price of gasoline and diesel fuel, could make coal a less competitive source of energy when compared to alternative fuels or could make coal produced in one region of the United States less competitive than coal produced in other regions of the United States or abroad. If we experience disruptions in our transportation services or if transportation costs increase significantly and we are unable to find alternative transportation providers, our coal mining operations may be disrupted, we could experience a delay or halt of production or our profitability could decrease significantly. In addition, a growing portion of our coal sales in recent years has been into export markets, and we are actively seeking additional international customers. Our ability to maintain and grow our export sales revenue and margins depends on a number of factors, including the existence of sufficient and cost-effective export terminal capacity for the shipment of coal to foreign markets. At present, there is limited terminal capacity for the export of coal into foreign markets. Our access to existing and future terminal capacity may be adversely affected by, among other factors, regulatory and permit requirements, environmental and other legal challenges, public perceptions and resulting political pressures, foreign and domestic trade policies, operational issues at terminals and competition among domestic coal producers for access to limited terminal capacity. If we are unable to maintain terminal capacity, or are unable to access additional future terminal capacity for the export of our coal on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, our results could be materially and adversely affected.\nFrom time to time we enter into \u201ctake or pay\u201d contracts for rail and port capacity related to our export sales. These contracts require us to pay for a minimum quantity of coal to be transported on the railway or through the port regardless of whether we sell and ship any coal. If we fail to acquire sufficient export sales to meet our minimum obligations under these contracts, we are still obligated to make payments to the railway or port facility, which could have a negative impact on our cash flows, profitability and results of operations.\nThe loss of, or a significant reduction in, purchases by our largest customers could adversely affect our profitability.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, we derived approximately 21% of our total coal revenues from sales to our three largest customers and approximately 45% of our total coal revenues from sales to our ten largest customers. If any of those customers, particularly any of our three largest customers, were to significantly reduce the quantities of coal it purchases from us, or if we are unable to sell coal to those customers on terms as favorable to us, it may have an adverse impact on the results of our business.\nWe may incur losses as a result of certain marketing, trading and asset optimization strategies.\nWe seek to optimize our coal production and leverage our knowledge of the coal industry through a variety of marketing, trading and other asset optimization strategies. We maintain a system of complementary processes and controls designed to monitor and control our exposure to market and other risks as a consequence of these strategies. These processes and controls seek to balance our ability to profit from certain marketing, trading and asset optimization strategies with our exposure to potential losses. Our risk monitoring and mitigation techniques, and accompanying\njudgments cannot anticipate every potential outcome or the timing of such outcomes. In addition, the processes and controls that we use to manage our exposure to market and other risks resulting from these strategies involve assumptions about the degrees of correlation or lack thereof among prices of various assets or other market indicators. These correlations may change significantly in times of market turbulence or other unforeseen circumstances. As a result, we may experience volatility in our earnings as a result of our marketing, trading and asset optimization strategies.\nIf we sustain cyber-attacks or other security breaches that disrupt our operations, or that result in the unauthorized release of proprietary or confidential information, we could be exposed to significant liability, reputational harm, loss of revenue, increased costs or other risks.\nWe have become increasingly dependent on information technology systems to operate our business and to comply with regulatory, legal and tax requirements. As our dependence on digital technologies has increased, the risk of cyber incidents, including both deliberate attacks and unintentional events, also has increased. A cyber-attack may involve persons gaining unauthorized access to our digital systems or systems maintained on our behalf for purposes of gathering, monitoring, releasing, misappropriating or corrupting proprietary or confidential information, or causing operational disruption. In addition, certain cyber incidents, such as surveillance, may remain undetected for an extended period. Strategic targets, such as energy-related assets, may be at greater risk of future cyber-attacks than other targets in the United States.\nTo date, we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyber incidents. However, our systems may be susceptible to cyber incidents or security breaches which could result in unauthorized access to our facilities or to information we are trying to protect. Failure of our systems, whether caused maliciously or inadvertently, may lead to unauthorized physical access to one or more of our facilities or locations, or electronic access to our proprietary or confidential information and could result in, among other things, unfavorable publicity, litigation by parties affected by such breach, disruptions to our operations, loss of customers and financial obligations that may not be covered by our insurance for damages, fines or penalties related to the theft, release or misuse of such information, any of which could have a substantial impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flow. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any system vulnerabilities.\nWe may be unable to comply with the restrictions imposed by our Term Loan Debt Facility and other financing arrangements.\nThe agreements governing our outstanding financing arrangements impose a number of restrictions on us. For example, the terms of our credit facilities, leases and other financing arrangements contain financial and other covenants that may create limitations on our ability to borrow the full amount under our credit facilities, effect acquisitions or dispositions and incur additional debt and require us to comply with various affirmative covenants. The Term Loan Debt Facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, which include restrictions on (i) indebtedness, (ii) liens, (iii) liquidations, mergers, consolidations and acquisitions, (iv) disposition of assets or subsidiaries, (v) affiliate transactions, (vi) creation or ownership of certain subsidiaries, partnerships and joint ventures, (vii) continuation of or change in business, (viii) restricted payments, (ix) prepayment of subordinated and junior lien indebtedness, (x) restrictions in agreements on dividends, intercompany loans and granting liens on collateral, (xi) loans and investments, (xii) sale and leaseback transactions, (xiii) changes in organizational documents and fiscal year and (xiv) transactions with respect to bonding subsidiaries. Our ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control and our failure to comply could result in an event of default under the Term Loan Debt Facility.\nWe may be unable to raise the funds necessary to repurchase our Convertible Notes for cash following a fundamental change, or to pay any cash amounts due upon conversion, and our other indebtedness limits our ability to repurchase the notes or pay cash upon their conversion.\nConvertible noteholders may, subject to a limited exception, require us to repurchase their notes following a fundamental change (including certain delisting events that we elect to treat as the occurrence of a fundamental change) at a cash repurchase price generally equal to the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and\nunpaid interest, if any. In addition, upon conversion we will satisfy part or all of our conversion obligation in cash unless we elect to settle conversions solely in shares of our common stock. We may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to repurchase the notes or pay the cash amounts due upon conversion. In addition, applicable law, regulatory authorities and the agreements governing our other indebtedness may restrict our ability to repurchase the notes or pay the cash amounts due upon conversion. Our failure to repurchase notes or to pay the cash amounts due upon conversion when required would constitute a default under the indenture. A default under the indenture or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our other indebtedness, and may result in that other indebtedness becoming immediately payable in full. We may not have sufficient funds to satisfy all amounts due under the other indebtedness and the notes.\nRisks Related to Environmental, Other Regulations and Legislation\nExtensive environmental regulations, including existing and potential future regulatory requirements relating to air emissions, affect our customers and could reduce the demand for coal as a fuel source and cause coal prices and sales of our coal to materially decline.\nCoal contains impurities, including but not limited to sulfur, mercury, chlorine and other elements or compounds, many of which are released into the air when coal is burned. The operations of our customers are subject to extensive environmental regulation particularly with respect to air emissions. For example, the federal Clean Air Act and similar state and local laws extensively regulate the amount of sulfur dioxide, particulate matter, nitrogen oxide, and other compounds emitted into the air from electric power plants, which are the largest end-users of our coal. A series of more stringent requirements relating to particulate matter, ozone, haze, mercury, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and other air pollutants may be developed and implemented. For instance, the Clean Power Plan, if implemented in the form promulgated under the Obama administration, would severely limit emissions of carbon dioxide which would adversely affect our ability to sell coal. However, in April 2017, the EPA announced that it was initiating a review of the Clean Power Plan consistent with President Trump\u2019s Executive Order 13783, and, in October 2017, the EPA published a proposed rule to formally repeal the Clean Power Plan. In June 2019, the EPA issued the final Affordable Clean Energy rule, which revises the agency\u2019s interpretation of Clean Air Act section 111(d). The EPA rule offers the power generation industry incentives to invest in coal-fired power plants and provides guidelines for reducing carbon dioxide emissions by making on-site \u201cheat rate improvements.\u201d On January 19, 2021, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the Affordable Clean Energy rule and its implied repeal of the Clean Power Plan, remanding to EPA for further proceedings. In the event the matter is not heard by the Supreme Court, it is not clear whether EPA will reinstate the Clean Power Plan or undertake new rulemaking.\nIn addition, the change in presidential administration could result in a further shift in policy by the EPA. In December 2015, the United States and 195 other countries reached an agreement (the \u201cParis Agreement\u201d) during the 21st Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, a long-term, international framework convention designed to address climate change over the next several decades. The Trump administration formally withdrew the United States from the Paris Agreement, effective November 2020. However, the Biden administration issued an executive order on January 21, 2021, that, among other things, commenced the process of reentering the Paris Agreement. The terms on which the United States may reenter the Paris Agreement, including its emissions pledges, are uncertain at this time. However, any efforts to control and/or reduce greenhouse gas emissions by the United States or other countries that have also pledged \u201cNationally Determined Contributions,\u201d or concerted conservation efforts that result in reduced electricity consumption, could adversely impact coal prices, our ability to sell coal and, in turn, our financial position and results of operations.\nIn addition, the January 21, 2021, executive order also directed all federal agencies to review and take action to address any federal regulations, orders, guidance documents, policies and any similar agency actions promulgated during the prior administration that may be inconsistent with the administration\u2019s policies. The executive order also established an Interagency Working Group on the Social Cost of Greenhouse Gases (\u201cWorking Group\u201d), which is called on to, among other things, develop methodologies for calculating the \u201csocial cost of carbon,\u201d \u201csocial cost of nitrous oxide\u201d and \u201csocial cost of methane.\u201d Recommendations from the Working Group are due beginning June 1, 2021 and final recommendations no later than January 2022. The Biden administration issued a second executive order on January 27, 2021, focused on addressing climate change. Further regulation of air emissions at the federal level, as well as\nuncertainty regarding the future course of federal regulation, could reduce demand for coal and negatively impact our financial position and results of operations.\nWe are also subject to state and local regulations, which may be more stringent than federal rules. For example, certain United States cities and states have announced their intention to satisfy their proportionate obligations under the Paris Agreement. In addition, almost one-half of states have taken measures to track and reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, and some states have elected to participate in voluntary regional cap-and-trade programs like the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative in the northeastern United States. State and local governments may pass laws mandating the use of alternative energy sources, such as wind power and solar energy, which may decrease demand for our coal products. State and local commitments and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nConsiderable uncertainty is associated with these air emissions initiatives, and the content of regulatory requirements in the United States and other countries continues to evolve and develop, which could require significant emissions control expenditures for many coal-fueled power plants. As a result, these power plants may switch to other fuels that generate fewer of these emissions, may install more effective pollution control equipment that reduces the need for low sulfur coal, or may cease operations, possibly reducing future demand for coal and a reduced need to construct new coal-fueled power plants. Any switching of fuel sources away from coal, closure of existing coal-fired plants or reduced construction of new plants could have a material adverse effect on demand for and prices received for our coal. Alternatively, less stringent air emissions limitations, particularly related to sulfur, to the extent enacted, could make low sulfur coal less attractive, which could also have a material adverse effect on the demand for and prices received for our coal.\nYou should see Item 1, \u201cEnvironmental and Other Regulatory Matters\u201d for more information about the various governmental regulations affecting the market for our products.\nThe demand for our products and market for our securities, as well as our ability to access the capital markets and obtain financing and insurance upon favorable terms may be significantly impacted by increased pressure from political and regulatory authorities, along with environmental activist groups, and lending and investment policies adopted by financial institutions and insurance companies to address concerns about the environmental impacts of coal combustion, including perceived impacts on the global climate. These activities and developments may potentially materially and adversely impact our future financial results, liquidity and growth prospects.\nConcerns about the environmental impacts of coal combustion are resulting in increased regulation in many jurisdictions, unfavorable lending policies by government-backed lending institutions and development banks and divestment efforts affecting the investment community, which could significantly affect demand for our products or our securities. Global climate issues continue to attract significant public and scientific attention. For example, the Fourth and Fifth Assessment Reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change have expressed concern about the impacts of human activity, especially from fossil fuel combustion, on the global climate. As a result of the public and scientific attention, several governmental bodies increasingly are focusing on climate issues and, more specifically, levels of emissions of carbon dioxide from coal combustion by power plants. The Clean Power Plan would severely limit emissions of carbon dioxide, possibly reducing future demand for coal. However, as discussed above, the EPA has sought to replace the Clean Power Plan with the Affordable Clean Energy rule. On January 19, 2021, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the Affordable Clean Energy rule and its implied repeal of the Clean Power Plan, remanding to EPA for further proceedings; as such, and given that the change in presidential administration could result in a further shift in policy by the EPA, the future of that rule and the Clean Power Plan is uncertain. Additionally, a number of governments pledged to control and reduce greenhouse gas emissions under the Paris Agreement, which may impact demand for coal resources. The Biden administration issued an executive order on January 21, 2021, that, among other things, commenced the process of reentering the Paris Agreement.\nFuture regulation of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States could occur pursuant to future treaty obligations, statutory or regulatory changes at the federal, state or local level or otherwise. The enactment of laws or the passage of regulations regarding greenhouse gas emissions from the combustion of coal by the U.S., some of its states or other countries, or other actions to limit emissions have resulted in, and may continue to result in, electricity generators\nswitching from coal to other fuel sources or coal-fueled power plant closures. Further, policies limiting available financing for the development of new coal-fueled power plants could adversely impact the global demand for coal in the future. You should see Item 1, \u201cEnvironmental and Other Regulatory Matters-Climate Change\u201d for more information about governmental regulations relating to greenhouse gas emissions.\nThere have been recent efforts by members of the general financial and investment communities, such as investment advisors, sovereign wealth funds, public pension funds, universities and other groups, to divest themselves and to promote the divestment of securities issued by companies involved in the fossil fuel extraction market, such as coal producers. In California, for example, legislation was signed into law in October 2015 requiring California\u2019s state pension funds to divest investments in companies that generate 50% or more of their revenue from coal mining. Also, in December 2017, the Governor of New York announced that the New York Common Fund would immediately cease all new investments in entities with \u201csignificant fossil fuel activities,\u201d and the World Bank announced that it would no longer finance upstream oil and gas after 2019, except in \u201cexceptional circumstances.\u201d Other activist campaigns have urged banks to cease financing coal-driven businesses. As a result, numerous banks, other financing sources and insurance companies have taken actions to limit available financing and insurance coverage for the development of new coal-fueled power plants and coal mines and utilities that derive a majority of their revenue from thermal coal. However, in January 2021, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, a top federal banking regulator, issued a final rule that would require banks to provide \u201cfair access\u201d to financial services to companies regardless of industry. The final rule, set to take effect April 1, 2021, is targeted at major financial institutions that have made pledges not to lend to the fossil fuel industry. The final rule has not yet been published in the Federal Register, and its future is uncertain given the change in presidential administration. The impact of efforts to divest or promote the divestment from the fossil fuel extraction market may adversely affect the demand for and price of our securities and impact our access to the capital and financial markets.\nAny future laws, regulations or other policies of the nature described above may adversely impact our business in material ways. The degree to which any particular law, regulation or policy impacts us will depend on several factors, including the substantive terms involved, the relevant time periods for enactment and any related transition periods. We routinely attempt to evaluate the potential impact on us of any proposed laws, regulations or policies, which requires that we make several material assumptions. From time to time, we determine that the impact of one or more such laws, regulations or policies, if adopted and ultimately implemented as proposed, may result in materially adverse impacts on our operations, financial condition or cash flow. In general, it is likely that any future laws, regulations or other policies aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions will negatively impact demand for our coal.\nOur failure to obtain and renew permits necessary for our mining operations could negatively affect our business.\nMining companies must obtain numerous permits that impose strict regulations on various environmental and operational matters in connection with coal mining. These include permits issued by various federal, state and local agencies and regulatory bodies. The permitting rules, and the interpretations of these rules, are complex, change frequently and are often subject to discretionary interpretations by the regulators, all of which may make compliance more difficult or impractical, and may possibly preclude the continuance of ongoing operations or the development of future mining operations. The public, including non-governmental organizations, anti-mining groups and individuals, have certain statutory rights to comment upon and submit objections to requested permits and environmental impact statements prepared in connection with applicable regulatory processes, and otherwise engage in the permitting process, including bringing citizens\u2019 lawsuits to challenge the issuance of permits, the validity of environmental impact statements or the performance of mining activities. Accordingly, required permits may not be issued or renewed in a timely fashion or at all, or permits issued or renewed may be conditioned in a manner that may restrict our ability to efficiently and economically conduct our mining activities, any of which would materially reduce our production, cash flow and profitability.\nFederal or state regulatory agencies have the authority to order certain of our mines to be temporarily or permanently closed under certain circumstances, which could materially and adversely affect our ability to meet our customers\u2019 demands.\nFederal or state regulatory agencies have the authority, under certain circumstances following significant health and safety incidents, such as fatalities, to order a mine to be temporarily or permanently closed. If this occurred, we may\nbe required to incur capital expenditures to re-open the mine. In the event that these agencies order the closing of our mines, our coal sales contracts generally permit us to issue force majeure notices which suspend our obligations to deliver coal under these contracts. However, our customers may challenge our issuances of force majeure notices. If these challenges are successful, we may have to purchase coal from third-party sources, if it is available, to fulfill these obligations, incur capital expenditures to re-open the mines and/or negotiate settlements with the customers, which may include price reductions, the reduction of commitments, the extension of time for delivery or the termination of customers\u2019 contracts. Any of these actions could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nExtensive environmental regulations impose significant costs on our mining operations, and future regulations could materially increase those costs or limit our ability to produce and sell coal.\nThe coal mining industry is subject to increasingly strict regulation by federal, state and local authorities with respect to environmental matters such as:\n\u25cf limitations on land use;\n\u25cf mine permitting and licensing requirements;\n\u25cf reclamation and restoration of mining properties after mining is completed and required surety bonds or other instruments to secure those reclamation and restoration obligations;\n\u25cf management of materials generated by mining operations;\n\u25cf the storage, treatment and disposal of wastes;\n\u25cf remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater;\n\u25cf air quality standards;\n\u25cf water pollution;\n\u25cf protection of human health, plant-life and wildlife, including endangered or threatened species;\n\u25cf protection of wetlands;\n\u25cf the discharge of materials into the environment;\n\u25cf the effects of mining on surface water and groundwater quality and availability; and\n\u25cf the management of electrical equipment containing polychlorinated biphenyls.\nThe costs, liabilities and requirements associated with the laws and regulations related to these and other environmental matters may be costly and time-consuming and may delay commencement or continuation of exploration or production operations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of cleanup and site restoration costs and liens, the issuance of injunctions to limit or cease operations, the suspension or revocation of permits and other enforcement measures that could have the effect of limiting production from our operations. We may incur material costs and liabilities resulting from claims for damages to property or injury to persons arising from our operations. If we are pursued for sanctions, costs and liabilities in respect of these matters, our mining operations and, as a result, our profitability could be materially and adversely affected.\nNew legislation or administrative regulations or new judicial interpretations or administrative enforcement of existing laws and regulations, including proposals related to the protection of the environment that would further regulate and tax the coal industry, may also require us to change operations significantly or incur increased costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Please refer to the section entitled \u201cEnvironmental and Other Regulatory Matters\u201d in Item 1 for more information about the various governmental regulations affecting us.\nIf the assumptions underlying our estimates of reclamation and mine closure obligations are inaccurate, our costs could be greater than anticipated.\nSMCRA and counterpart state laws and regulations establish operational, reclamation and closure standards for all aspects of surface mining, as well as most aspects of underground mining. We base our estimates of reclamation and mine closure liabilities on permit requirements, engineering studies and our engineering expertise related to these requirements. Our management and engineers periodically review these estimates. The estimates can change\nsignificantly if actual costs vary from our original assumptions, major operational changes are implemented or if governmental regulations change significantly. We are required to record new obligations as liabilities at fair value under U.S. GAAP. In estimating fair value, we considered the estimated current costs of reclamation and mine closure and applied inflation rates and a third-party profit, as required. The third-party profit is an estimate of the approximate markup that would be charged by contractors for work performed on our behalf. The resulting estimated reclamation and mine closure obligations could change significantly if actual amounts change significantly from our assumptions, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur operations may impact the environment or cause exposure to hazardous substances, and our properties may have environmental contamination, which could result in material liabilities to us.\nOur operations currently use hazardous materials and generate limited quantities of hazardous wastes from time to time. We could become subject to claims for toxic torts, natural resource damages and other damages as well as for the investigation and cleanup of soil, surface water, groundwater, and other media. Such claims may arise, for example, out of conditions at sites that we currently own or operate, as well as at sites that we previously owned or operated, or at sites that we may acquire. Under certain federal and state environmental laws, our liability for such conditions may be joint and several with other owners/operators, so that we may be held responsible for more than our share of the contamination or other damages, or even for the entire share. Liability under these laws is generally strict. Accordingly, we may incur liability without regard to fault or to the legality of the conduct giving rise to the conditions.\nWe maintain extensive coal refuse areas and slurry impoundments at a number of our mining complexes. Such areas and impoundments are subject to extensive regulation. Slurry impoundments can fail, which could release large volumes of coal slurry into the surrounding environment. Structural failure of an impoundment can result in extensive damage to the environment and natural resources, such as bodies of water that the coal slurry reaches, as well as liability for related personal injuries and property damages, and injuries to wildlife. Some of our impoundments overlie mined-out areas, which can pose a heightened risk of failure and of damages arising out of failure. If one of our impoundments were to fail, we could be subject to substantial claims for the resulting environmental contamination and associated liability, as well as for fines and penalties.\nDrainage flowing from or caused by mining activities can be acidic with elevated levels of dissolved metals, a condition referred to as \u201cacid mine drainage,\u201d which we refer to as AMD. The treating of AMD can be costly. Although we do not currently face material costs associated with AMD, it is possible that we could incur significant costs in the future.\nThese and other similar unforeseen impacts that our operations may have on the environment, as well as exposures to hazardous substances or wastes associated with our operations, could result in costs and liabilities that could materially and adversely affect us.\nChanges in the legal and regulatory environment could complicate or limit our business activities, increase our operating costs or result in litigation.\nThe conduct of our businesses is subject to various laws and regulations administered by federal, state and local governmental agencies in the United States. These laws and regulations may change, sometimes dramatically, as a result of political, economic or social events or in response to significant events. Environmental and other non-governmental organizations and activists, many of which are well funded, continue to exert pressure on regulators and other government bodies to enact more stringent laws and regulations. For instance, increasing attention to global climate change has resulted in an increased possibility of governmental investigations and, potentially, private litigation against us and our customers. For example, claims have been made against certain energy companies alleging that greenhouse gas emissions constitute a public nuisance. While our business is not a party to any such litigation, we could be named in actions making similar allegations. Moreover, the proliferation of successful climate change litigation could adversely impact demand for coal and ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Changes in the legal and regulatory environment in which we operate may impact our results, increase our costs or liabilities, complicate or limit our business activities or result in litigation. Such legal and regulatory environment changes may include changes in such items as: the processes for obtaining or renewing permits; federal\nLBA programs; costs associated with providing healthcare benefits to employees; health and safety standards; accounting standards; taxation requirements; competition laws; and trade policies, including policies concerning tariffs, quotas, trade barriers and other trade protection measures.\nRisks Related to Income Taxes\nOur ability to use net operating losses and alternative minimum tax credits is subject to current limitation, and our ability to use net operating losses may be subject to additional limitations.\nThe ability to use our net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d) in existence immediately prior to our emergence from bankruptcy in 2016 has been limited by the \u201cownership change\u201d under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (the \u201cCode\u201d) that occurred as a result of such emergence (the \u201cEmergence Ownership Change\u201d). The limitation resulting from the Emergence Ownership Change is substantial and applies to all NOLs existing at the time of the Emergence Ownership Change. The limitation resulting from the Emergence Ownership Change may have a significant impact on our ability to offset future taxable income with carryforward NOLs and, accordingly, we may be prevented from fully utilizing our NOL\u2019s existing at the time of the Emergence Ownership Change prior to their expiration.\nIn addition as a result of the discharge of debt in the Chapter 11 Cases, we and our subsidiaries were required to reduce the amount of our NOLs and other tax attributes existing at the end of 2016.\nNOLs generated after the Emergence Ownership Change are generally not subject to the limitations resulting from the Emergence Ownership Change. In addition, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, NOLs generated in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 are not subject to expiration; however, such NOLs can only be used to offset 80% of our U.S. federal taxable income in any taxable year beginning after December 31, 2020. However, if we undergo an additional \u201cownership change\u201d under Section 382 of the Code (very generally defined as a greater than 50% change, by value, in equity ownership by certain shareholders or groups of shareholders over a rolling three-year period), such ownership change may impose limitations on our ability to use any NOLs in existence immediately prior to such ownership change. We may experience ownership changes as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership. Future legal or regulatory changes could also limit our ability to utilize our NOLs. To the extent we are not able to offset future taxable income with our NOLs, our net income and cash flows may be adversely affected.\nU.S. tax legislation may materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe recent presidential and congressional elections in the United States could result in further significant changes in, and uncertainty with respect to, tax legislation and regulation directly or indirectly affecting our business. We urge our investors to consult with their legal and tax advisors with respect to the any such future legislation and regulations.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nInternational growth in our operations adds new and unique risks to our business.\nWe have sales offices in Singapore and the United Kingdom. The international expansion of our operations increases our exposure to country and currency risks. In addition, our international offices sell our coal to new customers and customers in new countries, whose business practices and reputations are not as well known to us. We also face new and increased political risks, including the potential for expropriation of assets and limitations on the repatriation of earnings. In the event that we are unable to effectively manage these new risks, our results of operations, financial position or cash flows could be adversely affected by these activities.\nOur ability to operate our business effectively could be impaired if we lose key personnel or fail to attract qualified personnel.\nWe manage our business with a number of key personnel, the loss of whom could have a material adverse effect on us, absent the completion of an orderly transition. In addition, we believe that our future success will depend greatly\non our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified personnel, particularly personnel with mining experience. Failure to retain or attract key personnel could have a material adverse effect on us.", "PERMNO": 75326, "SIC": 1220, "TIC": "ARCH"}
