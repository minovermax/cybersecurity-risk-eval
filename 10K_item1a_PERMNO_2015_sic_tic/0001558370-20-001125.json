{"cik": "812074", "company": "O-I Glass, Inc. /DE/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-21", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\u2003RISK FACTORS\nCorporate Modernization-The Company may not obtain the anticipated benefits of the Corporate Modernization.\nThe Company implemented the Corporate Modernization on December 26 and 27, 2019. On December 27, 2019, the Company announced the adoption of a new holding company structure whereby O-I Glass became the new parent entity with O-I Group and Paddock as direct, wholly owned subsidiaries. The Company\u2019s legacy asbestos-related liabilities and certain other liabilities remained within Paddock, structurally separating them from the Company\u2019s glass-making operations, which remain under O-I Group. The Company believes that the Corporate Modernization improves the Company\u2019s operating efficiency and cost structure, while ensuring the Company remains well-positioned to address its legacy liabilities. The anticipated benefits of the Corporate Modernization may not be obtained if circumstances prevent the Company from taking advantage of the strategic and business opportunities that the Company expects from the Corporate Modernization transactions. As a result, the Company may incur the costs of a corporate reorganization without realizing the anticipated benefits, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s reputation, financial condition, and operating results. The Company\u2019s management has dedicated, and will continue to dedicate, significant effort to implementing the Corporate Modernization. These efforts may divert management\u2019s focus and resources from the Company\u2019s business, corporate initiatives, or strategic opportunities, which could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s businesses, results of operations, financial condition, or prospects.\nAs a result of the Corporate Modernization, the name of the Company\u2019s parent holding company changed from Owens-Illinois, Inc. to O-I Glass, Inc. The reorganization efforts related to the Corporate Modernization could confuse and distract the Company\u2019s customers, suppliers and employees. In addition, these reorganization efforts could adversely affect or delay the Company\u2019s development and introduction of new products and technologies, result in the loss of management, technical, or other key personnel, disrupt the Company\u2019s supplier or customer relationships, jeopardize our supplier or sales channels and the Company\u2019s branding and marketing efforts, and increase our administrative expense, all of which could affect the Company\u2019s profitability.\nFor a discussion of the effects of the Corporate Modernization on the Company\u2019s financial statements, see Item 1, \u201cCorporate Modernization and Paddock\u2019s Chapter 11 Filing\u201d and Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d\nSubsidiary Bankruptcy-The Company\u2019s subsidiary, Paddock, has filed a petition to resolve asbestos litigation and asbestos-related claims under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the \u201cBankruptcy Code\u201d). Risks and uncertainties related to this filing could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOn January 6, 2020 (the \u201cPetition Date\u201d), Paddock voluntarily filed for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware to equitably and finally resolve all of its current and future asbestos-related liabilities. O-I Glass and O-I Group were not included in the Chapter 11 filing. Paddock\u2019s ultimate goal in its Chapter 11 case is to confirm a plan of reorganization under Section 524(g) of the Bankruptcy Code and utilize this specialized provision to establish a trust that will address all current and future asbestos-related claims. Paddock has been deconsolidated from the Company\u2019s financial statements since the Petition Date.\nThe amount that will be necessary to fully and finally resolve all of Paddock\u2019s current and future asbestos-related claims is uncertain. Several risks and uncertainties related to Paddock\u2019s Chapter 11 case could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including the value of Paddock, as deconsolidated, reflected in the Company\u2019s financial statements, the ultimate amounts necessary to fund any trust established pursuant to Section 524(g) of the Bankruptcy Code, the potential for the Company\u2019s asbestos-related exposure to extend beyond Paddock arising from corporate veil piercing efforts or other claims by asbestos plaintiffs, the costs of the Chapter 11 proceedings and the length of time\nnecessary to resolve the case, either through settlement or as a result of litigation arising in connection with the Chapter 11 proceeding, and the possibility that Paddock will be unsuccessful in attaining relief under Chapter 11.\nAs part of the Corporate Modernization transactions, O-I Glass entered into a support agreement with Paddock that requires O-I Glass to provide funding to Paddock for all permitted uses, subject to the terms of the support agreement and that is designed to ensure that Paddock remains solvent. The key objective of the support agreement is to ensure that Paddock has the same ability to fund the costs related to Asbestos Claims (as defined herein) as O-I, which funded asbestos-related liabilities out of cash funded from its subsidiaries.\nPaddock also has legacy environmental liabilities, related to, among other things, O-I\u2019s prior operation of certain facilities, including, but not limited to, in Ohio, Kentucky, Connecticut, New Jersey, and Georgia. Paddock\u2019s liabilities with respect to these facilities relate to penalties for site closures, remediation expenses, exposure for cleanup of contamination, and alleged noncompliance with regulations. Paddock also has liabilities associated with O-I\u2019s involvement in a number of other administrative and legal proceedings regarding the responsibility for the cleanup of hazardous waste or damages claimed to be associated with it and with O-I\u2019s involvement in some minor claims for environmental remediation of properties sold to third parties. Paddock also has other contested prepetition liabilities arising from pending non-asbestos-related litigation.\nFor a further discussion of the Chapter 11 proceedings and Paddock\u2019s legacy liabilities, see Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and Notes 14 and 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this report.\nAsbestos-Related Liability-The Company has made substantial payments to resolve claims of persons alleging exposure to asbestos-containing products and the Company has obligations to make further payments to resolve such claims under the terms of the support agreement. These substantial payments and obligations have affected and may continue to affect the Company\u2019s cost of borrowing, its ability to pursue global or domestic acquisitions, its ability to reinvest in its operations, and its ability to pay dividends.\nFrom 1948 to 1958, one of the Company\u2019s former business units commercially produced and sold approximately $40 million of a high-temperature, calcium silicate based pipe and block insulation material containing asbestos. The Company exited the insulation business in April 1958. Historically, the Company received claims from individuals alleging bodily injury and death as a result of exposure to asbestos from this product (\u201cAsbestos Claims\u201d). Some Asbestos Claims were brought as personal injury lawsuits that typically allege various theories of liability, including negligence, gross negligence and strict liability and seek compensatory and, in some cases, punitive damages. Predominantly, however, Asbestos Claims were presented to O-I under administrative claims-handling agreements, which O-I had in place with many plaintiffs\u2019 counsel throughout the country (\u201cAdministrative Claims\u201d).\nBeginning with the initial liability of $975 million established in 1993, O-I had accrued a total of approximately $5.0 billion through 2019, before insurance recoveries, for its asbestos-related liability. O-I\u2019s ability to estimate its liability had been significantly affected by, among other factors, the volatility of asbestos related litigation in the United States, the significant number of co-defendants that have filed for bankruptcy, the inherent uncertainty of future disease incidence, the claiming patterns against O-I, the significant expansion of the defendants that are in the litigation, and the continuing changes in the way in which these defendants participate in the resolution of the cases in which O-I was also a defendant.\nFor many years, O-I conducted an annual comprehensive legal review of its asbestos-related liabilities and costs in connection with finalizing its annual results of operations. In May 2016, O-I revised its method for estimating its asbestos-related liabilities in connection with finalizing and reporting its restated results of operations for the three years ended December 31, 2015. The revised method estimated the total future costs for O-I\u2019s asbestos-related liability. Under this method, O-I provided historical Asbestos Claims\u2019 data to a third party with expertise in determining the impact of disease incidence and mortality on future filing trends to develop information to assist O-I in estimating the total number of future Asbestos Claims likely to be asserted against O-\nI. O-I used this estimate, along with an estimation of disposition costs and related legal costs, as inputs to develop its best estimate of its total probable liability. The revised methodology led O-I to conclude that an asbestos-related liability of $486 million was required as of December 31, 2019.\nFollowing the Corporate Modernization transactions, asbestos-related liabilities that were previously paid by O-I now reside at Paddock. The Company undertook the Corporate Modernization transactions to structurally separate the legacy liabilities of O-I to reside within Paddock, separating the liabilities from the active operations of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries, while fully maintaining Paddock\u2019s ability to access the value of those operations to support its legacy liabilities through the support agreement. The Corporate Modernization transactions also helped ensure that Paddock has the same ability to fund the costs of defending and resolving present and future Asbestos Claims as O-I previously did, through Paddock\u2019s retention of its own assets to satisfy these claims and through its access to additional funds from the Company through the support agreement. The Company anticipates that, as a result of Paddock\u2019s Chapter 11 filing, Paddock\u2019s asbestos-related liabilities will be assessed and ultimately paid out in connection with a confirmed Chapter 11 plan of reorganization.\nThe Company continues to believe that Paddock\u2019s ultimate asbestos-related liabilities cannot be estimated with certainty. Historically, as part of its annual comprehensive legal reviews, the Company has reviewed its estimate of total asbestos-related liability, unless significant changes in trends or new developments warranted an earlier review. Such reviews resulted in significant adjustments to the liability accrued at the time of the review. For example, for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company\u2019s comprehensive legal review of asbestos-related liabilities resulted in charges of $35 million and $125 million, respectively.\nThe significant assumptions underlying the material components of the Company\u2019s historical accruals have been:\na)settlements will continue to be limited almost exclusively to claimants who were exposed to the Company\u2019s asbestos containing insulation prior to its exit from that business in 1958;\nb)Asbestos Claims will continue to be resolved primarily under the Company\u2019s administrative claims agreements, which are currently suspended as a result of Paddock\u2019s Chapter 11 filing, or on terms comparable to those set forth in those agreements;\nc)the incidence of serious asbestos related disease cases and claiming patterns against the Company for such cases do not change materially, including claiming pattern changes driven by changes in the law, procedure, or expansion of judicial resources in jurisdictions where the Company settles Asbestos Claims;\nd)the Company is substantially able to defend itself successfully at trial and on appeal;\ne)the number and timing of additional co-defendant bankruptcies do not change significantly the assets available to participate in the resolution of cases in which the Company is a defendant; and\nf)co-defendants with substantial resources and assets continue to participate significantly in the resolution of future Asbestos Claims.\nSee \u201cCritical Accounting Estimates\u201d and Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about the Company\u2019s asbestos-related liability.\nThe Company\u2019s funding of substantial payments to resolve asbestos-related claims and the obligation to fund asbestos-related payments ultimately paid out in connection with the confirmation of a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization has affected and may continue to affect the Company\u2019s cost of borrowing, its ability to pursue global or domestic acquisitions, its ability to reinvest in its operations, and its ability to pay dividends.\nSubstantial Leverage-The Company\u2019s indebtedness could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial health.\nThe Company has a significant amount of debt. As of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the Company had approximately $5.6 billion and $5.3 billion of total debt outstanding.\nThe Company\u2019s indebtedness could:\n\u25cfIncrease vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u25cfIncrease vulnerability to interest rate increases for the portion of the debt under the secured credit agreement;\n\u25cfRequire the Company to dedicate a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to payments on indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases, development efforts and other general corporate purposes;\n\u25cfLimit flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the Company\u2019s business and the rigid packaging market;\n\u25cfPlace the Company at a competitive disadvantage relative to its competitors that have less debt; and\n\u25cfLimit, along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in the documents governing indebtedness, among other things, the Company\u2019s ability to borrow additional funds.\nAbility to Service Debt-To service its indebtedness, the Company will require a significant amount of cash. The Company\u2019s ability to generate cash and refinance certain indebtedness depends on many factors beyond its control.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to make payments on, to refinance its indebtedness and to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, development efforts and other general corporate purposes depends on its ability to generate cash in the future. The Company has no assurance that it will generate sufficient cash flow from operations, or that future borrowings will be available under the secured credit agreement, in an amount sufficient to enable the Company to pay its indebtedness, or to fund other liquidity needs. If short-term interest rates increase, the Company\u2019s debt service cost will increase because some of its debt is subject to short-term variable interest rates. At December 31, 2019, the Company\u2019s debt, including interest rate swaps, that is subject to variable interest rates represented approximately 26% of total debt.\nFurther, in July 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (the authority that regulates LIBOR) announced it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee (\"ARRC\") has proposed that the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\") is the rate that represents best practice as the alternative to USD-LIBOR for use in debt instruments, derivatives and other financial contracts that are currently indexed to USD-LIBOR. ARRC has proposed a paced market transition plan to SOFR from USD-LIBOR and organizations are currently working on industry wide and company specific transition plans as it relates to derivatives, debt and cash markets exposed to USD-LIBOR. Approximately 33% of the Company\u2019s long-term indebtedness are indexed to USD-LIBOR and it is monitoring this activity and evaluating the related risks. Although an alternative to LIBOR has been contemplated in the Company\u2019s bank credit agreement, it is unclear as to the new method of calculating LIBOR that may evolve and this new method could adversely affect the Company\u2019s interest rates on its indebtedness.\nThe Company may need to refinance all or a portion of its indebtedness on or before maturity. If the Company is unable to generate sufficient cash flow and is unable to refinance or extend outstanding borrowings on commercially reasonable terms or at all, it may have to take one or more of the following actions:\n\u25cfReduce or delay capital expenditures planned for replacements, improvements and expansions;\n\u25cfSell assets;\n\u25cfRestructure debt; and/or\n\u25cfObtain additional debt or equity financing.\nThe Company can provide no assurance that it could affect or implement any of these alternatives on satisfactory terms, if at all.\nDebt Restrictions-The Company may not be able to finance future needs or adapt its business plans to changes because of restrictions placed on it by the secured credit agreement and the indentures and instruments governing other indebtedness.\nThe secured credit agreement, the indentures governing the senior notes, and certain of the agreements governing other indebtedness contain affirmative and negative covenants that limit the ability of the Company to take certain actions. For example, certain of the indentures restrict, among other things, the ability of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries to borrow money, pay dividends on, or redeem or repurchase its stock, make certain investments, create liens, enter into certain transactions with affiliates and sell certain assets or merge with or into other companies. These restrictions could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to operate its businesses and may limit its ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise.\nFailure to comply with these or other covenants and restrictions contained in the secured credit agreement, the indentures or agreements governing other indebtedness could result in a default under those agreements, and the debt under those agreements, together with accrued interest, could then be declared immediately due and payable. If a default occurs under the secured credit agreement, the Company could no longer request borrowings under the secured credit agreement, and the lenders could cause all of the outstanding debt obligations under such secured credit agreement to become due and payable, which would result in a default under the indentures governing the Company\u2019s other outstanding debt securities and could lead to an acceleration of obligations related to these debt securities. A default under the secured credit agreement, indentures or agreements governing other indebtedness could also lead to an acceleration of debt under other debt instruments that contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rates-The Company is subject to the effects of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which could adversely impact the Company\u2019s financial results.\nThe Company\u2019s reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. A significant portion of the Company\u2019s net sales, costs, assets and liabilities are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Euro, Brazilian real, Colombian peso, Mexican peso and Australian dollar. In its consolidated financial statements, the Company remeasures transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the reporting entity (e.g. soda ash purchases) and translates local currency financial results into U.S. dollars based on the exchange rates prevailing during the reporting period. During times of a strengthening U.S. dollar, the reported revenues and earnings of the Company\u2019s international operations will be reduced because the local currencies will translate into fewer U.S. dollars. This could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nInternational Operations-The Company is subject to risks associated with operating in foreign countries.\nThe Company operates manufacturing and other facilities throughout the world. Net sales from non-U.S. operations totaled approximately $4.8 billion, representing approximately 71% of the Company\u2019s net sales for the year ended December 31, 2019. As a result of its non-U.S. operations, the Company is subject to risks associated with operating in foreign countries, including:\n\u25cf Political, social and economic instability;\n\u25cf War, civil disturbance or acts of terrorism;\n\u25cf Outbreaks of pandemic disease, such as coronavirus, which could cause the Company or its suppliers and/or customers to temporarily suspend operations in affected areas, restrict the ability of the Company to distribute its products and cause economic downturns that could affect demand for the Company\u2019s products;\n\u25cf Taking of property by nationalization or expropriation without fair compensation;\n\u25cf Changes in governmental policies and regulations;\n\u25cf Devaluations and fluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u25cf Fluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u25cf Imposition of limitations on conversions of foreign currencies into dollars or remittance of dividends and other payments by foreign subsidiaries;\n\u25cf Imposition or increase of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by foreign subsidiaries;\n\u25cf Hyperinflation in certain foreign countries;\n\u25cf Impositions or increase of investment and other restrictions or requirements by foreign governments;\n\u25cf Loss or non-renewal of treaties or other agreements with foreign tax authorities;\n\u25cf Changes in tax laws, or the interpretation thereof, including those affecting foreign tax credits or tax deductions relating to the Company\u2019s non-U.S. earnings or operations; and\n\u25cf Complying with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits companies and their intermediaries from engaging in bribery or other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purposes of obtaining or retaining business or gaining an unfair business advantage and requires companies to maintain accurate books and records and effective internal controls.\nThe risks associated with operating in foreign countries may have a material adverse effect on operations.\nBrexit-The Company\u2019s business may be impacted by the United Kingdom\u2019s proposed exit from the European Union.\nIn 2016, the United Kingdom held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the European Union, commonly referred to as \"Brexit.\" On January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom officially left the European Union\nand entered a transitional period running through December 31, 2020, during which period the United Kingdom and the European Union will attempt to negotiate their future relationship. Such negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union remain ongoing and are complex, and there can be no assurance regarding the terms, timing or consummation of any resulting agreements.\nThis uncertainty may result in future exchange rate volatility. Such volatility, and any adverse effect that Brexit has on the currency regimes to which the Company is subject, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s sales volumes and costs. The Company has two manufacturing facilities in the United Kingdom. Further, the uncertainty surrounding the ongoing Brexit negotiations continues to create economic uncertainty, which may cause the Company\u2019s customers to closely monitor their costs, terminate or reduce the scope of existing contracts, decrease or postpone currently planned contracts, or negotiate for more favorable deal terms, each of which may have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCompetition-The Company faces intense competition from other glass container producers, as well as from makers of alternative forms of packaging. Competitive pressures could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial health.\nThe Company is subject to significant competition from other glass container producers, as well as from makers of alternative forms of packaging, such as aluminum cans and plastic containers. The Company also competes with manufacturers of non-rigid packaging alternatives, including flexible pouches and aseptic cartons, in serving the packaging needs of certain end-use markets, including juice customers. The Company competes with each rigid packaging competitor on the basis of price, quality, service and the marketing and functional attributes of the container. Advantages or disadvantages in any of these competitive factors may be sufficient to cause the customer to consider changing suppliers and/or using an alternative form of packaging. The adverse effects of consumer purchasing decisions may be more significant in periods of economic downturn and may lead to longer-term reductions in consumer spending on glass packaged products.\nPressures from competitors and producers of alternative forms of packaging have resulted in excess capacity in certain countries in the past and have led to capacity adjustments and significant pricing pressures in the rigid packaging market. These pressures could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s operations.\nLower Demand Levels-Changes in consumer preferences may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial results.\nChanges in consumer preferences for the food and beverages they consume can reduce demand for the Company\u2019s products. Because many of the Company\u2019s products are used to package consumer goods, the Company\u2019s sales and profitability could be negatively impacted by changes in consumer preferences for those products. Examples of changes in consumer preferences include, but are not limited to, lower sales of major domestic beer brands and shifts from beer to wine or spirits that results in the use of fewer glass containers. In periods of lower demand, the Company\u2019s sales and production levels may decrease causing a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s profitability.\nEnergy Costs-Higher energy costs worldwide and interrupted power supplies may have a material adverse effect on operations.\nElectrical power, natural gas, and fuel oil are vital to the Company\u2019s operations as it relies on a continuous energy supply to conduct its business. Depending on the location and mix of energy sources, energy accounts for 10% to 20% of total production costs. Substantial increases and volatility in energy costs could cause the Company to experience a significant increase in operating costs, which may have a material adverse effect on operations.\nGlobal Economic Environment-The global credit, financial and economic environment could have a material adverse effect on operations and financial condition.\nThe global credit, financial and economic environment could have a material adverse effect on operations, including the following:\n\u25cfDownturns in the business or financial condition of any of the Company\u2019s customers or suppliers could result in a loss of revenues or a disruption in the supply of raw materials;\n\u25cfTightening of credit in financial markets could reduce the Company\u2019s ability, as well as the ability of the Company\u2019s customers and suppliers, to obtain future financing;\n\u25cfVolatile market performance could affect the fair value of the Company\u2019s pension assets and liabilities, potentially requiring the Company to make significant additional contributions to its pension plans to maintain prescribed funding levels;\n\u25cfThe deterioration of any of the lending parties under the Company\u2019s revolving credit facility or the creditworthiness of the counterparties to the Company\u2019s derivative transactions could result in such parties\u2019 failure to satisfy their obligations under their arrangements with the Company; and\n\u25cfA significant weakening of the Company\u2019s financial position or results of operations could result in noncompliance with the covenants under the Company\u2019s indebtedness.\nBusiness Integration Risks-The Company may not be able to effectively integrate additional businesses it acquires in the future.\nThe Company may consider strategic transactions, including acquisitions that will complement, strengthen and enhance growth in its worldwide glass operations. The Company evaluates opportunities on a preliminary basis from time to time, but these transactions may not advance beyond the preliminary stages or be completed. Such acquisitions are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including:\n\u25cfThe inability to integrate effectively the operations, products, technologies and personnel of the acquired companies (some of which may be located in diverse geographic regions) and achieve expected synergies;\n\u25cfThe potential disruption of existing business and diversion of management\u2019s attention from day-to-day operations;\n\u25cfThe inability to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies;\n\u25cfThe need or obligation to divest portions of the acquired companies;\n\u25cfThe potential impairment of relationships with customers;\n\u25cfThe potential failure to identify material problems and liabilities during due diligence review of acquisition targets;\n\u25cfThe potential failure to obtain sufficient indemnification rights to fully offset possible liabilities associated with acquired businesses; and\n\u25cfThe challenges associated with operating in new geographic regions.\nIn addition, the Company cannot make assurances that the integration and consolidation of newly acquired businesses will achieve any anticipated cost savings and operating synergies.\nCustomer Consolidation-The continuing consolidation of the Company\u2019s customer base may intensify pricing pressures and have a material adverse effect on operations.\nMany of the Company\u2019s largest customers have acquired companies with similar or complementary product lines. This consolidation has increased the concentration of the Company\u2019s business with its largest customers. In many cases, such consolidation has been accompanied by pressure from customers for lower prices, reflecting the increase in the total volume of products purchased or the elimination of a price differential between the acquiring customer and the company acquired. Increased pricing pressures from the Company\u2019s customers may have a material adverse effect on operations.\nOperational Disruptions-Profitability could be affected by unanticipated operational disruptions.\nThe Company\u2019s glass container manufacturing process is asset intensive and includes the use of large furnaces and machines. The Company periodically experiences unanticipated disruptions to its assets and these events can have an adverse effect on its business operations and profitability. The impacts of these operational disruptions include, but are not limited to, higher maintenance, production changeover and shipping costs, higher capital spending, as well as lower absorption of fixed costs during periods of extended downtime. The Company maintains insurance policies in amounts and with coverage and deductibles that are reasonable and in line with industry standards; however, this insurance coverage may not be adequate to protect the Company from all liabilities and expenses that may arise.\nSeasonality-Profitability could be affected by varied seasonal demands.\nDue principally to the seasonal nature of the consumption of beer and other beverages, for which demand is stronger during the summer months, sales of the Company\u2019s products have varied and are expected to vary by quarter. Shipments in the U.S. and Europe are typically greater in the second half of the year, while shipments in the Asia Pacific region are typically greater in the first and fourth quarters of the year, and shipments in South America are typically greater in the last three quarters of the year. Unseasonably cool weather during peak demand periods can reduce demand for certain beverages packaged in the Company\u2019s containers.\nRaw Materials-Profitability could be affected by the availability and cost of raw materials.\nThe raw materials that the Company uses have historically been available in adequate supply from multiple sources. For certain raw materials, however, there may be temporary shortages due to weather or other factors, including disruptions in supply caused by transportation or production delays. These shortages, as well as material volatility in the cost of any of the principal raw materials that the Company uses, may have a material adverse effect on operations.\nIn addition, the Company purchases its soda ash raw materials in U.S. dollars in South America, Mexico and Asia Pacific. Given fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, this may cause these regions to experience inflationary or deflationary impacts to their raw material costs.\nEnvironmental Risks-The Company is subject to various environmental legal requirements and may be subject to new legal requirements in the future. These requirements may have a material adverse effect on operations.\nThe Company\u2019s operations and properties are subject to extensive laws, ordinances, regulations and other legal requirements relating to environmental protection, including legal requirements governing investigation and clean-up of contaminated properties as well as water discharges, air emissions, waste management and workplace health and safety. Such legal requirements frequently change and vary among jurisdictions. The Company\u2019s\noperations and properties must comply with these legal requirements. These requirements may have a material adverse effect on operations.\nThe Company has incurred, and expects to incur, costs for its operations to comply with environmental legal requirements, and these costs could increase in the future. Many environmental legal requirements provide for substantial fines, orders (including orders to cease operations), and criminal sanctions for violations. These legal requirements may apply to conditions at properties that the Company presently or formerly owned or operated, as well as at other properties for which the Company may be responsible, including those at which wastes attributable to the Company were disposed. A significant order or judgment against the Company, the loss of a significant permit or license or the imposition of a significant fine may have a material adverse effect on operations.\nA number of governmental authorities have enacted, or are considering enacting, legal requirements that would mandate certain rates of recycling, the use of recycled materials and/or limitations on certain kinds of packaging materials. In addition, some companies with packaging needs have responded to such developments and/or perceived environmental concerns of consumers by using containers made in whole or in part of recycled materials. Such developments may reduce the demand for some of the Company\u2019s products and/or increase the Company\u2019s costs, which may have a material adverse effect on operations.\nGovernmental authorities have also enacted, or are considering enacting, legal requirements restricting the volume of GHG emissions that manufacturing facilities can produce with penalties for companies that do not comply. A reduction in the quantity of permitted GHG emissions under existing rules, or the introduction of new GHG emissions rules, in jurisdictions where the Company operates, could have a material effect on the its results. The Company is not able to predict what environmental legal requirements may be adopted in the future nor the impact such future environmental legal requirements may have on its results of operations or cash flows.\nTaxes-Potential tax law and U.S. trade policy changes could adversely affect net income and cash flow.\nThe Company is subject to income tax in the numerous jurisdictions in which it operates. Increases in income tax rates or other tax law changes, as well as ongoing audits by domestic and international authorities, could reduce the Company\u2019s net income and cash flow from affected jurisdictions. In particular, additional guidance is likely to be issued providing further clarification on the application of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was signed into law on December 22, 2017, and proposed and final regulations that have subsequently been issued with respect to the provisions enacted pursuant to such law. Further, it is reasonable to expect that global taxing authorities will be reviewing current legislation for potential modifications in reaction to the implementation of the U.S. legislation. This additional guidance, along with the potential for additional global tax legislation changes, could have a material adverse impact on net income and cash flow by impacting significant deductions or income inclusions. In addition, the Company\u2019s products are subject to import and excise duties and/or sales or value-added taxes in many jurisdictions in which it operates. Increases in these indirect taxes could affect the affordability of the Company\u2019s products and, therefore, reduce demand.\nIn addition, existing free trade laws and regulations provide certain beneficial duties and tariffs for qualifying imports and exports, subject to compliance with the applicable classification and other requirements. Changes in laws or policies governing the terms of foreign trade, and in particular increased trade restrictions, tariffs or taxes on imports from countries where the Company manufactures products, such as Mexico, could have a material adverse effect on its business and financial results. Also, a government\u2019s adoption of \u201cbuy national\u201d policies or retaliation by another government against such policies may affect the prices of and demand for the Company\u2019s products and could have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nMany international legislative and regulatory bodies have proposed legislation and begun investigations of the tax practices of multinational companies and, in the European Union (EU), the tax policies of certain EU member states. One of these efforts has been led by the OECD, an international association of more than 35 countries including the United States, which has finalized recommendations to revise corporate tax, transfer\npricing, and tax treaty provisions in member countries. Since 2013, the European Commission (EC) has been investigating tax rulings granted by tax authorities in a number of EU member states with respect to specific multinational corporations to determine whether such rulings comply with EU rules on state aid, as well as more recent investigations of the tax regimes of certain EU member states. If the EC determines that a tax ruling or tax regime violates the state aid restrictions, the tax authorities of the affected EU member state may be required to collect back taxes for the period of time covered by the ruling. In addition, the European Commission has expanded upon the OECD guidelines with anti-tax avoidance directives to be applied by its member states. Among other things, the directives require companies to provide increased country-by-country disclosure of their financial information to tax authorities, which in turn could lead to disagreements by jurisdictions over the proper allocation of profits between them. In connection with the OECD\u2019s base erosion and profit shifting project, the OECD has undertaken a new project focused on \u201cAddressing the Tax Challenges of the Digitalisation of the Economy.\u201d This project may impact all multinational businesses by implementing a global model for minimum taxation. Additionally, the European Commission and some foreign jurisdictions have introduced proposals to impose a separate tax on specified digital service activity. There is significant uncertainty regarding such proposals. Due to the large scale of the Company\u2019s U.S. and international business activities, many of these proposed changes to the taxation of the Company\u2019s activities, if enacted, could increase the Company\u2019s worldwide effective tax rate and harm results of operations.\nLabor Relations-Some of the Company\u2019s employees are unionized or represented by workers\u2019 councils.\nThe Company is party to a number of collective bargaining agreements with labor unions, which at December 31, 2019, covered approximately 76% of the Company\u2019s employees in the U.S. and Canada. The principal collective bargaining agreement, which at December 31, 2019 covered approximately 76% of the Company\u2019s union-affiliated employees in U.S. and Canada, will expire on March 31, 2022. Approximately 69% of employees in South America and Mexico are covered by collective bargaining agreements. The majority of the hourly workers in Australia and New Zealand are also covered by collective bargaining agreements. The collective bargaining agreements in South America, Mexico, Australia and New Zealand have varying terms and expiration dates. Upon the expiration of any collective bargaining agreement, if the Company is unable to negotiate acceptable contracts with labor unions, it could result in strikes by the affected workers and increased operating costs as a result of higher wages or benefits paid to union members. In Europe, a large number of the Company\u2019s employees are employed in countries in which employment laws provide greater bargaining or other rights to employees than the laws of the U.S. Such employment rights require the Company to work collaboratively with the legal representatives of the employees to effect any changes to labor arrangements. For example, most of the Company\u2019s employees in Europe are represented by workers\u2019 councils that must approve any changes in conditions of employment, including salaries and benefits and staff changes, and may impede efforts to restructure the Company\u2019s workforce. In addition, if the Company\u2019s employees were to engage in a strike or other work stoppage, the Company could experience a significant disruption of operations and/or higher ongoing labor costs, which may have a material adverse effect on operations.\nKey Management and Personnel Retention-Failure to retain key management and personnel could have a material adverse effect on operations.\nThe Company believes that its future success depends, in part, on its experienced management team and certain key personnel. The loss of certain key management and personnel could limit the Company\u2019s ability to implement its business plans and meet its objectives.\nJoint Ventures-Failure by joint venture partners to observe their obligations could have a material adverse effect on operations.\nA portion of the Company\u2019s operations is conducted through joint ventures, including joint ventures in the Americas, Europe, and Asia Pacific segments. If the Company\u2019s joint venture partners do not observe their obligations or are unable to commit additional capital to the joint ventures, it is possible that the affected joint\nventure would not be able to operate in accordance with its business plans, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nInformation Technology-Failure or disruption of the Company\u2019s information technology, or those of third parties, could have a material adverse effect on its business and the results of operations.\nThe Company employs information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) systems and networks to support the business and relies on them to operate its plants, to communicate with its employees, customers and suppliers, to store sensitive business information and intellectual property, and to report financial and operating results. As with any IT system, the Company\u2019s IT system, or any third party\u2019s system on which the Company relies, could fail on its own accord or may be vulnerable to a variety of interruptions due to events, including, but not limited to, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, power outages, fire, sabotage, equipment failures, cybersecurity vulnerabilities, and cyber-related attacks or computer crimes, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCybersecurity and Data Privacy - Security breaches could disrupt the Company\u2019s business operations, result in the loss of critical and confidential information, and have a material adverse effect on its business, reputation and results of operations.\nThe Company has been subject to cyberattacks in the past, including phishing and malware incidents, and although no such attack has had a material adverse effect on its business, this may not be the case with future attacks. As the prevalence of cyberattacks continues to increase, the Company\u2019s IT systems, or those of third parties, may be subject to increased security threats and the Company may incur additional costs to upgrade and maintain its security measures in place to prevent and detect such threats. The Company\u2019s security measures may be unable to prevent certain security breaches, and any such breaches could result in transactional errors, business disruptions, loss of or damage to intellectual property, loss of customers and business opportunities, unauthorized access to or disclosure of confidential or personal information (which could cause a breach of applicable data protection legislation), regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensatory costs, and additional compliance costs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Any resulting costs or losses may not be covered by, or may exceed the coverage limits of, the Company\u2019s cyber insurance.\nThe Company is increasingly reliant on third parties to provide software, support and management with respect to its IT systems. The security and privacy measures the Company\u2019s vendors implement may not be sufficient to prevent and detect cyberattacks that could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. While the Company\u2019s IT vendor agreements typically contain provisions that seek to eliminate or limit the Company\u2019s exposure to liability for damages from a cyberattack, the Company cannot assure that such provisions will withstand legal challenges or cover all or any such damages. If the Company\u2019s business continuity and/or disaster recovery plans do not effectively and timely resolve issues resulting from a cyberattack, the Company may suffer material adverse effects on its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, new global privacy rules are being enacted and existing ones are being updated and strengthened. In May 2018, the European Union (EU) implemented the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) that stipulates data protection and privacy regulations for all individuals within the EU and the European Economic Area (EEA). The Company has significant operations in the EEA and is subject to the GDPR. The GDPR imposes several stringent requirements for controllers and processors of personal data and could make it more difficult and/or more costly for the Company to use and share personal data. Although the Company takes reasonable efforts to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that the Company will not be subject to regulatory action, including fines, in the event of an incident. To comply with the new data protection rules imposed by GDPR and other applicable data protection legislation, the Company may be required to put in place additional mechanisms which could adversely affect its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAccounting Estimates-The Company\u2019s financial results are based upon estimates and assumptions that may differ from actual results.\nIn preparing the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, several estimates and assumptions are made that affect the accounting for and recognition of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. These estimates and assumptions must be made due to certain information used in the preparation of the Company\u2019s financial statements which is dependent on future events, cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from data available or is not capable of being readily calculated based on generally accepted methodologies. The Company believes that accounting for long-lived assets, pension benefit plans, contingencies and litigation, and income taxes involves the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements. Actual results for all estimates could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that the Company uses, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nAccounting Standards-The adoption of new accounting standards or interpretations could adversely impact the Company\u2019s financial results.\nNew accounting standards or pronouncements could adversely affect the Company\u2019s operating results or cause unanticipated fluctuations in its results in future periods. The accounting rules and regulations that the Company must comply with are complex and continually changing. In addition, many companies\u2019 accounting policies are being subjected to heightened scrutiny by regulators and the public. The Company cannot predict the impact of future changes to accounting principles or its accounting policies on its financial statements going forward.\nGoodwill-A significant write down of goodwill would have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s reported results of operations and net worth.\nGoodwill at December 31, 2019 totaled $1.9 billion. The Company evaluates goodwill annually (or more frequently if impairment indicators arise) for impairment using the required business valuation methods. These methods include the use of a weighted average cost of capital to calculate the present value of the expected future cash flows of the Company\u2019s reporting units. Future changes in the cost of capital, expected cash flows, or other factors may cause the Company\u2019s goodwill to be impaired, resulting in a non-cash charge against results of operations to write down goodwill for the amount of the impairment. If a significant write down is required, the charge would have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s reported results of operations and net worth. For example, the Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $595 million in the third quarter of 2019, which was equal to the excess of the North American reporting unit's carrying value over its fair value.\nPension Funding-An increase in the underfunded status of the Company\u2019s pension plans could adversely impact the Company\u2019s operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nThe Company contributed $33 million, $34 million and $31 million to its defined benefit pension plans in 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The amount the Company is required to contribute to these plans is determined by the laws and regulations governing each plan, and is generally related to the funded status of the plans. A deterioration in the value of the plans\u2019 investments or a decrease in the discount rate used to calculate plan liabilities generally would increase the underfunded status of the plans. An increase in the underfunded status of the plans could result in an increase in the Company\u2019s obligation to make contributions to the plans, thereby reducing the cash available for working capital and other corporate uses, and may have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s operations, financial condition and liquidity.", "PERMNO": 77157, "SIC": 3221, "TIC": "OI"}
