{"cik": "1320695", "company": "TreeHouse Foods, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-13", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nIn addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this Report, the following risks and uncertainties could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company also may impair the Company\u2019s business operations and financial condition.\nWe operate in the highly competitive and rapidly changing food industry.\nThe food industry is highly competitive, and faces increased competition as a result of consolidation, channel proliferation and the growth of online food retailers and new market participants. We face competition across our product lines from other companies that have varying abilities to withstand changes in market conditions. Some of our competitors have substantial financial, marketing, and other resources, and competition with them in our various business segments and product lines could cause us to reduce prices, increase capital, marketing or other expenditures, or lose sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. Category sales and growth could also be adversely impacted if we are not successful in introducing new products.\nSome customer buying decisions are based on a periodic bidding process in which the successful bidder is reasonably assured the selling of its selected product to the food retailer, super center, mass merchandiser, or foodservice distributors, until the next bidding process. Our sales volume may decrease significantly if our offer is too high and we lose the ability to sell products through these channels, even temporarily. Alternatively, we risk reducing our margins if our offer is successful but below our desired price point. Either of these outcomes may adversely affect our results of operations. Additionally, competition can impact our ability to pass on increased costs or otherwise increase prices.\nAs new and evolving distribution channels acquire greater attention with consumers, we will need to evaluate whether our business methods and processes can be utilized or adopted in a manner that permits us to successfully serve these distribution channels. Our inability to offer competitive products to these customer segments could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nAs we are dependent upon a limited number of customers, the loss of a significant customer, or consolidation of our customer base, could adversely affect our operating results.\nA limited number of customers represent a large percentage of our consolidated net sales. Our operating results are contingent on our ability to maintain our sales to these customers. The competition to supply products to these high volume customers is very strong. We expect that a significant portion of our net sales will continue to arise from a small number of customers, consisting primarily of traditional grocery retailers, mass merchandisers, and foodservice operators. For the year ended December 31, 2019, our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 57.6% of our consolidated net sales. For the year ended December 31, 2019, our largest customer, Walmart Inc. and its affiliates, accounted for approximately 24.4% of our consolidated net sales. No other customer accounted for 10% or more of the Company\u2019s consolidated net sales. These customers typically do not enter into written contracts with fixed purchase commitments, and the contracts that they do enter into generally are terminable at will. Our customers make purchase decisions based on a combination of price, product quality, and customer service performance. If our product sales to one or more of these customers decline, this reduction may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nFurther, over the past several years, the retail grocery and foodservice industries have experienced a consolidation trend, which has resulted in mass merchandisers and non-traditional grocers, such as ecommerce grocers with direct-to-consumer channels, gaining market share. As our customer base continues to consolidate, we expect competition to intensify as we compete for the business of fewer large customers. As this trend continues and such customers grow larger, they may seek to use their position to improve their profitability through improved efficiency, lower pricing, or increased promotional programs. If we are unable to use our scale, product innovation, and category leadership positions to respond to these demands, our profitability or volume growth could be negatively impacted. Additionally, if the surviving entity of a consolidation or similar transaction is not a current customer of the Company, we may lose significant business once held with the acquired retailer.\nConsolidation also increases the risk that adverse changes in our customers' business operations or financial performance will have a corresponding material adverse effect on us. For example, if our customers cannot access sufficient funds or financing, then they may delay, decrease, or cancel purchases of our products, or delay or fail to pay us for previous purchases.\nIf we are unable to attract, hire or retain key employees or a highly skilled and diverse global workforce, it could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe competitive environment requires us to attract, hire, retain and develop key employees, including our executive officers and senior management team, and maintain a highly skilled and diverse global workforce. We compete to attract and hire highly skilled employees and our own employees are highly sought after by our competitors and other companies. Competition could cause us to lose talented employees, and unplanned turnover could deplete our institutional knowledge and result in increased costs due to increased competition for employees.\nDisruption of our supply chain or distribution capabilities could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur ability to manufacture, move, and sell products is critical to our success. We are subject to damage or disruption to raw material supplies or our manufacturing or distribution capabilities (in particular, to the extent that our raw materials are sourced globally) due to weather, including any potential effects of climate change, natural disaster, fire, terrorism, adverse changes in political conditions or political unrest, pandemic, strikes, import restrictions, or other factors that could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products. Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations, as well as require additional resources to restore our supply chain.\nOur business operations could be disrupted if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately or are breached.\nThe efficient operation of our business depends on our information technology systems. We rely on our information technology systems, including the internet, to effectively manage our business data, communications, supply chain, order entry and fulfillment, and other business processes. These information technology systems, some of which are dependent on services provided by third parties, may be susceptible to damage, invasions, disruptions, or shutdowns due to hardware failures, computer viruses, hacker attacks, and other cybersecurity risks, telecommunication failures, user errors, employee error or malfeasance, catastrophic events, natural disasters, fire or other factors. If we are unable to prevent or adequately respond to and resolve these breaches, disruptions or failures, our business may be disrupted, and we may suffer other adverse consequences such as data loss, financial or reputational damage or penalties, legal claims or proceedings, remediation costs, or the loss of sales or customers.\nIncreases in input costs, such as ingredients, packaging materials, and fuel costs, could adversely affect earnings.\nThe costs of raw materials, packaging materials, and fuel have varied widely in recent years and future changes in such costs may cause our results of operations and our operating margins to fluctuate significantly. We are also subject to delays caused by interruptions in production of raw materials based on conditions not within our control. Such conditions include job actions or strikes by employees of suppliers, weather, crop conditions, transportation shortages and interruptions, natural disasters, sustainability issues or other catastrophic events. While individual input cost changes varied throughout the year, with certain costs increasing and others decreasing, input costs were in the aggregate unfavorable in 2019 compared to 2018. We expect the volatile nature of these costs to continue with an overall long-term upward trend.\nWe manage the impact of increases in the costs of raw materials, wherever possible, by locking in prices on quantities required to meet our production requirements. The price of oil has been particularly volatile recently and there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will result in the optimal price. In addition, we attempt to offset the effect of such increases by raising prices to our customers. However, changes in the prices of our products may lag behind changes in the costs of our materials. Competitive pressures may also limit our ability to quickly raise prices in response to increased raw materials, packaging, and fuel costs. Accordingly, if we are unable to increase our prices to offset increasing raw material, packaging, and fuel costs, our operating profits and margins could be materially affected. In addition, in instances of declining input costs, customers may look for price reductions in situations where we have locked into purchases at higher costs.\nPotential liabilities and costs from litigation could adversely affect our business.\nThere is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourself in civil, criminal, or regulatory actions, including under general, commercial, employment, environmental, data privacy or security, intellectual property, food quality and safety, anti-trust and trade, advertising and claims, and environmental laws and regulations, or in asserting our rights under various laws. For example, our claims could face allegations of false or deceptive advertising or other criticisms which could end up in litigation and result in potential liabilities or costs. In addition, we could incur substantial costs and fees in defending our self or in asserting our rights in these actions or meeting new legal requirements. The costs and other effects of potential and pending litigation and administrative actions against us, and new legal requirements, cannot be determined with certainty and may differ from expectations.\nOur private label and regionally branded products may not be able to compete successfully with nationally branded products.\nFor sales of private label products to retailers, the principal competitive factors are price, product quality, and quality of service. For sales of private label products to consumers, the principal competitive factors are price and product quality. In many cases, competitors with nationally branded products have a competitive advantage over private label products due to name recognition. In addition, when branded competitors focus on price and promotion, the environment for private label producers becomes more challenging because the price differential between private label products and branded products may become less significant.\nCompetition to obtain shelf space for our branded products with retailers is primarily based on the expected or historical performance of our product sales relative to our competitors. The principal competitive factors for sales of our branded products to consumers are brand recognition and loyalty, product quality, promotion, and price. Some of our branded competitors have significantly greater resources and brand recognition than we do.\nCompetitive pressures or other factors could cause us to lose sales, which may require us to lower prices, increase the use of discounting or promotional programs, or increase marketing expenditures, each of which would adversely affect our margins and could result in a decrease in our operating results and profitability.\nOur operations are subject to the general risks associated with acquisitions and divestitures.\nWe have made several acquisitions and divestitures in recent years that align with our strategic initiative of delivering long-term value to shareholders. The Company regularly reviews strategic opportunities to grow through acquisitions and to divest non-strategic assets. Potential risks associated with these transactions include the inability to consummate a transaction on favorable terms, the diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, the potential loss of key employees and customers of current or acquired companies, the inability to integrate or divest operations successfully, the possible assumptions of unknown liabilities, potential disputes with buyers or sellers, potential impairment charges if purchase assumptions are not achieved, and the inherent risks in entering markets or lines of business in which the Company has limited or no prior experience. Any or all of these risks could impact the Company\u2019s financial results and business reputation. In addition, acquisitions outside the United States may present unique challenges and increase the Company\u2019s exposure to the risks associated with foreign operations.\nWe may not realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of our restructuring plans in the anticipated time frame or at all.\nWe depend on our ability to evolve and grow, and as changes in our business environments occur, we may adjust our business plans by introducing new restructuring programs, from time to time, to meet these changes, such as TreeHouse 2020, a long-term growth and margin improvement strategy involving plants and distribution locations, and Structure to Win, a sales, general, and administrative expenses improvement and alignment program. During 2019, the Company incurred approximately $105.4 million in restructuring program costs. See Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Restructuring programs often require a substantial amount of management and operational resources, which may divert the Company\u2019s attention from existing core businesses, potentially disrupting our operations and adversely affecting our relationships with suppliers and customers. In addition, events and circumstances, such as financial or strategic difficulties, delays and unexpected costs may occur that could result in our not realizing all or any of the anticipated benefits on our expected timetable or at all, and there can be no assurance that any benefits we realize from these restructuring efforts will be sufficient to offset the restructuring charges and other costs that we expect to incur.\nThe recognition of impairment charges on goodwill or long-lived assets could adversely impact our future financial reporting and results of operations.\nWe have $2,662.0 million of total intangible assets at December 31, 2019, consisting of $2,107.3 million of goodwill and $554.7 million of other intangible assets. Additionally, we have $1,045.2 million of property, plant, and equipment at December 31, 2019.\nWe perform an annual impairment assessment for goodwill and our indefinite-lived intangible assets, and as necessary, for other long-lived assets. If the results of such assessments were to show that the fair value of these assets were less than the carrying values, we could be required to recognize a charge for impairment of goodwill or long-lived assets, and the amount of the impairment charge could be material. Factors which could result in an impairment include, but are not limited to, (i) reduced demand for our products; (ii) higher commodity prices; (iii) lower prices for our products or increased marketing as a result of increased competition; and (iv) significant disruptions to our operations as a result of both internal and external events.\nIn 2019, on a continuing operations basis, we incurred a total of $129.1 million of impairment charges, comprised of $88.0 million of non-cash impairment charges related to the Cookies and Dry Dinners asset groups and $41.1 million related to the expected disposal loss on the In-Store Bakery facilities. In 2019, on a discontinued operations basis, we incurred a total of $141.0 million of non-cash impairment charges, comprised of $66.5 million related to long-lived asset impairment in the Snacks segment and the expected disposal loss on the RTE Cereal transaction of $74.5 million. These impairments and any future impairments on goodwill or long-lived assets could adversely impact our future financial position and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to anticipate changes in consumer preferences, which may result in decreased demand for our products.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to anticipate the tastes, quality demands, eating habits, and overall purchasing trends of consumers and to offer products that appeal to their preferences. Consumer preferences change from time to time, and our failure to anticipate, identify, or react to these changes could result in reduced demand for our products, which would adversely affect our operating results and profitability.\nNew laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations could adversely affect our business.\nThe food industry is subject to a variety of federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations, including those related to food safety, food labeling (including the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act (NLEA) and Bioengineered (BE) Labeling Declaration), and environmental matters. Governmental regulations also affect taxes and levies, healthcare costs, energy usage, international trade, immigration, and other labor issues, all of which may have a direct or indirect effect on our business or those of our customers or suppliers. Changes in these laws or regulations, or the introduction of new laws or regulations, could increase the costs of doing business for the Company, our customers, or suppliers, or restrict our actions, causing our results of operations to be adversely affected.\nOur indebtedness and our ability to service our debt could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had $2,122.7 million of outstanding indebtedness, including a $458.4 million term loan (\u201cTerm Loan A\u201d) maturing on January 31, 2025, a $681.6 million term loan (\u201cTerm Loan A-1\u201d and, together with Term Loan A, the \u201cTerm Loans\u201d) maturing on February 1, 2023, $375.9 million of 4.875% notes due March 15, 2022 (the \u201c2022 Notes\u201d), $602.9 million of 6.0% notes due February 15, 2024 (the \u201c2024 Notes\u201d), and $3.9 million of finance lease obligations and other debt. The Revolving Credit Facility (as defined in Note 13) and the Term Loans are known collectively as the \u201cCredit Agreement.\u201d The degree to which we are leveraged could have adverse consequences to us, limiting management's choices in responding to business, economic, regulatory and other competitive conditions. In addition, our ability to make scheduled payments on or refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. We may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, dispose of material assets or operations, seek additional debt or equity capital, or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. We may not be able to effect any such alternative measures, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms or at all and, even if successful, those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. In addition, we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur significant additional indebtedness in the future. Although the agreements governing our indebtedness contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and the additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these\nrestrictions could be substantial. These restrictions also will not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the risks described herein would increase.\nThe terms of the agreements governing our indebtedness may restrict our current and future operations.\nThe agreements governing our indebtedness contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our long-term best interest, including restrictions on our ability to: incur additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness; pay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem our capital stock; prepay, redeem, or repurchase certain subordinated debt; issue certain preferred stock or similar equity securities; make loans and investments; sell assets; incur liens; enter into transactions with affiliates; enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to pay dividends; and consolidate, merge, sell, or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets.\nIn addition, our Credit Agreement requires us to maintain a certain consolidated net leverage ratio tested on a quarterly basis. Our ability to meet these financial covenants can be affected by events beyond our control, and we may be unable to meet the required ratio.\nA breach of the covenants or restrictions under the agreements governing our indebtedness could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness. Such default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a cross acceleration or cross default provision applies. In addition, an event of default under the Credit Agreement may permit our lenders to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under those facilities. In the event our lenders or noteholders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings, we and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness. As a result of these restrictions, we may be:\n\u2022\nlimited in how we conduct our business;\n\u2022\nunable to raise additional debt or equity financing to operate during general economic or business downturns; or\n\u2022\nunable to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities.\nThese restrictions may affect our ability to grow in accordance with our strategy. In addition, our financial results, substantial indebtedness and credit ratings could materially adversely affect the availability and terms of our financing.\nDisruptions in the financial markets could impair our ability to fund our operations or limit our ability to expand our business.\nUnited States capital credit markets have experienced volatility, dislocations, and liquidity disruptions that caused tightened access to capital markets and other sources of funding. Capital and credit markets and the U.S. and global economies could be affected by additional volatility or economic downturns in the future. Events affecting the credit markets could have an adverse effect on other financial markets in the United States, which may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of common stock or other equity securities. There can be no assurance that future volatility or disruption in the capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing. Our business could also be negatively impacted if our suppliers or customers experience disruptions resulting from tighter capital and credit markets, or a slowdown in the general economy. Any of these risks could impair our ability to fund our operations or limit our ability to expand our business and could possibly increase our interest expense, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nMultiemployer pension plans could adversely affect our business.\nWe participate in various multiemployer pension plans administered by labor unions representing some of our employees. We make periodic contributions to these plans to allow them to meet their pension benefit obligations to their participants. Our required contributions to these funds could increase because of a shrinking contribution base as a result of the insolvency or withdrawal of other companies that currently contribute to these funds, inability or failure of withdrawing companies to pay their withdrawal liability, lower than expected returns on pension fund assets or other funding deficiencies. In the event that we withdraw from participation in one of these plans, then applicable law could require us to make an additional lump-sum contribution (\u201cwithdrawal liability\u201d) to the plan, and we would have to reflect that as an expense in our results of operations. Our withdrawal liability for any multiemployer plan would depend on the extent of the plan\u2019s funding of vested benefits. In the ordinary course of our renegotiation of collective bargaining agreements with labor unions that maintain these plans, we may decide to discontinue participation in a plan, and in that event, we could face a withdrawal liability.\nIncreases in interest rates may negatively affect earnings.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the aggregate principal amount of our debt instruments with exposure to interest rate risk was approximately $1,140.0 million, based on the outstanding debt balance of our Credit Agreement. As a result, higher interest rates will increase the cost of servicing our financial instruments with exposure to interest rate risk, and could materially reduce our profitability and cash flows. Certain of our variable rate debt currently uses LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate. LIBOR is the subject of recent proposals for reform. These reforms and other pressures may cause LIBOR to disappear entirely or to perform differently than in the past. The consequences of these developments with respect to LIBOR cannot be entirely predicted but could result in a change in the cost of our variable rate debt. In June 2016, we entered into $500.0 million of long-term interest rate swap agreements to lock into a fixed LIBOR rate base, beginning on January 31, 2017 and ending on February 28, 2020. In February 2018, we entered into an additional $1,625.0 million of staggered long-term interest rate swap agreements to lock into a fixed LIBOR base rate. As of December 31, 2019, each one percentage point change in LIBOR rates would result in an approximate $2.7 million change in the annual cash interest expense, before any principal payment, on our financial instruments with exposure to interest rate risk, including the impact of the $875 million in interest rate swap agreements that were effective in 2019.\nAs mentioned, the interest rates on some of our debt is tied to LIBOR. In July 2017, the head of the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority announced its intention to phase out the use of LIBOR by the end of 2021. The uncertainty regarding the future of LIBOR, as well as the transition from LIBOR to another benchmark rate or rates could have adverse impacts on our outstanding debt that currently use LIBOR as a benchmark rate, and ultimately, adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nFluctuations in foreign currencies may adversely affect earnings.\nThe Company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company\u2019s foreign subsidiaries purchase various inputs that are based in U.S. dollars; accordingly, the profitability of the foreign subsidiaries are subject to foreign currency transaction gains and losses that affect earnings. We manage the impact of foreign currency fluctuations related to raw material purchases using foreign currency contracts. We are also exposed to fluctuations in the value of our foreign currency investment in our Canadian subsidiaries, which includes Canadian dollar denominated intercompany notes. We translate the Canadian and Italian assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars at applicable exchange rates. Accordingly, we are exposed to volatility in the translation of foreign currency denominated earnings due to fluctuations in the values of the Canadian dollar and Euro, which may negatively impact the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial position.\nChanges in weather conditions, natural disasters, and other events beyond our control could adversely affect our results of operations.\nChanges in weather conditions, climate changes, and natural disasters such as floods, droughts, frosts, earthquakes, hurricanes, fires, or pestilence, may affect the cost and supply of commodities and raw materials. Additionally, these events could result in reduced supplies of raw materials. Our competitors may be affected differently by weather conditions and natural disasters depending on the location of their suppliers and operations. Further, changes in weather could impact consumer demand and our earnings may be affected by seasonal factors including the seasonality of our supplies and such changes in consumer demand. Damage or disruption to our production or distribution capabilities due to weather, natural disaster, fire, terrorism, pandemic, strikes, or other reasons could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products. Failure to take adequate steps to reduce the likelihood or mitigate the potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, particularly when a product is sourced from a single location, could adversely affect our business and results of operations, as well as require additional resources to restore our supply chain.\nOur business could be harmed by strikes or work stoppages by our employees.\nCurrently, collective bargaining agreements cover a significant number of our full-time distribution, production, and maintenance employees. A dispute with a union or employees represented by a union could result in production interruptions caused by work stoppages. If a strike or work stoppage were to occur, our results of operations could be adversely affected.", "PERMNO": 90775, "SIC": 2030, "TIC": "THS"}
