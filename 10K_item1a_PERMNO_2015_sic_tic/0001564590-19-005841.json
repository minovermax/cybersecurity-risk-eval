{"cik": "1374535", "company": "Altra Industrial Motion Corp.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nRisks Related to our Business and Industry\nWe operate in the highly competitive power transmission and motion control industries and if we are not able to compete successfully our business may be significantly harmed.\nWe operate in highly fragmented and very competitive markets in the power transmission and motion control industries. Some of our competitors have achieved substantially more market penetration in certain of the markets in which we operate, and some of our competitors are larger than us and have greater financial and other resources. With respect to certain of our products, we compete with divisions of our original equipment manufacturer customers. Competition in our business lines is based on a number of considerations, including quality, reliability, pricing, availability, and design and application engineering support. Our customers increasingly demand a broad product range and we must continue to develop our expertise in order to manufacture and market these products successfully. To remain competitive, regular investment in manufacturing, customer service and support, marketing, sales, research and development and intellectual property protection is required. In the future, we may not have sufficient resources to continue to make such investments and may not be able to maintain a competitive position within each of the markets we serve. We may have to adjust the prices of some of our products to stay competitive.\nAdditionally, some of our larger, more sophisticated customers are attempting to reduce the number of vendors from which they purchase in order to increase their efficiency. If we are not selected to become one of these preferred providers, we may lose market share in some of the markets in which we compete.\nThere is substantial and continuing pressure on major original equipment manufacturers and larger distributors to reduce costs, including the cost of products purchased from outside suppliers. As a result of cost pressures from customers, our ability to compete depends in part on their ability to generate production cost savings and, in turn, to find reliable, cost effective outside\nsuppliers to source components or manufacture their products. If we are unable to generate sufficient cost savings in the future to offset price reductions, then our gross margin could be materially adversely affected.\nGlobal economic changes or continued volatility and disruption in global financial markets could significantly impact our customers and suppliers, weaken the markets we serve and harm our operations and financial performance.\nGlobal economic and financial market conditions have been weak and/or volatile in recent years, and those conditions have adversely affected our business operations and are expected to continue to adversely affect our business. A weakening of current conditions or a future downturn may adversely affect our future results of operations and financial condition. Weak, challenging or volatile economic conditions in the end markets, businesses or geographic areas in which we sell our products could reduce demand for products and result in a decrease in sales volume for a prolonged period of time, which would have a negative impact on our future results of operations.\nFor example, with reports of slowing growth in China, questions about the health of the economy in the European Union, and continued debate around the potential impact of Brexit, our increased exposure to these markets with the Fortive Transaction, the Bauer Acquisition, the Svendborg Acquisition and the Stromag Acquisition, could have a significant negative impact on our future results and operations. Given the significance and widespread nature of these circumstances, the U.S., European, Chinese, and global economies could continue to face significant challenges for an indeterminate period of time.\nOur acquisition of businesses, joint ventures and strategic relationships, or our failure to successfully integrate such transactions into our business, could adversely affect our future results and the market price of our common stock.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we have made and expect to continue to make, acquisitions. Our continued growth may depend on our ability to identify and acquire companies that complement or enhance our business on acceptable terms. We may not be able to identify or complete future acquisitions. We may not be able to integrate successfully our recent acquisitions, or any future acquisitions, operate any acquired companies profitably or realize the potential benefits from these acquisitions.\nThese acquisitions and strategic relationships involve a number of financial, accounting, managerial, operational, legal, compliance and other risks and challenges, including the following, any of which could adversely affect our future results and the market price of our common stock:\n\u2022\nany acquired business, technology, service or product could under-perform relative to our expectations and the price that we paid for it, or not perform in accordance with our anticipated timetable;\n\u2022\nwe may incur or assume significant debt in connection with our acquisitions or strategic relationships;\n\u2022\nacquisitions or strategic relationships could cause our financial results to differ from our own or the investment community\u2019s expectations in any given period, or over the long-term;\n\u2022\npre-closing and post-closing earnings charges could adversely impact operating results in any given period, and the impact may be substantially different from period to period;\n\u2022\nacquisitions or strategic relationships could create demands on our management, operational resources and financial and internal control systems that we are unable to effectively address;\n\u2022\nwe could experience difficulty in integrating personnel, operations and financial and other controls and systems and retaining key employees and customers;\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to achieve cost savings or other synergies anticipated in connection with an acquisition or strategic relationship;\n\u2022\nwe may assume by acquisition or strategic relationship unknown liabilities, known contingent liabilities that become realized, known liabilities that prove greater than anticipated, internal control deficiencies or exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from the acquired company\u2019s activities. The realization of any of these liabilities or deficiencies may increase our expenses, adversely affect our financial position or cause us to fail to meet our public financial reporting obligations;\n\u2022\nin connection with acquisitions, we may enter into post-closing financial arrangements such as purchase price adjustments, earn-out obligations and indemnification obligations, which may have unpredictable financial results;\n\u2022\nin connection with acquisitions, we have recorded significant goodwill and other intangible assets on our balance sheet. If we are not able to realize the value of these assets, we may be required to incur charges relating to the impairment of these assets; and\n\u2022\nwe may have interests that diverge from those of strategic partners and we may not be able to direct the management and operations of the strategic relationship in the manner we believe is most appropriate, exposing us to additional risk.\nOur growth could suffer if the markets in which we sell our products and services experience cyclicality.\nOur growth will depend in part on the growth of the markets which we serve and on the U.S. and global economies in general. Some of the markets Altra serves are highly cyclical, such as the metals, mining and energy markets, including oil, gas and renewable energy. The A&S Business serves certain industries that have historically been cyclical and have experienced periodic downturns that have had a material adverse impact on demand for the products that the A&S Business offers. In such an environment, expected cyclical activity or sales may not occur or may be delayed and may result in significant quarter-to-quarter variability in our performance. Any of these factors could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations in any given period.\nChanges to U.S. trade policy, tariff and import/export regulations could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nChanges in U.S. or international social, political, regulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade, manufacturing, development and investment in the territories or countries where we currently sell our products or conduct our business, as well as any negative sentiment toward the U.S. as a result of such changes, could adversely affect our business. The U.S. presidential administration has instituted or proposed changes in trade policies that include the negotiation or termination of trade agreements, the imposition of higher tariffs on imports into the United States, economic sanctions on individuals, corporations or countries, and other government regulations affecting trade between the United States and other countries where we conduct our business. These measures could trigger retaliatory actions by affected countries, and certain foreign governments have instituted or are considering imposing trade sanctions on certain U.S. goods. It may be time-consuming and expensive for us to alter our business operations in order to adapt to or comply with any such changes. For example, any resulting increase to the costs of goods imported to the United States could require us to increase our prices to customers, which may reduce demand, or, if we are unable to increase prices, could result in lower margin on our products sold. The new tariffs and other changes in U.S. trade policy have the potential to adversely impact the U.S. economy or certain sectors thereof, our industry and the global demand for our products, and as a result, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nRisks associated with foreign government regulations and U.S. trade policy may affect our foreign operations and sourcing.\nOur businesses are subject to risks generally associated with doing business abroad, including foreign governmental regulation in the countries in which several of our manufacturing sources and facilities are located, such as Brazil, Canada, China, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, India, Mexico, Slovakia, St. Kitts, Sweden, Turkey and the United Kingdom (the \u201cU.K.\u201d). We believe that the issue of foreign governmental regulations that would impact our arrangements with our foreign manufacturing sources, is of particular concern with regard to countries such as China due to the less mature nature of the Chinese market economy and the historical involvement of the Chinese government in industry. If regulations were to render the conduct of business in a particular country undesirable or impracticable, if our current foreign manufacturing sources were for any other reason to cease doing business with us, or if we were in a position where we needed to relocate our manufacturing facilities due to regulations or other similar circumstances, such a development could have a material adverse effect on our product sales and on our supply, manufacturing, and distribution channels.\nOur business is also subject to risks associated with U.S. and foreign legislation and regulations relating to imports, including quotas, duties, tariffs or taxes, and other charges or restrictions on imports, which could adversely affect our operations and our ability to import products at current or increased levels. We cannot predict whether additional U.S. and foreign customs quotas, duties (including antidumping or countervailing duties), tariffs, taxes or other charges or restrictions, requirements as to where raw materials must be purchased, additional workplace regulations, or other restrictions on our imports will be imposed upon the importation of our products in the future or adversely modified, or what effect such actions would have on our costs of operations. For example, our products that are imported to the United States are subject to U.S. customs duties and, in the ordinary course of our business, we may from time to time be subject to claims by the U.S. Customs Service for duties and other charges. Factors that may influence the modification or imposition of these restrictions include the determination by the U.S. Trade Representative that a country has denied adequate intellectual property rights or fair and equitable market access to U.S. firms that rely on intellectual property, trade disputes between the United States and a country that leads to withdrawal of \"most favored nation\" status for that country, and economic and\npolitical changes within a country that are viewed unfavorably by the U.S. government. Future quotas, duties, or tariffs may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Future trade agreements could also provide our competitors with an advantage over us, or increase our costs, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Substantially all of our import operations are subject to customs duties imposed by the governments where our production facilities are located on imported products, including raw materials.\nAdverse conditions in the credit and capital markets may limit or prevent our and our customers\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 ability to borrow or raise capital, which could harm our operations and financial performance.\nAdverse conditions in the credit and financial markets could prevent us from obtaining financing, if the need arises. Our ability to invest in our global business and refinance or repay maturing debt obligations could require access to the credit and capital markets and sufficient bank credit lines to support cash requirements. If we are unable to access the credit and capital markets on commercially reasonable terms, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations.\nMoreover, while currently these conditions have not impaired our ability to access credit markets and finance our operations, there can be no assurance that there will not be a further deterioration in financial markets and confidence in major economies. In addition, a tight credit market may adversely affect the ability of our customers to obtain financing for significant purchases and operations and could result in a decrease in or cancellation of orders for our products and services as well as impact the ability of our customers to make payments. Similarly, a tight credit market may adversely affect our supplier base and increase the potential for one or more of our suppliers to experience financial distress or bankruptcy. These conditions would harm our business by adversely affecting our sales, results of operations, profitability, cash flows, financial condition and long-term anticipated growth rate, which could result in potential impairment of certain long-term assets including goodwill.\nWe must continue to invest in new technologies and manufacturing techniques; however, our ability to develop or adapt to changing technology and manufacturing techniques is uncertain and our failure to do so could place us at a competitive disadvantage.\nThe successful implementation of our business strategy requires us to invest continuously in new technologies and manufacturing techniques to evolve our existing products and introduce new products to meet our customers\u2019 needs in the industries we serve and want to serve.\nOur products are characterized by performance and specification requirements that mandate a high degree of manufacturing and engineering expertise. We believe that our customers rigorously evaluate their suppliers on the basis of a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nproduct quality and availability;\n\u2022\nprice competitiveness;\n\u2022\ntechnical expertise and development capability;\n\u2022\nreliability and timeliness of delivery;\n\u2022\nproduct design capability;\n\u2022\nmanufacturing expertise; and\n\u2022\nsales support and customer service.\nOur success depends on our ability to invest in new technologies and manufacturing techniques to continue to meet our customers\u2019 changing demands with respect to the above factors. We may not be able to make required capital expenditures and, even if we do so, we may be unsuccessful in addressing technological advances or introducing new products necessary to remain competitive within our markets. Furthermore, our own technological developments may not be able to produce a sustainable competitive advantage. If we fail to invest successfully in improvements to our technology and manufacturing techniques, our business may be materially adversely affected.\nOur operations are subject to international risks that could affect our operating results.\nOur net sales to customers outside North America represented approximately 49% of our total net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018. In addition, we sell products to domestic customers for use in their products sold overseas. We also source a significant portion of our products and materials from overseas. Our financial performance has been, and is expected to continue to be,\nadversely impacted by foreign currency exchange rates. Our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally, and our future results could be materially adversely affected by a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nexchange rate controls;\n\u2022\ntariffs or other trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;\n\u2022\npotentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws;\n\u2022\ninterest rates;\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nchanges in foreign intellectual property law;\n\u2022\ndiffering labor regulations;\n\u2022\nrequirements relating to withholding taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on our ability to own or operate subsidiaries, make investments or acquire new businesses in various jurisdictions;\n\u2022\npotential political instability and the actions of foreign governments; and\n\u2022\nrestrictions on our ability to repatriate dividends from our subsidiaries.\nIn addition, our international operations are governed by various U.S. laws and regulations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other similar laws that prohibit us and our business partners from making improper payments or offers of payment to foreign governments and their officials and political parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Any alleged or actual violations of these regulations may subject us to government scrutiny, severe criminal or civil sanctions and other liabilities.\nAs we continue to expand our business globally, our success will depend, in large part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with our international operations. However, any of these factors could materially adversely affect our international operations and, consequently, our operating results.\nOur operations depend on commercial activities and production facilities throughout the world, many of which may be located in jurisdictions that are subject to increased risks of disrupted production or commercial activities causing delays in shipments and loss of customers and revenue.\nWe operate businesses with manufacturing facilities worldwide, many of which are located outside the United States including in Brazil, Canada, China, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, India, Mexico, Russia, Slovakia, St. Kitts, Sweden, Turkey and the United Kingdom. Serving a global customer base requires that we place production in emerging markets to capitalize on market opportunities and cost efficiencies. Our international production facilities and operations and commercial activities could be disrupted by currency fluctuations and devaluation, capital and currency exchange controls, low or negative economic growth rates, natural disaster, labor strike, military activity or war, political unrest, terrorist activity, or public health concerns, particularly in emerging countries that are not well-equipped to handle such occurrences. Any such disruptions could materially adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on distributors and the loss of these distributors could adversely affect our business.\nIn addition to our direct sales force and manufacturer sales representatives, we depend on the services of distributors to sell our products and provide service and aftermarket support to our customers. We support an extensive distribution network, with over 3,000 distributor locations worldwide. During the year ended December 31, 2018, approximately 25% of our net sales from continuing operations were generated through distributors, on a pro forma basis giving effect to the Fortive Transaction. Almost all of the distributors with whom we transact business offer competitive products and services to our customers. In addition, the distribution agreements we have are typically non-exclusive and cancelable by the distributor after a short notice period. The loss of any major distributor or a substantial number of smaller distributors or an increase in the distributors\u2019 sales of our competitors\u2019 products to our customers could materially reduce our sales and profits.\nWe rely on estimated forecasts of our OEM customers\u2019 needs, and inaccuracies in such forecasts could materially adversely affect our business.\nWe generally sell our products pursuant to individual purchase orders instead of under long-term purchase commitments. Therefore, we rely on estimated demand forecasts, based upon input from our customers, to determine how much material to purchase and product to manufacture. Because our sales are based on purchase orders, our customers may cancel, delay or otherwise modify their purchase commitments with little or no consequence to them and with little or no notice to us. For these reasons, we generally have limited visibility regarding our customers\u2019 actual product needs. The quantities or timing required by our customers for our products could vary significantly. Whether in response to changes affecting the industry or a customer\u2019s specific business pressures, any cancellation, delay or other modification in our customers\u2019 orders could significantly reduce our revenue, impact our working capital, cause our operating results to fluctuate from period to period and make it more difficult for us to predict our revenue. In the event of a cancellation or reduction of an order, we may not have enough time to reduce operating expenses to minimize the effect of the lost revenue on our business and we may purchase too much inventory and spend more capital than expected, which may materially adversely affect our business.\nFrom time to time, our customers may experience deterioration of their businesses. In addition, during periods of economic difficulty, our customers may not be able to accurately estimate demand forecasts and may scale back orders in an abundance of caution. As a result, existing or potential customers may delay or cancel plans to purchase our products and may not be able to fulfill their obligations to us in a timely fashion. Such cancellations, reductions or inability to fulfill obligations could significantly reduce our revenue, impact our working capital, cause our operating results to fluctuate adversely from period to period and make it more difficult for us to predict our revenue.\nOur inability to efficiently utilize or re-negotiate minimum purchase requirements in certain supply agreements could decrease our profitability.\nOur ability to maintain and expand our business depends, in part, on our ability to continue to obtain raw materials and component parts on favorable terms from various suppliers. Agreements with some of our suppliers contain minimum purchase requirements. We can give no assurance that we will be able to utilize the minimum amount of raw materials or component parts that we are required to purchase under certain supply agreements which contain minimum purchase requirements. If we are required to purchase more raw materials or component parts than we are able to utilize in the operation of our business, the costs of providing our products would likely increase, which could decrease our profitability and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDisruption of our supply chain could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability, including manufacturing or distribution capabilities, and that of our suppliers, business partners and contract manufacturers, to make, move and sell products is critical to our success. Damage or disruption to our or their manufacturing or distribution capabilities due to weather, natural disaster, fire or explosion, terrorism, pandemics, strikes, repairs or enhancements at our facilities, excessive demand, raw material shortages, or other reasons, could impair our ability, and that of our suppliers, to manufacture or sell our products. Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as require additional resources to restore our supply chain.\nThe materials used to produce our products are subject to price fluctuations that could increase costs of production and adversely affect our profitability.\nThe materials used to produce our products, especially aluminum, copper and steel, are sourced on a global or regional basis and the prices of those materials are susceptible to price fluctuations due to supply and demand trends, transportation costs, government regulations and tariffs, changes in currency exchange rates, price controls, the economic climate and other unforeseen circumstances. If we are unable to continue to pass a substantial portion of such price increases on to our customers on a timely basis, our future profitability may be materially adversely affected. In addition, passing through these costs to our customers may also limit our ability to increase our prices in the future.\nDefects, quality issues, inadequate disclosure or misuse with respect to our products and capabilities could adversely affect our business, reputation and financial statements.\nDefects in, quality issues with respect to, or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to our products or the misuse of our products, could lead to lost profits and other economic damage, property damage, personal injury or other liability resulting in third-party claims, criminal liability, significant costs, damage to our reputation and loss of business. Any of these factors could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face potential product liability claims relating to products we manufacture or distribute, which could result in our having to expend significant time and expense to defend these claims and to pay material damages or settlement amounts.\nWe face a business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products is alleged to have resulted in injury or other adverse effects. We currently have several product liability claims against us with respect to our products. We may not be able to obtain product liability insurance on acceptable terms in the future, if at all, or obtain insurance that will provide adequate coverage against potential claims. Product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for long periods of time, regardless of the ultimate outcome. An unsuccessful product liability defense could exceed any insurance that we maintain and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or our ability to make payments under our debt obligations when due. In addition, we believe our business depends on the strong brand reputation we have developed. In the event that our reputation is damaged, we may face difficulty in maintaining our pricing positions with respect to some of our products, which would reduce our sales and profitability.\nWe also risk exposure to product liability claims in connection with products sold by businesses that we acquire. We cannot assure you that third parties that have retained responsibility for product liabilities relating to products manufactured or sold prior to our acquisition of the relevant business or persons from whom we have acquired a business that are required to indemnify us for certain product liability claims subject to certain caps or limitations on indemnification will in fact satisfy their obligations to us with respect to liabilities retained by them or their indemnification obligations. If those third parties become unable to or otherwise do not comply with their respective obligations including indemnity obligations, or if certain product liability claims for which we are obligated were not retained by third parties or are not subject to these indemnities, we could become subject to significant liabilities or other adverse consequences. Moreover, even in cases where third parties retain responsibility for product liabilities or are required to indemnify us, significant claims arising from products that we have acquired could have a material adverse effect on our ability to realize the benefits from an acquisition, could result in our reducing the value of goodwill that we have recorded in connection with an acquisition, or could otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nWe may be subject to litigation for a variety of claims, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn addition to product liability claims and securities class action litigation, which has often been brought against a company following a decline in the market price of its securities, we and our directors and officers may be subject to claims arising from our normal business activities. These may include claims, suits, and proceedings involving stockholder and fiduciary matters, intellectual property, labor and employment, wage and hour, commercial and other matters. The outcome of any litigation, regardless of its merits, is inherently uncertain. Any claims and lawsuits, and the disposition of such claims and lawsuits, could be time-consuming and expensive to resolve, divert management attention and resources, and lead to attempts on the part of other parties to pursue similar claims. Any adverse determination related to litigation or settlement or other resolution of a legal matter could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, harm our reputation or otherwise negatively impact our business.\nWe may be subject to work stoppages at our facilities, or our customers may be subjected to work stoppages, which could seriously impact our operations and the profitability of our business.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we employed approximately 9,300 people on a full-time basis, of whom approximately 3,700 were employed in the United States and approximately 5,600 were employed outside of the United States. Of our United States employees, approximately 665 were hourly-rated, unionized employees. Outside the United States, we have government-mandated collective bargaining arrangements and union contracts in certain countries, particularly in Europe where certain of our employees are represented by unions and/or works councils.\nThe Company believes that its relationship with employees is good. However, we are party to several U.S. and international collective bargaining arrangements and union contracts, and we may be unable to renew these agreements on terms that are satisfactory to us, if at all.\nIf our unionized workers or those represented by a works council were to engage in a strike, work stoppage or other slowdown in the future, we could experience a significant disruption of our operations. Such disruption could interfere with our ability to deliver products on a timely basis and could have other negative effects, including decreased productivity and increased labor costs. In addition, if a greater percentage of our work force becomes unionized, our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected.\nMoreover, many of our direct and indirect customers have unionized work forces. Strikes, work stoppages or slowdowns experienced by these customers or their suppliers could result in slowdowns or closures of assembly plants where our products are used and could cause cancellation of purchase orders with us or otherwise result in reduced revenues from these customers.\nChanges in labor or employment laws could increase our costs and may adversely affect our business.\nVarious federal, state and international labor and employment laws govern our relationship with employees and affect operating costs. These laws include minimum wage requirements, overtime, unemployment tax rates, workers\u2019 compensation rates paid, leaves of absence, mandated health and other benefits, and citizenship requirements. Significant additional government-imposed increases or new requirements in these areas could materially affect our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flow.\nIn the event our employee-related costs rise significantly, we may have to curtail the number of our employees or shut down certain manufacturing facilities. Any such actions would not only be costly but could also materially adversely affect our business.\nWe depend on the services of key executives, the loss of whom could materially harm our business.\nOur senior executives are important to our success because they are instrumental in setting our strategic direction, operating our business, maintaining and expanding relationships with distributors, identifying, recruiting and training key personnel, identifying expansion opportunities and arranging necessary financing. Losing the services of any of these individuals could adversely affect our business until a suitable replacement could be found. We believe that our senior executives could not easily be replaced with executives of equal experience and capabilities but we cannot prevent our key executives from terminating their employment with us. We do not maintain key person life insurance policies on any of our executives.\nIf we lose certain of our key sales, marketing or engineering personnel, our business may be adversely affected.\nOur success depends on our ability to recruit, retain and motivate highly skilled sales, marketing and engineering personnel. Competition for these persons in our industry is intense and we may not be able to successfully recruit, train or retain qualified personnel. If we fail to recruit and retain the necessary personnel, our business and our ability to obtain new customers, develop new products and provide acceptable levels of customer service could suffer. If certain of these key personnel were to terminate their employment with us, we may experience difficulty replacing them, and our business could be harmed.\nWe are subject to environmental laws that could impose significant costs on us and the failure to comply with such laws could subject us to sanctions and material fines and expenses.\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state, local, foreign and provincial environmental laws and regulations, including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air or water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the responsibility to investigate and clean up contaminated sites that are or were owned, leased, operated or used by us or our predecessors. Some of these laws and regulations require us to obtain permits, which contain terms and conditions that impose limitations on our ability to emit and discharge hazardous materials into the environment and periodically may be subject to modification, renewal and revocation by issuing authorities. Fines and penalties may be imposed for non-compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and the failure to have or to comply with the terms and conditions of required permits. From time to time, our operations may not be in full compliance with the terms and conditions of our permits. The operation of manufacturing plants entails risks related to compliance with environmental laws, requirements and permits, and a failure by us to comply with applicable environmental laws, regulations, or permits could result in civil or criminal fines, penalties, enforcement actions, third party claims for property damage and personal injury, requirements to clean up property or to pay for the costs of cleanup, or regulatory or judicial orders enjoining or curtailing operations or requiring corrective measures, including the installation of pollution control equipment or remedial actions. Moreover, if applicable environmental laws and regulations, or the interpretation or enforcement thereof, become more stringent in the future, we could incur capital or operating costs beyond those currently anticipated.\nCertain environmental laws in the United States, such as the federal Superfund law and similar state laws, impose liability for the cost of investigation or remediation of contaminated sites upon the current or, in some cases, the former site owners or operators and upon parties who arranged for the disposal of wastes or transported or sent those wastes to an off-site facility for treatment or disposal, regardless of when the release of hazardous substances occurred or the lawfulness of the activities giving rise to the release. Such liability can be imposed without regard to fault and, under certain circumstances, can be joint and several, resulting in one party being held responsible for the entire obligation. As a practical matter, however, the costs of investigation and remediation generally are allocated among the viable responsible parties on some form of equitable basis. Liability also may include damages to natural resources. In addition, from time to time, we are notified that we are a potentially responsible party and may have liability in connection with off-site disposal facilities. There can be no assurance that we will be able to resolve pending and future matters relating to off-site disposal facilities at all or for nominal sums.\nThere is contamination at some of our current facilities, primarily related to historical operations at those sites, for which we could be liable for the investigation and remediation under certain environmental laws. The potential for contamination also exists at other of our current or former sites, based on historical uses of those sites. Our costs or liability in connection with potential contamination conditions at our facilities cannot be predicted at this time because the potential existence of contamination has not been investigated or not enough is known about the environmental conditions or likely remedial requirements. Currently, with respect to certain of our facilities, other parties with contractual liability are addressing or have plans or obligations to address those\ncontamination conditions that may pose a material risk to human health, safety or the environment. In addition, there may be environmental conditions currently unknown to us relating to our prior, existing or future sites or operations or those of predecessor companies whose liabilities we may have assumed or acquired which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are being indemnified, or expect to be indemnified by third parties subject to certain caps or limitations on the indemnification, for certain environmental costs and liabilities associated with certain owned or operated sites. We cannot assure you that third parties who indemnify or who are expected to indemnify us for certain environmental costs and liabilities associated with certain owned or operated sites will in fact satisfy their indemnification obligations. If those third parties become unable to, or otherwise do not, comply with their respective indemnity obligations, or if certain contamination or other liability for which we are obligated is not subject to these indemnities, we could become subject to significant liabilities.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights, brands or technology effectively, which could allow competitors to duplicate or replicate the our technology and could adversely affect our ability to compete.\nWe rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as on license, non-disclosure, employee and consultant assignment and other agreements and domain names registrations in order to protect our proprietary technology and rights. Applications for protection of our intellectual property rights may not be allowed, and the rights, if granted, may not be maintained. In addition, third parties may infringe or challenge our intellectual property rights. In some cases, we rely on unpatented proprietary technology. It is possible that others will independently develop the same or similar technology or otherwise obtain access to our unpatented technology. In addition, in the ordinary course of our operations, we pursue potential claims from time to time relating to the protection of certain products and intellectual property rights, including with respect to some of our more profitable products. Such claims could be time-consuming, expensive and divert resources. If we are unable to maintain the proprietary nature of our technologies or proprietary protection of our brands, our ability to market or be competitive with respect to some or all of our products may be affected, which could reduce our sales and profitability.\nWe or our products could infringe on the intellectual property of others, which may cause us to engage in costly litigation and, if we are not successful, could cause us to pay substantial damages and prohibit us from selling our products.\nThird parties may assert infringement or other intellectual property claims against us based on their patents or other intellectual property claims, and we may have to pay substantial damages, possibly including treble damages, if it is ultimately determined that our products infringe. We may have to obtain a license to sell our products if it is determined that our products infringe upon another party\u2019s intellectual property. We might be prohibited from selling our products before we obtain a license, which, if available at all, may require us to pay substantial royalties. Even if infringement claims against us are without merit, defending these types of lawsuits takes significant time, may be expensive and may divert management attention from other business concerns.\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles comprises a significant portion of our total assets, and if we determine that goodwill or indefinite-lived intangibles become impaired in the future, net income in such years may be materially and adversely affected.\nGoodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations. Due to the acquisitions we have completed historically, goodwill comprises a significant portion of our total assets. In addition, indefinite lived intangibles, primarily tradenames and trademarks, comprise a significant portion of our total assets. We review goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles annually for impairment and any excess in carrying value over the estimated fair value is charged to the results of operations. Future reviews of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles could result in future reductions. Any reduction in net income resulting from the write down or impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles could adversely affect our financial results. If economic conditions deteriorate we may be required to impair goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles in future periods.\nUnplanned repairs or equipment outages could interrupt production and reduce income or cash flow.\nUnplanned repairs or equipment outages, including those due to natural disasters, could result in the disruption of our manufacturing processes. Any interruption in our manufacturing processes would interrupt our production of products, reduce our income and cash flow and could result in a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nOur operations are highly dependent on information technology infrastructure and failures in such infrastructure and failure to comply with data privacy laws or regulations could significantly affect our business.\nWe depend heavily on our information technology, or IT, infrastructure in order to achieve our business objectives both in our everyday business operations and perhaps even more so during our integration efforts related to acquisitions. If we experience a problem that impairs this infrastructure, such as a computer virus, natural disaster, act of terrorism, cyber-attack, electrical/telecommunications outage or failure or other problem with the functioning of an important IT application, or malware,\nphishing, or other intentional disruption, tampering or manipulation of our IT systems by an employee or unauthorized third party, the resulting disruptions could impede our ability to record or process orders, manufacture and ship in a timely manner, or otherwise carry on our business in the ordinary course. Any such events could cause us to lose revenue, could harm our relationships with or cause us to lose customers or suppliers and could require us to incur significant expense to eliminate these problems and address related security concerns. Information security risks also exist with respect to the use of portable electronic devices, such as smartphones and laptops, which are particularly vulnerable to loss and theft.\nCyber-attacks from computer hackers and cyber criminals and other malicious Internet-based activity continue to increase generally, and perpetrators of cyber-attacks may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, ransomware, malware, DNS attacks, wireless network attacks, phishing attempts, distributed denial of service attacks and other malicious software programs that attack our IT infrastructure and our networks. These cyber-attacks expose us to a variety of risks, including a risk of theft of substantial assets including cash. In addition, a cyber-attack may cause additional costs, such as investigative and remediation costs, and the costs of providing our suppliers, customers, or other potentially affected parties with notice of the breach, legal fees and the costs of any additional fraud detection activities required by law, a court or a third-party.\nTechniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems, to impersonate, or to otherwise seek to perpetrate fraudulent acts against commercial parties change frequently, are increasingly sophisticated and generally are not recognized until launched against a target. As a result, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. We cannot be certain that advances in cyber-capabilities or other developments will not compromise or breach the technology protecting our IT infrastructure and networks or our industrial machinery, software or hardware, and we can make no assurance that we will be able to detect, prevent, timely and adequately address or mitigate the negative effects of cyber-attacks or other security breaches. If such events affect our systems or products, our reputation and brand names could be materially damaged and use of our products may decrease.\nIf any one of these risks materializes, our business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe are also subject to an increasing number of evolving data privacy and security laws and regulations that impose requirements on us and our technology prior to certain use or transfer, storing, use, processing, disclosure and protection of data and prior to sale or use of certain technologies. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in the imposition of fines, penalties and other costs. For example, the European Union\u2019s implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation in 2018, the European Union\u2019s pending ePrivacy Regulation and California\u2019s implementation of its Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 and Connected Device Privacy Act of 2018 all could disrupt our ability to sell products and solutions or use and transfer data because such activities may not be in compliance with applicable law in certain jurisdictions.\nSystem failures, ineffective system implementation or disruptions, failure to comply with data privacy and security laws or regulations, or the compromise of security with respect to internal or external systems or portable electronic devices could damage our systems or infrastructure, subject us to liability claims or regulatory fines, penalties, or intervention, harm our reputation, interrupt our operations, disrupt customer operations and adversely affect our internal control over financial reporting, business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nIf we are unable to successfully implement enhancements to our Enterprise Resource Planning systems across our business operations or such implementation is delayed, our operations may be disrupted or become less efficient.\nWe are in the process of implementing enhancements to our Enterprise Resource Planning systems, with the aim of enabling management to achieve better control across our business operations through: improved quality, reliability and timeliness of information; improved integration and visibility of information stemming from different management functions and countries; and optimization and global management of corporate processes. The enhancements of these ERP systems pose several challenges relating to, among other things, training of personnel, communication of new rules and procedures, changes in corporate culture, migration of data, and the potential instability of the following implementation. If the remaining implementation of the enhancements is delayed, in whole or in part, our current ERP systems may not be sufficient to support our planned operations. In addition, we rely on third-party vendors to provide long-term software maintenance support and hosting services for our information systems. Software vendors may decide to discontinue further development, integration or long-term software maintenance support for our information systems, which may increase our operational expenses as well as disrupt the management of our business operations. In addition, we do not control the operation of any third party hosting facilities. These facilities are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures and similar events. They are also subject to break-ins, computer viruses, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and other misconduct. The occurrence of any of these disasters or other unanticipated problems with our third party hosting vendors could disrupt the management of, and have a material adverse effect on, our business operations. There can be no\nassurance that the enhancements to our ERP systems will be successfully implemented and failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nOur leverage could adversely affect our financial health and make us vulnerable to adverse economic and industry conditions.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had approximately $1,320.0 million outstanding and $295.8 million available under our Altra Revolving Credit Facility (as defined herein). In addition, as of December 31, 2018, we had approximately $400 million outstanding under the Notes (as defined herein). Our indebtedness has important consequences; for example, it could:\n\u2022\nmake it more challenging for us to obtain additional financing to fund our business strategy and acquisitions, debt service requirements, capital expenditures and working capital;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to interest rate changes and general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to finance acquisitions and to fund working capital, capital expenditures, research and development efforts and other general corporate activities;\n\u2022\nmake it difficult for us to fulfill our obligations under our credit and other debt agreements;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our markets; and\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors that have less debt.\nSubstantially all of the domestic personal property of Altra and our domestic subsidiaries and certain shares of certain non-domestic subsidiaries have been pledged as collateral against any outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement dated October 1, 2018 (as amended from time to time, the \u201cAltra Credit Agreement\u201d) governing the Altra Revolving Credit Facility. In addition, the Altra Credit Agreement requires us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy certain financial condition tests, which may require that we take action to reduce our debt or to act in a manner contrary to our business objectives.\nIn the future, the then current economic and credit market conditions may limit our access to additional capital, to the extent that the Altra Credit Agreement would otherwise permit additional financing, or may preclude our ability to refinance our existing indebtedness. There can be no assurance that there will not be a deterioration in the credit markets, a deterioration in the financial condition of our lenders or their ability to fund their commitments or, if necessary, that we will be able to find replacement financing, if need be, on similar or acceptable terms. An inability to access sufficient financing or capital could have an adverse impact on our operations and thus on our operating results and financial position.\nThe Altra Credit Agreement imposes significant operating and financial restrictions, which may prevent us from pursuing our business strategies or favorable business opportunities.\nSubject to a number of important exceptions, under the Altra Credit Agreement we are subject to customary affirmative and negative covenants, such as limitations on:\n\u2022\ndebt and preferred stock;\n\u2022\nliens;\n\u2022\nmergers, consolidations, liquidations, dissolutions and asset sales;\n\u2022\ninvestments, loans, advances, guarantees and acquisitions;\n\u2022\nspeculative swaps and hedging arrangements;\n\u2022\ndividends or other distributions on capital stock, redemptions and repurchases of capital stock and prepayments, redemptions and repurchases of junior lien secured and subordinated debt;\n\u2022\ntransactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on liens and other restrictive agreements;\n\u2022\namendments of the operative documents related to junior debt agreements and organizational documents; and\n\u2022\nchanges in fiscal year\nThe restrictions contained in the Altra Credit Agreement may prevent us from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interest of our business and may make it difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy or effectively compete with companies that are not similarly restricted. A breach of any of these covenants or the inability to comply with the required financial ratios could result in a default under the Altra Credit Agreement. If any such default occurs, the lenders under the Altra Credit Agreement may elect to declare all of the outstanding debt under the Altra Credit Agreement, together with accrued interest and other amounts payable thereunder, to be immediately due and payable. The lenders under the Altra Credit Agreement also have the right in those circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings. In addition, following an event of default under the Altra Credit Agreement, the lenders under the Altra Credit Agreement will have the right to proceed against the collateral that secures the debt. If the debt under the Altra Credit Agreement were to be accelerated, we may not have the ability to refinance that debt, and if we can, the terms of such refinancing may be less favorable than the current financing terms under the Altra Credit Agreement. In the event that the indebtedness is accelerated, our assets may not be sufficient to repay in full all of our debt.\nWe face risks associated with our exposure to variable interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.\nWe are exposed to various types of market risk in the normal course of business, including the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Some of our indebtedness bears interest at variable rates, generally linked to market benchmarks such as LIBOR. Any increase in interest rates would increase our finance expenses relating to our variable rate indebtedness and increase the costs of refinancing our existing indebtedness and issuing new debt. In addition, in July 2017, the U.K.\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced its intent to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. It is not possible to predict the effect of this announcement, including whether LIBOR will continue in place, and if so what changes will be made to it, what alternative reference rates may replace LIBOR in use going forward and how LIBOR will be determined for purposes of loans, securities and derivative instruments currently referencing it if it ceases to exist. If the method for calculation of LIBOR changes, if LIBOR is no longer available or if lenders have increased costs due to changes in LIBOR, we may suffer from potential increases in interest rates on our floating debt rate. Further, we may need to renegotiate our indebtedness documents to replace LIBOR with the new standard that is established. These uncertainties or their resolution also could negatively impact our funding costs, loan and other asset values, asset-liability management strategies and other aspects of our business and financial results. In addition, we conduct our business and incur costs in the local currency of the countries in which we operate. As we continue expanding our business into markets such as Europe, China, Australia, India and Brazil, we expect that an increasing percentage of our revenue and cost of sales will be denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, our reporting currency. As a result, we are subject to currency translation risk, whereby changes in exchange rates between the dollar and the other currencies in which we borrow and do business could result in foreign exchange losses and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe are exposed to swap counterparty credit risk that could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nFrom time to time, we rely on interest rate swap contracts and cross-currency swap contracts and hedging arrangements to effectively manage our interest rate and currency risk. Failure to perform under derivatives contracts by one or more of our counterparties could disrupt our hedging operations, particularly if we were entitled to a termination payment under the terms of the contract that we did not receive, if we had to make a termination payment upon default of the counterparty, or if we were unable to reposition the swap with a new counterparty.\nWe are subject to tax laws and regulations in many jurisdictions and the inability to successfully defend claims from taxing authorities related to our current or acquired businesses could adversely affect our operating results and financial position.\nWe conduct business in many countries, which requires us to interpret the income tax laws and rulings in each of those taxing jurisdictions. Due to the subjectivity of tax laws between those jurisdictions as well as the subjectivity of factual interpretations, our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments. Claims from taxing authorities related to these differences could have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial position. Moreover, changes to tax laws and regulations in the U.S. or other countries where we do business could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial position.\nChanges in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities or assessments could significantly affect our profitability. In addition, audits by tax authorities could result in additional tax payments for prior periods.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and in numerous non-U.S. jurisdictions. On December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\u201cTCJA\u201d) that significantly reformed the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d). The TCJA, among other things, includes changes to U.S. federal tax rates, including reduction of the corporate tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35% to a flat rate of 21%, limitations of the tax deduction for interest expense to 30% of adjusted earnings (except for certain small businesses), limitations of the deduction for net operating losses to 80% of current year taxable income and\nelimination of net operating loss carrybacks, one time taxation of offshore earnings at reduced rates regardless of whether they are repatriated, elimination of U.S. tax on foreign earnings (subject to certain important exceptions), immediate deductions for certain new investments instead of deductions for depreciation expense over time, modifying or repealing many business deductions and credits and putting into effect the migration from a \u201cworldwide\u201d system of taxation to a territorial system. The U.S. Treasury Department and IRS continue to issue regulations with respect to implementing the TCJA and further regulations are expected to be issued. Notwithstanding the reduction in the corporate income tax rate, the overall impact of the recent federal tax law is uncertain and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected. In addition, it is uncertain if and to what extent various states will adjust their policies in response to the recently enacted federal tax law. The impact of this tax reform as well as other tax laws and regulations in the U.S. or other countries where we do business on holders of our common stock and our operating results and financial position is uncertain and could be adverse.\nDue to the potential for changes to tax laws and regulations or changes to the interpretation thereof (including regulations and interpretations pertaining to the TCJA), the ambiguity of tax laws and regulations, the subjectivity of factual interpretations, the complexity of our intercompany arrangements, uncertainties regarding the geographic mix of earnings in any particular period, and other factors, our estimates of effective tax rate and income tax assets and liabilities may be incorrect and our financial statements could be adversely affected. The impact of these factors referenced in the first sentence of this paragraph may be substantially different from period-to-period.\nIn addition, the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by U.S. federal, state and local tax authorities and by non-U.S. tax authorities. If audits result in payments or assessments different from our reserves, our future results may include unfavorable adjustments to our tax liabilities and our financial statements could be adversely affected. Any further significant changes to the tax system in the United States or in other jurisdictions (including changes in the taxation of international income as further described below) could adversely affect our financial statements.\nCertain of our businesses are exposed to renewable energy markets which depend significantly on the availability and size of government subsidies and economic incentives.\nCertain of our businesses sell product to customers within the renewable energy market, which among other energy sources includes wind energy and solar energy. This market is inherently cyclical and can be impacted by governmental policy, the comparative cost differential between various forms of energy, and the general macroeconomic climate.\nAt present, the cost of many forms of renewable energy may exceed the cost of conventional power generation in locations around the world. Various governments have used different policy initiatives to encourage or accelerate the development and adoption of renewable energy sources such as wind energy and solar energy. Renewable energy policies are in place in the European Union, certain countries in Asia, including China, Japan and South Korea, and many of the states in Australia and the United States. Examples of government sponsored financial incentives include capital cost rebates, feed-in tariffs, tax credits, net metering and other incentives to end-users, distributors, system integrators and manufacturers of renewable energy products to promote the use of renewable energy and to reduce dependency on other forms of energy. Governments may decide to reduce or eliminate these economic incentives for political, financial or other reasons. Reductions in, or eliminations of, government subsidies and economic incentives could reduce demand for our products and, as our customers attempt to compete on a levelized playing field with other forms of nonrenewable energy, also increase pressure to reduce cost throughout the supply chain. Lower demand or increased pricing pressure could adversely affect our business prospects and results of operations.\nRegulations related to conflict minerals could adversely impact our business\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act contains provisions to improve transparency and accountability concerning the supply of certain minerals, known as conflict minerals, originating from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and adjoining countries. As a result, in August 2012 the SEC adopted annual disclosure and reporting requirements for those companies who use conflict minerals mined from the DRC and adjoining countries in their products. These new requirements required country of origin inquiries and potentially due diligence, with initial disclosure requirements beginning in May 2014 relating to activities in 2013. There have been and will continue to be costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including for country of origin inquiries and due diligence to determine the sources of conflict minerals used in our products and other potential changes to products, processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. These rules could adversely affect the sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in our products. As there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering \u201cconflict free\u201d conflict minerals, we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain necessary conflict minerals from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Also, we may face reputational challenges if we determine that certain of our products contain minerals not determined to be conflict free or if we are unable to verify sufficiently the origins for all conflict minerals used in our products through the procedures we have implemented.\nWe face risks associated with the Stromag Acquisition and the Fortive Transaction.\nIn connection with the Stromag Acquisition and the Fortive Transaction, we are subject to substantially all of the liabilities of Stromag and the A&S Business, respectively, that were not satisfied on or prior to the corresponding closing date. There may be liabilities that we underestimated or did not discover in the course of performing our due diligence investigation of Stromag and the A&S Business. Under the related purchase agreements, the sellers agreed to provide us with a limited set of representations and warranties, including with respect to outstanding and potential liabilities. Damages resulting from a breach of a representation or warranty could have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, and there is no guarantee we would actually be able to recover all or any portion of the sums payable in connection with such breach.\nWe may not be able to achieve the efficiencies, savings and other benefits anticipated from our cost reduction, margin improvement and other business optimization initiatives.\nWe have in the past undertaken and expect to continue to undertake various restructuring activities and cost reduction initiatives in an effort to better align our organizational structure and costs with our strategy. We cannot assure you that we will be able to achieve all of the cost savings that we expect to realize from current or future activities and initiatives. Furthermore, in connection with these activities, we may experience a disruption in our ability to perform functions important to our strategy. Unexpected delays, increased costs, challenges with adapting our internal control environment to a new organizational structure, inability to retain and motivate employees or other challenges arising from these initiatives could adversely affect our ability to realize the anticipated savings or other intended benefits of these activities and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results.\nThe uncertainty surrounding the implementation and effect of Brexit and related negative developments in the European Union could adversely affect our business and financial results. The vote by the U.K. to leave the European Union could adversely affect us.\nIn a Referendum of the U.K. held on June 23, 2016, the UK voted to leave the European Union (E.U.) (referred to as Brexit), which could cause disruptions to and create uncertainty surrounding our business, including affecting our relationships with our existing and future customers, suppliers and employees, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial results and operations. The formal process for U.K. leaving the E.U. began in March 2017, when the U.K. served notice to the European Council under Article 50 of the Treaty of Lisbon. The U.K. is currently due to exit the E.U. on March 29, 2019. The long-term nature of the U.K.\u2019s relationship with the E.U. is unclear and there is considerable uncertainty when any withdrawal agreement or long-term relationship strategy, including trade deals, will be agreed to and implemented. The political and economic instability created by Brexit has caused and may continue to cause significant volatility in global financial markets and uncertainty regarding the regulation of data protection in the U.K. Brexit could also have the effect of disrupting the free movement of goods, services, and people between the U.K., the E.U. and elsewhere. The effects of Brexit will depend on any agreements the U.K. makes to retain access to E.U. markets either during a transitional period or more permanently. Discussions between the U.K. and the E.U. focused on finalizing withdrawal issues and transition agreements are ongoing. However, limited progress to date in these negotiations and ongoing uncertainty within the U.K. Government and Parliament sustains the possibility of the U.K. leaving the E.U. on March 29, 2019 without a withdrawal agreement and associated transition period in place, which is likely to cause significant market and economic disruption. If the U.K. leaves the E.U. with no agreement, it will likely have an adverse impact on labor and trade in addition to creating further short-term uncertainty and currency volatility. In the absence of a future trade deal, the U.K.\u2019s trade with the United States, the E.U. and the rest of the world would be subject to tariffs and duties set by the World Trade Organization. The measures could potentially disrupt the markets we serve and the tax jurisdictions in which we operate and adversely change tax benefits or liabilities in these or other jurisdictions, and may cause us to lose customers, suppliers, and employees. Brexit may also have unfavorable impacts on foreign currency exchange rates that increase our costs or reduce our reported results in dollar terms. In addition, Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the U.K. determines which E.U. laws to replace or replicate. Further, in the Brexit Referendum, Scotland voted to remain in the E.U., while England and Wales voted to exit. The disparity has renewed the Scottish independence movement. Scottish leaders have publicly stated that a second independence referendum will not be held until after the terms of the Brexit are clear; however, plans may change. Political issues and a potential breakup of the U.K. could create legal and economic uncertainty in the region and have a material adverse effect on the Company and other economies in which we operate. There can be no assurance that any or all of these events, or others that we cannot anticipate at this time, will not have a material adverse effect on our business operations, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate with market volatility.\nThe market price of our common stock has been volatile and may continue to fluctuate in response to a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control. The stock market in general, and the market prices of stocks of industrial companies in particular, have experienced significant price volatility that has adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, the market price of our common stock for reasons unrelated to our business or operating results. Broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our common stock, which in turn could cause impairment of goodwill that could materially and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nIt is not uncommon when the market price of a stock has been volatile for holders of that stock to institute securities class action litigation against the company that issues that stock. If any of our stockholders brought such a lawsuit against us, even if the lawsuit is without merit, we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit beyond any insurance coverage which we may have for such risks. Such a lawsuit could also divert the time and attention of our management. Any of these events, as well as other circumstances discussed in these Risk Factors, may cause the market price of our common stock to fall.\nRisks Related to the Fortive Transaction\nThe Fortive Transaction may not achieve its anticipated benefits.\nWe may not be able to successfully realize anticipated growth opportunities or integrate our business and operations with the A&S Business\u2019s business and operations. Following completion of the Fortive Transaction, we have significantly more revenue, expenses, assets and employees than we did prior to the Fortive Transaction. In the Fortive Transaction, we assumed certain liabilities of the A&S Business and other obligations (including collective bargaining agreements and certain non-U.S. pension obligations with respect to transferred employees). We may not successfully or cost-effectively integrate the A&S Business\u2019s business and operations into our existing business and operations. Even if we are able to integrate the combined businesses and operations successfully, this integration may not result in the realization of the full benefits of the growth and other opportunities that we currently expect within the anticipated time frame, or at all.\nThe failure to successfully integrate the A&S Business into our business within the expected timetable could adversely affect our future results and the market price of our common stock.\nThe success of the Fortive Transaction depends, in large part, on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the Fortive Transaction to our sales and profitability. To realize these anticipated benefits, we must successfully integrate the A&S Business into our businesses. This integration will be complex and time-consuming. The failure to successfully integrate and manage the challenges presented by the integration process may result in the failure to achieve some or all of the anticipated benefits of the Fortive Transaction.\nPotential difficulties that may be encountered in the integration process include, among others:\n\u2022\nthe failure to implement our business plan;\n\u2022\nlost sales and customers as a result of customers of Altra or the A&S Business deciding not to do business with us;\n\u2022\nrisks associated with managing a larger and more complex business;\n\u2022\nintegrating personnel of Altra and the A&S Business while maintaining focus on providing consistent, high-quality products and service to customers;\n\u2022\nthe loss of key employees;\n\u2022\nunanticipated issues in integrating manufacturing, logistics, information, communications and other systems;\n\u2022\npossible inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures, policies and compensation structures;\n\u2022\nthe impact on our internal controls and compliance with the regulatory requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002; and\n\u2022\npotential unknown liabilities and unforeseen expenses associated with the Fortive Transaction.\nIf any of these events were to occur, our ability to maintain relationships with customers, suppliers and employees or our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the Fortive Transaction could be adversely affected, or could reduce our sales or earnings or otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results and, as a result, adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nThe significant costs related to the Fortive Transaction could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, cash flows and operating results.\nDuring 2018, we incurred one-time costs in connection with the Fortive Transaction, including approximately $69 million in transaction-related costs (of which $33 million will be capitalized), and we expect to incur approximately $24 in non-recurring implementation costs during the first three years from the A&S Closing Date that Altra management believes are necessary to realize the anticipated synergies from the Fortive Transaction. For the three months ended and the year ended December 31, 2018, acquisition-related costs included approximately $24 million and approximately $36 million, respectively, associated with advisory, legal, accounting, integration and other professional fees. The incurrence of these costs may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, cash flows and operating results in the periods in which they are incurred.\nThe substantial amount of indebtedness that we incurred to consummate the Fortive Transaction could materially adversely affect our financial conditions.\nOur level of indebtedness increased in connection with the Fortive Transaction, as discussed in Note 10, Long Term Debt. Our increased level of indebtedness could have important consequences, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to accommodate growth by reducing funds otherwise available for other corporate purposes and to compete, which in turn could prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our indebtedness;\n\u2022\nlimiting our operational flexibility due to the covenants contained in our debt agreements;\n\u2022\nrequiring us to dispose of significant assets in order to satisfy our debt service and other obligations if we are not able to satisfy these obligations from cash from operations or other sources;\n\u2022\nto the extent that our debt is subject to floating interest rates, increasing our vulnerability to fluctuations in market interest rates;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to buy back our common stock or pay cash dividends;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or industry or economic conditions, thereby limiting our ability to compete with companies that are not as highly leveraged; and\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to economic downturns.\nOur ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make scheduled payments on our debt will depend on a range of economic, competitive and business factors, many of which are outside our control. There can be no assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make these payments. If we are unable to meet our expenses and debt obligations, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness before maturity, sell assets or issue additional equity. We may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness, sell assets or issue additional equity on commercially reasonable terms or at all, which could cause us to default on our obligations and impair our liquidity. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our debt obligations on commercially reasonable terms, would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as on our ability to satisfy our debt obligations.\nOur ability to comply with the financial maintenance covenants in the Altra Revolving Credit Facility cannot be assured.\nThe Altra Revolving Credit Facility contains certain financial maintenance covenants requiring Altra to not exceed a maximum consolidated senior secured net leverage ratio and to maintain a minimum consolidated cash interest coverage ratio. There can be no assurance that we will be able to remain in compliance with these ratios. If we fail to comply with either of these covenants in a future period and are not able to obtain waivers from the lenders thereunder, we would need to refinance the Altra Revolving Credit Facility. However, there can be no assurance that such refinancing would be available on terms that would be acceptable to us or at all.\nWe are required to abide by potentially significant restrictions under the Tax Matters Agreement which could limit our ability to undertake certain corporate actions (such as the issuance of Altra common stock or the undertaking of a merger or consolidation) that otherwise could be advantageous.\nTo preserve the tax-free treatment to Fortive and/or its stockholders of the Distribution and certain related transactions, under the Tax Matters Agreement, we are restricted from taking certain actions that could prevent such transactions from being tax-free. These restrictions may limit our ability to pursue certain strategic transactions or engage in other transactions, including using Altra\ncommon stock to make acquisitions and in connection with equity capital market transactions that might increase the value of our business.\nOur estimates and judgements related to the acquisition accounting models used to record the purchase price allocation may be inaccurate.\nWe made significant accounting judgments and estimates for the application of acquisition accounting under GAAP, and the underlying valuation models. Our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted in future periods if our accounting judgments and estimates related to these models prove to be inaccurate.\nWe may be required to recognize impairment charges for goodwill and other intangible assets.\nThe Fortive Transaction added approximately $2.9 billion of goodwill and other intangible assets to our consolidated balance sheet. In accordance with GAAP, management periodically assesses these assets to determine if they are impaired. Significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets, divestitures and market capitalization declines may impair goodwill and other intangible assets. Any charges relating to such impairments would adversely affect results of operations in the periods recognized.\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected if we cannot negotiate terms that are as favorable as those that Fortive had received prior to the closing of the Fortive Transaction.\nPrior to consummation of the Fortive Transaction, certain functions (such as treasury, cash management, tax compliance, benefits, corporate development, internal audit, purchasing and information systems) for the A&S Business were generally performed or supported under centralized systems that were not transferred to us and, in some cases, under contracts that are also used for Fortive\u2019s other businesses and which were not assigned to us with the A&S Business. In addition, some other contracts that Fortive or its subsidiaries are a party to on behalf of the A&S Business require consents of their parties to assign them. While Fortive, under the Transition Services Agreement, has agreed to provide us with certain limited services, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain those consents or negotiate terms that are as favorable as those Fortive had received when and if we replace these services with our own agreements for similar services. Although we believe that we will be able to obtain any such consents or enter into new agreements for similar services, it is possible that the failure to obtain consents for or replace a significant number of these agreements for any of these services or to replace them on terms that as are as favorable as those Fortive had received could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success also depends on relationships with third parties and pre-existing customers of Altra and the A&S Business, which relationships may be affected by customer or third-party preferences or public attitudes about the Fortive Transaction. Any adverse changes in these relationships could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operation.\nOur success will depend in part on our ability to maintain and renew relationships with pre-existing customers, suppliers and other third parties of both Altra and the A&S Business, and our ability to establish new relationships. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain and renew pre-existing contracts and other business relationships, or enter into or maintain new contracts and other business relationships, on acceptable terms, if at all. The failure to maintain important business relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.", "PERMNO": 91658, "SIC": 3560, "TIC": "AIMC"}
