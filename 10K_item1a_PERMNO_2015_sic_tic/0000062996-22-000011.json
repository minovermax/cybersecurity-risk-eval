{"cik": "62996", "company": "MASCO CORP /DE/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-08", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nThere are a number of business risks and uncertainties that could affect our business. These risks and uncertainties could cause our actual results to differ from past performance or expected results. We consider the following risks and uncertainties to be most relevant to our specific business activities. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently believe to be immaterial, also may adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial position.\nCoronavirus Disease Risks\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has and may continue to impact our operations, which may impact our results and our financial condition.\nThe spread of COVID-19 created a global health crisis that resulted in widespread disruption to economic activity, both in the U.S. and globally.\nWe operate facilities in the United States and around the world which have been and may continue to be adversely affected by this pandemic, including the closure or reduced capacity of certain of our facilities; delays or disruptions in our ability to source raw materials, components and products; constraints in shipping, transportation and logistics; and decreased employee availability. Due to the uncertain duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are unable to fully estimate the extent of the impact it may have on the markets in which we operate or our business. The extent of such impact will depend on a number of factors, including the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, its effect on our customers, suppliers and employees, its effect on domestic and international economies and markets, including consumer discretionary spending, and the response of governmental authorities. A prolonged disruption of our operations or slowdown in domestic and international economic activity could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nTo the extent COVID-19 continues to impact our business and our operations, it may also have the effect of heightening certain of the other risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, such as those relating to our international operations and global strategies and our dependence on third-party suppliers.\nStrategic Risks\nOur business strategy is focused on residential repair and remodeling activity and, to a lesser extent, on new home construction activity, both of which are impacted by a number of economic factors and other factors.\nOur business relies on residential repair and remodeling activity and, to a lesser extent, on new home construction activity. A number of factors impact consumers\u2019 spending on home improvement projects as well as new home construction activity, including:\n\u2022consumer confidence levels;\n\u2022fluctuations in home prices;\n\u2022existing home sales;\n\u2022unemployment and underemployment levels;\n\u2022consumer income and debt levels;\n\u2022household formation;\n\u2022the availability of skilled tradespeople for repair and remodeling work;\n\u2022the availability of home equity loans and mortgages and the interest rates for and tax deductibility of such loans;\n\u2022trends in lifestyle and housing design; and\n\u2022natural disasters, terrorist acts, pandemics or other catastrophic events.\nThe fundamentals driving our business are impacted by economic cycles. Adverse changes or uncertainty involving the factors listed above, an economic contraction or inflationary pressures could result in a decline in residential repair and remodeling activity or in demand for new home construction, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.\nWe may not achieve all of the anticipated benefits of our strategic initiatives.\nWe continue to pursue our strategic initiatives of investing in our brands, developing innovative products, and focusing on operational excellence through the Masco Operating System, our methodology to drive growth and productivity. These initiatives are designed to grow revenue, improve profitability and increase shareholder value over the mid- to long-term. Our business performance and results could be adversely affected if we are unable to successfully execute these initiatives or if we are unable to execute these initiatives in a timely and efficient manner. We could also be adversely affected if we have not appropriately prioritized and balanced our initiatives or if we are unable to effectively manage change throughout our organization.\nWe may not be able to successfully execute our acquisition strategy or integrate businesses that we acquire.\nPursuing the acquisition of businesses complementary to our portfolio is a component of our strategy for future growth. If we are not able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or consummate potential acquisitions within a desired time frame or at acceptable terms and prices, our long-term competitive positioning may be affected. Even if we are successful in acquiring businesses, the businesses we acquire may not be able to achieve the revenue, profitability or growth we anticipate, or we may experience challenges and risks in integrating these businesses into our existing business. Such risks include:\n\u2022difficulties realizing expected synergies and economies of scale;\n\u2022diversion of management attention and our resources;\n\u2022unforeseen liabilities;\n\u2022issues or conflicts with our new or existing customers or suppliers; and\n\u2022difficulties in retaining critical employees of the acquired businesses.\nInternational acquisitions that we have made, and international acquisitions that we may make in the future may continue to increase our exposure to foreign currency risks and risks associated with interpretation and enforcement of foreign regulations. Our failure to address these risks could cause us to incur additional costs and fail to realize the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.\nBusiness and Operational Risks\nVariability in the cost and availability of our raw materials, component parts and finished goods could affect our results of operations and financial position.\nWe purchase substantial amounts of raw materials, component parts and finished goods from outside sources, including international sources, and we manufacture certain of our products outside of the United States. Increases in the cost of the materials we purchase, including as a result of availability, tariffs and inflation, have in the past and may in the future increase the prices for our products. Further, our production could be affected if we or our suppliers are unable to procure our requirements for various commodities, including, among others, brass, resins, titanium dioxide and zinc, or if a shortage of these commodities results in significantly increased costs. Rising energy costs could also increase our production and transportation costs. In addition, water is a significant component of our architectural coatings products and may be subject to shortages and restrictions on supply in certain regions, due to climate-related and other influences. These factors could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.\nIt can be difficult for us to pass on to customers our cost increases. Our existing arrangements with customers, competitive considerations and customer resistance to price increases may delay or make us unable to adjust selling prices. If we are not able to sufficiently increase the prices of our products or achieve cost savings to offset increased material and production costs, our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected. Increased selling prices for our products have and may in the future lead to sales declines and loss of market share, particularly if those prices are not competitive. When our material costs decline, we have experienced and may in the future receive pressure from our customers to reduce our prices. Such reductions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.\nFrom time to time we enter into long-term agreements with certain significant suppliers to help ensure continued availability of the commodities we require to produce our products and to establish firm pricing, but at times these contractual commitments may result in our paying above market prices for commodities during the term of the contract. Occasionally, we may also use derivative instruments, including commodity futures and swaps. This strategy increases the possibility that we may make commitments for these commodities at prices that subsequently exceed their market prices, which has occurred and could occur in the future and may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.\nWe are dependent on third-party suppliers and service providers.\nWe are dependent on third parties for many of our products and components and for certain services. Our ability to offer a wide variety of products and provide high levels of service to our customers depend on our ability to obtain an adequate and timely supply of products and components. Failure of our suppliers to timely provide us quality products or services on commercially reasonable terms or to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements or our supplier business practices policies, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position or could damage our reputation. The operations of the third parties we depend on could be impacted by changing laws, regulations and policies, including those related to climate change, labor availability and by adverse weather conditions, pandemics, and other force majeure events, any of which could result in disruptions to their operations and result in shortages of supply, assertion of force majeure contract provisions and increases in the prices they charge for the raw materials, components and products they produce. Sourcing these products and components from alternate suppliers, including suppliers from new geographic regions, or re-engineering our products as a result of supplier disruptions, is time-consuming and costly and could result in inefficiencies or delays in our business operations or could negatively impact the quality of our products. In addition, the loss of critical suppliers, or a substantial decrease in the availability of products or components from our suppliers, has and could continue to disrupt our business and may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.\nMany of the suppliers we rely upon are located in foreign countries, primarily China. The differences in business practices, shipping and delivery requirements, changes in economic conditions and trade policies and laws and regulations, together with the limited number of suppliers, have increased the complexity of our supply chain logistics and the potential for interruptions in our production scheduling. We have experienced and may continue to experience constraints on and disruptions to transporting our raw materials, components and products from our international suppliers and have had to pay higher transportation costs. If we are unable to effectively manage our supply chain or if we continue to experience such transportation constraints, disruptions and higher costs for timely delivery of our products or components, our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected.\nThere are risks associated with our international operations and global strategies.\nIn 2021, 21 percent of our sales from continuing operations were made outside of North America (principally in Europe) and transacted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In addition to our European operations, we manufacture products in Asia and source products and components from third parties globally. Risks associated with our international operations include:\n\u2022differences in culture, economic and labor conditions and practices;\n\u2022the policies of the U.S. and foreign governments;\n\u2022disruptions in trade relations and economic instability;\n\u2022differences in enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights;\n\u2022timeliness of transportation and port congestion;\n\u2022social and political unrest; and\n\u2022natural disasters, terrorist attacks, pandemics or other catastrophic events.\nWe are also affected by domestic and international laws and regulations applicable to companies doing business abroad or importing and exporting goods and materials. These include tax laws, laws regulating competition, anti-bribery/anti-corruption and other business practices, and trade regulations, including duties and tariffs. Compliance with these laws is costly, and future changes to these laws may require significant management attention and disrupt our operations. Additionally, while it is difficult to assess what changes may occur and the relative effect on our international tax structure, significant changes in how U.S. and foreign jurisdictions tax cross-border transactions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.\nOur results of operations and financial position are also impacted by changes in currency exchange rates. Unfavorable currency exchange rates, particularly the euro, the Chinese Yuan renminbi, the Canadian dollar and the British pound sterling, have in the past adversely affected us, and could adversely affect us in the future. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates may present challenges in comparing operating performance from period to period.\nAdditionally, as a result of the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union, we could experience volatility in the currency exchange rates or a change in the demand for our products and services, particularly in our U.K. and European markets, or there could be disruption of our operations and our customers\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 businesses.\nThe long-term performance of our businesses relies on our ability to attract, develop and retain talented and diverse personnel.\nTo be successful, we must invest significant resources to attract, develop and retain highly qualified, talented and diverse employees at all levels, who have the experience, knowledge and expertise to implement our strategic and business initiatives. We compete for employees with a broad range of employers in many different industries, including large multinational firms, and we may fail in recruiting, developing, motivating and retaining them, particularly when there are low unemployment levels. We have been and continue to be affected by a shortage of qualified personnel in certain geographic areas. Our growth, competitive position, results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected by our failure to attract, develop and retain key employees and diverse talent, to build strong leadership teams, to successfully implement our talent strategies or to develop effective succession planning to assure smooth transitions of those employees and the knowledge and expertise they possess.\nExtreme weather events and changes in climate could adversely impact our results of operations and financial position.\nExtreme weather events, such as severe winter and other storms, hurricanes, fires, floods, tornados and droughts, as a result of climate change or other factors, have negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact our business. These types of events can be disruptive to our operations and may impact consumer spending. In addition, we have certain suppliers located in areas that have experienced extreme weather events which have impacted and may continue to impact the availability and cost of some of our raw materials, components and products from time to time. If the frequency or severity of extreme weather increases, we may experience interruptions to our operations, further impact on our supply chain, increased operating costs or loss or damage to our property or inventory, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.\nRestrictive covenants in our credit agreement could limit our financial flexibility.\nWe must comply with both financial and nonfinancial covenants in our credit agreement, and in order to borrow under it, we cannot be in default with any of those provisions. Our ability to borrow under the credit agreement could be affected if our earnings significantly decline to a level where we are not in compliance with the financial covenants or if we default on any nonfinancial covenants. In the past, we have been able to amend the covenants in our credit agreement, but there can be no assurance that in the future we would be able to further amend them. If we were unable to borrow under our credit agreement, our financial flexibility could be restricted.\nCompetitive Risks\nWe could lose market share if we do not maintain our strong brands, develop innovative products or respond to changing purchasing practices and consumer preferences or if our reputation is damaged.\nOur competitive advantage is due, in part, to our ability to maintain our strong brands and to develop and introduce innovative new and improved products. Our initiatives to invest in brand building, brand awareness and product innovation may not be successful. The uncertainties associated with developing and introducing innovative and improved products, such as gauging changing consumer demands and preferences and successfully developing, manufacturing, marketing, selling and servicing these products, may impact the success of our product introductions. If the products we introduce do not gain widespread acceptance or if our competitors improve their products more rapidly or effectively than we do, we could lose market share or be required to reduce our prices, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial position.\nIn recent years, consumer purchasing practices and preferences have shifted and our customers\u2019 business models and strategies have changed. As our customers execute their strategies to reach end consumers through multiple channels, they rely on us to support their efforts with our infrastructure, including maintaining robust and user-friendly websites with sufficient content for consumer research and providing comprehensive supply chain solutions and differentiated product development. If we are unable to successfully provide this support to our customers or if our customers are unable to successfully execute their strategies, our brands may lose market share.\nIf we do not timely and effectively identify and respond to changing consumer preferences, including, among others, a continued shift in consumer purchasing practices toward e-commerce and increased consumer demand for products with potential desired attributes, such as connected products and sustainable products, our relationships with our customers and with consumers could be harmed, our ability to retain our customers and consumers may be negatively impacted, the demand for our brands and products could be reduced and our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected.\nOur public image and reputation are important to maintaining our strong brands and could be adversely affected by various factors, including product quality and service, claims and comments in social media or the press, or a negative perception regarding our company practices, positions or public statements, including regarding disputes or legal action against us, even if unfounded. Damage to our public image or reputation could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.\nWe face significant competition and operate in an evolving competitive landscape.\nOur products face significant competition. We believe that brand reputation is an important factor affecting product selection and that we compete on the basis of product features, innovation, quality, customer service, warranty and price. We sell many of our products through home center retailers, online retailers, distributors and independent dealers and rely on these customers to market and promote our products to consumers. Our success with our customers is dependent on our ability to provide quality products and timely delivery. In addition, home center retailers, which have historically concentrated their sales efforts on retail consumers and remodelers, are increasingly selling directly to professional contractors and installers. This shift may adversely affect our margins on our products that contractors and installers would otherwise buy through our dealers and wholesalers, and as home center retailers develop customer experience programs to attract and retain contractors and installers, they may rely on us to support their efforts, which may affect our growth and operating results.\nCertain of our customers are selling products sourced from low-cost foreign manufacturers under their own private label brands, which directly compete with our brands. As a result of this trend, we have and we may in the future experience lower demand for our products or a shift in the mix of some products we sell toward more value-priced or opening price point products, which may affect our operating results.\nIn addition, we face competitive pricing pressure in the marketplace, including sales promotion programs, that could affect our market share or result in price reductions, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial position.\nFurther, the growing e-commerce channel brings an increased number of competitors and greater pricing transparency for consumers, as well as conflicts between our existing distribution channels and a need for different distribution methods. These factors could affect our results of operations and financial position. In addition, our relationships with our customers, including our home center customers, may be affected if we increase the amount of business we transact in the e-commerce channel.\nIf we are unable to maintain our competitive position in our industries, our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected.\nOur sales are concentrated with three significant customers and this concentration may continue to increase. In 2021, our net sales from our continuing operations to The Home Depot were $3.0 billion (approximately 36 percent of our consolidated net sales), and our net sales from our continuing operations to Ferguson and Lowe\u2019s were each less than 10 percent of our consolidated net sales. These customers can significantly affect the prices we receive for our products and the terms and conditions on which we do business with them. Additionally, these customers have in the past and may in the future reduce the number of vendors from which they purchase and could make significant changes in their volume of purchases from us. Although other retailers, dealers, distributors and homebuilders represent other channels of distribution for our products and services, we might not be able to quickly replace, if at all, the loss of a substantial portion of our sales to The Home Depot or the loss of all of our sales to either Ferguson or Lowe\u2019s, and any such loss would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.\nIn addition, our Behr business grants Behr brand exclusivity in the retail sales channel in North America to The Home Depot, and from time to time, certain of our other businesses grant product and/or brand exclusivity to our customers. The granting of exclusivity affects our ability to sell those products and brands to other customers and can increase the complexity of our product offerings and can increase our costs.\nTechnology and Intellectual Property Risks\nWe rely on information systems and technology, and a breakdown of these systems or interruptions resulting from our implementation of new systems could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.\nWe rely on many information systems and technology to process, transmit, store and manage information to support our business activities. We may be adversely affected if our information systems breakdown, fail, or are no longer supported. In addition to the consequences that may occur from interruptions in our current systems, we continue to invest in new technology systems throughout our company, including implementations of and upgrades to Enterprise Resource Planning (\u201cERP\u201d) systems at our business units. ERP implementations and upgrades are complex and require significant management oversight, and we have experienced, and may continue to experience, unanticipated expenses and interruptions to our operations during these implementations. Our results of operations and financial position, as well as the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting, could be adversely affected if we do not appropriately select, implement, maintain and upgrade our technology systems in a timely manner or if we experience significant unanticipated expenses or disruptions in connection with the implementation and upgrade of ERP systems.\nWe have been and may continue to be subject to cybersecurity attacks, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.\nGlobal cybersecurity vulnerabilities, threats and more frequent, sophisticated and targeted attacks pose a risk to our information technology systems. We have implemented security policies, processes and layers of defense designed to help identify and protect against intentional and unintentional misappropriation or corruption of our systems and information and disruption of our operations. Despite these efforts, our systems have been and may in the future be damaged, disrupted, or shut down due to cybersecurity attacks by unauthorized access, malware, ransomware, undetected intrusion, hardware failures, or other events, and in these circumstances our disaster recovery plans may be ineffective or inadequate. These breaches or intrusions have led and could in the future lead to business interruption, production or operational downtime, product shipment delays, exposure or loss of proprietary confidential or financial information or the personal information of our employees or customers, data corruption, an inability to report our financial results in a timely manner, damage to the reputation of our brands, damage to our relationships with our customers and suppliers, exposure to litigation, and increased costs associated with the remediation and mitigation of such attacks. In addition, we could be adversely affected if any of our significant customers, third-party suppliers or service providers experiences any similar events that disrupt their business operations or damage their reputation. Such events could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect or prevent the unauthorized use of our intellectual property.\nProtecting our intellectual property is important to our growth and innovation efforts. We own a number of patents, trade names, brand names and other forms of intellectual property in our products and manufacturing processes throughout the world. There can be no assurance that our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights will prevent violations. Our intellectual property has been and may again be challenged or infringed upon by third parties, particularly in countries where property rights are not highly developed or protected. In addition, the global nature of our business increases the risk that we may be unable to obtain or maintain our intellectual property rights on reasonable terms. Furthermore, others may assert intellectual property infringement claims against us. Current and former employees, contractors, customers or suppliers have or may have had access to proprietary or confidential information regarding our business operations that could harm us if used by them, or disclosed to others, including our competitors. Protecting and preventing the unauthorized use of our intellectual property could be costly, time consuming and require significant resources. If we are not able to protect our existing intellectual property rights, or prevent unauthorized use of our intellectual property, sales of our products may be affected and we may experience reputational damage to our brand names, increased litigation costs and adverse impact to our competitive position, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.\nLitigation and Regulatory Risks\nClaims and litigation could be costly.\nWe are involved in various claims and litigation, including class actions, mass torts and regulatory proceedings, that arise in the ordinary course of our business and that could have a material adverse effect on us. The types of matters may include, among others: competition, product liability, employment, warranty, advertising, contract, personal injury, environmental, intellectual property, product compliance and insurance coverage. The outcome and effect of these matters are inherently unpredictable, and defending and resolving them can be costly and can divert management\u2019s attention. We have and may continue to incur significant costs as a result of claims and litigation.\nWe are also subject to product safety regulations, product recalls and direct claims for product liability that can result in significant costs and, regardless of the ultimate outcome, create adverse publicity and damage the reputation of our brands and business. Also, we rely on third-party suppliers to provide products or components for products that we sell. Due to the difficulty of controlling the quality of products and components we source from these suppliers, we are exposed to risks relating to the quality of such products and to limitations on our recourse against such suppliers.\nWe maintain insurance against some, but not all, of the risks of loss resulting from claims and litigation. The levels of insurance we maintain may not be adequate to fully cover our losses or liabilities. If any significant accident, judgment, claim or other event is not fully insured or indemnified against, it could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.\nRefer to Note U to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report for additional information about litigation involving our businesses.\nOur failure to comply with laws, government regulations and other requirements could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.\nWe are subject to a wide variety of federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations pertaining to:\n\u2022securities matters;\n\u2022taxation;\n\u2022anti-bribery/anti-corruption;\n\u2022employment and labor matters;\n\u2022wage and hour matters;\n\u2022environment, health and safety matters;\n\u2022the protection of employees and consumers;\n\u2022product safety and performance;\n\u2022competition practices;\n\u2022trade, including duties and tariffs;\n\u2022data privacy and the collection and storage of information; and\n\u2022climate change and protection of the environment.\nIn addition to complying with current requirements and known future requirements, we will be subject to new or more stringent requirements in the future.\nAs we sell new types of products or existing products in new geographic areas or channels or for new applications, we are subject to the requirements applicable to those sales. Additionally, some of our products must be certified by industry organizations. Compliance with new or changed laws, regulations and other requirements, including as a part of government or industry response to climate change, may require us to alter our product designs, our manufacturing processes, our packaging or our sourcing. These compliance activities are costly and require significant management attention and resources. If we do not effectively and timely comply with such regulations and other requirements, our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected.", "PERMNO": 34032, "SIC": 3430, "TIC": "MAS"}
