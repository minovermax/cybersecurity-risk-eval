{"cik": "1014473", "company": "VERISIGN INC/CA", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-18", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nPlease carefully consider the following discussion of significant factors, events and uncertainties that make an investment in our securities risky. In addition to other information in this Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating us and our business. When the factors, events and contingencies described below or elsewhere in this Form 10-K materialize, our business, operating results, financial condition, reputation, cash flows or prospects can be materially adversely affected. In such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition, reputation, cash flows and prospects. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-K as a result of the risk factors discussed below and elsewhere in this Form 10-K and in other filings we make with the SEC. Additional or unforeseen effects from the COVID-19 pandemic and the global economic climate may give rise to or amplify many of the risks discussed below.\nCybersecurity and Technology Risk Factors\nAttempted security breaches, including from the exploitation of vulnerabilities, cyber-attacks and Distributed Denial of Service (\u201cDDoS\u201d) attacks against our systems and services increase our costs, expose us to potentially material liability, and could materially harm our business and reputation.\nAs an operator of critical internet infrastructure, we experience a high rate of cyber-attacks and attempted security breaches targeting our systems and services, including the most sophisticated forms of attacks, such as advanced persistent threat attacks, exploitation of zero-day vulnerabilities, ransomware attacks, and social engineering attacks. The forms of these attacks are constantly evolving and may involve methods, tools and strategies that may not have been previously identified and may not have been observed until the moment of launch, or until sometime after, making these attacks virtually impossible to anticipate and difficult to defend against. In addition to external threats, our systems and services are subject to insider threat risks, including physical or electronic break-ins, sabotage, and risks from suppliers, such as consultants and advisors, SaaS providers, hardware, software, and network systems manufacturers, regional internet registries, and other vendors, or from current or former contractors or employees. These threats and any resulting security breaches can arise from intentional or unintentional actions. Our continued exposure to these threats and the potential that they could lead to material liability claims against us requires us to expend significant financial and other resources. We have developed policies, procedures and standards to identify, protect, detect, respond, and recover from threats posed by cybersecurity risks, and failure to comply with these policies, procedures and standards by our employees or suppliers could limit our ability to effectively manage threats from these cybersecurity risks. In addition, we must ensure that our employees stay focused on cybersecurity threats especially in remote or hybrid work environment, including during the COVID-19 pandemic, or our ability to effectively manage cybersecurity risks could be impacted. Our failure to effectively manage these security risks, including insider threats, could result in material harm to our business, including loss of or delay in revenues, failure to meet contracted service level obligations, material liability claims, failure to maintain market acceptance, injury to our reputation, and increased costs, and could call into question our ability to preserve the security and stability of the internet.\nSecurity vulnerabilities in our systems and our vendors\u2019 systems, including vulnerabilities in third party software and hardware, pose a material risk to our operations. We use externally-developed technology, systems and services, including both hardware and software, for a variety of purposes, including compute, storage, encryption and authentication, back-office support, and other functions. We have developed policies, procedures, and standards to reduce the impact of security vulnerabilities in system components, as well as at any vendors where our data is stored or processed. However, such measures cannot provide absolute security. While we strive to remediate known vulnerabilities on a timely basis, such vulnerabilities could be exploited before our remediation is effective and if so, could cause systems and service interruptions, data loss and other damages. Our failure to identify, remediate and mitigate security vulnerabilities, including any potential failure to timely replace and upgrade hardware, software, or other technology assets, could result in material harm to our business, including loss of or delay in revenues, failure to meet contracted service level obligations, material liability claims, failure to maintain market acceptance, injury to our reputation, increased costs, and call into question our ability to preserve the security and stability of the internet.\nIn addition, our networks have been, and likely will continue to be, subject to DDoS attacks. Recent industry experience has demonstrated that DDoS attacks continue to grow in size and sophistication and have the ability to widely disrupt internet services. In recent years, the size of DDoS attacks has grown rapidly. We have successfully mitigated DDoS attacks during this time frame that are significantly larger than those we have historically experienced. While we have adopted mitigation techniques, procedures and strategies to defend against DDoS attacks, there can be no assurance that we will be able to defend against every attack, especially as the attacks increase in size and sophistication. Any attack, even if only partially successful, could disrupt our networks, increase response time, negatively impact our ability to meet our service level obligations, and generally impede our ability to provide reliable service to our customers and the broader internet community. We have historically incurred, and will continue to incur, significant costs to enable our infrastructure to process levels of attack traffic that are significant multiples of our normal transaction volume. We are employing new technologies and new and different\nservices and capabilities to help mitigate DDoS attacks. If these new technologies, services and capabilities are not effective, our networks could be disrupted, our response times could increase, our ability to meet our contracted service level obligations could be negatively impacted, and our ability to provide reliable service to our customers and the broader internet community could be impeded.\nWe do not maintain specific reserves for security breaches, cyber-attacks and DDoS attacks against our systems and the amount of insurance coverage we maintain may be inadequate to cover claims or liabilities relating to such attacks.\nWe may introduce undetected or unknown defects into our systems or services, which could materially harm our business and harm our vendors or our customers.\nDespite testing, services as complex as those we offer or develop could contain undetected defects or errors, which could result in service outages or disruptions, compromised customer data, including DNS data, diversion of development resources, injury to our reputation, tort or contract claims, increased insurance costs or increased service costs. Performance of our services, whether or not defective, could have unforeseen or unknown adverse effects on the networks over which they are delivered, on internet users and consumers, and on third-party applications and services that use our services, any of which could result in legal claims against us. While we strive to prevent, detect and remediate defects or errors, they can and do occur and they could result in our inability to meet customer expectations in a timely manner, failure to meet our contracted service level obligations, injury to our reputation, and increased costs.\nOur infrastructure and services are subject to vulnerabilities in the global routing system for the internet, as well as risks arising from internet services providers\u2019 increasing adoption of the Resource Public Key Infrastructure system.\nRouting on the internet depends on the Border Gateway Protocol (\u201cBGP\u201d), which is a protocol that relies on networks within the internet infrastructure acting in a trustworthy manner when sharing information about destinations for connectivity and the routing of internet traffic. As a trust-based protocol, BGP has a number of vulnerabilities that may lead to outages or disrupt our services, including as a result of \u201croute hijacks\u201d that involve accidental or malicious rerouting of internet traffic, or \u201croute leaks\u201d that involve the malicious or unintentional propagation of routing information beyond the intended scope of the originator, receiver, and/or one of the networks along the route\u2019s path. Both route hijacks and route leaks can result in partial or full rerouting of internet traffic for the impacted destinations. These types of events, which are generally beyond our control, could enable an array of attack conditions or service disruptions, and could result in adverse publicity and adversely affect the public\u2019s perception of the security of e-commerce and communications over the internet, as well as of the security or reliability of our services.\nTo address internet routing system vulnerabilities, many internet service providers are beginning to adopt and apply internet reachability policies based on a system known as the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (\u201cRPKI\u201d) operated by the regional internet registries (\u201cRIRs\u201d). The RIRs allocate internet number resources, such as internet protocol addresses, to enterprises and network operators. We have limited visibility into the maturity of and investment in the RIRs\u2019 operational and security controls, which are outside of our control. When the availability, integrity, or confidentiality of any of the information in the RPKI system, or systems used to maintain and administer RPKI data and systems, are impacted or otherwise compromised in any of the RIRs, or any network operator that is a relying party of the RPKI system, or the operations or ingestion of data from the RPKI system are otherwise impacted by a known or unknown vulnerability, our services may be negatively impacted. Such impacts may include degraded or full loss of reachability of service addresses in the global internet routing system, resulting in degradation or complete loss of availability of our services. A compromise of the RPKI system and related services, or unintentional or unauthorized manipulation of data therein, may also result in other denial of service attack conditions for our infrastructure and services. The systemic dependencies introduced by RPKI and the relying parties of the RPKI system, including network service providers, are outside of our control, and systems that depend upon the RPKI may be only as secure as the weakest elements of the RPKI system. We may contract with one or more RIRs to employ RPKI, which carries material operational risks, as described above, as well as material contractual risks, which may expose us to service disruptions and material liability.\nWe could encounter system interruptions or systems failures resulting from activities beyond our direct control that could materially harm our business.\nWe depend on the uninterrupted operation of our various systems, secure data centers and other computer and communication networks. Our systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from power loss, transmission cable cuts and other telecommunications failures, damage or interruption caused by fire, earthquake, and other natural disasters, intentional acts of vandalism, terrorist attacks, unintentional mistakes or errors. Our systems and operations also face risks inherent in, or arising from, the terms and conditions of our agreements with service providers to operate our networks and data centers. We are also subject to state suppression of internet operations. Any of these problems or outages could create potential liability and exposure, including from a failure to meet our contracted service level obligations, and could decrease customer satisfaction, harming our business, or resulting in adverse publicity and damage to our reputation or call into question our ability to preserve the security and stability of the internet.\nOur data centers, our data center systems, including the Shared Registration Systems located at our data centers, and our resolution systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption, which could impede our ability to provide our services, expose us to material liability, and materially harm our reputation.\nMost of the computing infrastructure for our Shared Registration System is located at, and most of our customer information is stored in, our owned data centers. In 2019, we began expanding some of our data center services to a leased data center facility. These data centers are vulnerable to damage or interruption, including from natural disasters, such as fires, earthquakes, hurricanes, and floods, power loss, hardware or system failures, physical or electronic break-ins, human error or interference. We are also updating our network architecture in several of our new and existing data centers. If our data center facilities or the updated network architecture do not operate as expected, including the ability to quickly switch over between sites, we could experience service interruptions or outages. A failure in the operation of our Shared Registration System could result in the inability of one or more registrars to register or manage domain names for a period of time. If such a registrar has not implemented robust services in a manner that preserves transactions until processed by the registry, then the failure in the operation of our Shared Registration System could result in permanent loss of transactions at the registrar during that period. A failure in the operation of our Shared Registration System could also impact our ability to provide up-to-date information in our resolution systems, which could result in breaches of our service level obligations pertaining to our resolution services and impact the resolution of domain names on the internet. Although we carry insurance, we do not carry insurance or designated financial reserves for such interruptions.\nIn addition, our services depend on the secure and efficient operation of the internet connections to and from customers to our Shared Registration System residing in our secure data centers. These connections depend upon the secure and efficient operation of internet service providers, internet exchange point operators, and internet backbone service providers. Such providers have encountered periodic operational problems or experienced outages in the past beyond our scope of control and may continue to encounter problems and outages or may choose to discontinue their service. If the providers that our connections depend upon do not protect, maintain, improve, and reinvest in their networks or present inconsistent data regarding the DNS through their networks, our business could be harmed.\nA failure in the operation or update of the root zone servers, the root zone file, the Root Zone Management System, the TLD name servers, or the TLD zone files that we operate, including, for example, the .gov registry, or other network functions, could result in, among other problems, (1) a DNS resolution or other service outage or degradation, (2) the deletion of one or more TLDs from the internet, (3) the deletion of one or more second-level domain names from the internet, or (4) a misdirection of one or more domain names to different servers. A failure in the operation or update of the supporting cryptographic and other operational infrastructure that we maintain could result in similar consequences. Any of these problems or outages could create potential material liability and exposure from litigation and investigations, could result in a failure to meet our service level agreements, and could decrease customer satisfaction, harming our business. These problems could also result in adverse publicity, decrease the public\u2019s trust in the security of e-commerce, or call into question our ability to preserve the security and stability of the internet.\nWe retain certain customer and employee information in our data centers and various domain name registration systems. Any physical or electronic break-in or other security breach or compromise of the information stored at our data centers or domain name registration systems may jeopardize the security of information we retain or that is retained in the computer systems and networks of our customers. In such an event, we could face material liability and exposure from litigation and investigations, fail to meet contracted service level obligations, or be at risk for loss of various security and standards-based compliance certifications needed for operation of our businesses, and customers could be reluctant to use our services, any of which could also adversely affect our reputation and harm our business or cause financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance.\nWe face risks from the operation of the root server system and our performance of the Root Zone Maintainer functions under the RZMA.\nAlthough the overall root server system is redundant and dispersed, a failure or interruption in the operation of the root server system could impact the effectiveness of our .com and .net authoritative servers and therefore negatively impact directory services necessary for the operation of the internet. We also have an important operational role in support of a key Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (\u201cIANA\u201d) function as the Root Zone Maintainer. In this role, we provision and publish the authoritative root zone data and make it available to all root server operators under the RZMA with ICANN. If we make errors in the publication of the root zone, we may be subject to material claims challenging the RZMA or our performance under it, including tort claims, and we may not have immunity from, or sufficient indemnification or insurance for, such claims.\nContractual, Regulatory, Legal and Compliance Risk Factors\nAny loss or modification of our right to operate the .com and .net gTLDs could have a material adverse impact on our business and result in loss of revenues.\nSubstantially all of our revenues are derived from our operation of the .com gTLD under our Cooperative Agreement with the DOC and our .com Registry Agreement as well as our operation of the .net gTLD under our .net Registry Agreement. Any loss or modification of our right to operate the .com and .net gTLDs could materially and adversely impact our ability to conduct our business and result in loss of revenues. Our .com and .net Registry Agreements contain \u201cpresumptive\u201d rights of renewal upon the expiration of their current terms on November 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023, respectively. ICANN could refuse to renew upon expiration or terminate our .com Registry Agreement or our .net Registry Agreement if, upon proper notice, (1) we fail to cure a fundamental and material breach of certain specified obligations, and (2) we fail to timely comply with a final decision of an arbitrator or court. Additionally, each of the .com and .net Registry Agreements provide that if certain terms of these agreements are not similar to such terms generally in effect in the registry agreements of the five largest gTLDs, then a renewal of these agreements would be upon terms reasonably necessary to render such terms to be similar to the registry agreements for those other gTLDs. Any such terms, if they apply, could be unfavorable to us and have a material adverse impact on our business.\nStandard renewals of the .com Registry Agreement do not require further DOC approval, although the prior written approval of the DOC is required for the removal of, or any changes to the pricing section (other than as approved in Amendment 35 to the Cooperative Agreement) and for changes to certain other specified terms whether such removal or changes is made at a renewal or otherwise. We can provide no assurances that DOC approval would be provided upon our request for any of these changes.\nIn addition, under Amendment 35 to the Cooperative Agreement, we have agreed to continue to operate the .com gTLD in a content-neutral manner and to work within ICANN processes to promote the development of content-neutral policies for the operation of the DNS, and under our binding letter of intent with ICANN, we have agreed to work with the ICANN community to develop certain best practices and other commitments for the security, stability and resiliency of the DNS and the internet. Such policies and processes could expose us to compliance costs and substantial liability and result in costly and time-consuming investigations or litigation.\nChanges or challenges to the pricing provisions in the .com Registry Agreement could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nUnder the terms of the .com Registry Agreement, we may increase the annual fee of each .com domain name registration or renewal by up to 7% over the previous year in each of the final four years of each six-year period. We can provide no assurance that we will exercise such right to increase the annual fee. In addition to this contractual right, we are entitled to increase the annual fee of each .com domain name registration or renewal by up to 7% due to the imposition of any new specifications or policies adopted by ICANN pursuant to the procedures set forth in its bylaws and due process (\u201cConsensus Policies\u201d) or documented extraordinary expense resulting from an attack or threat of attack on the security and stability of the DNS (an \u201cExtraordinary Expense\u201d). In addition, our ability to increase the price for .com domain name registrations and renewals due to a Consensus Policy or Extraordinary Expense may occur only in years in which we do not increase the price for .com domain name registrations and renewals as described above. It is uncertain whether circumstances would arise that would permit us to take a price increase due to a Consensus Policy or Extraordinary Expense, or if they do, whether we would seek to increase the price for .com domain name registrations for this reason. A failure to seek and obtain a price increase due to a Consensus Policy or Extraordinary Expense, when available, could negatively affect our operating results. We also have the right under the Cooperative Agreement to seek the removal of these pricing restrictions on the .com TLD if we demonstrate to the DOC that market conditions no longer warrant these restrictions. However, it is uncertain whether we will seek the removal of these restrictions, or whether the DOC would approve the removal of these restrictions.\nOur .com Registry Agreement, including its pricing provisions, has faced, and could face in the future, challenges, including possible legal challenges, or challenges under ICANN\u2019s accountability mechanisms, from ICANN, registrars, registrants, and others, and any adverse outcome from these challenges could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nGovernment regulation and the application of new and existing laws in the U.S. and internationally may slow business growth, increase our costs of doing business, create potential material liability and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nApplication of new and existing laws and regulations in the U.S. or internationally to the internet or the domain name industry have imposed and may in the future impose new costs and new restrictions on our business. Laws and regulations, including those designed to restrict who can register and who can distribute domain names or to require registrants to provide additional documentation to register domain names, have, and may in the future, impose significant additional costs on our business and subject us to additional liabilities or could prevent us from operating in certain jurisdictions. For example, the\ngovernment of China has indicated that it will issue, and has issued, new regulations, and has begun to enforce existing regulations, that impose additional costs on, and risks to, our provision of registry services in China and could impact the demand for domain name registrations in China. Registries, including us, and China-based registrars are also required by some of these regulations to obtain a government-issued license for each TLD operating in China. Any failure to obtain or renew the required licenses, or to comply with any license requirements or any updates thereto, by us or our China-based registrars could impact our current and future business in China.\nIn addition, laws have been and may in the future be adopted, that are designed to restrict counterfeit or illegal goods or intellectual property violations such as cybersquatting, prevent on-line abuse, increase access to registrant personal information or that restrict the transfer of data. The costs of complying or failing to comply with these laws and regulations could limit our ability to operate in our current locations, expose us to compliance costs and substantial liability, and result in costly and time-consuming litigation.\nSimilarly, the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation, which greatly increases the jurisdictional reach of European Union law and adds broad new requirements for handling personal data, including the public disclosure of significant data breaches, and significant penalties, became effective in May 2018. Other countries, such as China, and other states, such as California with the California Consumer Privacy Act, have enacted or are enacting data protection laws regulating or limiting the collection, storage, and processing of personal data as well as granting new rights to data subjects. To conduct our operations, we regularly move data across national borders and receive data originating from different jurisdictions, and consequently we are subject to these continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations both in the United States and internationally regarding privacy, data protection and data security. The scope of the laws and regulations that are applicable to us is often uncertain and may be conflicting, particularly with respect to international laws and regulations. These evolving legal, regulatory and compliance frameworks could impose significant costs for us that are likely to increase over time.\nOur international operations expose us and our business to additional economic, legal, regulatory and political risks that could have a material adverse impact on our revenues and business.\nA significant portion of our revenues is derived from customers outside the U.S. Our business operations in international locations have required, and will continue to require, significant management attention and resources. We may also need to tailor some of our services for a particular location and to enter into international distribution and operating relationships. We may fail to maintain our ability to conduct business, including potentially material business operations in some international locations, or we may not succeed in expanding our services into new international locations or expand our presence in existing locations. Failure to do so could materially harm our business. Moreover, local laws and customs in many countries differ significantly from those in the U.S. In many foreign countries, particularly in those with developing economies, it is common for others to engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or U.S. law or regulations applicable to us. There can be no assurance that our employees, contractors and agents will not take actions in violation of such policies, procedures, laws and/or regulations. Violations of laws, regulations or internal policies and procedures by our employees, contractors or agents could result in financial reporting problems, investigations, fines, penalties, or prohibition on the importation or exportation of our products and services and could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, we face risks inherent in doing business internationally, including:\n\u2022competition with companies in international locations or other domestic companies entering international locations in which we operate, as well as local governments actively promoting ccTLDs that we do not operate;\n\u2022political and economic tensions between governments and changes in international trade policies and/or the economic and trade sanctions programs administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (\u201cOFAC\u201d) of the U.S. Department of the Treasury;\n\u2022tariffs and other trade barriers and restrictions;\n\u2022difficulties in staffing and managing international operations;\n\u2022currency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u2022potential problems associated with adapting our services to technical conditions existing in different countries;\n\u2022difficulties in verifying end-user information, including for the purposes of complying with the verification requirements of certain countries and with the economic and trade sanctions programs administered by OFAC;\n\u2022more stringent privacy and data localization policies in some international jurisdictions;\n\u2022additional vulnerability from terrorist groups targeting U.S. interests abroad;\n\u2022potentially conflicting or adverse tax consequences;\n\u2022reliance on third parties in international locations in which we only recently started doing business; and\n\u2022potential concerns of international governments or customers and prospects regarding doing business with U.S. technology companies due to alleged U.S. government data collection policies.\nEscalating political tensions between the United States and China in particular may pose additional risks to our business in China. Since 2018, the United States and China have imposed tariffs on certain of each other\u2019s exports. In 2020 and 2021, the U.S. government announced restrictions on trading with certain Chinese companies. The Chinese government subsequently announced actions that, if implemented, could impose additional restrictions on the Chinese operations of non-Chinese companies. These and future government actions impacting our ability to operate in China may cause our management\u2019s attention to be diverted, our reputation to be damaged, or our business in China to be adversely affected.\nChanges in, or interpretations of, tax rules and regulations or our tax positions may materially and adversely affect our income taxes.\nWe are subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and numerous international jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our effective tax rates may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis because of a variety of factors, including changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in our business or structure, changes in tax laws that could adversely impact our income or non-income taxes or the expiration of or disputes about certain tax agreements in a particular country. We are subject to audit by various tax authorities. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we recognize income tax benefits, net of required valuation allowances and accrual for uncertain tax positions. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals. Should additional taxes be assessed as a result of an audit or litigation, an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made could result.\nIn the U.S., a number of legislative proposals, including the \u201cBuild Back Better\u201d bill, are being considered which could impact how multinational corporations are taxed. In addition, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (\u201cOECD\u201d) plans to issue guidance and a final report that will provide a long-term, multilateral proposal on the taxation of the digital economy. Similarly, some international tax jurisdictions, independent of the OECD, have enacted or may enact new tax regimes aimed at income resulting from digital services. Although we cannot predict the nature or outcome of such changes or the likelihood of such legislative proposals being adopted in the U.S. or throughout the world, any or all of these changes in tax laws could increase our taxes and adversely impact our financial condition and cash flow.\nOur business faces risks arising from ICANN\u2019s consensus and temporary policies, technical standards and other processes.\nOur Registry Agreements with ICANN require us to implement Consensus Policies and changes mandated by ICANN through temporary specifications or policies (\u201cTemporary Policies\u201d). ICANN could adopt Consensus Policies or Temporary Policies that (1) are unfavorable to us as the registry operator of .com, .net and other gTLDs that we operate, (2) are inconsistent with our current or future plans, (3) impose substantial costs on our business, (4) subject the Company to additional legal risks, or (5) affect our competitive position. These Consensus Policies or Temporary Policies could have a material adverse effect on our business. For example, ICANN has adopted a Consensus Policy that would require us to receive and display registrants\u2019 personal and contact information and designated administrative and technical contact information (\u201cThick Whois data\u201d) for .com and .net, although that Policy is undergoing modification by a subsequent Consensus Policy that may make such transfer of Thick Whois data to us optional. We can provide no assurances that such a modification will occur or that we would not choose to or ultimately be required to receive and display Thick Whois data for our .com and .net registries. The costs of complying or failing to comply with Consensus and Temporary Policies, particularly the cost of compliance if the .com and .net registries receive Thick Whois data could expose us to substantial compliance costs, liability and exposure, and result in costly and time-consuming investigations or litigation.\nOur Registry Agreements with ICANN require us to implement and comply with various technical standards and specifications published by the Internet Engineering Task Force (\u201cIETF\u201d). ICANN could impose requirements on us through changes to these IETF standards, or new standards, that are inconsistent with our current or future plans, that impose substantial costs on our business, that subject the Company to additional legal risks, or that affect our competitive position. Any such changes to the IETF standards, or new standards, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWeakening of, or changes to, the multi-stakeholder form of internet governance could materially and adversely impact our business.\nThe internet is governed under a multi-stakeholder model comprising civil society, the private sector, including for-profit and not-for-profit organizations such as ICANN, governments, including the U.S. government, academia, non-governmental organizations and international organizations. If ICANN fails to uphold, or if the multi-stakeholder model is significantly redefined, it could harm our business. For example, certain governments, governmental organizations, and private actors continue to express dissatisfaction with the multi-stakeholder form of internet governance and have proposed alternatives including oversight by the United Nations or by international treaties. Furthermore, national legislation has been proposed on topics such as information security and access to personal information that effectively supplants the multi-stakeholder process for policy development in the DNS. Substantially weakening or replacing the multi-stakeholder form of internet governance could materially harm our business.\nIn addition, in 2016 the U.S. government transferred key internet functions to ICANN, who adopted new and enhanced accountability mechanisms in its bylaws such as the creation of the Empowered Community. There can be no assurance that the removal of the U.S. government oversight of these key functions, or the changes to ICANN\u2019s bylaws, will not negatively impact our business.\nClaims, lawsuits, audits or investigations in which we are or could become involved may result in material adverse outcomes to our business.\nWe are, and may in the future become, involved in claims, lawsuits, audits and investigations, including intellectual property litigation and infringement claims. Litigation is inherently unpredictable, and unexpected judgments or excessive verdicts do occur. In addition, proceedings that we initially view as immaterial could prove to be material. Adverse outcomes in lawsuits, audits and investigations, could result in significant monetary damages, including indemnification payments, or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business, and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. For example, we are engaged in activities to help mitigate security threats and other forms of DNS abuse in our TLDs and we are involved in community efforts that could increase and expand such activities including potential new contractual obligations. Such activities include, for example, receiving reports of suspected threats and abuse from appropriate \u201ctrusted notifiers\u201d (typically involving national and international law enforcement) and notifying registrars or others of domain names associated with suspected malicious or illegal activity. Our activities may also include disabling one or more domain names in the TLDs we operate including in response to governmental directives and orders in those jurisdictions in which we operate. Activities such as these have resulted in, and could in the future result in, significant litigation and could harm our reputation. Given the inherent uncertainties in litigation, even when we are able to reasonably estimate the amount of possible loss or range of loss and therefore record an aggregate litigation accrual for probable and reasonably estimable loss contingencies, the accrual may change in the future due to new developments or changes in approach. In addition, such claims, lawsuits, audits and investigations could involve significant expense and diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources from other matters.\nStrategic, Business and Operating Risk Factors\nThe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have impacted how we operate our business, and the extent to which the effects of the pandemic will materially impact our business, operations, financial condition and results of operations remains uncertain.\nThe United States and the global community we serve are facing unprecedented challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic, and the preventative measures taken in response to the pandemic (including \u201cshelter-in-place\u201d or \u201cstay-at-home\u201d and similar orders issued by international, federal, state or local authorities and the subsequent relaxation and re-imposition of such orders), have resulted in, and are expected to continue to result in, significant volatility, business and economic disruptions and uncertainty. In response to the pandemic, we have taken steps to protect our employees, including arranging for most of our employees to work remotely, while we continue to operate all of our services, including our registry services for .com and .net and our root operations. However, the extent to which the effects of the pandemic will continue to impact our business, operations, financial condition and results of operations remains uncertain and depends on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to control or predict, including:\n\u2022the duration and scope of the pandemic;\n\u2022the extent and effectiveness of responsive actions, including the relaxation and re-imposition of orders by authorities and the delivery and administration of vaccines, including vaccination requirements and mandates by government regulation, and the impact of these and other factors on our employees, customers and vendors;\n\u2022the impact of the pandemic on our key personnel and other employees (including the impact of work-from-home arrangements on employee productivity and morale);\n\u2022the extent to which we are able to maintain and replace critical internet infrastructure components when necessary;\n\u2022our continued ability to execute on business continuity plans for the maintenance of our critical internet infrastructure while most of our employees continue to work remotely; and\n\u2022any negative impact on the demand for new and renewal domain name registrations resulting from the economic disruption caused by the pandemic and responses thereto.\nFurther, the impact of COVID-19 and the volatile regional and global economic conditions stemming from the pandemic may also precipitate or exacerbate other risks discussed in these Risk Factors, any of which could have a material effect on us. As of the date of this Form 10-K, our financial condition and results of operations have not been adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Regardless, this situation is uncertain and additional effects may arise that we are not presently aware of or that we currently do not consider present material risks to our operations. If we are unable to successfully respond to and manage the impact of the pandemic, and the resulting responses to it, our business, operations, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted, and the impact could be material.\nThe business environment is highly competitive and, if we do not compete effectively, we may suffer material adverse impact to our business, including lower demand for our products, reduced gross margins, and loss of market share.\nWe face competition from services that provide an online identity or presence, including other gTLD and ccTLD registries. In order to remain competitive and retain our market position, we must continually demonstrate the safety, security, and resiliency of our services and must adopt and support new technologies to adapt our services to changing technologies, market conditions, and our customers\u2019 and internet users\u2019 preferences and practices. If we do not successfully evolve and demonstrate the value of our services, we may not be able to compete effectively with current or future competitors, and such competitive pressures could materially harm our business. In addition, competing technologies developed by others or the emergence of new industry standards may adversely affect our competitive position or render our services or technologies noncompetitive or obsolete. Finally, consolidation within our industry has occurred and is likely to continue to occur. Our ability to participate and benefit from such consolidations may be limited and consolidation within our industry among our competitors could harm our competitive position and adversely impact our business.\nWe have been designated as the registry operator for certain new gTLDs, including certain IDN gTLDs. Our new gTLDs may not be as or more successful than the new gTLDs obtained by our competitors. In addition, our new gTLDs may face additional universal acceptance and usability challenges and it is possible that resolution of domain names within some of these new gTLDs may be blocked within certain state or organizational environments, challenging universal resolvability of these strings and their general acceptance and usability.\nSee the \u201cCompetition\u201d section in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K for further information.\nThe evolution of technologies or internet practices and behaviors, the adoption of substitute technologies, or wholesale price increases of domain names in our TLDs may materially and negatively impact the demand for the domain names for which we are the registry operator.\nTechnologies relating to online presence, including social media, mobile devices, apps, and search engines, have evolved and continue to evolve, changing the internet practices and behaviors of consumers and businesses. These ongoing changes can negatively impact the demand for our domain names. In addition, registrants purchase domain names for a variety of reasons, including personal, commercial, and investment reasons. Changes in the motivation of domain name registrants can negatively impact our business.\nTechnology changes to web browser or internet search technologies could reduce demand for domain names. Similarly, if internet users\u2019 preferences or practices shift away from recognizing and relying on web addresses or if internet users were to significantly decrease the use of web browsers in favor of applications to locate and access content, demand for domain names in our TLDs could be negatively impacted. Demand for domain names in our TLDs could be negatively impacted by new technologies that significantly decrease the use of traditional domain names to present and protect an online identity. New technologies that encourage internet users to expand the use of third-level domains or alternate identifiers, such as identifiers from social networking, e-commerce platforms and microblogging sites, could also negatively impact the demand for domain names in our TLDs. In addition, the demand for domain names in our TLDs could be impacted by alternative namespaces with domain-name-like identifiers that are operated outside the single authoritative DNS root zone, including, for example, blockchain namespaces. To the extent that web browsers, applications, DNS registrars and DNS resolvers recognize and support such namespaces, and that internet users are able to perform online operations with identifiers from such namespaces, demand for domain names in TLDs in the single authoritative DNS root zone, including our TLDs, could be negatively impacted.\nSome registrars and registrants purchase and resell domain names at an increased price. Adverse changes in the resale value of domain names, changes in the business models for such domain name registrars and registrants, or other factors,\nincluding regulations limiting the resale of domain names, could result in a decrease in the demand and/or renewal rates for domain names in our TLDs.\nSome registrars and registrants seek to generate revenues by registering domain names specifically for website advertising. Changes in the way these registrars and registrants are compensated (including changes in methodologies and metrics) by advertisers and advertisement placement networks, such as Google, Baidu and Bing, have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect the market for domain names used for this purpose, which has resulted in, and may continue to result in, a decrease in demand and/or the renewal rate for such domain names. In addition, if spending on online advertising and marketing is reduced, this may result in a further decline in the demand for domain names used for this purpose.\nUnder the terms of the .com and .net Registry Agreements, as amended, we are permitted to increase the annual fee of each .com and .net domain name registration or renewal according to the provisions in these agreements. To the extent we increase our prices, there could be a decrease in the demand and/or renewal rates for .com or .net domain names.\nIf we fail to expand our services into developing and emerging economies in international locations, our business may not grow.\nWe seek to serve many new, developing and emerging economies in international locations to grow our business. These economies are rapidly evolving and may not grow or even if they do grow, our services may not be widely used or accepted there. Accordingly, the demand for our services in these locations is uncertain. Factors that may affect acceptance or adoption of our services in these locations include:\n\u2022regional internet infrastructure development, expansion, penetration and adoption, and the development, maturity and depth of our sales channels;\n\u2022acceptance and adoption of substitute products and services that enable online presence without a domain name, including social media, e-commerce platforms, website builders and mobile applications;\n\u2022increased acceptance and adoption of other substitute products and services, including ccTLDs or other gTLDs;\n\u2022public perception of the security of our technologies and of IP and other networks;\n\u2022the introduction and consumer acceptance of new generations of mobile devices, and in particular, the use of mobile applications as the primary engagement mechanism for navigating the internet; and\n\u2022government regulations affecting the internet, internet access and availability, domain name registrations or the provision of registry services, data security, privacy, or data localization, e-commerce or telecommunications.\nIf our services are not widely accepted or adopted in these locations, our business may not grow.\nOur business depends on registrars and their resellers maintaining their focus on marketing our products and services.\nAll of the domain name registrations and renewals for the registries we operate occur through registrars. Registrars and their resellers engage in substantial marketing efforts to increase the demand and/or renewal rates for domain names as well as their own associated offerings. Consolidation in the registrar or reseller industry or changes in ownership, management, or strategy among individual registrars or resellers, including vertical integration by registrar or reseller industry participants, could result in significant changes to their businesses, operating models, and cost structures. These changes could include reduced marketing efforts for our TLDs or other operational changes that could adversely impact the demand and/or the renewal rates for the domain names for which we are the registry operator.\nWith the introduction of new gTLDs, many of our registrars and resellers have chosen to, and may continue to choose to, focus their short- or long-term marketing efforts on these new offerings and/or reduce the prominence or visibility of our products and services on their e-commerce platforms. Our registrars and resellers sell domain name registrations of other competing registries, including new gTLDs, and some also sell and support their own services for websites such as email, website hosting, and other services. Our registrars and resellers may be more motivated to sell to registrants to whom they can also market their own services. To the extent that registrars and resellers focus more on selling and supporting their services and less on the registration and renewal of domain names in our TLDs, our revenues could be adversely impacted. Our ability to successfully market our services to, and build and maintain strong relationships with, new and existing registrars or resellers is a factor upon which successful operation of our business is dependent. If we are unable to keep a significant portion of their marketing efforts focused on selling registrations of domain names in our TLDs, as opposed to other competing TLDs, including the new gTLDs, or their own services, our business could be harmed.\nWe depend on highly skilled employees to maintain and provide innovative solutions for our business, and our business could be materially harmed if we are not able to attract and retain such qualified talent.\nOur business is highly technical and requires individuals skilled and knowledgeable in unique technologies, configurations, operating systems, and software development tools. We depend on the knowledge, experience, and performance of these employees and leaders to effectively manage and provide innovative solutions for our business. For example, we require employees with expertise in DNS operations and with certain cybersecurity specialties. Because such employees are in high demand by our competitors and other companies, we must be able to attract, integrate, retain and motivate such highly skilled employees and leaders. In addition, we must effectively manage our transition to a post-pandemic work environment to attract and retain these employees to meet our business needs. Failure to attract and retain such employees and to effectively implement succession plans for these employees could harm our business.\nIntellectual Property Risk Factors\nWe rely on our intellectual property rights to protect our proprietary assets, and any failure by us to protect or enforce, or any misappropriation of, our intellectual property could materially harm our business.\nOur success depends in part on our internally developed technologies and related intellectual property. Despite our precautions, it may be possible for an external party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property without authorization. Furthermore, the laws of other countries may not protect our proprietary rights in those countries to the same extent U.S. law protects these rights in the U.S. In addition, it is possible that others may independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property. If we do not effectively protect our intellectual property, our business could suffer. Additionally, we have filed patent applications with respect to some of our technology in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and patent offices outside the U.S. Patents may not be awarded with respect to these applications and even if such patents are awarded, third parties may seek to oppose or otherwise challenge our patents, and such patents\u2019 scope may differ significantly from what was requested in the patent applications and may not provide us with sufficient protection of our intellectual property. In the future, we may have to resort to litigation to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. This type of litigation is inherently unpredictable and, regardless of its outcome, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management attention and technical resources. Some of the software and protocols used in our business are based on standards set by standards setting organizations such as the IETF. To the extent any of our patents are considered \u201cstandards essential patents,\u201d in some cases we may be required to license such patents to our competitors on reasonable and non-discriminatory terms or otherwise be limited in our ability to assert such patents.\nWe also license externally developed technology that is used in some of our products and services to perform key functions. These externally developed technology licenses may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The loss of, or our inability to obtain or maintain, any of these technology licenses could hinder or increase the cost of our services, launching new products and services, entering into new markets and/or otherwise harm our business. Some of the software and protocols used in our business are in the public domain or may otherwise become publicly available, which means that such software and protocols are or may become equally available to our competitors.\nWe rely on the strength of our Verisign brand to help differentiate Verisign in the marketing of our products. Dilution of the strength of our brand could harm our business. We are at risk that we will be unable to fully register, build equity in, or enforce the Verisign logo in all markets where Verisign products and services are sold.", "PERMNO": 85753, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "VRSN"}
