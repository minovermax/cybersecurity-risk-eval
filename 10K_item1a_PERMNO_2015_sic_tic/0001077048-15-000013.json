{"cik": "1596961", "company": "Smart Server, Inc", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-17", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the other information included in this report, before making an investment decision. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. You should read the section entitled \u201cSpecial Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements\u201d above for a discussion of what types of statements are forward-looking statements, as well as the significance of such statements in the context of this report.\nInvestors in Smart Server should be particularly aware of the inherent risks associated with our business. As of the date of this filing our management is aware of the following material risks.\nWe are a development stage company organized in October 2013 and have recently commenced operations, making an evaluation of us extremely difficult. At this stage, even with our good faith efforts, there is nothing on which to base an assumption that we will become profitable or generate any significant amount of revenues.\nWe were incorporated in October 2013 as a Nevada corporation. As a result of our start-up operations we have; (i) generated no revenues, (ii) accumulated deficit of $168,860 as of November 30, 2014, and (iii) we have incurred losses of $168,860 for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2014. We have been focused on organizational, start-up activities and business plan development since we incorporated. Although we have commenced the development of our website and marketing strategy, there is nothing at this time on which to base an assumption that our business operations will prove to be successful or that we will ever be able to operate profitably. Our future operating results will depend on many factors, including our ability to raise adequate working capital, demand for our product, the level of our competition and our ability to attract and maintain key management and employees. We do not presently have a market-ready product and we currently do not have any customers. As such, we have generated no revenues.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under the JOBS Act of 2012, and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (\u201cJOBS Act\u201d), and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nIn addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We are choosing to take advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to those of companies that comply with public company effective dates.\nWe will remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d for up to five years, although we will lose that status sooner if our revenues exceed $1 billion, if we issue more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt in a three year period, or if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million.\u201d\nEven if we no longer qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d, we may still be subject to reduced reporting requirements so long as we are considered a \u201cSmaller Reporting Company.\u201d\nMany of the exemptions available for emerging growth companies are also available to smaller reporting companies like us that have less than $75 million of worldwide common equity held by non-affiliates. So, although we may no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, we may still be subject to reduced reporting requirements.\nShareholders who hold unregistered shares of our common stock are subject to resale restrictions pursuant to Rule 144, due to our status as a \u201cShell Company.\u201d\nPursuant to Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (\u201cRule 144\u201d), a \u201cshell company\u201d is defined as a company that has no or nominal operations; and, either no or nominal assets; assets consisting solely of cash and cash equivalents; or assets consisting of any amount of cash and cash equivalents and nominal other assets. As such, because we have nominal assets, we are considered a \u201cshell company\u201d pursuant to Rule 144 and as such, sales of our securities pursuant to Rule 144 are not able to be made until we have ceased to be a \u201cshell company\u201d and we are subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and have filed all of our required periodic reports for at least the previous one year period prior to any sale pursuant to Rule 144; and a period of at least twelve months has elapsed from the date \u201cForm 10 information\u201d (i.e., information similar to that which would be found in a Form 10 Registration Statement filing with the SEC) has been filed with the Commission reflecting the Company\u2019s status as a non-\u201cshell company.\u201d Because none of our non-registered securities can be sold pursuant to Rule 144, until one year after filing Form 10 like information with the SEC, any non-registered securities we sell in the future or issue to consultants or employees, in consideration for services rendered or for any other purpose will have no liquidity until and unless such securities are registered with the Commission and/or until 12 months after we cease to be a \u201cshell company\u201d and have complied with the other requirements of Rule 144, as described above. As a result, it may be harder for us to fund our operations and pay our consultants with our securities instead of cash. Furthermore, it will be harder for us to raise funding through the sale of debt or equity securities unless we agree to register such securities with the Commission, which could cause us to expend additional resources in the future. Our status as a \u201cshell company\u201d could prevent us from raising additional funds, engaging consultants, and using our securities to pay for any acquisitions (although none are currently planned), which could cause the value of our securities, if any, to decline in value or become worthless.\nOur auditor\u2019s report reflects the fact that the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to raise additional capital from the sale of common stock and, ultimately the achievement of significant operating revenues. If we are unable to continue as a going concern, you will lose your investment.\nOur financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. Our auditor\u2019s report reflects that the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to raise additional capital from the sale of common stock and, ultimately, the achievement of significant operating revenues. If we are unable to continue as a going concern, stockholders will lose their investment. We will be required to seek additional capital to fund future growth and expansion. No assurance can be given that such financing will be available or, if available, that it will be on commercially favorable terms. Moreover, favorable financing may be dilutive to investors.\nA decline in the popularity of our website will negatively impact our business.\nInitially, our primary source of revenues will be from advertising on our website (www. http://smart-server.biz/). These revenues are dependent upon our ability to attract new users on our site, among other things. If we are unable to maintain or extend web traffic to, and use of, our site, our advertising revenues may be adversely affected. Currently, our website is not yet fully operational. We are in the process of developing a more advanced site and intend to launch it during the end of the second quarter of 2015.\nIntense competition in the internet social networking industry and in the mobile payment solution industry may adversely affect our revenue and profitability.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment and we compete for members, visitors and advertisers with numerous well established internet social networking sites, as well as many smaller and/or newer sites. We will compete for consumers and advertisers with other companies, including internet, television and print media companies. If we are unable to differentiate our products and generate sufficient appeal in the marketplace, our ability to achieve our business plan may be adversely affected.\nAs compared to us, many of our competitors have significantly longer operating histories and greater brand recognition as well as, greater financial, management, and other resources.\nIf we are unable to compete effectively in our market, our revenue and profitability may be adversely affected.\nOur ability to increase our revenue will depend on our ability to increase market penetration of our social networking and to evolve our mobile payment solution model.\nThe social networking industry and the mobile payment solution industry are, by their nature, businesses that rely upon the acceptance of its creative product by the marketplace. Much of our ability to increase revenue will depend on:\n\u00b7 expanding the market penetration of our offerings to consumers; and\n\u00b7 the successful evolution of our product mix.\nWhile we will be constantly evaluating the marketplace and evolving our offerings of content and internet and mobile application features, we may not be able to anticipate shifting tastes of our customer base and the content offered by us may fall out of favor with our consumers. If we are unable to expand the market penetration of our current products or anticipate changes in consumer taste, our revenue could be affected.\nOur network is subject to security and stability risks that could harm our business and reputation and expose us to litigation or liability.\nOnline and mobile commerce and communications depend on the ability to transmit confidential information and licensed intellectual property securely over private and public networks. Any compromise of our ability to transmit such information and data securely or reliably, and any costs associated with preventing or eliminating such problems, could harm our business. Online transmissions are subject to a number of security and stability risks, including:\n\u00b7 our encryption and authentication technology, and access and security procedures, may be compromised, breached or otherwise be insufficient to ensure the security of customer information;\n\u00b7 we could experience unauthorized access, computer viruses, system interference or destruction, \u201cdenial of service\u201d attacks and other disruptive problems, whether intentional or accidental, that may inhibit or prevent access to our website or use of our products and services;\n\u00b7 someone could circumvent our security measures and misappropriate our partners\u2019 or our customers\u2019 intellectual property, interrupt our operations, or jeopardize our licensing arrangements, which are contingent on our sustaining appropriate security protections;\n\u00b7 our computer systems could fail and lead to service interruptions;\n\u00b7 we may be unable to scale our infrastructure with increases in customer demand; or\n\u00b7 our network of facilities may be affected by a natural disaster, terrorist attack or other catastrophic events.\nThe occurrence of any of these or similar events could damage our business, hurt our ability to distribute products and services and collect revenue, threaten the proprietary or confidential nature of our technology, harm our reputation and expose us to litigation or liability. We may be required to expend significant capital or other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches, hacker attacks or system malfunctions or to alleviate problems caused by such breaches, attacks or failures.\nWe will be competing with better established companies.\nWe will not be the first company to attempt to design and sell apps for mobile devices. There are other companies whose contacts and expertise may be more advanced than ours, and whose methods of marketing and resale may be more cost-effective. Further, we will be facing competition from better established companies, which may have better local, regional and national connections, and whose efforts produce larger sales and revenues.\nThe mobile application industry is subject to rapid technological change and, to compete, we must continually enhance our mobile App.\nWe must continue to enhance and improve the performance, functionality and reliability of our mobile App. The mobile application industry is characterized by rapid technological change, changes in user requirements and preferences, frequent new product and services introductions embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards and practices that could render our products and services obsolete. If we are unable to adapt to changing market conditions, customer requirements or emerging industry standards, we may not be able to increase our revenue and expand our business.\nWe may face intense competition and expect competition to increase in the future, which could prohibit us from developing a customer base and generating revenue.\nThe mobile application industry is highly competitive, with low barriers to entry and we expect more companies to enter the sector and a wider range of mobile Apps and related products and services to be introduced. These companies may already have an established market in our industry. Most of these companies have significantly greater financial and other resources than us and have been developing their products and services longer than we have been developing ours.\nIf our app was found to contain hidden or objectionable content, our reputation and operating results could suffer.\nWe do not currently have a market-ready app and currently have no customers, but hidden content may be included in our future app by an employee who was not authorized to do so or by an outside developer or supplier without our knowledge. This hidden content may contain profanity and sexually explicit or otherwise objectionable material. Our design, programming process and the constraints on the file size of our services would reduce the possibility of hidden, objectionable content appearing in the apps we publish. Nonetheless, these processes and constraints may not prevent this content from being included in our future app. If our app is found to contain hidden or objectionable content, our customers could refuse to sell it and consumers could refuse to buy it or demand a refund of their money. This could have a materially negative impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, our reputation could be harmed. If any of these consequences were to occur, our business, operating results and financial condition could be significantly harmed.\nWe intend to partner with mobile operators to market and distribute our services and thus to generate our revenues. The loss of, a change in or the failure to create any significant mobile operator relationships would cause us to lose access to their subscribers and thus materially reduce our revenues.\nWe intend to sell our application offerings primarily through direct sales to mobile operators. Our future success is highly dependent upon creating and maintaining successful relationships with mobile operators and establishing strong mobile operator relationships. Our failure to create and maintain relationships, or a significant reduction in revenues from, one or more of these mobile operators would materially reduce our revenues and thus harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nBecause a substantial portion of our revenues would be derived from third party mobile operators, if any of our significant mobile operators are unable to fulfill its payment obligations, our financial condition and results of operations would suffer.\nIf any of our future customers are unable to fulfill their payment obligations to us under their contracted agreements, our revenues and cash flows could decline significantly and our financial condition could be harmed. In addition, recent disruptions in national and international credit markets have led to a scarcity of credit, tighter lending standards and higher interest rates on consumer and business loans. Continued disruptions in credit markets may materially limit consumer credit availability and restrict credit availability of mobile operators, which may also impact their ability to fulfill their payment obligations.\nMobile subscriber tastes are continually changing and are often unpredictable; if we fail to develop apps that achieve market acceptance, our sales could suffer.\nOur business will depend on apps that mobile operators will offer and mobile subscribers will buy. We must invest significant resources in research and development, as well as programming, design and marketing. Our success depends, in part, on unpredictable and volatile factors beyond our control including end-user preferences, competing companies and the availability of other apps. If our Company is not responsive to the requirements of our future mobile operator customers, the demands and preferences of mobile subscribers, or they are not brought to market in a timely and effective manner, our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed. Even if our services are successfully introduced and initially adopted, a subsequent shift in our mobile operator customers could cause a decline in popularity that could materially reduce our revenues and harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property, which may facilitate the development of competing services by others.\nAt this time our only intellectual property is the source code which is being written to run our first application. We will rely on a combination of trade secret and copyright laws, restrictions on disclosure, to protect it and any other intellectual property rights which may develop during the time of and upon completion of our initial source code. Despite our efforts to protect our source code and any other proprietary rights which may develop; third parties may copy or otherwise obtain and use our apps or technology. The laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as the laws of the United States. If we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, it will be easier for our competitors to sell competing apps.\nOur services may infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may result in lawsuits and prohibit us from selling our services or subject us to litigation costs and monetary damages.\nThere is a risk that third parties have filed or will file applications for, or have received or will receive, patents or obtain additional intellectual property rights relating to materials or processes that we use or propose to use. As a result, from time to time, third parties may assert patent or other intellectual property rights to technologies that are used in our services or are otherwise important to us. In addition, third parties may assert claims or initiate litigation against us or our manufacturers, suppliers, customers or partners with respect to existing or future services or other proprietary rights. We generally undertake to indemnify our customers and partners against intellectual property infringement claims asserted against them with respect to the services we sell to, or distribute through, them. Any claims against us or customers or partners that we indemnify against intellectual property claims, with or without merit, may be time-consuming, result in costly litigation or monetary damages and diversion of technical and management personnel, or require us to develop non-infringing technology. If a claim is successful, we may be required to obtain a license from the parties claiming the infringement. If we are unable to obtain a license, we may be unable to market our affected services. Limitations on our ability to market our services and delays and costs associated with monetary damages and redesigns in compliance with an adverse judgment or settlement would harm our business.\nEconomic conditions and any associated impact on consumer spending could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to macroeconomic fluctuations in the United States and worldwide economy, including those that impact discretionary consumer spending. Continued economic uncertainty and reductions in discretionary consumer spending may result in reductions in sales of our mobile personalization services, which would adversely affect our business, results of operations and our financial condition. If these issues persist, or if the economy continues this prolonged period of decelerating growth or recession, our results of operations may be harmed.\nOur present limited operations have not yet proven profitable.\nTo date we have not shown a profit in our operations. We do not presently have a market-ready product, and we currently do not have any customers. We cannot assure that we will achieve or attain profitability in 2014 or at any other time. If we cannot achieve operating profitability, we may not be able to meet our working capital requirements, which will have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition\nMs. Elliott has no experience in running a public company. The lack of experience in operating a public company could impact our return on investment, if any.\nAs a result of our reliance on Ms. Elliott, and her lack of experience in operating a public company, our investors are at risk in losing their entire investment. Ms. Elliott intends to hire personnel in the future, when sufficiently capitalized, who would have the experience required to manage our company, such management is not anticipated until the occurrence of future financing. Since our recently completed offering will not sufficiently capitalize our company, future offerings will be necessary to satisfy capital needs. Until such a future offering occurs, and until such management is in place, we are reliant upon Ms. Elliott to make the appropriate management decisions.\nMs. Elliott is involved with other businesses and there can be no assurance that she will continue to provide services to us. Ms. Elliott\u2019s limited time devotion to Smart Server could have the effect on our operations of preventing us from being a successful business operation, which ultimately could cause a loss of your investment.\nAs compared to many other public companies, we do not have the depth of managerial or technical personnel. Ms. Elliott is currently and may continue to be involved with other businesses.\nMs. Elliott is planning on allocating an additional 15 to 20 hours a week to the affairs of Smart Server; however there can be no assurance that she will continue to provide services to us. Ms. Elliott will devote only a portion of her time to our activities.\nWe will require additional financing in order to implement our business plan. In the event we are unable to acquire additional financing, we may not be able to implement our business plan resulting in a loss of revenues and ultimately the loss of your investment.\nDue to our start-up nature, we will have to incur the costs of website and marketing development, and all other associated fees. To fully implement our business plan we will require additional funding.\nWe will need to raise additional funds to expand our operations. We plan to raise additional funds through private placements, registered offerings, debt financing or other sources to maintain and expand our operations. Adequate funds for this purpose on terms favorable to us may not be available, and if available, on terms significantly more adverse to us than are manageable. Without new funding, we may be only partially successful or completely unsuccessful in implementing our business plan, and our stockholders will lose part or all of their investment.\nThere has been a limited public market for our common stock, and we do not know if one will develop that will provide you with adequate liquidity. The trading price for our common stock may be volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations.\nAlthough our common stock is listed for trading on the Over-the-Counter Pink Sheets (\u201cOTCPK\u201d) under the trading symbol SVTZ, and we intend to apply for the Over-the-Counter Quotation Board (\u201cOTCQB\u201d), we cannot assure you that we will meet OTCQB's listing requirements, and therefore may not be able to meet the standards for such listing. Furthermore, we cannot assure you that an active trading market for our common stock will develop. The liquidity of any market for the shares of our common stock will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7\nthe number of stockholders;\n\u00b7\nour operating performance and financial condition;\n\u00b7\nthe market for similar securities;\n\u00b7\nthe extent of coverage of us by securities or industry analysts; and\n\u00b7\nthe interest of securities dealers in making a market in the shares of our common stock.\nHistorically, the market for equity securities has also been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of these securities, which may not have corresponded to the business or financial success of the particular company. We cannot assure you that the market for the shares of our common stock will be free from similar disruptions. Any such disruptions could have an adverse effect on stockholders. In addition, the price of the shares of our common stock could decline significantly if our future operating results fail to meet or exceed the expectations of market analysts and investors.\nEven if an active trading market develops, the market price for our common stock may be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations. Some of the facts that could negatively affect our share price include:\n\u00b7\nactual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results;\nBecause our common stock is deemed a low-priced \u201cPenny\u201d stock, an investment in our common stock should be considered high risk and subject to marketability restrictions.\nSince our common stock is a penny stock, as defined in Rule 3a51-1 under the Securities Exchange Act, it will be more difficult for investors to liquidate their investment even if and when a market develops for the common stock. Until the trading price of the common stock rises above $5.00 per share, if ever, trading in the common stock is subject to the penny stock rules of the Securities Exchange Act specified in rules 15g-1 through 15g-10. Those rules require broker-dealers, before effecting transactions in any penny stock, to:\n\u00b7\nDeliver to the customer, and obtain a written receipt for, a disclosure document;\n\u00b7\nDisclose certain price information about the stock;\n\u00b7\nDisclose the amount of compensation received by the broker-dealer or any associated person of the broker-dealer;\n\u00b7\nSend monthly statements to customers with market and price information about the penny stock; and\n\u00b7\nIn some circumstances, approve the purchaser\u2019s account under certain standards and deliver written statements to the customer with information specified in the rules.\nConsequently, the penny stock rules may restrict the ability or willingness of broker-dealers to sell the common stock and may affect the ability of holders to sell their common stock in the secondary market and the price at which such holders can sell any such securities. These additional procedures could also limit our ability to raise additional capital in the future.\nOur internal controls may be inadequate which could cause our financial reporting to be unreliable and lead to misinformation being disseminated to the public.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. As defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f), internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the principal executive and principal financial officer and effected by the board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Exchange Act Rule includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of Creative, and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nWe have one individual performing the functions of all officers, and single director. Our sole officer and director has developed internal control procedures and is responsible for monitoring and ensuring compliance with those procedures. Management has determined that our internal controls are, at this time, adequate and effective. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Investors relying upon this misinformation may make an uninformed investment decision.\nBecause our common stock could remain under $5.00 per share, it could continue to be deemed a low-priced \u201cPenny\u201d stock, an investment in our common stock should be considered high risk and subject to marketability restrictions.\nSince our common stock is currently under $5.00 per share, it is considered a penny stock, as defined in Rule 3a51-1 under the Securities Exchange Act, it will be more difficult for investors to liquidate their investment even if and when a market develops for the common stock. If the trading price of the common stock stays below $5.00 per share, trading in the common stock is subject to the penny stock rules of the Securities Exchange Act specified in rules 15g-1 through 15g-10. Those rules require broker-dealers, before effecting transactions in any penny stock, to:\n\u00b7\nDeliver to the customer, and obtain a written receipt for, a disclosure document;\n\u00b7\nDisclose certain price information about the stock;\n\u00b7\nDisclose the amount of compensation received by the broker-dealer or any associated person of the broker-dealer;\n\u00b7\nSend monthly statements to customers with market and price information about the penny stock; and\n\u00b7\nIn some circumstances, approve the purchaser\u2019s account under certain standards and deliver written statements to the customer with information specified in the rules.\nConsequently, the penny stock rules may restrict the ability or willingness of broker-dealers to accept the common stock for deposit into an account or, if accepted for deposit, to sell the common stock and these restrictions may affect the ability of holders to sell their common stock in the secondary market and the price at which such holders can sell any such securities. These additional procedures could also limit our ability to raise additional capital in the future.", "PERMNO": 16999, "SIC": 5961, "TIC": "RMBL"}
