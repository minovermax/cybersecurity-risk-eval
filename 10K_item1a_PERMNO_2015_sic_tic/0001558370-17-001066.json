RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to factors discussed elsewhere in this Report, the following are important risks which could adversely affect our future results. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently do not deem material may also impair our business operations. If any of the risks we describe below occur, or if any unforeseen risk develops, our operating results may suffer, our financial condition may deteriorate, the trading price of our common stock may decline and investors could lose all or part of their investment in us.\nRisks Related to Our Operations\nWe may experience fleet transition costs, which may negatively impact our financial results.\nDuring 2016, we removed 40 50-seat aircraft and nine CRJ700 aircraft from scheduled service. We anticipate removing approximately 105 50-seat aircraft from service during 2017, which will likely result in a net fleet reduction from the end of 2016 to the end of 2017. Although the anticipated reduction in our 50-seat aircraft in 2017 is consistent with our long-term fleet plans to improve long-term profitability and reduce fleet risk, we may experience operating inefficiencies and cash and/or non-cash expenses in 2017 in connection with the aircraft reductions. These inefficiencies and expenses may include, but are not limited to, under-utilized facilities and other assets, infrastructure reductions and employee relocation costs. Additionally, we anticipate transitioning certain CRJ700 aircraft between major airline partners\u2019 code-share agreements during 2017. We may experience inefficiencies while aircraft are temporarily removed from service during a transition period. Fleet transition expenses and potential operating inefficiencies may negatively impact our financial results.\nThe residual value of our owned aircraft may be less than estimated in our depreciation policies.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $3.8 billion of property and equipment and related assets net of accumulated depreciation. Additionally, as of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $8.2 million in intangible assets. In accounting for these long-lived and intangible assets, we make estimates about the expected useful lives of the assets, the expected residual values of certain of these assets, and the potential for impairment based on the fair value of the assets and the cash flows they generate. Factors indicating potential impairment include, but are not limited to, significant decreases in the market value of the long-lived assets, a significant change in the condition of the long-lived assets and operating cash flow losses associated with the use of the long-lived assets. In the event the estimated residual value of any of our aircraft types is determined to be lower than the residual value assumptions used in our depreciation policies, the applicable aircraft type in our fleet may be impaired and may result in a material reduction in the book value of applicable aircraft types we operate or we may need to prospectively modify our depreciation policies. For example, during 2016 we recorded an impairment of $465.6 million attributable to certain long-lived assets associated with our 50-seat aircraft primarily resulting from changes to our short-term and long-term fleet plans with our 50-seat aircraft. An impairment on any of our aircraft types we operate or an increased level of depreciation expense resulting from a change to our depreciation policies could result in a material negative impact to our financial results.\nIncreased labor costs, strikes, labor disputes and increased unionization of our workforces may adversely affect our ability to conduct our business and reduce our profitability.\nOur business is labor intensive, requiring large numbers of pilots, flight attendants, mechanics and other personnel. Labor costs constitute a significant percentage of our total operating costs. For example, during the year ended December 31, 2016, our salary, wage and benefit costs constituted approximately 36.8% of our total operating costs. Increases in our labor costs could result in a material reduction in our earnings. Any new collective bargaining agreements entered into by other regional carriers with their work forces may also result in higher industry wages and increased pressure on us to increase the wages and benefits of our employees. Future agreements with unionized and non-unionized employees may be on terms that are not as attractive as our current agreements or comparable to agreements entered into by our competitors.\nApproximately 33.4% of our workforce is unionized. Strikes or labor disputes with our unionized employees may adversely affect our ability to conduct business. Relations between air carriers and labor unions in the United States are governed by the RLA, which provides that a collective bargaining agreement between an airline and a labor union does not expire, but instead becomes amendable as of a stated date. The RLA generally prohibits strikes or other types of\nself-help action both before and after a collective bargaining agreement becomes amendable, unless and until the collective bargaining processes required by the RLA have been exhausted.\nSkyWest Airlines\u2019 employees are not currently represented by any union; however, collective bargaining group organization efforts among those employees occur from time to time. Such efforts will likely continue in the future and may ultimately result in some or all of SkyWest Airlines\u2019 employees being represented by one or more unions. Moreover, one or more unions representing ExpressJet employees may seek a single carrier determination by the National Mediation Board, which could require SkyWest Airlines to recognize such union or unions as the certified bargaining representative of SkyWest Airlines\u2019 employees. One or more unions representing ExpressJet employees may also assert that SkyWest Airlines\u2019 employees should be subject to ExpressJet\u2019s collective bargaining agreements. If SkyWest Airlines\u2019 employees were to unionize or be deemed to be represented by one or more unions, negotiations with unions representing SkyWest Airlines\u2019 employees could divert management attention and disrupt operations, which may result in increased operating expenses and may negatively impact our financial results. Moreover, we cannot predict the outcome of any future negotiations relating to union representation or collective bargaining agreements. Agreements reached in collective bargaining may increase our operating expenses and negatively impact our financial results.\nThe supply of pilots to the airline industry is limited and may negatively affect our operations and financial condition.\nOn July 8, 2013, as directed by the U.S. Congress, the FAA issued more stringent pilot qualification and crew member flight training standards, which increase the required training time for new commercial pilots. In recent years, we have also experienced a reduction in pilot applicants with previous military experience. With these changes, the supply of qualified pilot candidates eligible for hiring by the airline industry has been dramatically reduced. Additionally, major airlines may significantly increase the number of pilots hired from regional carriers due to the number of pilots at the major airlines reaching the statutory mandatory retirement age of 65 years. These factors may cause our pilot attrition rates to be higher than our ability to hire and retain replacement pilots. If we are unable to maintain a sufficient number of eligible pilots to operate our scheduled flights, we may need to request a reduced flight schedule with our major airline partners, which may result in operational performance penalties under the code-share agreements with those partners and our operations and financial results could be materially and adversely affected.\nAdditionally, our projected number of available pilots and attrition rates may impact our fleet planning decisions. If actual pilot availability or our actual pilot attrition rates are materially different than our projections, our operations and financial results could be materially and adversely affected. A shortage of qualified pilots to conduct our operations may cause us to underutilize our aircraft and would negatively impact our operations and financial condition.\nThe amounts we receive under our code-share agreements may be less than the corresponding costs we incur.\nUnder our fixed-fee contracts with Delta, United, American and Alaska, a portion of our compensation is based upon pre-determined rates typically applied to production statistics (such as departures, block hours, flight hours and number of aircraft in service each month). The primary operating costs intended to be compensated by the pre-determined rates include labor costs, including crew training costs, certain aircraft maintenance expenses, and overhead costs. During the year ended December 31, 2016, approximately 88.6% of our code-share operating costs were reimbursable at pre-determined rates and 11.4% of our code-share operating costs were pass-through costs. Additionally, our aircraft maintenance costs may increase annually as our fleet ages at a higher rate than our pre-determined rates allow. If our operating costs for labor, aircraft maintenance and overhead costs exceed the compensation earned from our pre-determined rates under our fixed-fee arrangements, our financial position and operating results will be negatively affected.\nWe may be limited from expanding our flying within our major airline partners\u2019 flight systems.\nAdditional growth opportunities within our major airline partners\u2019 flight systems are limited by various factors, including a limited number of regional aircraft each such major airline partner can operate in its regional network due to its own labor agreements. Except as contemplated by our existing code-share agreements, we cannot be sure that our major airline partners will contract with us to fly any additional aircraft. We may not receive additional growth opportunities, or may agree to modifications to our code-share agreements that reduce certain benefits to us in order to obtain additional aircraft, or for other reasons. Given the competitive nature of the airline industry, we believe limited\ngrowth opportunities may result in competitors accepting reduced margins and less favorable contract terms in order to secure new or additional code-share operations. Even if we are offered growth opportunities by our major airline partners, those opportunities may involve economic terms or financing commitments that are unacceptable to us. Additionally, our major airline partners may reduce the number of regional jets in their system by not renewing or extending existing flying arrangements with regional operators. Any one or more of these factors may reduce or eliminate our ability to expand our flight operations with our existing major airline partners. We also cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to obtain the additional ground and maintenance facilities, including gates and support equipment, to expand our operations. The failure to obtain these facilities and equipment would likely impede our efforts to grow our business and could materially and adversely affect our operating results and our financial condition.\nThe decision by any of our major airline partners to reduce or limit code-share service may negatively affect our business.\nOur business model depends on major airlines electing to contract with us instead of operating their own regional jets. Some regional airlines are owned by a major airline. We have no guarantee that in the future our major airline partners will choose to enter into contracts with us instead of operating their own regional jets. Our major airline partners are not prohibited from doing so under our code-share agreements. A decision by any of our major airline partners to phase out code-share relationships and instead acquire and operate their own regional jets could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or the price of our common stock.\nWe have aircraft lease and debt commitments that extend beyond our existing fixed-fee contractual term on certain aircraft.\nUnder our fixed-fee arrangements with multiple major airline partners we have a total of 41 CRJ700s with flying contract expirations in 2019. Our underlying lease or debt financing obligations associated with each of these aircraft are scheduled to terminate in 2023 and 2024 on an aircraft-by-aircraft basis. We may not be successful in extending the flying contract term on these aircraft with our major airline partner at acceptable economic terms. In the event we are unsuccessful in extending the flying contract terms on these aircraft, we intend to pursue alternative uses for the aircraft over the remaining aircraft financing term including, but not limited to, operating the aircraft with another major carrier under a negotiated code-share agreement, subleasing the aircraft to another operator, and/or marketing the debt financed aircraft for sale. Additionally, we may negotiate an early lease return agreement with the aircraft lessor. In the event we are unable to extend the flying contract terms for these aircraft at each respective contract\u2019s expiration, we may incur cash and non-cash early lease termination costs that would negatively impact our operations and financial condition. Additionally, in the event we are unable to extend a flying contract with an existing major airline partner, but reach an agreement to place the aircraft into service with a different major airline partner, we likely will incur inefficiencies and incremental costs, such as changing the aircraft livery, which would negatively impact our financial results.\nThere are long-term risks related to supply and demand of regional aircraft associated with our regional airline services strategy.\nOur major airline partners have indicated that their committed supply of regional airline capacity is larger than they desire given current market conditions. Specifically, they have identified a general oversupply of 50-seat regional jets under contractual commitments with regional airlines. Delta in particular has reduced both the number of 50-seat regional jets within its network and the number of regional airlines with which it contracts. Including all regional airlines, there are currently more than 100 50-seat aircraft within the Delta Connection system, over 200 50-seat aircraft in the United system and over 200 50-seat aircraft in the American system. In addition to reducing the number of 50-seat jets under contract, major airlines have reduced the utilization of regional aircraft, thereby reducing the revenue paid to regional airlines under capacity purchase agreements (See the risk factor titled \u201cReduced utilization levels of our aircraft under our code-share agreements would adversely impact our financial results\u201d for additional details). This decrease has had, and may continue to have, a negative impact on our regional airline services revenue and financial results.\nThe Airline Safety and Pilot Training Improvement Act of 2009 could negatively affect our operations and our financial condition.\nThe Airline Safety and Pilot Training Improvement Act of 2009 (the \u201cImprovement Act\u201d) became effective in August 2013. The Improvement Act added new certification requirements for entry-level commercial pilots, requires additional emergency training for airline personnel, improves availability of pilot records and mandates stricter rules to minimize pilot fatigue.\nThe Improvement Act also:\n\u00b7\nRequires that all airline pilots obtain an Airline Transport Pilot license, which was previously only required for captains.\n\u00b7\nObligates the FAA to maintain a database of pilot records, including records to be provided by airlines and other sources, so that airlines will have access to more information before they hire pilots.\n\u00b7\nRequires the FAA to issue new regulations governing the airlines\u2019 obligations to submit pilot records and the requirements for airlines to obtain access for information in the database before the database portion of the Improvement Act becomes effective.\n\u00b7\nDirects the FAA to rewrite the rules for how long pilots are allowed to work and how much rest they must have before working.\nThe Improvement Act (and associated regulations) has increased our compliance and FAA reporting obligations, has had a negative effect on pilot scheduling, work hours and the number of pilots required to be employed for our operations or other aspects of our operations, and may continue to negatively impact our operations and financial condition.\nWe are highly dependent on Delta and United.\nAs of December 31, 2016, 561 out of our total 652 aircraft available for scheduled service were operating under a fixed-fee arrangement or a revenue-sharing agreement with either Delta or United. If our code-share agreements with Delta or United were terminated, we would be significantly impacted and likely would not have an immediate source of revenue or earnings to offset such loss. A termination of either of these agreements would likely have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operating revenues and net income unless we are able to enter into satisfactory substitute arrangements for the utilization of the affected aircraft by other code-share partners, or, alternatively, obtain the airport facilities and gates and make the other arrangements necessary to fly as an independent airline. We may not be able to enter into substitute code-share arrangements, and any such arrangements we might secure may not be as favorable to us as our current agreements. Operating an airline independent from major airline partners would be a significant departure from our business plan and would likely require significant time and resources, which may not be available to us at that point.\nThe SkyWest Airlines and ExpressJet Delta Connection Agreements are subject to certain early termination provisions. Delta\u2019s termination rights include cross-termination rights (meaning that a breach by either of SkyWest Airlines or ExpressJet of its Delta Connection Agreement could, under certain circumstances, permit Delta to terminate either of the Delta Connection Agreements), the right to terminate each of the agreements upon the occurrence of certain force majeure events (including certain labor-related events) that prevent SkyWest Airlines or ExpressJet from performance for certain periods and the right to terminate each of the agreements if SkyWest Airlines or ExpressJet, as applicable, fails to maintain competitive base rate costs, subject to certain rights of SkyWest Airlines to take corrective action to reimburse Delta for lost revenues. The current terms of the SkyWest Airlines and ExpressJet United Express Agreements are subject to certain early termination provisions and subsequent renewals. United may terminate the SkyWest Airlines and ExpressJet United Express Agreements due to an uncured breach by SkyWest Airlines or ExpressJet of certain operational or performance provisions, including measures and standards related to flight completions, baggage handling and on-time arrivals.\nWe currently use the systems, facilities and services of Delta and United to support a significant portion of our operations, including airport and terminal facilities and operations, information technology support, ticketing and reservations, scheduling, dispatching, fuel purchasing and ground handling services. If Delta or United were to cease to maintain any of these systems, close any of these facilities or no longer provide these services to us, due to termination\nof one of our code-share agreements, a strike or other labor interruption by Delta or United personnel or for any other reason, we may not be able to obtain alternative systems, facilities or services on terms and conditions as favorable as those we currently receive, or at all. Since our revenues and operating profits are dependent on our level of flight operations, we could then be forced to significantly reduce our operations. Furthermore, upon certain terminations of our code-share agreements, Delta and United could require us to sell or assign to them facilities and assets, including maintenance facilities, we use in connection with the code-share services we provide. As a result, in order to offer airline service after termination of any of our code-share agreements, we may have to replace these facilities, assets and services. We may be unable to arrange such replacements on satisfactory terms, or at all.\nDisagreements regarding the interpretation of our code-share agreements with our major airline partners could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nLong-term contractual agreements, such as our code-share agreements, are subject to interpretation and disputes may arise under such agreements if the parties to an agreement apply different interpretations to that agreement. Those disputes may divert management time and resources from the core operation of the business, and may result in litigation, arbitration or other forms of dispute resolution.\nIn recent years we have experienced disagreements with our major airline partners regarding the interpretation of various provisions of our code-share agreements. Some of those disagreements have resulted in litigation, and we may be subject to additional disputes and litigation in the future. Those disagreements have also required a significant amount of management time, financial resources and settlement negotiations of disputed matters.\nTo the extent that we continue to experience disagreements regarding the interpretation of our code-share or other agreements, we will likely expend valuable management time and financial resources in our efforts to resolve those disagreements. Those disagreements may result in litigation, arbitration, settlement negotiations or other proceedings. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that any or all of those proceedings, if commenced, would be resolved in our favor. An unfavorable result in any such proceeding could have adverse financial consequences or require us to modify our operations. Such disagreements and their consequences could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nReduced utilization levels of our aircraft under our code-share agreements would adversely impact our financial results.\nThe majority of our code-share agreements set forth minimum levels of flight operations which our major airline partners are required to schedule for our operations and we are required to provide. These minimum flight operating levels are intended to provide a baseline level of expected utilization of aircraft, labor, maintenance facilities and related flight operations support. Historically, our major airline partners have utilized our flight operations at levels which exceed the minimum levels set forth in our code-share agreements, however, higher fuel costs or other factors may cause our major airline partners to reduce our utilization levels. If our major airline partners schedule the utilization of our aircraft below historical levels (including taking into account the stage length and frequency of our scheduled flights), we may not be able to maintain operating efficiencies previously obtained, which would negatively impact our operating results and financial condition. Additionally, our major airline partners may change routes and frequencies of flights, which can negatively impact our operating efficiencies. Changes in schedules may increase our flight costs, which could exceed the reimbursed rates paid by our major airline partners. Continued reduced utilization levels of our aircraft or other changes to our schedules under our code-share agreements would adversely impact our financial results.\nWe have a significant amount of contractual obligations.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had a total of approximately $2.6 billion in total long-term debt obligations. Substantially all of this long-term debt was incurred in connection with the acquisition of aircraft and engines. We also have significant long-term lease obligations primarily relating to our aircraft fleet. These leases are classified as operating leases and therefore are not reflected as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. At December 31, 2016, we had 415 aircraft under lease, with remaining terms ranging up to nine years. Future minimum lease payments due under all long-term operating leases were approximately $1.0 billion at December 31, 2016. At a 4.77% discount factor, which is the average rate used to approximate the implicit rates within the applicable aircraft leases, the present value of\nthese lease obligations was equal to approximately $0.8 billion at December 31, 2016. Our high level of fixed obligations could impact our ability to obtain additional financing to support additional expansion plans or divert cash flows from operations and expansion plans to service the fixed obligations.\nOur anticipated fleet replacement would require a significant increase in our leverage and the related cash requirements.\nWe currently have 213 CRJ200s with an average life of 14.4 years and 154 ERJ145s with an average life of 14.3 years. Over the next several years, we may continue to replace the CRJ200s and ERJ145s with larger regional jets. If we continue to add new aircraft to our fleet, we anticipate using significant amounts of capital to acquire these larger regional jets.\nThere can be no assurance that our operations will generate sufficient cash flow or liquidity to enable us to obtain the necessary aircraft acquisition financing to replace our current fleet, or to make required debt service payments related to our existing or anticipated future obligations. Even if we meet all required debt, lease and purchase obligations, the size of these long-term obligations could negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations and the price of our common stock in many ways, including:\n\u00b7\nincreasing the cost, or limiting the availability of, additional financing for working capital, acquisitions or other purposes;\n\u00b7\nlimiting the ways in which we can use our cash flow, much of which may have to be used to satisfy debt and lease obligations; and\n\u00b7\nadversely affecting our ability to respond to changing business or economic conditions or continue our growth strategy.\nIf we need additional capital and cannot obtain such capital on acceptable terms, or at all, we may be unable to realize our fleet replacement plans or take advantage of unanticipated opportunities\nWe could be adversely affected by an outbreak of a disease that affects travel behavior.\nIn recent years, various virus and illness outbreaks, including, but not limited to Zika, Ebola, H1N1 flu virus and SARS, have an adverse impact on travel behavior. Any outbreak of a disease or spread of existing illnesses that affects travel behavior could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition. In addition, outbreaks of disease could result in quarantines of our personnel or an inability to access facilities or our aircraft, which could adversely affect our operations and financial condition.\nInterruptions or disruptions in service at one of our hub airports, due to adverse weather, system malfunctions or for any other reason, could have a material adverse impact on our operations.\nWe currently operate primarily through hubs in Atlanta, Los Angeles, Houston, Minneapolis, Detroit, San Francisco, Salt Lake City, Chicago, Denver, Houston, Washington, D.C., Newark, Cleveland and the Pacific Northwest. Nearly all of our flights either originate from or fly into one of these hubs. Our revenues depend primarily on our completion of flights and secondarily on service factors such as timeliness of departure and arrival. Any interruptions or disruptions could, therefore, severely and adversely affect us. Extreme weather can cause flight disruptions, and, during periods of storms or adverse weather, our flights may be canceled or significantly delayed. Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and Superstorm Sandy, in particular, caused severe disruption to air travel in the affected areas and adversely affected airlines operating in the region. We operate a significant number of flights to and from airports with particular weather difficulties, including Atlanta, Salt Lake City, Chicago, San Francisco, Newark and Denver. A significant interruption or disruption in service at one of our hubs, due to adverse weather, system malfunctions, security closures or otherwise, could result in the cancellation or delay of a significant portion of our flights and, as a result, could have a severe adverse impact on our operations and financial performance.\nEconomic and industry conditions constantly change, and negative economic conditions in the United States and other countries may create challenges for us that could materially and adversely affect our operations and financial condition.\nOur operations and financial condition are affected by many changing economic and other conditions beyond our control, including, among others:\n\u00b7\ndisruptions in the credit markets, which have resulted in greater volatility, less liquidity, widening of credit spreads, and decreased availability of financing;\n\u00b7\nactual or potential changes in international, national, regional and local economic, business and financial conditions, including recession, inflation, higher interest rates, wars, terrorist attacks or political instability;\n\u00b7\nchanges in consumer preferences, perceptions, spending patterns or demographic trends;\n\u00b7\nchanges in the competitive environment due to industry consolidation and other factors;\n\u00b7\nactual or potential disruptions to U.S. air traffic control systems;\n\u00b7\nprice of jet fuel and oil;\n\u00b7\noutbreaks of diseases that affect travel behavior; and\n\u00b7\nweather and natural disasters.\nThe effect of any, or some combination, of the foregoing economic and industry conditions on our operations or financial condition is virtually impossible to forecast; however, the occurrence of any or all of such conditions in a significant manner could materially and adversely affect our operations and financial condition.\nWe could be adversely affected by significant disruptions in the supply of fuel or by significant fluctuation in fuel prices.\nDependence on foreign imports of crude oil, limited refining capacity and the possibility of changes in government policy on jet fuel production, transportation and marketing make it impossible to predict the future availability of jet fuel. If there are additional outbreaks of hostilities or other conflicts in oil-producing areas or elsewhere, or a reduction in refining capacity (due to weather events, for example), or governmental limits on the production or sale of jet fuel, there could be a reduction in the supply of jet fuel and significant increases in the cost of jet fuel. Additionally, our operations may experience disruptions from temporary fuel shortages by our fuel vendors resulting from fuel quality issues, refueling disruption, or other challenges. Major reductions in the availability of jet fuel or significant increases in its cost, or a continuation of high fuel prices for a significant period of time, would have a material adverse impact on us.\nPursuant to our fixed-fee arrangements, our major airline partners have agreed to bear the economic risk of fuel price fluctuations on our contracted flights. However, we bear the economic risk of fuel price fluctuations on our prorate operations. As of December 31, 2016, we operated 22 CRJ200s under a prorate agreement with United, 21 CRJ200s under a prorate agreement with Delta, and nine CRJ200s under a prorate agreement with American. Our operating and financial results with respect to these prorate arrangements can be negatively affected by the price of jet fuel in the event we are unable to increase our passenger fares. Additionally in the event of prolonged low fuel prices, our competitors may lower their passenger ticket prices on routes that compete with our prorate markets, which could negatively impact our passenger load factors.\nThe issuance of operating restrictions applicable to one of the fleet types we operate could negatively impact our business and financial condition.\nWe rely on a limited number of aircraft types, and are dependent upon Bombardier and Embraer as the sole manufacturers of our aircraft. The issuance of FAA or manufacturer directives restricting or prohibiting the use of Bombardier or Embraer aircraft types we operate could negatively impact our business and financial results. We are also dependent upon General Electric and Rolls Royce as the sole manufacturers of our aircraft engines. Our operations could be materially and adversely affected by the failure or inability of Bombardier, Embraer, General Electric or Rolls Royce to provide sufficient parts or related maintenance and support services to us on a timely manner, or the interruption of our flight operations as a result of unscheduled or unanticipated maintenance requirements for our aircraft or engines.\nCertain flying arrangements with our major airline partners are terminable upon notice of 120 days or less.\nCertain of our flying agreements with our major airline partners permit the major airline partner to terminate the agreement in its discretion by giving us notice of 120 days or less. If one of our major airline partners elects to terminate a flying agreement with notice of 120 days or less, our ability to use the aircraft under an alternative agreement with similar economics may be limited, which could negatively impact our financial results. Additionally, even if we can subsequently place the aircraft into service with a different major airline partner, of which there can be no assurance, we likely would incur inefficiencies and incremental costs, such as changing the aircraft livery, during the transition period, which would negatively impact our financial results.\nIf we have a failure in our technology or if we have security breaches of our information technology infrastructure, our business and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nThe performance and reliability of our technology are critical to our ability to compete effectively. Any internal technological error or failure or large-scale external interruption in the technological infrastructure we depend on, such as power, telecommunications or the internet, may disrupt our internal network. Any individual, sustained or repeated failure of technology could impact our ability to conduct our business and result in increased costs. Our technological systems and related data may be vulnerable to a variety of sources of interruption due to events beyond our control, including natural disasters, terrorist attacks, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, hackers and other security issues.\nIn addition, as a part of our ordinary business operations, we collect and store sensitive data, including personal information of our passengers and employees and information of our business partners. Our information systems are subject to an increasing threat of continually evolving cybersecurity risks. Unauthorized parties may attempt to gain access to our systems or information through fraud or other means of deception. The methods used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems are constantly evolving, and may be difficult to anticipate or to detect for long periods of time. We may not be able to prevent all data security breaches or misuse of data. The compromise of our technology systems resulting in the loss, disclosure, misappropriation of, or access to, customers\u2019, employees\u2019 or business partners\u2019 information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information, disruption to our operations and damage to our reputation, any or all of which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nOur business could be harmed if we lose the services of our key personnel.\nOur business depends upon the efforts of our chief executive officer, Russell A. Childs, and our other key management and operating personnel. We may have difficulty replacing management or other key personnel who cease to be employed by us and, therefore, the loss of the services of any of these individuals could harm our business. We do not maintain key-person insurance on any of our executive officers.\nRisks Related to the Airline Industry\nWe may be materially affected by uncertainties in the airline industry.\nThe airline industry has experienced tremendous challenges in recent years and will likely remain volatile for the foreseeable future. Among other factors, the financial challenges faced by major and regional carriers and the high profile target of airlines for terrorist groups have significantly affected, and are likely to continue to affect, the U.S.\nairline industry. These events have resulted in declines and shifts in passenger demand, increased insurance costs, increased government regulations and tightened credit markets, all of which have affected, and will likely continue to affect, the operations and financial condition of participants in the industry, including us, major carriers (including our major airline partners), low-cost carriers, competitors and aircraft manufacturers. These industry developments raise substantial risks and uncertainties, which will likely affect us, major carriers (including our major airline partners), competitors and aircraft manufacturers in ways that we are unable to predict.\nThe airline industry is highly competitive and has undergone a period of consolidation and transition leaving fewer potential code-share partners.\nThe airline industry is highly competitive. We not only compete with other regional airlines, some of which are owned by or operated as code-share partners of major airlines, but we also face competition from low-cost carriers and major airlines on many of our routes. Low-cost carriers such as Southwest, Allegiant, Spirit and JetBlue among others, operate at many of our hubs, resulting in significant price competition. Additionally, a large number of other carriers operate at our hubs, creating intense competition. Certain of our competitors are larger and have significantly greater financial and other resources than we do. Moreover, federal deregulation of the industry allows competitors to rapidly enter our markets and to quickly discount and restructure fares. The airline industry is particularly susceptible to price discounting because airlines incur only nominal costs to provide service to passengers occupying otherwise unsold seats. Increased fare competition could adversely affect our operations and the price of our common stock. The airline industry has undergone substantial consolidation, including the mergers between Alaska and Virgin America Inc. in 2016, American and US Airways Group Inc. in 2013, Southwest Airlines Co. and AirTran Holdings, Inc. in 2011, United and Continental Airlines, Inc. in 2010 and Delta and Northwest Airlines, Inc. in 2008. Any additional consolidation or significant alliance activity within the airline industry could limit the number of potential partners with whom we could enter into code-share relationships and could have a material adverse effect on our relationships with our major airline partners.\nDue, in part, to the dynamic nature of the airline industry, major airlines may also make other strategic changes such as changing or consolidating hub locations. If our major airline partners were to make changes such as these in their strategy and operations, our operations and financial results could be adversely impacted.\nTerrorist activities or warnings have dramatically impacted the airline industry, and will likely continue to do so.\nThe terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 and their aftermath have negatively impacted the airline industry in general, including our operations. The primary effects experienced by the airline industry include a substantial loss of passenger traffic and revenue. If additional terrorist attacks are launched against the airline industry, there will be lasting consequences of the attacks, which may include loss of life, property damage, increased security and insurance costs, increased concerns about future terrorist attacks, increased government regulation and airport delays due to heightened security. Additional terrorist attacks and the fear of such attacks could negatively impact the airline industry, and result in further decreased passenger traffic and yields, increased flight delays or cancellations associated with new government mandates, as well as increased security, fuel and other costs. We cannot provide any assurance that these events will not harm the airline industry generally or our operations or financial condition in particular.\nWe are subject to significant governmental regulation.\nAll interstate air carriers, including SkyWest Airlines and ExpressJet, are subject to regulation by the DOT, the FAA and other governmental agencies. Regulations promulgated by the DOT primarily relate to economic aspects of air service. The FAA requires operating, air worthiness and other certificates; approval of personnel who may engage in flight, maintenance or operation activities; record keeping procedures in accordance with FAA requirements; and FAA approval of flight training and retraining programs. We cannot predict whether we will be able to comply with all present and future laws, rules, regulations and certification requirements or that the cost of continued compliance will not have a material adverse effect on our operations. We incur substantial costs in maintaining our current certifications and otherwise complying with the laws, rules and regulations to which we are subject. A decision by the FAA to ground, or require time-consuming inspections of or maintenance on, all or any of our aircraft for any reason may have a material adverse effect on our operations. In addition to state and federal regulation, airports and municipalities enact rules and\nregulations that affect our operations. From time to time, various airports throughout the country have considered limiting the use of smaller aircraft, such as our aircraft, at such airports. The imposition of any limits on the use of our aircraft at any airport at which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nThe occurrence of an aviation accident involving our aircraft would negatively impact our operations and financial condition.\nAn accident or incident involving one of our aircraft could result in significant potential claims of injured passengers and others, as well as repair or replacement of a damaged aircraft and its consequential temporary or permanent loss from service. In the event of an accident, our liability insurance may not be adequate to offset our exposure to potential claims and we may be forced to bear substantial losses from the accident. Substantial claims resulting from an accident in excess of our related insurance coverage would harm our operational and financial results. Moreover, any aircraft accident or incident, even if fully insured, could cause a public perception that our operations are less safe or reliable than other airlines.\nThe new Trump Administration may make substantial changes to fiscal, tax, trade and other policies that may adversely affect our business.\nThe Trump Administration has called for substantial change to fiscal and tax policies, which may include comprehensive tax reform. We cannot predict the impact, if any, of these changes to our business or the airline industry as whole. However, it is possible that these changes could adversely affect our business. It is likely that some policies adopted by the new administration will benefit us and others will negatively affect us. Until we know what changes are enacted, we will not know whether in total we benefit from, or are negatively affected by, the changes.\nAs a candidate, President Trump expressed antipathy towards existing trade agreements, including the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), greater restrictions on free trade generally and significant increases on tariffs on goods imported into the United States. Changes in U.S. social, political, regulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade, manufacturing, development and investment in the territories and countries where we do business or have parts for our aircrafts developed, and any negative sentiments towards the United States as a result of such changes, could adversely affect our business.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nFuture sales of our common stock could dilute existing shareholders, and future issuances of preferred stock could decrease the value of our common stock.\nOur Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended (the \u201cRestated Articles\u201d), authorize the issuance of up to 120,000,000 shares of common stock, all of which may be issued without any action or approval by our shareholders. As of December 31, 2016, we had 51,765,919 shares outstanding. In addition, as of December 31, 2016, we had equity-based incentive plans under which 3,337,285 shares are reserved for issuance and an employee stock purchase plan under which 855,100 shares are reserved for issuance, both of which may dilute the ownership interest of our shareholders. Our Restated Articles also authorize the issuance of up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock. Our board of directors has the authority to issue preferred stock with the rights and preferences, and at the price, which it determines. The rights of any shares of preferred stock issued would likely be senior to the rights of shares of our common stock in various regards, including dividends, payments upon liquidation and voting. The value of our common stock could be negatively affected by the issuance of any shares of preferred stock.\nThe amount of dividends we pay may decrease, or we may no longer pay dividends.\nHistorically, we have paid dividends in varying amounts on our common stock. The future payment and amount of cash dividends will depend upon our financial condition and results of operations and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors. There can be no assurance that we will continue our practice of paying dividends on our common stock or that we will have the financial resources to pay such dividends.\nThe amount of common stock we repurchase may decrease from historical levels, or we may not repurchase any additional shares of common stock.\nHistorically, we have repurchased shares of our common stock in varying amounts. Our future repurchases of shares of common stock, if any, and the number of shares of common stock we may repurchase will depend upon our financial condition, results of operations and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. There can be no assurance that we will continue our practice of repurchasing shares of common stock or that we will have the financial resources to repurchase shares of common stock in the future.\nProvisions of our charter documents and code-share agreements may limit the ability or desire of others to gain control of our company.\nOur ability to issue shares of preferred and common stock without shareholder approval may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock, even in circumstances where such a change in control would be viewed as desirable by most investors. The provisions of the Utah Control Shares Acquisitions Act may also discourage the acquisition of a significant interest in or control of our company. Additionally, our code-share agreements contain termination and extension trigger provisions related to change in control type transactions that may have the effect of deterring a change in control of our company.", "PERMNO": 10421, "SIC": 4512, "TIC": "SKYW"}
