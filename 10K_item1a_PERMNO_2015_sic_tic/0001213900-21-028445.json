RISK FACTORS\nCautionary Statement As To Forward-Looking Information\nThis report includes \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than statements of historical fact are \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d for purposes of federal and state securities laws, including: projections of earnings, cash flows, revenue or other financial items; statements of the plans, strategies and objectives of management for future operations; statements concerning proposed new services or developments; statements regarding future economic conditions or performance or future growth rates in the markets we serve; statements regarding future raw material costs or supply; statements of belief; and statements of assumptions underlying any of the foregoing. Forward-looking statements may include the words \u201cmay,\u201d \u201ccould,\u201d \u201cestimate,\u201d \u201cintend,\u201d \u201cplan,\u201d \u201ccontinue,\u201d \u201cbelieve,\u201d \u201cexpect,\u201d \u201canticipate\u201d or other comparable terminology, or the negative of such terms.\nAlthough we believe that the expectations and assumptions reflected in any of our forward-looking statements are reasonable, actual results could differ materially from those projected or assumed in any of our forward-looking statements. Our future financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, as well as any forward-looking statements, are subject to change and to inherent risks and uncertainties, such as those disclosed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Factors that could cause our actual results, performance and achievements or industry results to differ materially from estimates or projections contained in forward-looking statements include, among others, the following:\n\u25cf Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u25cf Weaknesses or cyclicality in any of the industries in which our customers operate;\n\u25cf Changes in marketing, product pricing and sales strategies, or development of new products by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf Future reductions in U.S. governmental spending or changes in governmental programs, particularly military equipment procurement programs;\n\u25cf Conditions that adversely affect the business of any of our significant customers;\n\u25cf Our ability to obtain and retain product approvals;\n\u25cf Supply and costs of raw materials (particularly steel) and energy resources, the imposition of import tariffs, and our ability to pass through these costs on a timely basis;\n\u25cf Our ability to acquire and integrate complementary businesses;\n\u25cf Unanticipated liabilities of acquired businesses;\n\u25cf Unexpected equipment failures or catastrophic events;\n\u25cf Our ability to attract and retain our management team and other highly skilled personnel;\n\u25cf Work stoppages and other labor problems affecting us or our customers or suppliers;\n\u25cf Changes in trade agreements or treaties and the imposition of tariffs on our goods exported to other countries;\n\u25cf Regulatory changes or developments in the U.S. or in foreign countries where we produce or sell products;\n\u25cf Developments or disputes concerning patents or other proprietary rights;\n\u25cf Risks associated with utilizing information technology systems;\n\u25cf Risks associated with operating internationally, including currency translation risks;\n\u25cf Investors\u2019 perceptions of us and our industry; and\n\u25cf Other risks and uncertainties including but not limited to those described from time to time in our current and quarterly reports filed with the SEC.\nThese and additional factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements are set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K under Part I, Item 1. \u201cBusiness,\u201d Part I, Item 1A. \u201cRisk Factors,\u201d Part II, Item 7. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d and Part II, Item 8. \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d All forward-looking statements contained in this report and any subsequently filed reports are expressly qualified in their entirety by these cautionary statements.\nWe have no duty to update any forward-looking statements after the date of this report to conform such statements to actual results or to changes in our expectations. You are advised, however, to review any disclosures we make on related subjects in our future periodic filings with the SEC.\nRisk Factors Relating to Our Company\nOur business, operating results, cash flows or financial condition could be materially adversely affected by any of the following risks. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks, and you could lose all or part of your investment. You should carefully consider these risks before investing in shares of our common stock.\nThe bearing and engineered products industries are highly competitive, and competition could reduce our profitability or limit our ability to grow.\nThe global bearing and engineered products industries are highly competitive, and we compete with many U.S. and non-U.S. companies, some of which benefit from lower labor costs and fewer regulatory burdens than us. We compete primarily based on product qualifications, product line breadth, service and price. Certain competitors may be better able to manage costs than us or may have greater financial resources than we have. Due to the competitiveness in the bearing and engineered products industries we may not be able to increase prices for our products to cover increases in our costs, and we may face pressure to reduce prices, which could materially reduce our revenues, cash flows and profitability. Competitive factors, including changes in market penetration, increased price competition and the introduction of new products and technology by existing and new competitors, could result in a material reduction in our revenues, cash flows and profitability.\nThe loss of a major customer, or a material adverse change in a major customer\u2019s business, could result in a material reduction in our revenues, cash flows and profitability.\nOur top ten customers generated approximately 36%, 34% and 35% of our net sales during fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Accordingly, the loss of one or more of those customers or a substantial decrease in those customers\u2019 purchases from us could result in a material reduction in our revenues, cash flows and profitability. If one of our major customers were to experience an adverse change in its business, that customer could reduce its purchases from us. For example, due to Boeing\u2019s 737 MAX production shutdown that began in 2019 we experienced the suspension or cancellation of orders for product used in the 737 MAX airframe and engines. In addition, in fiscal 2021 we experienced reduced purchasing from customers whose businesses were constrained by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe consolidation and combination of defense or other manufacturers could eliminate customers from the industry and/or put downward pricing pressures on sales of component parts. For example, the consolidation that has occurred in the defense industry in recent years has significantly reduced the overall number of defense contractors in the industry. In addition, if one of our customers is acquired or merged with another entity, the new entity may discontinue using us as a supplier because of an existing business relationship between one of our competitors and the acquiring company, or because it may be more efficient to consolidate certain suppliers within the newly formed enterprise. The significance of the impact that such consolidation could have on our business is difficult to predict because we do not know when or if one or more of our customers will engage in merger or acquisition activity. However, if such activity involved our material customers it could materially impact our revenues, cash flows and profitability.\nOur results have been and are likely to continue to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe public health issues resulting from COVID-19 and the precautionary measures instituted by governments and businesses to mitigate its spread have caused, and are expected to continue to cause, world-wide business disruption, plant closures, inventory shortages, delivery delays, supply chain disruptions, and order cancellations and deferrals. As a result, the pandemic had an adverse effect on our financial results and business operations throughout fiscal 2021, which contributed to the 16.3% decline in our revenue from the prior fiscal year. The lower demand for our products made it necessary to reduce our workforce and consolidate certain of our production facilities. It is expected that the pandemic will continue to adversely affect our business during fiscal 2022, although the severity and duration depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and unpredictable.\nWhile we have been able to keep our operations open for the most part during the pandemic and COVID-19 vaccines are now being administered throughout the world, it remains possible that there could be a future increase in the COVID-19 infection rate that results in governmental orders or COVID-19 outbreaks among the local workforce that necessitate the closure of any of our operations or those of any of our critical suppliers, which would adversely affect our production. In addition, operations that remain open may be adversely affected by personnel shortages, which could impair the operation\u2019s efficiency.\nDemand for our products would be affected if the pandemic leads to the closure of any operations of our significant customers. For example, Boeing\u2019s temporary shut-down of its two primary production facilities in April 2020 led to the cancellation or deferral of various orders for our products that support Boeing production. In addition, demand for our commercial aerospace products has been adversely affected by the significant reduction in commercial air travel during the pandemic.\nWeakness in any of the industries in which our customers operate, as well as the cyclical nature of our customers\u2019 businesses generally, could materially reduce our revenues, cash flows and profitability.\nThe commercial aerospace, mining and construction equipment and other diversified industrial industries to which we sell our products are, to varying degrees, cyclical and tend to decline in response to overall declines in industrial production. Margins in those industries are highly sensitive to demand cycles, and our customers (or our customers\u2019 customers) in those industries historically have tended to delay large capital purchases and projects, including expensive maintenance and upgrades, during economic downturns. As a result, our business is also cyclical, and the demand for our products by these customers depends, in part, on overall levels of industrial production, general economic conditions, and business confidence levels. Many of our customers have historically experienced periodic downturns, which often have had a negative effect on demand for our products. Future downward economic cycles or customer downturns could reduce sales of our products resulting in reductions in our revenues, cash flows and profitability.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused a significant reduction in air travel, which has lead to various airlines delaying or cancelling previously-scheduled aircraft purchases as they reassess their fleet needs and/or take advantage of opportunities to purchase aircraft that have become available in the used aircraft market. This reduction in new aircraft purchases has had an adverse effect on our sales of bearings and component parts.\nFuture reductions or changes in U.S. government spending could negatively affect our business.\nIn fiscal 2021, approximately 5.8% of our net sales were made directly, and we estimate that approximately an additional 25.5% of our net sales were made indirectly, to the U.S. government to support military or other government projects. Our failure (or the failure of our customers that are prime contractors to the government) to obtain new government contracts, the cancellation of government contracts relating to our products, or reductions in federal budget appropriations for programs in which our products are used could materially reduce our revenues, cash flows and profitability. A reduction in federal budget appropriations relating to our products could result from a shift in government defense spending to other programs in which we are not involved or a reduction in U.S. government defense spending generally (due to budget reduction initiatives or a shift in government spending priorities).\nFluctuating supply and costs of subcomponents, raw materials and energy resources, or the imposition of import tariffs, could materially reduce our revenues, cash flows and profitability.\nOur business is dependent on the availability and costs of subcomponents, raw materials, particularly steel (generally in the form of stainless and chrome steel, which are commodity steel products), and energy resources. The availability and prices of subcomponents, raw materials and energy resources may be subject to change due to, among other things, new laws or regulations, suppliers\u2019 allocations to other purchasers, interruptions in production or deliveries by suppliers (including interruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic), and changes in exchange rates and supplier costs and profit expectations. The United States has imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, and could impose tariffs on other items that we import, which could increase the cost of raw materials and decrease the available supply. Although we currently maintain alternative supply sources, our business is subject to the risk of price fluctuations and periodic delays in the delivery of certain subcomponents or raw materials. Disruptions in the supply of subcomponents, raw materials or energy resources could temporarily impair our ability to manufacture our products for our customers or require us to pay higher prices in order to obtain these items from other sources, which could thereby affect our net sales and profitability.\nWhere our customer contracts permit us to do so, we seek to pass through a significant portion of our additional costs to our customers through steel surcharges or price increases. However, many of our contracts are fixed-price contracts under which we are not able to pass these additional costs on to our customers. Even where we are able to pass these steel surcharges or price increases to our customers, there may be a lag of several months between the time we experience a cost increase and the time we are able to implement surcharges or price increases, particularly for orders already in our backlog. Competitive pressures and the terms of certain of our long-term contracts may require us to absorb at least part of these cost increases. As a result, our gross margin percentage could decline. We cannot provide assurances that we will be able to continue to pass these additional costs on to our customers at all or on a timely basis or that our customers will not seek alternative sources of supply if there are significant or prolonged increases in the price of subcomponents or other raw materials or energy resources.\nOur results could be impacted by governmental trade policies and tariffs relating to our supplies imported from foreign vendors or our finished goods exported to other countries.\nThe U.S. government has imposed tariffs on the importation of various products that we use to produce our finished goods, and various foreign countries, including the People\u2019s Republic of China, could impose retaliatory tariffs on our products exported to those countries. While this situation has not had a material adverse effect on our business, a further escalation of tariffs on our foreign-sourced supplies and/or the imposition of tariffs on our finished goods exported to other countries could adversely impact our operating costs or demand for our products.\nOur products are subject to certain approvals and government regulations and the loss of such approvals, or our failure to comply with such regulations, could materially reduce our revenues, cash flows and profitability.\nEssential to servicing the aerospace market is the ability to obtain product approvals. We have a substantial number of product approvals, which enable us to provide products used in virtually all domestic aircraft platforms presently in production or operation. Product approvals are typically issued by the FAA to designated OEMs who are Production Approval Holders of FAA-approved aircraft. These Production Approval Holders provide quality control oversight and generally limit the number of suppliers directly servicing the commercial aerospace market. Regulations enacted by the FAA provide for an independent process (the PMA process) that enables suppliers who currently sell their products to the Production Approval Holders to also sell products to the aftermarket. Our foreign sales may be subject to similar approvals or U.S. export control restrictions. We cannot assure you that we will not lose approvals for our products in the future. The loss or suspension of product approvals could result in lost sales and materially reduce our revenues, cash flows and profitability.\nThe repair and overhaul of aircraft parts and accessories throughout the world is highly regulated by government agencies, including the FAA. Our repair and overhaul operations are subject to certification pursuant to regulations established by the FAA and foreign government agencies, with regulations varying from country to country, although compliance with FAA requirements generally satisfies regulatory requirements in other countries. Our failure to comply with these regulations, or our compliance with new and more stringent government regulations, if enacted, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur U.S. government business is subject to specific procurement regulations and other requirements that increase our performance and compliance costs. These costs might increase in the future, reducing our profitability. Although we have procedures designed to assure compliance with these regulations and requirements, failure to do so under certain circumstances could lead to suspension or debarment from future government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time, which would result in lost sales and reduce our revenues, cash flows and profitability and could adversely impact our reputation.\nThe retirement of commercial aircraft could reduce our revenues, cash flows and profitability.\nWe sell replacement parts used in the repair and overhaul of jet engine and aircraft components, as well as provide such repair and overhaul services ourselves. As aircraft or engines for which we offer replacement parts or repair and overhaul services are retired, demand for these parts and services could decline and could reduce our revenue, cash flows and profitability.\nRisks associated with utilizing information technology systems could adversely affect our operations.\nWe rely upon our information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) systems to process, transmit and store electronic information to manage and operate our business. Further, in the ordinary course of business we store sensitive data, including intellectual property, on our networks. The secure maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our business operations.\nWe may face cyber events and other IT security threats, including malware, ransomware, phishing and other intrusions, to our IT infrastructure, attempts to gain unauthorized access to proprietary, classified or confidential information, and threats to the physical security of our IT systems. As a U.S. government contractor, our risk of cyber events may be greater than the risk faced by other companies that are not government contractors. In addition to security threats, our IT systems may also be subject to network, software or hardware failures. The unavailability of our IT systems, the failure of these systems to perform as anticipated, or any significant breach of data security could cause loss of data, disrupt our operations, require significant management attention and resources, subject us to liability to third parties, regulatory actions, or contract termination, and negatively impact our reputation among our customers and the public, which could have a negative impact on our financial and competitive position, results of operations and liquidity. In addition, our business with our customers and vendors could be impacted by cyber events on their IT systems.\nTo address the risk to our IT systems and data, we maintain an IT security program designed to resist cyber events and to mitigate the damage from successful events. A cyber event occurred during the last week of February 2021 that disrupted our IT systems. We took immediate steps to address the incident, including engaging two IT security and forensics experts to assess the impact to any affected data and to correct the security weakness that was exploited in the event. Based upon the forensic review, there is no evidence of data access or exfiltration and no material impact to the operations of the Company. The Company has implemented a variety of measures to enhance and modernize its systems to guard against similar incidents in the future, and is also enhancing the Company\u2019s recovery capabilities in the event of future incidents. We continue to evaluate the need to upgrade and/or replace our systems and network infrastructure to protect our IT environment, improve the effectiveness of our systems, and strengthen our cybersecurity program. However, these upgrades and replacements may not result in the protection or improvements anticipated.\nWork stoppages and other labor problems could materially reduce our ability to operate our business.\nWe currently have three collective bargaining agreements covering employees at our Plymouth, Indiana, Fairfield, Connecticut and West Trenton, New Jersey facilities, representing approximately 8.2% of our hourly employees as of April 3, 2021. While we believe our relations with our employees are satisfactory, the inability to satisfactorily negotiate and enter into new collective bargaining agreements upon expiration, or a lengthy strike or other work stoppage at any of our facilities, particularly at some of our larger facilities, could materially reduce our ability to operate our business. In addition, any attempt by our employees not currently represented by a union to join a union could result in additional expenses, including with respect to wages, benefits and pension obligations.\nIn addition, work stoppages at one or more of our customers or suppliers (including suppliers of transportation services), many of which have large unionized workforces, could also cause disruptions to our business that we cannot control, and these disruptions could materially reduce our revenues, cash flows and profitability.\nUnexpected equipment failures or catastrophic events could increase our costs and reduce our sales due to production curtailments or shutdowns.\nOur manufacturing processes are dependent upon critical pieces of turning, milling, grinding, and electrical equipment, and this equipment could, on occasion, be out of service as a result of unanticipated failures. In addition to equipment failures, our facilities are also subject to the risk of catastrophic loss due to unanticipated events such as fires, explosions, earthquakes or violent weather conditions. In the future, we could experience material plant shutdowns or periods of reduced production as a result of these types of equipment failures or catastrophes. Interruptions in production capabilities will inevitably increase our production costs and reduce revenues, cash flows and profitability for the affected period.\nWe may not be able to continue to make the acquisitions necessary for us to realize our growth strategy.\nThe acquisition of businesses that complement or expand our operations has been and continues to be an important element of our business strategy. We frequently engage in evaluations of potential acquisitions and negotiations for possible acquisitions, some of which, if consummated, could be significant to us. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in identifying attractive acquisition candidates or completing acquisitions on favorable terms in the future. Our inability to acquire businesses, or to operate them profitably once acquired, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, cash flow and growth.\nOur ability to realize anticipated benefits and synergies from our acquisitions could be affected by a number of factors, including: the need for greater than expected cash or other financial resources or management time in order to implement or integrate acquisitions; increases in other expenses related to an acquisition, including restructuring and other exit costs; the timing and impact of purchase accounting adjustments; difficulties in employee or management integration, including labor disruptions or disputes; and unanticipated liabilities associated with acquired businesses.\nAny potential cost-saving opportunities may take several quarters following an acquisition to implement, and any results of these actions may not be realized for several quarters thereafter, if at all.\nBusinesses that we have acquired or that we may acquire in the future may have liabilities which are not known to us.\nIn certain cases, we have assumed liabilities of acquired businesses and may assume liabilities of businesses that we acquire in the future. There may be liabilities or risks that we are required to assume in order to complete an acquisition, or that we do not discover, or that we underestimate, in the course of performing our due diligence investigations of the acquired business. Additionally, businesses that we have acquired or may acquire in the future may have made previous acquisitions, and we could be subject to certain liabilities and risks relating to these prior acquisitions as well. We cannot assure you that our rights to indemnification contained in definitive acquisition agreements that we have entered or may enter into will be sufficient in amount, scope or duration to fully offset the risk of liabilities relating to acquired businesses. Any such liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. As we begin to operate acquired businesses, we may learn additional information about them that adversely affects us, such as unknown or contingent liabilities, issues relating to compliance with applicable laws, or issues related to ongoing supply chain or customer relationships or order demand.\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles comprise a significant portion of our total assets, and if we determine that goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles have become impaired in the future, our results of operations and financial condition in such years may be materially and adversely affected.\nGoodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations. Indefinite-lived intangibles represent repair station certifications obtained in business combinations and assumed to have indefinite lives. We review goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles at least annually for impairment and any excess in carrying value over the estimated fair value is charged to the results of operations. Our estimates of fair value are based on assumptions about the future operating cash flows, growth rates, discount rates applied to these cash flows, and current market estimates of value. If we are required to record a charge to earnings because of an impairment of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangibles, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe depend heavily on our senior management and other key personnel, the loss of whom could materially affect our financial performance and prospects.\nOur business is managed by a number of key personnel, including our CEO Dr. Michael J. Hartnett. Our future success will depend on, among other things, our ability to keep the services of these personnel and to hire their successors and other highly qualified employees at all levels.\nOur international operations are subject to risks inherent in such activities.\nWe have operations in Mexico, France, Switzerland, Poland, China and Germany. Of our 43 facilities in seven countries, 12 are located outside the U.S., including ten manufacturing facilities in three countries.\nIn fiscal 2021, 10.3% of our net sales were generated by our international operations. We expect that this proportion is likely to increase as we seek to increase our penetration of foreign markets, including through acquisitions. Our foreign operations are subject to the risks inherent in such activities such as: currency devaluations, logistical and communication challenges, costs of complying with a variety of foreign laws and regulations, greater difficulties in protecting and maintaining our rights to intellectual property, difficulty in staffing and managing geographically diverse operations, acts of terrorism or war or other acts that may cause social disruption which are difficult to quantify or predict, and general economic conditions in these foreign markets. Our international operations may be negatively impacted by changes in government policies, such as changes in laws and regulations, restrictions on imports and exports, sources of supply, duties or tariffs, the introduction of measures to control inflation, and changes in the rate or method of taxation. To date we have not experienced significant difficulties with the foregoing risks associated with our international operations.\nCurrency translation risks may have a material impact on our results of operations.\nOur Swiss operation utilizes the Swiss franc as the functional currency, our French and German operations utilize the euro as the functional currency and our Polish operation utilizes the Polish zloty as the functional currency. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in earnings. Foreign currency transaction exposure arises primarily from the transfer of foreign currency from one subsidiary to another within the group and to foreign currency denominated trade receivables. Unrealized currency translation gains and losses are recognized upon translation of the foreign operations\u2019 balance sheets to U.S. dollars. Because our financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, changes in currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the currencies used by our international operations have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our earnings. We periodically enter into derivative financial instruments such as forward exchange contracts to reduce the effect of fluctuations in exchange rates on certain third-party sales transactions denominated in non-functional currencies. Currency fluctuations may affect our financial performance in the future and we cannot predict the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations. See Part II, Item 7A. \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk-Foreign Currency Exchange Rates\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe may incur material losses for product liability and recall-related claims.\nWe are subject to a risk of product and recall-related liability in the event that the failure, use or misuse of any of our products results in personal injury, death or property damage or our products do not conform to our customers\u2019 specifications. In particular, our products are installed in a number of types of vehicle fleets, including airplanes, trains, automobiles, heavy trucks and farm equipment, many of which are subject to government-ordered recalls as well as voluntary recalls by the manufacturer. If one of our products is found to be defective, causes a fleet to be disabled or otherwise results in a product recall, significant claims may be brought against us. We currently maintain insurance coverage for product liability claims but not for recall-related claims. We cannot assure you that product liability claims, if made, would be covered by our insurance or would not exceed our insurance coverage limits. Claims that are not covered by insurance, or that exceed insurance coverage limits, could result in material losses. Claims that are covered by insurance could result in increased future insurance costs.\nOur intellectual property and proprietary information are valuable, and any inability to protect them could adversely affect our business and results of operations; in addition, we may be subject to infringement claims by third parties.\nOur ability to compete effectively is dependent upon our ability to protect and preserve the intellectual property and proprietary information owned, licensed or otherwise used by us. We have numerous U.S. and foreign trademark registrations and patents. We also have U.S. and foreign trademark and patent applications pending. We cannot assure you that our pending trademark and patent applications will result in trademark registrations and issued patents, and our failure to secure rights under these applications may limit our ability to protect the intellectual property rights that these applications were intended to cover. Although we have attempted to protect our intellectual property and proprietary information both in the United States and in foreign countries through a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection, and non-disclosure agreements, these steps may be insufficient to prevent unauthorized use of our intellectual property and proprietary information, particularly in foreign countries where the protection available for such intellectual property and proprietary information may be limited. We cannot assure you that any of our intellectual property rights will not be infringed upon or that our trade secrets will not be misappropriated or otherwise become known to or independently developed by competitors. We may not have adequate remedies available for any such infringement or other unauthorized use. We cannot assure you that any infringement claims asserted by us will not result in our intellectual property being challenged or invalidated, that our intellectual property will be held to be of adequate scope to protect our business, or that we will be able to deter current and former employees, contractors or other parties from breaching confidentiality obligations and misappropriating trade secrets.\nWe could become subject to litigation claiming that our intellectual property or proprietary information infringes the rights of a third party. In that event, we could incur substantial defense costs and, if such litigation is successful, we could be required to pay the claimant damages and royalties for our past and future use of such intellectual property or proprietary information, or we could be prohibited from using it in the future. Our inability to use our intellectual property and proprietary information on a cost-effective basis in the future could have a material adverse effect on our revenue, cash flow and profitability. See Part I, Item 1. \u201cBusiness-Intellectual Property\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCancellation of orders in our backlog could negatively impact our revenues, cash flows and profitability.\nAs of April 3, 2021, we had an order backlog of $394.8 million. However, orders included in our backlog are subject to cancellation, delay or other modifications by our customers and we cannot assure you that these orders will ultimately be fulfilled.\nRisk Factors Related to our Common Stock\nProvisions in our charter documents may prevent or hinder efforts to acquire a controlling interest in us.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions that might benefit our stockholders or in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. These provisions may also prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our management.\nPursuant to our charter documents, our Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d) consists of eight members serving staggered three-year terms and divided into three classes. As a result, two annual meetings are required to change a majority of the Board members. In addition, our certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of preferred stock, with such designations, rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by the Board, without stockholder approval. If we were to issue preferred stock in the future, it could be utilized, under certain circumstances, as a method of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control of us, or could impede our stockholders\u2019 ability to approve a transaction they consider in their best interests. Although we have no present intention to issue any preferred stock, we may do so in the future. Holders of our common stock do not have preemptive rights to subscribe for a pro rata portion of preferred stock or any other capital stock that we may issue in the future.\nWe may not pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nExcept for a $2.00 per common share special dividend paid in 2014, we have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock and may not pay cash dividends in the future. Instead, we plan to apply earnings and excess cash, if any, to the expansion and development of our business. Thus, the return on your investment, if any, could depend solely on an increase, if any, in the market value of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 90870, "SIC": 3562, "TIC": "ROLL"}
