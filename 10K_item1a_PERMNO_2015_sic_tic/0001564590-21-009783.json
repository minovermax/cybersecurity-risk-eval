RISK FACTORS\nThere are risks, many beyond our control, which could cause our results to differ significantly from management\u2019s expectations. Some of these risk factors are described below. Any factor described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (\u201cAnnual Report\u201d) could, by itself or together with one or more other factors, adversely affect our business, results of operations and/or financial condition. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently consider to not be material also\nmay materially and adversely affect us. In assessing these risks, you should also refer to other information disclosed in our SEC filings, including the financial statements and notes thereto.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nPublic Health and COVID-19\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is adversely affecting us and our customers, counterparties, employees, and third-party service providers, and the continued adverse impacts on our business, financial position, results of operations, and prospects could be significant.\nThe spread of COVID-19 has created a global public-health crisis that has resulted in widespread volatility and deteriorations in household, business, economic, and market conditions. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company\u2019s capital, liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations during 2020 include:\n\u2022\nA goodwill impairment charge of $443.7 million, recognized in the first quarter of 2020, primarily caused by economic and industry conditions resulting from COVID-19. At December 31, 2020, our remaining goodwill totaled $43.1 million.\n\u2022\nProvision for credit losses of $278.0 million for 2020, primarily caused by the adoption of the CECL accounting standard and the forecasted effects of COVID-19 on the various loan segments due to worsening economic conditions. Because of CECL, our financial results may be negatively affected as soon as weak or deteriorating economic conditions are forecasted and alter our expectations for credit losses. In addition, due to the expansion of the time horizon over which we are required to estimate future credit losses under CECL, we may experience increased volatility in our future provisions for credit losses.\n\u2022\nHedge income of $169.2 million recognized in the fourth quarter of 2020, which resulted from a partial accounting ineffectiveness determination that resulted from a decline of hedge eligible loans due to the economic impact of COVID-19.\n\u2022\nLoans decreased by 2.0% during 2020, resulting from decreased loan originations due in part to the economic impacts from COVID-19. This decrease was partially mitigated by outstanding Paycheck Protection Program (\u201cPPP\u201d) loans which were $938.0 million at December 31, 2020.\n\u2022\nDeposits increased by 8.9% during 2020 due to corporate customer increases in liquidity in the current economic environment and broader impacts of fiscal stimulus.\nThe specific effects of the pandemic noted above are discussed and described in more detail throughout Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe extent of the impact of COVID-19 on the Company\u2019s future capital, liquidity, and other financial positions and on its business, results of operations, and prospects will depend on a number of evolving factors, including:\n\u2022\nThe duration, extent, and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 is not yet contained and could affect significantly more households and businesses. The duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic continue to be impossible to accurately predict.\n\u2022\nThe response of governmental and nongovernmental authorities. The actions of many governmental and nongovernmental authorities have been directed toward curtailing household and business activity to contain COVID-19 while simultaneously deploying fiscal- and monetary-policy measures to partially mitigate the adverse effects on individual households and businesses. These actions are not always coordinated or consistent across jurisdictions but, in general, have rapidly expanded in scope and intensity.\n\u2022\nThe effect on the Company\u2019s customers, counterparties, employees, and third-party service providers. COVID-19 and its associated consequences and uncertainties have affected individuals, households, and businesses differently and unevenly. The COVID-19 pandemic had an impact on our operations, financial condition and results of operations during 2020, and we expect that the virus will continue to have an impact on the business, financial condition, and results of operations of the Company and its customers during 2021. In order to protect the health of our customers and employees, and to comply with applicable government directives, we have modified our business practices, including restricting employee travel, asking employees to work from home insofar as is possible, cancelling in-person meetings and implementing our business continuity plans and protocols to the extent necessary. We may take further such actions that we determine are in the best interest of our employees, customers and communities or as may be required by government order. These actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and similar actions by our vendors and business partners, have not materially impaired our ability to support our employees, conduct our business and serve our customers, but there is no assurance that these actions will be sufficient to successfully mitigate the risks presented by COVID-19 or that our ability to operate will not be materially affected going forward.\n\u2022\nCARES Act and Consolidated Appropriations Act 2021 (\u201cCAA\u201d). In response to the pandemic, we have also enacted assistance for customers affected by COVID-19, including fee and penalty waivers, loan deferrals or other scenarios that may help our customers. Furthermore, in an effort to support our communities during the pandemic, we are participating in the PPP under the CARES Act whereby loans to small businesses are made and those loans are subject to the regulatory\nrequirements that would require forbearance of loan payments for a specified time or that would limit our ability to pursue all available remedies in the event of a loan default. If the borrower under the PPP loan fails to qualify for loan forgiveness, we are at the heightened risk of holding the loan at an unfavorable interest rate as compared to the loans to customers that we would have otherwise extended credit. Rules providing for forgiveness have been constantly evolving, including an automatic forgiveness if the amount of the PPP loan was not larger than a specified floor. The CAA was enacted on December 27, 2020 and includes nearly $900 billion in COVID-19 aid including taxpayer stimulus checks, enhanced federal unemployment benefits, an additional $284 billion in PPP loans, and other economic aid.\n\u2022\nThe effect on economies and markets. Whether the actions of governmental and nongovernmental authorities will be successful in mitigating the adverse effects of COVID-19 is unclear. National, regional, and local economies and markets could suffer disruptions that are lasting. An economic slowdown could adversely affect the Company\u2019s origination of new loans and the performance of its existing loans. In addition, governmental actions are meaningfully influencing the interest-rate environment, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nCOVID-19 has also resulted in increased operational risks. A significant portion of our workforce has been working remotely, and the increased level of remote access creates additional cybersecurity risk and opportunities for cybercriminals to exploit vulnerabilities. Cybercriminals may increase their attempts to compromise business emails, including an increase in phishing attempts, and fraudulent vendors or other parties may view the pandemic as an opportunity to prey upon consumers and businesses during this time. The increase in online and remote banking activities may also increase the risk of fraud in certain instances. Additionally, our third-party service providers have also been impacted by the pandemic and we may experience some disruption to certain services performed by vendors, which could adversely impact our business.\nCredit Risk\nWe are highly subject to credit risk.\nOur business depends on our ability to successfully measure and manage credit risk. As a lender, we are exposed to the risk that the principal of, or interest on, a loan will not be repaid timely or at all or that the value of any collateral supporting a loan will be insufficient to cover our outstanding exposure. In addition, we are exposed to risks with respect to the period of time over which the loan may be repaid; proper loan underwriting; and changes in economic and industry conditions. The creditworthiness of a borrower is affected by many factors including local market conditions and general economic conditions. If the overall economic climate in the United States, generally, or our market areas, specifically, experiences material disruption, our borrowers may experience difficulties in repaying their loans, the collateral we hold may decrease in value or become illiquid, and the level of nonperforming loans, charge-offs and delinquencies could rise and require significant additional provisions for credit losses. Additional factors related to the credit quality of commercial loans include the quality of the management of the business and the borrower\u2019s ability both to properly evaluate changes in the supply and demand characteristics affecting their market for products and services and to effectively respond to those changes. Additional factors related to the credit quality of commercial real estate loans include tenant vacancy rates and the quality of management of the property.\nOur credit risk management practices and our credit approval, review and administrative practices may not adequately reduce credit risk, and our credit administration policies and procedures may not adequately adapt to changes in economic or any other conditions affecting customers and the quality of the loan portfolio. A failure to effectively measure and limit the credit risk associated with our loan portfolio may result in loan defaults, foreclosures and additional charge-offs, and may necessitate that we significantly increase our allowance for credit losses (\u201cACL\u201d). As a result, our inability to successfully manage credit risk could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ACL may prove to be insufficient to absorb losses in our loan portfolio, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCredit losses are inherent in the business of making loans and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Our ACL is maintained at a level considered adequate by management to absorb expected credit losses based on our analysis of the quality of our loan portfolio, market environment and other factors we deem to be relevant to this analysis based upon relevant information available to us. The ACL contains provisions for expected losses relating to specific borrowing relationships, as well as expected life-of-loan losses in the loan portfolio and credit undertakings that are not specifically identified. The determination of the appropriate level of the ACL inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires us to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes. Although our management has established an ACL it believes is adequate to absorb expected losses in our loan portfolio, the allowance may not be adequate. We could sustain credit losses that are significantly higher than the amount of our ACL for a variety of reasons, including changes in economic, operating and other conditions within our markets, as well as changes in the financial condition, cash flows, and operations of our borrowers. In addition, regulatory agencies periodically review our ACL, the policies and procedures we use to determine the level of the allowance and the value attributed to nonperforming loans or to real estate acquired through foreclosure. Such regulatory agencies may require us to recognize future charge-offs. Substantial increases in the ACL could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe security interest that we have in our clients\u2019 assets may not be sufficient to protect us from a partial or complete loss if we are required to foreclose.\nOur loans are often secured by a lien on specified collateral of our clients. However, the collateral may not protect us from suffering a loss if we foreclose on the collateral. Factors that could reduce the value of the collateral that we have a security interest in include:\n\u2022\nchanges in general economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nchanges in the real estate markets in which we lend;\n\u2022\ninherent uncertainties in the future value of the collateral;\n\u2022\nthe financial condition and/or cash flows of the borrower and/or the project being financed; and\n\u2022\nany representation by the borrower of, or failure to keep adequate records related to, important information concerning the collateral.\nAny one or more of the preceding factors could materially impair our ability to collect on specified collateral of our clients in the event loans we have made to such clients are not repaid in accordance with their terms, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMany of our loans are to commercial borrowers, which have unique risks compared to other types of loans.\nAs of December 31, 2020, approximately $10.2 billion or 80% of our loan portfolio was comprised of commercial loans. Because payments on these loans are often dependent on the successful operation or development of the property or business involved, their repayment is sensitive to adverse conditions in the real estate market and the general economy. Accordingly, downturns in the real estate market and economy increase the risk related to commercial loans, particularly commercial real estate loans. Commercial loans are also subject to loan specific risks, including risks associated with construction, cost overruns, project completion risk, general contractor credit risk and risks associated with the ultimate sale or use of the completed construction. If a decline in economic conditions, natural disasters affecting commercial development or other issues cause difficulties for our borrowers of these types of business loans, if we fail to evaluate the credit of these loans accurately when we underwrite them or if we do not continue to monitor adequately the performance of these loans, our lending portfolio could experience delinquencies, defaults and credit losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur loan portfolio has significant concentration in energy and our specialized industries.\nMuch of our lending activity is concentrated in energy and our specialized industries. As of December 31, 2020, we had a total of $1.5 billion of loans, or 12.0% of our total loans, to companies operating in the restaurant and healthcare industries, and $1.3 billion, or 10.3%, to companies operating in the energy sector. These industries and businesses are sensitive to economic conditions and complex factors (such as supply chain factors), which may expose us to the risk of economic downturns and other risks unique to these industries. Oil prices can fluctuate widely on a month-to-month basis in response to a variety of factors that are beyond our control. Factors that contribute to price fluctuations include instability in oil-producing regions, worldwide economic conditions, weather conditions, the supply and price of domestic and foreign oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids, consumer demand, the price and availability of alternative fuels, the proximity to, and capacity of, transportation facilities and the effect of worldwide energy conservation measures. Adverse economic conditions or business conditions relating to these industries could negatively impact our operating results more than if our loan portfolio was not concentrated in these industries.\nThe ACL allocated to the Energy portfolio was $32.3 million or 2.46% of the energy portfolio at December 31, 2020, compared to $12.7 million or 0.89% as of December 31, 2019 (see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Provision for Credit Losses\u201d and \u201c-Allowance for Credit Losses\u201d). As of December 31, 2020, we had $20.2 million of nonperforming energy credits compared to $9.8 million of nonperforming energy credits as of December 31, 2019. In addition, 19.3% of the energy portfolio was criticized as of December 31, 2020 compared to 6.7% at December 31, 2019. The increases in nonperforming and criticized energy credits is due to stress in the sector that resulted from the significant decline in demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As of December 31, 2020, there were approximately $76.2 million in PPP loans outstanding in the Energy portfolio.\nThe Restaurant portfolio is one of the components of our specialized industries. The Restaurant portfolio has experienced increases in nonperforming loans and charge-offs during 2020 and 2019 as certain customers have faced difficulties dealing with market pressures on employee compensation and increased competition, and more recently, the significant effects of COVID-19. Dining room closures and restrictions have required restaurants to adjust their business and labor models accordingly, although many of our QSR customers are experiencing meaningful drive-through and pick-up business. Our Full-Service portfolio is the most stressed segment of the portfolio with continued uncertainty and inconsistencies in dining-room re-openings or capacity across the country.\nSustained low oil prices, volatility in oil prices and downturns in the energy industry, including in Texas, could materially and adversely affect us.\nAs of December 31, 2020, energy lending comprised approximately 10% of our loan portfolio. The economy in Texas has dependence on the energy industry. A downturn or lack of growth in the energy industry and energy-related business, including sustained low oil prices or the failure of oil prices to rise in the future, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial\ncondition. The economic impacts of COVID-19 resulted in pricing pressure on oil and gas which lead to increased credit stress in our energy portfolio, increased losses associated with our energy portfolio, increased utilization of our contractual obligations to extend credit and weaker demand for energy lending. These factors and general uncertainty resulting from continued volatility could have other future adverse impacts such as job losses in industries tied to energy, increased spending habits, lower borrowing needs, higher transaction deposit balances or a number of other effects that are difficult to isolate or quantify, particularly in states with significant dependence on the energy industry such as Texas, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is comprised of loan participations and SNC\u2019s, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to monitor the lending relationships and lead to an increased risk of loss.\nWe participate in loans originated by other institutions and in SNC\u2019s, broadly defined as loans to larger institutions by a group of participating lenders where the client\u2019s needs are larger than any individual lender can prudently provide, and in which other lenders serve as the agent bank. Additionally, our specialized industries lending includes larger, national companies that tend to be served through SNC\u2019s. As of December 31, 2020, $2.3 billion, or approximately 18% of our total loans, consisted of participations or SNC\u2019s. For the vast majority of SNC\u2019s, we are not the lead bank. Our reduced control over the monitoring and management of these relationships could lead to increased risk of loss, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe amount of nonperforming and criticized assets may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had nonperforming assets of $157.8 million and $125.5 million, respectively. Total criticized loans as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, were $871.7 million and $605.1 million, respectively. These increases in nonperforming assets and criticized loans resulted in increased provisions for credit losses, lost income, and additional expenses to maintain such assets which had a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe fair value of our investment securities may decline.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the fair value of our investment securities portfolio was approximately $3.3 billion. Factors beyond our control can significantly influence the fair value of our securities and can cause adverse changes to the fair value of these securities. These factors include rating agency actions, defaults by or other adverse events affecting the issuer, lack of liquidity, changes in market interest rates, and continued instability in the capital markets. A prolonged decline in the fair value of our securities could result in an other-than-temporary impairment write-down, which would affect our results of operations.\nLiquidity Risk\nLiquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations and meet our obligations as they become due and could jeopardize our financial condition.\nLiquidity is essential to our business. A failure to maintain adequate liquidity or any substantial, unexpected, and/or prolonged change in the level or cost of liquidity could impair our ability to fund operations and meet our obligations as they become due and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLiquidity risk is the potential that we will be unable to meet our obligations as they become due because of an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding. We require sufficient liquidity to meet customer loan requests, customer deposit maturities and withdrawals, payments on our debt obligations as they come due and other cash commitments under both normal operating conditions and other unpredictable circumstances, including events causing industry or general financial market stress. Our access to deposits may be affected by the liquidity needs of our depositors. We depend on deposit account balances as our primary source of funding for our lending activities. A key part of our liquidity plan and funding strategy is to increase our deposit base as a source of funds. We might have difficulty replacing such funds in the future, especially if a large number of our depositors withdraw their accounts, regardless of the reason. Liquidity risk can increase due to a number of factors, including an over-reliance on a particular source of funding or market-wide phenomena such as market dislocation and major disasters. Our inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of loans or securities, and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on liquidity. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities or on acceptable terms could be impaired by factors that affect our organization specifically or the financial services industry or economy in general. We rely on brokered deposits as a source of liquidity and generally target a brokered deposit to total deposit ratio of less than 15% to 20%. Brokered deposits may have a higher deposit cost compared to our core deposits. Factors that could detrimentally impact access to liquidity sources include, but are not limited to, a decrease in the level of our business activity as a result of a downturn in the markets in which our loans are concentrated (including a downturn resulting from natural disasters affecting those markets) or adverse regulatory actions against us or changes in the liquidity needs of our depositors. Market conditions or other events could also negatively affect the level or cost of funding, affecting our ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals, meet contractual obligations (including any unfunded credit commitments), and fund asset growth and new business transactions at a reasonable cost, in a timely manner, and without adverse consequences.\nWe rely on customer deposits as a significant source of funding, and our deposits may decrease in the future.\nWe rely on customer deposits as a significant source of funding. Competition among U.S. banks and non-banks for customer deposits is intense and may increase the cost of deposits or prevent new deposits and may otherwise negatively affect our ability to grow our deposit base. Our deposit accounts may decrease in the future, and any such decrease could have a material adverse impact on our sources of funding. Any changes we make to the rates offered on our deposit products to remain competitive with other financial institutions may adversely affect our profitability. The demand for our deposit products may also be reduced due to a variety of factors such as demographic patterns, changes in customer preferences, reductions in consumers\u2019 disposable income, regulatory actions that decrease customer access to particular products or the availability of competing products. In addition, a portion of our deposits are brokered deposits. The levels of these types of deposits that we hold may be more volatile during changing economic conditions. At December 31, 2020, the median balance in our deposits accounts was approximately $5 thousand.\nThe borrowing needs of our clients may increase, especially during a challenging economic environment, which could result in increased borrowing against our contractual obligations to extend credit.\nA commitment to extend credit is a formal agreement to lend funds to a client as long as there is no violation of any condition established under the agreement. The actual borrowing needs of our clients under these credit commitments have historically been lower than the contractual amount of the commitments. As of December 31, 2020, we had $4.5 billion in unfunded credit commitments to our clients. Actual borrowing needs of our clients may exceed our expectations for any numbers of reasons. This could adversely affect our liquidity, which could impair our ability to fund operations and meet obligations as they become due and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur indebtedness could affect our ability to meet our obligations and may otherwise restrict our activities.\nOur indebtedness could limit our ability to borrow money for funding loans, capital expenditures, debt service requirements or other corporate purposes; require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to payments on our indebtedness; increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; and limit our ability to respond to business opportunities, including growing our business through acquisitions. In addition, the instruments governing our indebtedness contain certain restrictive covenants including with respect to consolidating or merging the Company or the Bank into another entity or transferring substantially all of their respective assets or properties. Certain of the Company\u2019s debt also contains restrictions on the Company\u2019s ability to assign or grant a security interest in or otherwise dispose of any shares of the voting stock of the Bank. Failure to meet any of these covenants could result in an event of default under these agreements. If an event of default occurs under these agreements, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under these agreements to be immediately due and payable.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company and its subsidiaries had $285.6 million of gross indebtedness ($50.6 million of which represents junior subordinated debt before purchase accounting adjustment). During 2021, borrowings will decrease by $90 million as we will call $40 million in subordinated notes as of March 11, 2021, and our $50 million senior notes are due on June 28, 2021. Total interest expense on all outstanding indebtedness was $16.8 million on a pre-tax basis for 2020. An increase in interest rates would increase our interest expense. See \u201cItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.\u201d Our principal source of funds for interest and repayment of our debt is dividends received directly from our subsidiaries, primarily the Bank. Federal and state statutes and regulations limit the amount of dividends that the Bank may pay to us, with or without regulatory approval. We may not receive dividends sufficient to fund our debt obligations. In addition, we may not be able to refinance our indebtedness on substantially similar terms, or at all, at or prior to the time that it comes due.\nMarket Risk\nWe are subject to interest rate risk.\nThe majority of our banking assets are subject to changes in interest rates. The principal component of our earnings is our net interest income, which is the difference between interest earned on interest-earning assets and interest paid on our interest-bearing liabilities. We expect that we will periodically experience \u201cgaps\u201d in the interest rate sensitivities of our assets and liabilities, meaning that either our interest-bearing liabilities will be more sensitive to changes in market interest rates than our interest-earning assets, or vice versa. In either event, if market interest rates should move contrary to our position, this \u201cgap\u201d will negatively impact our earnings. Many factors beyond our control impact interest rates, including economic conditions, governmental monetary policies, inflation, recession, unemployment, the money supply, and disorder and instability in domestic and foreign financial markets. Changes in monetary policies of the Federal Reserve could influence not only our net income but could also affect our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits, the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities, and the average duration of our assets and liabilities.\nIn any future declining interest rate environment, there may be an increase in prepayments on loans as borrowers refinance their loans at lower rates. Interest rate increases often result in larger payment requirements for our floating interest rate borrowers, which increases the potential for default. At the same time, the marketability of the property securing a loan may be adversely affected by any reduced demand resulting from higher interest rates. An increase or decrease in interest rates may also require us to increase or decrease the interest rates that we pay on our deposits.\nChanges in interest rates also can affect the value of loans, securities, and other assets. An increase in interest rates that adversely affects the ability of borrowers to pay the principal or interest on loans may lead to increases in nonperforming assets, charge-offs, further increases to the ACL, and a reduction of income recognized, among others, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nAdditionally, an increase in interest rates may not increase our net interest income to the same extent we currently anticipate based on our modeling estimates and the assumptions underlying such modeling. Our failure to benefit from an increased interest rate environment to the extent we currently estimate, to the same extent as our competitors or at all could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur fully tax equivalent total interest income for 2020 totaled $712.9 million compared to $861.8 million for 2019. This decrease is primarily the result of decreases in interest income on loans and on short-term investments partially offset by an increase in interest income on securities. The decrease in interest income on loans resulted from: decreased market interest rates caused by the economic slowdown resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic; the origination of $1.0 billion in Paycheck Protection Program (\u201cPPP\u201d) loans with an average yield of 2.50%; a decrease of 30.9% in accretion on acquired loans due to the declining balance of those loans; and a decrease in average loan balances due to payoffs and paydowns. We recognized $65.3 million in hedge income during 2020 which partially offset the decline in interest rates and average balances. Additionally, our interest expense for 2020 and 2019 was $92.2 million and $208.9 million, respectively, a decrease of $116.7 million as we achieved record low-deposit costs and record high levels of non-interest bearing deposits during 2020. Our cost of interest-bearing deposits decreased to 0.70% for 2020 compared to 1.68% for 2019. Due to this decrease and an increase of $1.2 billion or 34.0% in noninterest bearing deposits, our cost of total deposits decreased to 0.49% in 2020 from 1.29% in 2019. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\u201d and \u201c -Net Interest Income\u201d for additional information.\nThe geographic concentration of our markets in Texas and the southeast United States makes our business susceptible to local economic conditions, local adverse weather events, public health issues, and other events which could have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nUnlike larger financial institutions that are nationally diversified, we are a regional banking franchise concentrated in Texas and the southeast United States. A deterioration in local economic conditions in these markets could have a material adverse effect on the quality of our portfolio, the demand for our products and services, the ability of borrowers to timely repay loans, and the value of the collateral securing loans. If the population, employment or income growth in one of our markets is negative or slower than projected, income levels, deposits, and performing loans could be adversely impacted. Our markets are also susceptible to severe weather. The occurrence of adverse weather and natural or man-made disasters could destroy or cause a decline in the value of assets that serve as our collateral and increase the risk of delinquencies, defaults, foreclosures and losses on our loans, damage our banking facilities and offices, negatively impact regional economic conditions, result in a decline in local loan demand, loan originations and deposit availability and negatively impact the implementation of our growth strategy. Any one or more of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBy engaging in derivative transactions, we are exposed to credit and market risk, which could adversely affect our profitability and financial condition.\nWe manage interest rate risk by, among other things, utilizing derivative instruments to minimize significant unplanned fluctuations in earnings that are caused by interest rate volatility. Hedging interest rate risk is a complex process, requiring sophisticated models and constant monitoring, and is not a perfect science. Due to interest rate fluctuations, hedged assets and liabilities will appreciate or depreciate in market value. The effect of this unrealized appreciation or depreciation will generally be offset by income or loss on the derivative instruments that are linked to the hedged assets and liabilities. By engaging in derivative transactions, we are exposed to credit and market risk. If the counterparty fails to perform, credit risk exists to the extent of the fair value gain in the derivative. Market risk exists to the extent that interest rates change in ways that are significantly different from what we expected when we entered into the derivative transaction. The existence of credit and market risk associated with our derivative instruments could adversely affect our net interest income and, therefore, could have a material effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Failure to manage interest rate risk could have a material adverse effect on our business. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.\u201d\nStrategic Risk\nWe face significant competition to attract and retain customers and clients, which could adversely affect our growth and profitability.\nWe operate in the highly competitive banking industry and face significant competition in originating loans, attracting deposits and providing other financial services for customers. Many of our competitors are significantly larger and have significantly more resources, greater name recognition, larger market share, and more extensive and established branch networks than we do. Because of their scale, many of these competitors can be more aggressive than we can on loan and deposit pricing. Also, many of our non-bank competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures. In addition, they may maintain a wider range\nof product offerings than we do, including more technology-based banking tools. We expect competition to continue to intensify due to financial institution consolidation; legislative, regulatory and technological changes; and the emergence of alternative banking sources.\nCustomer and client loyalty can also be influenced by a competitor\u2019s new products, especially offerings that could provide cost savings or a higher return to the customer. Increased competition could require us to increase the rates that we pay on deposits or lower the rates that we offer on loans, which could reduce our profitability. Our failure to compete effectively in our markets could restrain our growth or cause us to lose market share, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may also face a competitive disadvantage as a result of our concentration in Texas and the southeast United States and will be unable, as compared to our more geographically diversified peers, to spread our operating costs across a broader market.\nWe may not be able to manage our growth effectively, which could adversely affect our profitability and financial condition.\nWe may face a variety of risks and difficulties in pursuing our organic growth strategy and managing our growth, including, among other things:\n\u2022\nmaintaining organic loan growth;\n\u2022\nmaintaining asset quality;\n\u2022\nfinding suitable markets for expansion;\n\u2022\nattracting funding to support additional growth;\n\u2022\nmanaging execution risks;\n\u2022\nattracting and retaining qualified management;\n\u2022\nmaintaining adequate regulatory capital;\n\u2022\nmanaging a growing number of client relationships;\n\u2022\nscaling technology platforms; and\n\u2022\nachieving expected additional capacity of our relationship managers.\nTo manage our growth and maintain adequate information and reporting systems within our organization, we must identify, hire and retain qualified associates, particularly in the accounting and operational areas of our business. We must also successfully implement improvements to, or integrate, our management information and control systems, procedures and processes in an efficient or timely manner and identify deficiencies in existing systems and controls. In particular, our controls and procedures must be able to accommodate an increase in loan volume in various markets and the infrastructure that comes with expanding operations, including new branches. Our growth strategy may divert management from our existing franchises and may require us to incur additional expenditures to expand our administrative and operational infrastructure. If we are unable to effectively manage and grow our banking franchise, we may experience compliance and 4 problems, have to slow the pace of growth, or have to incur additional expenditures beyond current projections to support such growth, any one of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nWe may not be able to raise additional capital in the future.\nIn the future, should we need additional capital to implement our business plan, support our business, expand our operations, or meet applicable capital requirements, we may not be able to raise additional funds in the form of additional debt or equity. Our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on, among other things, conditions in the capital markets at that time, and our financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Economic conditions and a loss of confidence in financial institutions may increase our cost of funding and limit access to certain customary sources of capital, including inter-bank borrowings, repurchase agreements and borrowings from the discount window of the Federal Reserve System.\nSuch capital may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Any occurrence that may limit our access to the capital markets, such as a decline in the confidence of debt purchasers, depositors of our bank or counterparties participating in the capital markets or other disruption in the capital markets, may adversely affect our capital costs and our ability to raise capital and, in turn, our liquidity. Further, if we need to raise capital in the future, we may have to do so when many other financial institutions are also seeking to raise capital and would then have to compete with those institutions for investors. An inability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nFuture acquisitions will subject us to a variety of risks, including execution risks, failure to realize anticipated transaction benefits, and failure to overcome integration risks, which could adversely affect our growth and profitability.\nWe regularly consider potential acquisition opportunities that we believe would support our businesses and enhance our profitability. If we do pursue acquisitions, we may have difficulty executing and may not realize the anticipated benefits of any transaction we complete. Any of the foregoing matters could materially and adversely affect us.\nGenerally, any acquisition of financial institutions, branches or other banking assets by us will require approval by, and cooperation from, federal and state banking regulatory agencies. Such regulators could deny our application, which would restrict our growth, or the regulatory approvals may not be granted on terms that are acceptable to us. For example, we could be required to\nsell branches as a condition to receiving regulatory approvals, and such a condition may not be acceptable to us or may reduce the benefit of an acquisition.\nAs to any acquisition that we complete, we may fail to realize some or all of the anticipated transaction benefits if the integration process takes longer or is more costly than expected or otherwise fails to meet our expectations.\nIn addition, acquisition activities could be material to our business and involve several risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nincurring time and expense associated with identifying and evaluating potential acquisitions and negotiating potential transactions, resulting in our attention being diverted from the operation of our existing business;\n\u2022\nusing inaccurate estimates and judgments to evaluate credit, operations, management and market risks with respect to the target institution or assets;\n\u2022\nprojected results may vary significantly from actual results;\n\u2022\nintense competition from other banking organizations and other inquirers for acquisitions;\n\u2022\npotential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of banks and businesses we acquire;\n\u2022\nunexpected asset quality problems;\n\u2022\nthe time and expense required to integrate the operations and personnel of the combined businesses;\n\u2022\nexperiencing higher operating expenses relative to operating income from the new operations;\n\u2022\ncreating an adverse short-term effect on our results of operations;\n\u2022\nlosing key employees and customers as a result of an acquisition that is poorly received;\n\u2022\nsignificant problems relating to the conversion of the financial and customer data of the entity;\n\u2022\nintegration of acquired customers into our financial and customer product systems;\n\u2022\nrisk of assuming businesses with internal control deficiencies; or\n\u2022\nrisks of impairment to goodwill or other than temporary impairment of investment securities.\nDepending on the condition of any institution or assets or liabilities that we may acquire, that acquisition may, at least in the near term, adversely affect our capital and earnings and, if not successfully integrated with our organization, may continue to have such effects over a longer period. We may not be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with potential acquisitions, and any acquisition we may consider will be subject to prior regulatory approval. Also, acquisitions may involve the payment of a premium over book and market values and, therefore, some dilution of our tangible book value and net income per common share may occur in connection with any future transaction. Our inability to overcome these risks could have a material adverse effect on our profitability, return on equity and return on assets, our ability to implement our business strategy and enhance shareholder value, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, our inability to overcome these risks could materially and adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock, which could make it difficult to sell your shares at the volume, price or time desired.\nIf the goodwill that we record in connection with a business acquisition becomes impaired, it could require a charge to earnings.\nGoodwill represents the amount by which the purchase price exceeds the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination. We review goodwill for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the asset might be impaired.\nWe evaluate goodwill for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. Factors that could cause an impairment charge include adverse changes to macroeconomic conditions, declines in the profitability of the reporting unit, or declines in the tangible book value of the reporting unit. We recorded an impairment charge of $443.7 million in the first quarter of 2020 to our bank reporting unit. Future evaluations of goodwill may result in impairment and additional losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOperational Risk\nWe are subject to certain operational risks, including, but not limited to, employee or customer fraud, employee errors, and data processing system failures and errors.\nEmployee errors and employee and customer misconduct could subject us to financial losses or regulatory sanctions and seriously harm our reputation. Misconduct by our employees could include, among other things, improper use of confidential information or engaging in unauthorized activities on behalf of our customers. It is not always possible to prevent such employee errors and misconduct or documentation errors, and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases. Employee errors and misconduct could also subject us to financial claims for negligence.\nWhile we maintain a system of internal controls and insurance coverage to mitigate against operational risks, if our internal controls fail to prevent or detect an occurrence, or if any resulting loss is not insured or exceeds applicable insurance limits, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, we rely heavily upon information supplied by third parties, including the information contained in credit applications, property appraisals, title information, equipment pricing and valuation and employment and income documentation, in deciding which loans we will originate, as well as the terms of those loans. If any of the information upon which we rely is misrepresented, either fraudulently or inadvertently, and the misrepresentation is not detected prior to asset funding, the value of the asset may be significantly lower than expected, or we may fund a loan that we would not have funded or on terms we would not have extended. Whether a misrepresentation is made by the applicant or another third party, we generally bear the risk of loss associated with such misrepresentation. A loan subject to a material misrepresentation is typically unsellable or subject to repurchase if it is sold prior to detection of the misrepresentation. The sources of the misrepresentations are often difficult to identify, and it is often difficult to recover any of the monetary losses we may suffer.\nWe are subject to environmental liability risk associated with our lending activities.\nWe own certain of our properties, and, in the course of our business, we may purchase real estate, or we may foreclose on and take title to real estate. As a result, we could be subject to environmental liabilities with respect to these properties. We may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination or may be required to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic substances or chemical releases at a property. The costs associated with investigation or remediation activities could be substantial and could exceed the value of the underlying properties. In addition, if we are the owner or former owner of a contaminated site, we may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property. Any significant environmental liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe offer certain third-party wealth management products which could experience significant declines in value subjecting us to reputational damage and litigation risk.\nWe offer third-party products including mutual funds, annuities, life insurance, individual securities and other wealth management products. If these products do not generate competitive risk-adjusted returns that satisfy clients in a variety of asset classes, we will have difficulty maintaining existing business and attracting new business. Additionally, our wealth management business involves the risk that clients or others may sue us, claiming that we have failed to perform under a contract or otherwise failed to carry out a duty owed to them. This risk may be heightened during periods when credit, equity or other financial markets are deteriorating in value or are particularly volatile, or when clients or investors are experiencing losses. Significant declines in the performance of these third-party products could subject us to reputational damage and litigation risk.\nWe may be adversely impacted by the transition from LIBOR as a reference rate.\nIn 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority announced that after 2021 it would no longer compel banks to submit the rates required to calculate the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d). This announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021. Consequently, at this time, it is not possible to predict whether and to what extent banks will continue to provide submissions for the calculation of LIBOR. Similarly, it is not possible to predict whether LIBOR will continue to be viewed as an acceptable market benchmark, what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, or what the effect of any such changes in views or alternatives may be on the markets for LIBOR-indexed financial instruments.\nIn particular, regulators, industry groups and certain committees, e.g., the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (\u201cARRC\u201d), have, among other things, published recommended fall-back language for LIBOR-linked financial instruments, identified recommended alternatives for certain LIBOR rates (e.g., the Secured Overnight Financing Rate as the recommended alternative to U.S. Dollar LIBOR), and proposed implementations of the recommended alternatives in floating rate instruments. At this time, it is not possible to predict whether these specific recommendations and proposals will be broadly accepted, whether they will continue to evolve, and what the effect of their implementation may be on the markets for floating-rate financial instruments.\nWe have a significant number of loans, derivative contracts, borrowings and other financial instruments with attributes that are either directly or indirectly dependent on LIBOR. The transition from LIBOR could create considerable costs and additional risk. Since proposed alternative rates are calculated differently, payments under contracts referencing new rates will differ from those referencing LIBOR. The transition will change our market risk profiles, requiring changes to risk and pricing models, valuation tools, product design and hedging strategies. Furthermore, failure to adequately manage this transition process with our customers could adversely impact our reputation. Although we are currently unable to assess what the ultimate impact of the transition from LIBOR will be, failure to adequately manage the transition could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have formed a cross-functional project team to manage the assessment, identification, and resolution of risks and potential issues related to the transition from LIBOR to a replacement index. This team reports to the Asset Liability Committee (\u201cALCO\u201d) and Enterprise Risk Management Committee, who provide regular reports to the Board of Directors.\nAs part of our transition, we have identified approximately 35.2% of our assets and 1.3% of our liabilities and equity as being tied to LIBOR, with 28.2% of our assets and 1.3% of our liabilities and equity having a maturity date beyond 2021. We have begun\nremediation plans that include standardization of fallback language in all new contracts, solicitation from existing customers of rate index and spread amendments prior to LIBOR transition, providing customers with at least three options on alternative rate indexes of Prime, Ameribor, and SOFR, and adopting ISDA protocols for derivative contracts.\nAt this time, we do not anticipate any changes with our outstanding cash flow hedges because the ARRC convened by the Federal Reserve has already approved the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) as a replacement index for LIBOR and we anticipate sufficient SOFR loans will be available to hedge at transition. For the terminated collar, the timing of future forecasted income from other comprehensive income may be further accelerated as our loans could migrate to an index not qualified by FASB as a replacement for LIBOR.\nWe anticipate remediation of all contracts will be essentially complete by third quarter of 2021 in advance of LIBOR\u2019s potential termination.\nA failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of our third-party providers, could result in financial losses to us and/or in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, including client information, each of which could adversely affect our financial condition, damage our reputation and subject us to litigation.\nAs a financial institution, we may be the target of fraudulent activity that may result in financial losses to us or our clients, privacy breaches against our clients or damage to our reputation. Such fraudulent activity may take many forms, including check fraud, electronic fraud, wire fraud, phishing, unauthorized intrusion into or use of our systems, and other dishonest acts. We provide our clients with the ability to bank remotely, including over the Internet and over the telephone. The secure transmission of confidential information over the Internet and other remote channels is a critical element of remote banking.\nAdditionally, our customers and employees have been, and will continue to be, targeted by parties using fraudulent e-mails and other communications in attempts to misappropriate passwords, bank account information or other personal information or to introduce viruses or other malware through \u201cTrojan horse\u201d programs to our information systems and/or our customers\u2019 computers. Information security risks for financial institutions related to these types of attacks have generally increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the Internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, activists, and other external parties, including foreign state-sponsored parties. Though we endeavor to mitigate these threats through product improvements, use of encryption and authentication technology and customer and employee education, such cyberattacks against us or our merchants and our third-party service providers remain a serious issue.\nOur operations are dependent upon our ability to protect the computer systems and network infrastructure utilized by us, including our Internet, telephone and other remote channel banking activities, our debit and credit card payment processing activities, and our customer relationship management, general ledger, deposit, loans and other systems, against damage from physical break-ins, cybersecurity breaches and other disruptive problems caused by the Internet or other users. Such computer break-ins and other disruptions would jeopardize the security of information stored in and transmitted through our computer systems and network infrastructure, which may result in significant liability, damage our reputation and inhibit current and potential customers from using our Internet banking services. While we maintain security measures to mitigate the risk of cybersecurity breaches, it is possible that we may not be able to anticipate, detect or recognize threats to its systems or to implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types, especially because the techniques used change frequently or are not recognized until launched, and because cyberattacks can originate from a wide variety of sources, including third parties. Controls employed by our information technology department and cloud vendors could prove inadequate. These risks may increase in the future as we continue to increase our Internet-based product offerings and expand our internal usage of web-based products and applications. In addition, maintaining our security measures to seek to protect against the latest types of threats entails significant costs and creates risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones.\nA breach of our security that results in unauthorized access to our data could expose us to a disruption or challenges relating to our daily operations, as well as to data loss, litigation, damages, fines and penalties, significant increases in compliance costs (such as repairing systems or adding new personnel or protection technologies), and reputational damage (including customer dissatisfaction), any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on third parties for many of our information technology and telecommunications solutions, and any systems failures, interruptions, or data breaches involving these systems could adversely affect our operations and financial condition.\nOur business depends on the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our information technology and telecommunications systems, third-party servicers and financial intermediaries. We outsource many of our major systems, such as data processing, loan servicing and deposit processing systems. The failure of these systems, or the termination of a third-party software license or service agreement on which any of these systems is based, could interrupt our operations and we could experience difficulty in implementing replacement solutions. In many cases, our operations rely heavily on the secure processing, storage and transmission of information and the monitoring of a large number of transactions on a minute-by-minute basis, and even a short interruption in service could have significant consequences. In addition, we interact with and rely on financial counterparties, regulators and retailers for whom we process transactions. Each of these third parties may be targets of the same types of fraudulent activity, computer break-ins and\nother cybersecurity breaches described in the immediately preceding risk factor, and the cybersecurity measures that they maintain to mitigate the risk of such activity may be different than our own.\nBecause our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, we could experience service denials if demand for such services exceeds capacity or such third-party systems fail or experience interruptions. If significant, sustained or repeated, a system failure or service denial could compromise our ability to operate effectively, damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, and subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, failure of third parties to comply with applicable laws and regulations, or fraud or misconduct on the part of employees of any of these third parties could disrupt our operations or adversely affect our reputation. We may also incur costs as a result of data or security breaches of third parties with whom we do not have a significant direct relationship. For example, various retailers and companies processing payments on their behalf have reported that they were victims of cyberattacks in which large amounts of their customers\u2019 data, including debit and credit card information, was obtained. In these situations, we generally incur costs to replace compromised cards and address fraudulent transaction activity affecting our customers.\nAs a result of financial entities and technology systems becoming more interdependent and complex, a cyber incident, information breach or loss, or technology failure that compromises the systems or data of one or more financial entities could have a material impact on counterparties or other market participants, including ourselves. We have taken measures to implement backup systems and other safeguards, such as third party risk management due diligence and ongoing monitoring, disaster recovery testing with key providers, key service level agreements, and strategic planning/exit strategy, to support our operations, but our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by any significant disruptions to us or to third parties with whom we interact.\nWe are subject to laws regarding the privacy, information security and protection of personal information and any violation of these laws or another incident involving personal, confidential or proprietary information of individuals could damage our reputation and otherwise adversely affect our operations and financial condition.\nOur business requires the collection and retention of large volumes of customer data, including personally identifiable information in various information systems that we maintain and in those maintained by third parties with whom we contract to provide data services. We also maintain important internal company data such as personally identifiable information about our employees and information relating to our operations. We are subject to complex and evolving laws and regulations governing the privacy and protection of personal information of individuals (including customers, employees, suppliers and other third parties). For example, our business is subject to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act which, among other things: (i) imposes certain limitations on our ability to share nonpublic personal information about our customers with nonaffiliated third parties; (ii) requires that we provide certain disclosures to customers about our information collection, sharing and security practices and afford customers the right to \u201copt out\u201d of any information sharing by us with nonaffiliated third parties (with certain exceptions); and (iii) requires that we develop, implement and maintain a written comprehensive information security program containing appropriate safeguards based on our size and complexity, the nature and scope of our activities, and the sensitivity of customer information we process, as well as plans for responding to data security breaches. Various state and federal banking regulators and states have also enacted data security breach notification requirements with varying levels of individual, consumer, regulatory or law enforcement notification in certain circumstances in the event of a security breach. Ensuring that our collection, use, transfer and storage of personal information complies with all applicable laws and regulations can increase our costs. Furthermore, we may not be able to ensure that all of our clients, suppliers, counterparties and other third parties have appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of the information that they exchange with us, particularly where such information is transmitted by electronic means. If personal, confidential or proprietary information of customers or others were to be mishandled or misused (in situations where, for example, such information was erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information, or where such information was intercepted or otherwise compromised by third parties), we could be exposed to litigation or regulatory sanctions under personal information laws and regulations. Concerns regarding the effectiveness of our measures to safeguard personal information, or even the perception that such measures are inadequate, could cause us to lose customers or potential customers for our products and services and thereby reduce our revenues. Accordingly, any failure or perceived failure to comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws and regulations may subject us to inquiries, examinations and investigations that could result in requirements to modify or cease certain operations or practices or in significant liabilities, fines or penalties, and could damage our reputation and otherwise adversely affect our operations and financial condition.\nWe continually encounter technological changes, and if we are unable to stay current with those changes, we may not be able to effectively compete.\nThe financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to stay current with technological changes. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements than we do. As a result, they may be able to offer additional or superior products to those that we will be able to provide, which would put us at a competitive disadvantage. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers. In addition, the implementation of technological changes and upgrades to maintain current systems and integrate new ones may also cause service interruptions, transaction processing errors and\nsystem conversion delays, may cause us to fail to comply with applicable laws, and may cause us to incur additional expenses, which may be substantial. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry and avoid interruptions, errors and delays could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe expect that new technologies and business processes applicable to the consumer credit industry will continue to emerge and these new technologies and business processes may be better than those we currently use. Because the pace of technological change is high, and our industry is intensely competitive, we may not be able to sustain our investment in new technology as critical systems and applications become obsolete or as better ones become available. A failure to maintain current technology and business processes could cause disruptions in our operations or cause our products and services to be less competitive, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions.\nOur ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services companies are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, and other relationships. We have exposure to different industries and counterparties including through transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks and other institutional clients. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about the soundness of, one or more financial services companies, or the financial services industry generally, have historically led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. These losses or defaults could have a material effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to the Regulation of Our Industry\nRegulatory Risk\nThe banking industry is highly regulated, and current and future legislative or regulatory changes could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nAs a financial holding company, we are subject to extensive federal supervision and regulation. Federal regulation of the banking industry, along with tax and accounting laws, regulations, rules and standards, limit our operations significantly and control the methods by which we conduct business. In addition, compliance with laws and regulations can be difficult and costly, and changes to laws and regulations can impose additional compliance costs. Many of these regulations are intended to protect depositors, customers, the public, the banking system as a whole or the FDIC deposit insurance fund, not shareholders. Regulatory requirements and discretion affect our lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy and many other aspects of our business. There are laws and regulations which restrict transactions between us and our subsidiaries. These requirements may constrain our operations, and the adoption of new laws and changes to or repeal of existing laws may have a further impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects. The burdens imposed by federal and state regulations place banks at a competitive disadvantage compared to non-bank competitors. We are also subject to requirements with respect to the confidentiality of information obtained from clients concerning their identities, business and personal financial information, employment, and other matters. We require our personnel to agree to keep all such information confidential and we monitor compliance. Failure to comply with confidentiality requirements could result in material liability and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.\nFederal and state regulatory agencies may adopt changes to their regulations or change the manner in which existing regulations are applied. We cannot predict the substance or effect of pending or future legislation or regulation or the application of laws and regulations to our Company. Compliance with current and potential regulation, as well as regulatory scrutiny, may significantly increase our costs, impede the efficiency of our internal business processes, require us to increase our regulatory capital, and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities in an efficient manner by requiring us to expend significant time, effort and resources to ensure compliance and respond to any regulatory inquiries or investigations. In addition, press coverage and other public statements that assert some form of wrongdoing by financial services companies (including press coverage and public statements that do not involve us) may result in regulatory inquiries or investigations, which, independent of the outcome, may be time-consuming and expensive and may divert time, effort and resources from our business. Evolving regulations and guidance concerning executive compensation may also impose limitations on us that affect our ability to compete successfully for executive and management talent.\nBecause our total assets exceed $10 billion, we are subject to additional regulatory requirements, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nVarious federal banking laws and regulations, including rules adopted by the Federal Reserve pursuant to the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act, impose heightened requirements on certain large banks and bank holding companies. Most of these rules apply primarily to bank holding companies with at least $50 billion in total consolidated assets, but certain rules also apply to banks and bank holding companies with at least $10 billion in total consolidated assets. The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (\u201cEGRRCPA\u201d) was enacted in 2018 and provides certain limited amendments to the Dodd-Frank Act as well as other modifications to certain post-crisis regulatory requirements. The EGRRCPA has decreased the overall regulatory burden on institutions like Cadence.\nAs a result of our total assets exceeding $10 billion, we and Cadence Bank: are required to have a dedicated risk committee of our Board of Directors responsible for overseeing our enterprise-risk management policies that includes at least one risk management expert; are subject to more frequent regulatory examinations; and are subject to examination for compliance with federal consumer protection laws by the CFPB. We established a dedicated risk committee of the Board prior to reaching $10 billion in total assets in 2018 and were already subject to more frequent examinations because we were part of the OCC mid-size bank group.\nRegulatory initiatives regarding bank capital requirements may require heightened capital.\nCadence and Cadence Bank are subject to risk-based and leverage capital requirements under the BASEL III capital rules. We must maintain certain risk-based and leverage capital ratios as required by our banking regulators, which can change depending on economic conditions and our particular condition, risk profile, growth plans, and regulatory capital guidelines. Failure to meet minimum capital guidelines and/or other regulatory requirements can subject the Company and the Bank to certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements. Additional information, including the Company\u2019s and Bank\u2019s compliance with applicable capital adequacy standards is provided in \u201cNote 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Shareholders\u2019 Equity.\u201d\nIn March 2020, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision announced that it will delay the implementation of outstanding capital standards, commonly referred to as \u201cBasel IV\u201d, to allow banks to focus their resources on navigating the COVID-19 pandemic. The standards, originally set to be implemented on January 1, 2022, will now have an implementation date of January 1, 2023.\nRegulators periodically examine our business and we may be required to remediate adverse examination findings.\nThe Federal Reserve, the FDIC, the OCC, and the CFPB periodically examine our business, including our compliance with laws and regulations, and we may become subject to other regulatory agency examinations in the future. If, as a result of an examination, a federal banking agency were to determine that our financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity, or other aspects of any of our operations had become unsatisfactory, or that we were in violation of any law or regulation, it may require us to take a number of different remedial actions as it deems appropriate. These actions include the power to enjoin \u201cunsafe or unsound\u201d practices, to require affirmative action to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice, to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced, to direct an increase in our capital, to restrict our growth by preventing us from acquiring other financial institutions or limiting our ability to expand our business by engaging in new activities, to change the asset composition of our portfolio or balance sheet, to assess civil monetary penalties against our officers or directors, to remove officers and directors and, if it is concluded that such conditions cannot be corrected or there is an imminent risk of loss to depositors, to terminate our deposit insurance and place us into receivership or conservatorship. Any regulatory action against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Federal Reserve may require us to commit additional capital resources to support Cadence Bank.\nThe Federal Reserve requires a bank holding company to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to a subsidiary bank and to commit resources to support such subsidiary bank. The Federal Reserve may require a bank holding company to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank and may charge the bank holding company with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices for failure to commit resources to a subsidiary bank. A capital injection may be required at times when the holding company may not have the resources to provide it and therefore may be required to borrow the funds or raise capital. Any loans by a holding company to its subsidiary banks are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary bank. In the event of a bank holding company\u2019s bankruptcy, the bankruptcy trustee will assume any commitment by the holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank. Moreover, claims based on any such commitment will be entitled to priority of payment over the claims of the institution\u2019s general unsecured creditors, including the holders of its note obligations. Thus, any borrowing that must be done by the bank holding company to make the required capital injection becomes more difficult and expensive and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCompliance Risk\nWe are subject to numerous laws designed to protect consumers, including the CRA and fair lending laws, and failure to comply with these laws could lead to a wide variety of sanctions.\nThe CRA, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act and other fair lending laws and regulations impose non-discriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions. The Department of Justice and other federal agencies, including the CFPB, are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations. A successful regulatory challenge to an institution\u2019s performance under the CRA or fair lending laws and regulations could result in a wide variety of sanctions, including damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, restrictions on mergers and acquisitions activity, restrictions on expansion, and restrictions on entering new business lines. In the case of the CRA, the performance of a financial institution in meeting the credit needs of its community and its overall CRA rating are factors that will be taken into consideration when the federal banking agencies evaluate applications related to mergers and acquisitions, as well as branch opening and relocations. Private parties may also have the ability to challenge\nan institution\u2019s performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation. Such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFederal, state and local consumer lending laws may restrict our ability to originate certain mortgage loans or increase our risk of liability with respect to such loans and could increase our cost of doing business.\nFederal, state and local laws have been adopted that are intended to eliminate certain lending practices considered \u201cpredatory.\u201d These laws prohibit practices such as steering borrowers away from more affordable products, selling unnecessary insurance to borrowers, repeatedly refinancing loans and making loans without a reasonable expectation that the borrowers will be able to repay the loans irrespective of the value of the underlying property. It is our policy not to make predatory loans, but these laws create the potential for liability with respect to our lending and loan investment activities. They increase our cost of doing business and, ultimately, may prevent us from making certain loans and cause us to reduce the average percentage rate or the points and fees on loans that we do make.\nThe expanding body of federal, state and local regulations and/or the licensing of loan servicing, collections or other aspects of our business and our sales of loans to third parties may increase the cost of compliance and the risks of noncompliance and subject us to litigation.\nWe service some of our own loans, and loan servicing is subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local governmental authorities as well as to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing requirements and restrictions on those activities. The volume of new or modified laws and regulations has increased in recent years and, in addition, some individual municipalities have begun to enact laws that restrict loan servicing activities including delaying or temporarily preventing foreclosures or forcing the modification of certain mortgages. If regulators impose new or more restrictive requirements, we may incur additional significant costs to comply with such requirements which may further adversely affect us. In addition, were we to be subject to regulatory investigation or regulatory action regarding our loan modification and foreclosure practices, our financial condition and results of operation could be adversely affected.\nFailure to comply with economic and trade sanctions or with applicable anti-corruption laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Office of Foreign Assets Control administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions against targeted foreign countries and regimes, under authority of various laws, including designated foreign countries, nationals and others. We are responsible for, among other things, blocking accounts of, and transactions with, such persons and countries, prohibiting unlicensed trade and financial transactions with them and reporting blocked transactions after their occurrence. Through our company and the Bank, and our agents and employees, we are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d), which prohibits offering, promising, giving, or authorizing others to give anything of value, either directly or indirectly, to a non-U.S. government official in order to influence official action or otherwise gain an unfair business advantage. The Company is also subject to applicable anti-corruption laws in the jurisdictions in which it may operate. The Company has implemented policies, procedures, and internal controls that are designed to comply with economic and trade sanctions or with applicable anti-corruption laws, including the FCPA. Failure to comply with economic and trade sanctions or with applicable anti-corruption laws, including the FCPA, could have serious legal and reputational consequences for us.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nEconomic Conditions\nThe fiscal and monetary policies of the U.S. government could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur business is significantly affected by fiscal and monetary policies of the U.S. federal government and its agencies, particularly the Federal Reserve Board. Federal Reserve policies determine in large part the cost of funds for lending and investing and the returned earned on those loans and investments, both of which impact our net interest margin. Federal Reserve policies may also adversely affect borrowers, potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans or could adversely create asset bubbles which result from prolonged periods of accommodative policy. This, in turn, may result in volatile markets and rapidly declining collateral values. The monetary policies of the Federal Reserve and other governmental policies have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. Changes in any of these policies are influenced by macroeconomic conditions and other factors that are beyond our control. Adverse economic conditions and government policy responses to such conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe current economic environment poses significant challenges and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are operating in a challenging and uncertain economic environment. Financial institutions continue to be affected by uncertainty in the real estate market, the credit markets, and the national financial market generally. We retain direct exposure to the commercial and, to a lesser extent, residential, real estate markets, and we are affected by events in these markets. The uncertainty in economic conditions has subjected us and other financial institutions to increased regulatory\nscrutiny. In addition, deterioration in local economic conditions in our markets could result in losses beyond that provided for in our ACL and result in increased loan delinquencies, problem assets, and foreclosures. This may also result in declining demand for products and services, decreased deposits and increased borrowings under our current contractual obligations to extend credit, all of which would adversely impact our liquidity positions, and declining values for loan collateral, which in turn would reduce customers\u2019 borrowing power and the value of assets and collateral associated with our existing loans.\nInvestment in Our Class A Common Stock\nThe market price of our Class A common stock may be subject to substantial fluctuations, which may make it difficult to sell shares at the volume, prices and times desired.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock may be highly volatile, which may make it difficult to sell shares at the volume, prices and times desired. There are many factors that may impact the market price and trading volume of our Class A common stock, including, without limitation:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results, financial condition or asset quality;\n\u2022\nchanges in economic or business conditions;\n\u2022\nfailure to meet market predictions of our earnings;\n\u2022\nthe effects of trade, monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government;\n\u2022\npublication of research reports about us, our competitors, or the financial services industry generally, or changes in, or failure to meet, estimates made by securities analysts or ratings agencies of our financial and operating performance, or lack of research reports by industry analysts or ceasing of coverage;\n\u2022\noperating and stock price performance of companies that investors deemed comparable to us;\n\u2022\nfuture issuances of our Class A common stock or other securities;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws, regulations or policies affecting us;\n\u2022\nperceptions in the marketplace regarding our competitors and/or us;\n\u2022\nsignificant acquisitions or business combinations, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by or involving our competitors or us;\n\u2022\nother economic, competitive, governmental, regulatory and technological factors affecting our operations, pricing, products and services; and\n\u2022\nother news, announcements or disclosures (whether by us or others) related to us, our competitors, our markets or the financial services industry.\nThe stock market and the market for financial institution stocks, have experienced substantial fluctuations in recent years, which in many cases have been unrelated to the operating performance and prospects of particular companies. In addition, significant fluctuations in the trading volume in our Class A common stock may cause significant price variations to occur. Increased market volatility may materially and adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock, which could make it difficult to sell your shares at the volume, prices and times desired.\nThere are substantial regulatory limitations on changes of control of bank holding companies that may discourage investors from purchasing shares of our Class A common stock.\nWith certain limited exceptions, federal regulations prohibit a person or company or a group of persons deemed to be \u201cacting in concert\u201d from, directly or indirectly, acquiring more than 10% (5% if the acquirer is a bank holding company) of any class of our voting stock or obtaining the ability to control in any manner the election of a majority of our directors or otherwise direct the management or policies of our Company without prior notice or application to, and the approval of, the Federal Reserve. Companies investing in banks and bank holding companies receive additional review and may be required to become bank holding companies, subject to regulatory supervision. Accordingly, prospective investors must be aware of and comply with these requirements, if applicable, in connection with any purchase of shares of our Class A common stock. These provisions could discourage third parties from seeking to acquire significant interests in us or in attempting to acquire control of us, which, in turn, could adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock.\nSecurities analysts may not continue coverage on our Class A common stock, which could adversely affect the market for our Class A common stock.\nThe trading market for our Class A common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities analysts publish about us and our business. We do not have any control over these securities analysts, and they may not cover our Class A common stock. If securities analysts do not continue to cover our Class A common stock, the lack of research coverage may adversely affect our market price. If our Class A common stock is the subject of an unfavorable report, the price of our Class A common stock may decline. If one or more of these analysts cease to cover us or fail to publish regular reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause the price or trading volume of our Class A common stock to decline.\nShares of our Class A common stock are subject to dilution.\nActual or anticipated issuances or sales of substantial amounts of our Class A common stock could cause the market price of our Class A common stock to decline significantly and make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and on terms that we deem appropriate. The issuance of any shares of our Class A common stock in the future also would, and equity-related securities could, dilute the percentage ownership interest held by shareholders prior to such issuance. We may issue all these shares without any action or approval by our shareholders, and these shares, once issued (including upon exercise of outstanding options), will be available for sale into the public market, subject to the restrictions described below, if applicable, for affiliate holders.\nWe may issue shares of Class B non-voting common stock or shares of preferred stock that would adversely affect the rights of our Class A common shareholders.\nOur authorized capital stock includes 300,000,000 shares of Class B non-voting common stock, $0.01 par value per share, and 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.01 par value per share. As of the date of the filing of this Annual Report with the SEC, we have no issued and outstanding shares of either our Class B non-voting common stock or our preferred stock. Our Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, may issue Class B non-voting common stock and one or more series of preferred stock. Subject to limitations imposed by our certificate of incorporation, our Board of Directors is empowered to determine, among other items, the number of shares for each series, the dividend rate for each series, the terms and conditions of any voting, conversion or exchange rights for each series, and the preferences and the relative rights for each series.\nOur future ability to pay dividends is subject to restrictions.\nWe currently conduct substantially all our operations through our subsidiaries, and a significant part of our income is attributable to dividends from the Bank and we principally rely on the profitability of the Bank to conduct operations and satisfy obligations. Our principal source of funds to pay dividends on our common and preferred stock and service any of our obligations are dividends received directly from our subsidiaries, including Cadence Bank. As is the case with all financial institutions, the profitability of the Bank is subject to the fluctuating cost and availability of money, changes in interest rates, and in economic conditions in general. In addition, various federal and state statutes and regulations limit the amount of dividends that the Bank may pay to us, with or without regulatory approval.\nHolders of our Class A common stock are entitled to receive only such cash dividends as our Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. Any declaration and payment of dividends on Class A common stock will depend upon our earnings and financial condition, liquidity and capital requirements, the general economic and regulatory climate, our ability to service any equity or debt obligations senior to the Class A common stock, and other factors deemed relevant by the board of directors. Furthermore, consistent with our business plans, growth initiatives, capital availability, projected liquidity needs, and other factors, we have made, and will continue to make, capital management decisions and policies that could adversely impact the amount of dividends, if any, paid to our common shareholders.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws include provisions that could impede a takeover of the Company.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could delay, defer, or prevent a third party from acquiring control of our organization or conduct a proxy contest, even if those events were perceived by many of our shareholders as beneficial to their interests. These provisions:\n\u2022\nenable our Board of Directors to issue additional shares of authorized, but unissued capital stock;\n\u2022\nenable our Board of Directors to issue \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock with such designations, rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by the board;\n\u2022\nenable our Board of Directors to increase the size of the board and fill the vacancies created by the increase;\n\u2022\nmay prohibit large shareholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock, from merging or combining with us for a certain period of time;\n\u2022\nprovide for a plurality voting standard in the election of directors;\n\u2022\ndo not provide for cumulative voting in the election of directors;\n\u2022\nenable our Board of Directors to amend our bylaws without shareholder approval;\n\u2022\ndo not allow for the removal of directors without cause;\n\u2022\nlimit the right of shareholders to call a special meeting;\n\u2022\nrequire advance notice for director nominations and other shareholder proposals; and\n\u2022\nrequire prior regulatory application and approval of any transaction involving control of our organization.\nThese provisions may discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control, including when our shareholders might otherwise receive a premium over the market price of our shares. At the 2020 Annual Shareholders Meeting, certain amendments to our certificate of incorporation and by-laws were approved by our shareholders. These amendments: (a) declassify the Board of Directors beginning in 2021, at which time each director on the ballot for election would be elected to a one-year term following the expiration of such director\u2019s existing term (beginning in 2022) and (b) eliminate the requirement for a supermajority vote in order to amend the By-Laws and replace the requirement with a majority vote standard.\nShares of our Class A common stock are not deposits insured by the FDIC and are subject to risk of loss.\nShares of our Class A common stock are not deposit accounts and are not insured by the FDIC or any other government agency and are subject to investment risk, including the possible loss of your investment.\nThe return on investment in our common stock is uncertain.\nAn investor in our Class A common stock may not realize a substantial return on his or her investment or may not realize any return at all. Further, as a result of the uncertainty and risks associated with our operations, many of which are described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, it is possible that an investor could lose his or her entire investment.\nOther Risks\nAs a public company, we are required to meet periodic reporting requirements under the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d). Complying with federal securities laws as a public company is expensive.\nAs a publicly traded company, we are required to file periodic reports containing our consolidated financial statements with the SEC within a specified time following the completion of quarterly and annual periods. Any failure by us to file our periodic reports with the SEC in a timely manner could harm our reputation and cause investors and potential investors to lose confidence in us and reduce the market price of our Class A common stock.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting, insurance, compliance and other expenses. Any deficiencies in our financial reporting or internal controls could materially and adversely affect us, including resulting in material misstatements in our financial statements, and the market price of our Class A common stock.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting, insurance and other expenses. These costs and compliance with the rules of the SEC and the rules of the applicable stock exchange may further increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time consuming and costly. SEC rules require that our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer periodically certify the existence and effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and our independent registered public accounting firm will be required to attest to our assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. This process requires significant documentation of policies, procedures and systems, review of that documentation by our internal auditing and accounting staff and our outside independent registered public accounting firm and testing of our internal control over financial reporting by our internal auditing and accounting staff and our outside independent registered public accounting firm. This process involves considerable time and attention from management, which could prevent us from successfully implementing our business initiatives and improving our business, results of operations and financial condition, may strain our internal resources, and increases our operating costs.\nDuring our testing, we may identify deficiencies that would have to be remediated to satisfy the SEC rules for certification of our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is defined by the standards issued by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board as a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting that results in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Therefore, we would have to disclose in periodic reports we file with the SEC any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. The existence of a material weakness would preclude management from concluding that our internal control over financial reporting is effective and would preclude our independent auditors from attesting to our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting is effective. In addition, disclosures of deficiencies of this type in our SEC reports could cause investors to lose confidence in our financial reporting, may negatively affect the market price of our Class A common stock, and could result in the delisting of our securities from the securities exchanges on which they trade. Moreover, effective internal controls are necessary to produce reliable financial reports and to prevent fraud. If we have deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting, it may materially and adversely affect us.\nWe may be adversely affected by changes in U.S. tax laws\nWe are subject to federal and applicable state tax regulations. Such tax regulations are often complex and require interpretation and changes in these regulations could negatively impact our results of operations. In the normal course of business, we are routinely subject to examinations and challenges from federal and applicable state tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. Federal and state taxing authorities have become increasingly aggressive in challenging tax positions taken by financial institutions. These tax positions may relate to tax compliance, sales and use, franchise, gross receipts, payroll, property and income tax issues, including tax base, apportionment and tax credit planning. The challenges made by tax authorities may result in adjustments to the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. If any such challenges are made and are not resolved in our favor, they could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe rely heavily on our management team and could be adversely affected by the unexpected loss of key personnel.\nWe are led by an experienced management team with substantial experience in the markets that we serve, and our operating strategy focuses on providing products and services through long-term relationship managers. Accordingly, our success depends in large part on the performance of our key personnel, as well as on our ability to attract, motivate and retain highly qualified senior and middle management. Competition for employees is intense, and we may be unsuccessful in locating key personnel with the\ncombination of skills and attributes required to execute our business plan. We may not be successful in retaining our key employees, and the unexpected loss of key personnel, including our relationship managers, could also have a material adverse effect on our business because of their skills, knowledge of our market, industry experience, relationship-centric banking model, and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel.\nActs or threats of terrorism and political or military actions taken by the United States or other governments could adversely affect general economic or industry conditions.\nGeopolitical conditions may affect our business. Acts or threats of terrorism and political or military actions taken by the United States or other governments, including in response to terrorism or similar activity, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are required to make significant estimates and assumptions in the preparation of our financial statements. These estimates and assumptions may not be accurate and are subject to change.\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires our management to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of income and expense during the reporting periods. Critical estimates are made by management in determining, among other things, the accounting for business combinations, estimates of fair value, ACL and valuation of deferred tax assets. If our underlying estimates and assumptions prove to be incorrect or if events occur that require us to revise our previous estimates or assumptions, our financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nWe are subject to litigation, which could result in substantial judgment or settlement costs.\nWe may be involved from time to time in litigation matters in the ordinary course of business. While we believe that these litigation matters should not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or future prospects, we may be unable to successfully defend or resolve any current or future litigation matters, in which case those litigation matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 16654, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "CADE"}
