{"cik": "945764", "company": "DENBURY INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-05", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe risks described below fall into six broad categories related to (1) oil price volatility and demand, (2) future executive, legislative or regulatory actions, (3) financial risks, (4) risks of owning our common stock, (5) cybersecurity risks, and (6) those related to our operations and industry. These are not the only ones we face but are considered to be the most material. There may be other unknown or unpredictable economic, business, competitive, regulatory or other factors that could have material adverse effects on our future results. Past financial performance is not a reliable indicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\nRisks Relating to Volatility in Oil Pricing and Demand for Oil\nLow oil prices in recent years have led to significant periods of reduced cash flows and negatively affected our financial condition and results of operations.\nOil prices are the most important determinant of our operational and financial success. Oil prices are highly impacted by worldwide oil supply, demand and prices and have historically been subject to significant price changes over short periods of time. Over the last several years, NYMEX oil prices have been extremely volatile, declining from a three-year peak of $76 per Bbl in October 2018 to lows averaging $17 per Bbl in April 2020 due to the reduction in worldwide economic activity and oil demand amid the COVID-19 pandemic, plus OPEC supply pressures, before gradually increasing to the low-$60s per barrel in mid-February 2021. Based on rising COVID-19 case levels and their impact on worldwide economic activity, volatility will remain, and prices could move downward on a rapid or repeated basis, which makes planning and budgeting, acquisition transactions, capital raising, and sustaining business strategies more difficult. Our cash flow from operations is highly dependent on the prices that we receive for oil, as oil comprised approximately 97% of our 2020 production and approximately 98% of our proved reserves at December 31, 2020. The prices for oil and natural gas are subject to a variety of factors that are beyond our control. These factors include:\n\u2022the level of worldwide demand for oil and natural gas, which has been negatively affected by the economic impact of the worsening COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022worldwide economic conditions;\n\u2022the degree to which members of OPEC maintain oil price and production controls;\n\u2022the degree to which domestic oil and natural gas production affects worldwide supply of crude oil or its price; and\n\u2022worldwide political events, conditions and policies, including actions taken by foreign oil and natural gas producing nations.\nNegative movements in oil prices could harm us in a number of ways, including:\n\u2022lower cash flows from operations may require reduced levels of capital expenditures; which in turn could lower our present and future production levels and lower the quantities and value of our oil and gas reserves, which constitute our major asset;\n\u2022we could be forced to increase our level of indebtedness, issue additional equity, or sell assets; and/or\n\u2022we could be required to impair various assets, including a write-down of our oil and natural gas assets or the value of other tangible or intangible assets.\nFurthermore, some or all of our tertiary projects could become or remain uneconomical. We may also decide to suspend future expansion projects, and if prices were to drop below our operating cash break-even points for an extended period of time, we may decide to shut-in existing production, both of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition and reduce our production.\nThe continued COVID-19 pandemic is likely to continue to suppress worldwide economic activity, which in turn could negatively affect our cash flow.\nThe spread and emergence of new variants of the COVID-19 virus continues to evolve, both in the United States and abroad. Its ultimate impact on our operational and financial performance will depend on future developments, including (1) the timing and effectiveness of administration of available vaccines domestically and around the world, which is currently thought to be the most important factor affecting the duration and intensity of the pandemic, (2) the actions to contain the virus or\nDenbury Inc.\nmitigate its impact, and (3) related restrictions on business activity and travel, all of which have had a direct impact on continued lower levels of domestic and global oil demand.\nAs described above, oil prices are the most important determinant of our operational and financial success. The possibility of a continued reduction in cash flows for an indeterminant period of time could impair our ability to develop our properties and grow our production and oil and gas reserve values.\nA continuing financial downturn in one or more of the world\u2019s major markets could negatively affect our business and financial condition.\nIn addition to the current impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the demand for oil, regional or worldwide increases in tariffs or other trade restrictions, significant international currency fluctuations, evolving political and military tensions in the Middle East and Asia, a sustained credit crisis, a severe economic contraction either regionally or worldwide or turmoil in the global financial system could materially affect our business and financial condition or impact our ability to finance operations. Negative credit market conditions could inhibit our lenders from funding our senior secured bank credit facility or cause them to restrict our borrowing base or make the terms of our senior secured bank credit facility more costly and more restrictive. Negative economic conditions could also adversely affect the collectability of our trade receivables or performance by our suppliers or cause our commodity hedging arrangements to be ineffective if our counterparties are unable to perform their obligations.\nRisks Relating to Any Future Executive, Legislative or Regulatory Actions\nAny future climate change initiatives by the Biden Administration, by Congress or by state regulatory or legislative bodies could negatively affect our business and operations, especially in the Rocky Mountain region.\nThe new Biden Administration and Congress may adopt stricter standards for, and increase oversight and regulation over, the exploration and production industry at the federal level, which measures could lead to increased costs or additional operating restrictions. Also, there is the potential for climate change legislation which could affect demand for oil on a long-term basis.\nOur operations on federal, state or Indian oil and natural gas leases in the Rocky Mountain region must be conducted pursuant to permits and authorizations issued by the Bureau of Land Management, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and other federal and state stakeholder agencies. In late January 2021, the Biden Administration, through executive action, suspended for a 60-day period new leasing and other oil and natural gas approvals on federal lands, pending review of such activity. Also, the Department of Interior recently has rescinded the ability to issue new permits to drill oil and natural gas wells on existing federal leases. Extension of these actions over a longer period could prevent us from expanding our oil and natural gas operations, in both new locations and in areas currently leased for which permits have not yet been obtained. In addition, any action by the federal government to rescind previously issued permits on the Company\u2019s existing leases, or actions to restrict our ability to access public lands or to obtain permits, including permits for additional pipeline infrastructure to transport CO2, could significantly disrupt our existing and future operations, including our planned 105-mile CO2 pipeline extension in the Cedar Creek Anticline area in Montana and North Dakota.\nTax proposals under discussion within the Biden Administration, if enacted, could change or remove long-time tax benefits available to the oil and gas industry for drilling and production activities.\nAs part of its budgetary planning, the Biden Administration has discussed a number of changes to certain provisions of federal tax law applicable to the exploration and production industry, including imposing a tax on carbon emissions, as well as eliminating long-standing deductions that benefit the fossil fuel industry. Among the specific provisions being focused upon are Internal Revenue Code (\u201cIRC\u201d) Section 263, which allows expensing of exploration, development and intangible drilling costs, and IRC Section 613, which allows use of percentage depletion instead of cost depletion to recover drilling and development costs of oil and gas wells. Any such changes would require the U.S. Congress to pass new legislation and are likely to be part of a broader set of tax revisions. It is currently anticipated that new tax legislation will be proposed by the Administration later in 2021, the timing and specifics of which are yet to be determined, and the likelihood of passage of which is not assured.\nDenbury Inc.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations applicable to our industry are costly and stringent.\nOur exploration, production, and marketing operations are subject to complex and stringent federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing, among other things, the discharge of substances into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of human health and the protection of endangered species. These laws and regulations and related public policy considerations affect the costs, manner, and feasibility of our operations and require us to make significant expenditures in order to comply. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil, and criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory and remedial obligations, and the issuance of injunctions that could limit or prohibit our operations. Some of these laws and regulations may impose joint and several, strict liability for contamination resulting from spills, discharges, and releases of substances, including petroleum hydrocarbons and other wastes, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct. Under such laws and regulations, we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed substances and property contamination, including wastes disposed or released by prior owners or operators.\nRisks Relating to Financial Results and Condition\nOn September 18, 2020, we emerged from bankruptcy, which could adversely affect our business and relationships.\nIt is possible that our having filed for bankruptcy and our third-quarter 2020 emergence from the Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings could adversely affect our business and relationships with customers, employees and suppliers in the following ways:\n\u2022key suppliers could terminate their relationship or require financial assurances or enhanced performance;\n\u2022the ability to renew existing contracts and compete for new business may be adversely affected\u037e\n\u2022the ability to attract, motivate and/or retain key executives and employees may be adversely affected\u037e\n\u2022employees may be distracted from performance of their duties or more easily attracted to other employment opportunities\u037e and\n\u2022competitors may take business away from us, and our ability to attract and retain customers may be negatively impacted.\nThe occurrence of one or more of these events could have a material and adverse effect on our operations, financial condition and reputation. We cannot assure you that having been subject to bankruptcy protection will not adversely affect our operations in the future.\nOur actual financial results after emergence from bankruptcy are not comparable to our historical financial information as a result of the implementation of the plan of reorganization and our adoption of fresh start accounting.\nUpon our emergence from bankruptcy, we adopted fresh start accounting. Accordingly, certain values and financial measures of the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements subsequent to September 18, 2020 are not comparable to those in its consolidated financial statements prior to, and including September 18, 2020, although numerous operational measures are roughly comparable to those in our historical financial statements and other disclosures.\nIn connection with proceedings in the Bankruptcy Court, and the late third-quarter 2020 hearing to consider confirmation of the plan of reorganization, we prepared projected financial information to demonstrate to the Bankruptcy Court the feasibility of the plan of reorganization and our ability to continue operations upon our emergence from bankruptcy. Those projections were prepared at that time solely for the purpose of the bankruptcy proceedings and have not been, and will not be, updated on an ongoing basis. The projections were prepared based upon then-current prevailing economic assumptions at that time, are inherently subject to substantial and numerous uncertainties and to a wide variety of significant business, economic and competitive risks, and the assumptions underlying the projections and/or valuation estimates may prove to be wrong in material respects. Actual results will likely vary significantly from those contemplated by the projections. As a result, investors should not rely on those projections.\nWe may be unable to access the equity or debt capital markets to raise sufficient capital to fund our development activities or other obligations.\nRecent reluctance of traditional capital sources to invest in the exploration and production sector based on market volatility, perceived underperformance and environmental, social and governance trends, has raised concerns regarding capital availability\nDenbury Inc.\nfor the sector. The cost of obtaining money from the credit markets has increased as many lenders and institutional investors have increased interest rates, enacted tighter lending standards and reduced (and in some cases ceased to provide) funding to borrowers. If those markets are unavailable, or if we are unable to access them or alternative financing sources on acceptable terms, we may be unable to carry out our business strategy, with an accompanying negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nCommodity derivative contracts may expose us to potential financial loss.\nTo reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the prices of oil and natural gas, we enter into commodity derivative contracts in order to economically hedge a portion of our forecasted oil and natural gas production. As of February 24, 2021, we have oil derivative contracts in place covering approximately 32,500 Bbls/d for 2021, 10,500 Bbls/d for the first half of 2022, and 2,000 Bbls/d for the second half of 2022. Such derivative contracts expose us to risk of financial loss, including when there is a change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the hedging agreement and actual prices received, when the cash benefit from hedges including a sold put is limited to the extent oil prices fall below the price of any sold puts in our derivative portfolio, or when the counterparty to the derivative contract is financially constrained and defaults on its contractual obligations. In addition, these derivative contracts may limit the benefit we would otherwise receive from increases in the prices for oil and natural gas.\nRisks Relating to Ownership of Denbury Securities\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, including both those issuable upon exercise of our outstanding warrants and those registrable for resale under a registration rights agreement, could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well.\nApproximately 40% of our currently issued and outstanding shares of common stock, currently held by five shareholders, are entitled to be registered for resale under a registration rights agreement (see Note 10, Stockholders\u2019 Equity, to the consolidated financial statements), for the benefit of the largest holders of our pre-emergence debt, as agreed as part of our bankruptcy plan of reorganization. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock by these holders, or the perception that such sales could occur, could reduce the market price of our common stock and might also impair our ability to raise capital through future sale of our equity. Additionally, in connection with our plan of reorganization, we issued series A and series B warrants to holders of our pre-emergence debt and equity, entitling the warrant holders to exercise the warrants for up to approximately 5.5 million shares (approximately 10%) of our currently outstanding common stock on a fully diluted basis. See Note 1, Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Emergence from Voluntary Reorganization Under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, to the consolidated financial statements regarding the specific terms of the warrants. The future exercise of a large number of warrants, followed by the subsequent sale of the acquired stock into the market, could also negatively affect our common stock price. We cannot predict the likelihood of sales of shares by these two groups of holders of our common stock or their amounts, or the effect of any such sales on the prevailing market price of our common stock.\nThe trading market for our common stock and its market price may be affected by our limited trading volume.\nUpon our emergence from bankruptcy, our old common stock was canceled and we issued new common stock. The market price and trading volume of our common stock is affected by numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include, among other things, the overhang of shares of our common stock registered for resale under a registration statement as discussed above, the concentration of holdings of our common stock, and on a longer-term basis, the potential future dilution of up to 5.5 million shares of our common stock acquirable upon exercise of our series A or series B warrants, which dilution from exercise of the series A or series B warrants could be reduced to the extent warrants are exercised on a cashless basis. No assurance can be given as to the liquidity of the trading market for the common stock.\nRisks Relating to a Cybersecurity Breach\nA cyber breach could occur and result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption, and/or financial loss.\nOur business has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct day-to-day operations, including certain of our exploration, development and production activities. We depend on digital technology, among other things, to process and record financial and operating data; analyze seismic and drilling information; monitor and control pipeline and\nDenbury Inc.\nplant equipment; and process and store personally identifiable information of our employees, industry partners and royalty owners. Cyberattacks on businesses have escalated in recent years, exemplified by the recent delayed discovery of the Russian-sponsored hack of U.S. governmental agencies and hundreds of U.S. corporations which did not affect our systems. Our technologies, systems and networks, or those of software providers that we use, may become the target of cyberattacks or information security breaches that could compromise our process control networks or other critical systems and infrastructure, resulting in disruptions to our business operations, harm to the environment or our assets, disruptions in access to our financial reporting systems, or loss, misuse or corruption of our critical data and proprietary information, including our business information and that of our employees, partners and other third parties. Successful attacks which disable third-party pipelines or processing facilities upon which we depend could materially adversely affect our operations. Any of the foregoing may be exacerbated by a delay or failure to detect a cyber incident. Although we have not incurred any material losses from cyberattacks, future cyberattacks could result in significant financial losses, legal or regulatory violations, reputational harm, and legal liability.\nAlthough we utilize various procedures and controls to monitor and protect against these threats and to mitigate our exposure to such threats, there can be no assurance that these procedures and controls will be sufficient in preventing successful attacks from the increasing number of sophisticated intrusions based on technological advances. We may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our procedures and controls or to upgrade our digital and operational systems, related infrastructure, technologies and network security, which could increase our costs. The Audit Committee\u2019s duties and responsibilities include reviewing and discussing the Company\u2019s guidelines and policies with respect to risk assessment and risk management, as well as the Company\u2019s major financial and cybersecurity risk exposures and the steps that management has taken to monitor and control such exposures.\nRisks Relating to Our Operations and Industry\nOur future performance depends upon our ability to effectively develop our existing oil and natural gas reserves and find or acquire additional oil and natural gas reserves that are economically recoverable.\nUnless we can successfully develop our existing reserves and/or replace the reserves that we produce, our reserves will decline, resulting eventually in a decrease in oil and natural gas production and lower revenues and cash flows from operations. We have historically replaced reserves through both acquisitions and internal organic growth activities. For internal organic growth activities, the magnitude of proved reserves that we can book in any given year depends on our progress with new floods and the timing of the production response, as well as the success of exploitation projects. In the future, we may not be able to continue to replace reserves at acceptable costs. The business of exploring for, developing or acquiring reserves is capital intensive. We may not be able to make the necessary capital investment to maintain or expand our oil and natural gas reserves if our cash flows from operations are reduced, whether due to current oil or natural gas prices or otherwise, or if external sources of capital become limited or unavailable. Further, the process of using CO2 for tertiary recovery, and the related infrastructure, requires significant capital investment prior to any resulting and associated production and cash flows from these projects, heightening potential capital constraints. If our capital expenditures are restricted, or if outside capital resources become limited, we will not be able to maintain our current production levels.\nEstimating our reserves, production and future net cash flows is difficult to do with any certainty.\nEstimating quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves requires interpretations of available technical data and various assumptions, including future production rates, production costs, severance and excise taxes, capital expenditures and workover and remedial costs, and the assumed effect of governmental rules and regulations. There are numerous uncertainties about when a property may have proved reserves as compared to potential or probable reserves, particularly relating to our tertiary recovery operations. Forecasting the amount of oil reserves recoverable from tertiary operations, and the production rates anticipated therefrom, requires estimates, one of the most significant being the oil recovery factor. Actual results most likely will vary from our estimates. Also, the use of a 10% discount factor for reporting purposes, as prescribed by the SEC, may not necessarily represent the most appropriate discount factor, given actual interest rates and risks to which our business, and the oil and natural gas industry in general, are subject. Any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions, or changes of conditions, could result in a revision of the quantities and net present value of our reserves.\nThe reserves data included in documents incorporated by reference represents estimates only. Quantities of proved reserves are estimated based on economic conditions, including first-day-of-the-month average oil and natural gas prices for the 12-month period preceding the date of the assessment. The representative oil and natural gas prices used in estimating our\nDenbury Inc.\nDecember 31, 2020 reserves, after adjustments for market differentials and transportation expenses by field, were $35.84 per Bbl for crude oil and $1.70 per Mcf for natural gas. Our reserves and future cash flows may be subject to revisions based upon changes in economic conditions, including oil and natural gas prices, as well as due to production results, results of future development, operating and development costs, and other factors. Downward revisions of our reserves could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results. Actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs used in our estimates.\nOur production will decline if our access to sufficient amounts of carbon dioxide is limited.\nOur long-term strategy is primarily focused on our CO2 tertiary recovery operations. The crude oil production from our tertiary recovery projects depends, in large part, on having access to sufficient amounts of naturally occurring and industrial-sourced CO2. Our ability to produce oil from these projects would be hindered if our supply of CO2 was limited due to, among other things, problems with our current CO2 producing wells and facilities, including compression equipment, catastrophic pipeline failure or our ability to economically purchase CO2 from industrial sources. This could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our anticipated future crude oil production from tertiary operations is also dependent on the timing, volumes and location of CO2 injections and, in particular, on our ability to increase our combined purchased and produced volumes of CO2 and inject adequate amounts of CO2 into the proper formation and area within each of our tertiary oil fields.\nThe development of our naturally occurring CO2 sources involves the drilling of wells to increase and extend the CO2 reserves available for use in our tertiary fields. These drilling activities are subject to many of the same drilling and geological risks of drilling and producing oil and gas wells (see Oil and natural gas development and producing operations involve various risks below). Furthermore, recent market conditions may cause the delay or cancellation of construction of plants that produce industrial-sourced CO2 as a byproduct that we can purchase, thus limiting the amount of industrial-sourced CO2 available for our use in our tertiary operations.\nCertain of our operations may be limited during certain periods due to severe weather conditions and other regulations.\nOur operations in the Gulf Coast region may be subjected to adverse weather conditions such as hurricanes, flooding and tropical storms in and around the Gulf of Mexico, as well as freezing temperatures, ice and snow, that can damage oil and natural gas facilities and delivery systems and disrupt operations, which can also increase costs and have a negative effect on our results of operations. Certain of our operations in North Dakota, Montana and Wyoming, including the construction of CO2 pipelines, the drilling of new wells and production from existing wells, are conducted in areas subject to extreme weather conditions including severe cold, snow and rain, which conditions may cause such operations to be hindered or delayed or otherwise require that they be conducted only during non-winter months, and depending on the severity of the weather, could have a negative effect on our results of operations in these areas. Further, the potential impacts of climate change on our operations may include unusually intense rainfall and storm patterns, rising sea levels and increased high temperatures, the last of which imposes certain physical constraints on our CO2 injections in our operations in the Gulf Coast.\nCertain of our operations in the Rocky Mountain region are confined to certain time periods due to environmental regulations, federal restrictions on when drilling can take place on federal lands, and lease stipulations designed to protect certain wildlife, which regulations, restrictions and limitations could slow down our operations, cause delays, increase costs and have a negative effect on our results of operations. In addition, a number of governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating regulatory changes in response to various proposals to combat climate change and how it should be dealt with. Legislation and increased regulation regarding climate change could impose significant costs on us and possibly affect our financial condition and operating performance.\nOil and natural gas development and producing operations involve various risks.\nOur operations are subject to all of the risks normally incident and inherent to the operation and development of oil and natural gas properties and the drilling of oil and natural gas wells, including, without limitation, pipe failure; fires; formations with abnormal pressures; uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas, brine or well fluids; release of contaminants into the environment and other environmental hazards and risks; and well blowouts, cratering or explosions. In addition, our operations are sometimes near populated commercial or residential areas, which adds additional risks. The nature of these risks is such that some liabilities could exceed our insurance policy limits or otherwise be excluded from, or limited by, our insurance\nDenbury Inc.\ncoverage, as in the case of environmental fines and penalties, for example, which are excluded from coverage as they cannot be insured.\nWe could incur significant costs related to these risks that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows or could have an adverse effect upon the profitability of our operations. Additionally, a portion of our production activities involves CO2 injections into fields with wells plugged and abandoned by prior operators. It is often difficult (or impracticable) to determine whether a well has been properly plugged prior to commencing injections and pressuring the oil reservoirs. We may incur significant costs in connection with remedial plugging operations to prevent environmental contamination and to otherwise comply with federal, state and local regulations relative to the plugging and abandoning of our oil, natural gas and CO2 wells. In addition to the increased costs, if wells have not been properly plugged, modification to those wells may delay our operations and reduce our production.\nDevelopment activities are subject to many risks, including the risk that we will not recover all or any portion of our investment in such wells. The cost of drilling, completing and operating a well is often uncertain, and cost factors can adversely affect the economics of a project. Further, our drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of numerous factors, including:\n\u2022unexpected drilling conditions;\n\u2022pressure or irregularities in formations;\n\u2022equipment failures or accidents;\n\u2022adverse weather conditions, including hurricanes and tropical storms in and around the Gulf of Mexico, as well as freezing temperatures, ice and snow, that can damage oil and natural gas facilities and delivery systems and disrupt operations, and winter conditions and forest fires in the Rocky Mountain region that can delay or impede operations;\n\u2022compliance with environmental and other governmental requirements;\n\u2022the cost of, or shortages or delays in the availability of, drilling rigs, equipment, pipelines and services; and\n\u2022title problems.\nOur planned tertiary operations and the related construction of necessary CO2 pipelines could be delayed by difficulties in obtaining pipeline rights-of-way and/or permits and/or by the listing of certain species as threatened or endangered.\nThe production of crude oil from our planned tertiary operations is dependent upon having access to pipelines to transport available CO2 to our oil fields at a cost that is economically viable. Our future construction of CO2 pipelines will require us to obtain rights-of-way from private landowners, state and local governments and the federal government in certain areas. Certain states where we operate have considered or may again consider the adoption of laws or regulations that could limit or eliminate the ability of a pipeline owner or of a state, state\u2019s legislature or its administrative agencies to exercise eminent domain over private property, in addition to possible judicially imposed constraints on, and additional requirements for, the exercise of eminent domain. We also often conduct Rocky Mountain operations on federal and other oil and natural gas leases inhabited by species that could be listed as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act, which listing could lead to tighter restrictions as to federal land use and other land use where federal approvals are required. These laws and regulations, together with any other changes in law related to the use of eminent domain or the listing of certain species as threatened or endangered, could inhibit or eliminate our ability to secure rights-of-way or otherwise access land for current or future pipeline construction projects and may require additional regulatory and environmental compliance, and increased costs in connection therewith, which could delay our CO2 pipeline construction schedule and initiation of our pipeline operations, and/or increase the costs of constructing our pipelines.\nThe marketability of our production is dependent upon transportation lines and other facilities, most of which we do not control. When these facilities are unavailable, our operations can be interrupted and our revenues reduced.\nThe marketability of our oil and natural gas production depends, in part, upon the availability, proximity and capacity of transportation lines owned by third parties. In general, we do not control these transportation facilities, and our access to them may be limited or denied. A significant disruption in the availability of, and access to, these transportation lines or other production facilities could adversely impact our ability to deliver to market or produce our oil and thereby cause a significant interruption in our operations.\nDenbury Inc.\nWe may lose key executive officers or specialized technical employees, which could endanger the future success of our operations.\nOur success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our executive officers, other key management and specialized technical personnel. Our employees, including our executive officers, are employed at will and do not have employment agreements. We believe that our future success depends, in large part, upon our ability to hire and retain highly skilled personnel.\nThe loss of one or more of our large oil and natural gas purchasers could have an adverse effect on our operations.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, three purchasers individually accounted for 10% or more of our oil and natural gas revenues and, in the aggregate, for 54% of such revenues. The loss of a large single purchaser could adversely impact the prices we receive or the transportation costs we incur.", "PERMNO": 82196, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "DNRCQ"}
