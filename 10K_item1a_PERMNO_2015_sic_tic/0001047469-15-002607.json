RISK FACTORS.\nAn investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the other information included in this Report, before making an investment decision. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer. In that case, the trading price of our shares of common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment. See \"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements\" above for a discussion of forward-looking statements and the significance of such statements in the context of this Report.\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Industry\nWe have a very limited operating history and are expected to incur significant operating losses during the early stage of our corporate development.\nWe were organized on January 14, 2010 and we acquired the rights to our product candidate Locilex\u00ae in April 2010. Accordingly, we have a limited operating history. We have not sold our product candidate because it is currently investigational in nature and requires completion of additional clinical and non-clinical trials and studies in order to obtain regulatory approval in the U.S. and abroad. Therefore, our historical financial information consists only of an audit of our financial results at and for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013, and 2014. This is very limited historical financial information upon which to base an evaluation of our performance. We are an emerging company, and thus our prospects must be considered in light of the uncertainties, risks, expenses, and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their early stages of operation, particularly in the pharmaceutical industry. We have generated cumulative losses of approximately $22.3 million since inception, and we expect to continue to incur losses until Locilex\u00ae is approved by the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities. Even if regulatory approval is obtained, there is a risk that we will not be able to generate material sales of Locilex\u00ae, which would cause us to continue to incur losses. We thus expect to incur substantial operating expenses over the next several years as our product development and marketing activities increase. The amount of future losses and when, if ever, we will achieve profitability are uncertain.\nWe have never generated revenue, may never generate revenue, are not profitable and may never become profitable.\nWe expect to incur substantial losses and negative operating cash flow for the foreseeable future, and we may never achieve or maintain profitability. Even if we are able to launch Locilex\u00ae, we expect to incur substantial losses for the foreseeable future and may never become profitable.\nAs we have no operating revenue, we also expect to experience negative cash flow for the foreseeable future as we continue to fund our operating losses and capital expenditures. As a result, we will need to generate significant revenues in order to achieve and maintain profitability. We may not be able to generate these revenues or achieve profitability in the future. Our failure to achieve or maintain profitability would negatively impact the value of your securities and potentially require us to shut down our business, which would result in the loss of your investment.\nGiven our lack of revenue and cash flow, we may need to raise additional capital, which may be unavailable to us or, even if consummated, may cause dilution or place significant restrictions on our ability to operate.\nSince we will be unable to generate sufficient, if any, revenue or cash flow to fund our operations for the foreseeable future, we may need to seek additional equity or debt financing to provide the capital required to maintain or expand our operations. We may also need additional funding to continue the development of Locilex\u00ae, increase our sales and marketing capabilities, promote brand identity, or develop or acquire complementary companies, technologies and assets, as well as for\nworking capital requirements and other operating and general corporate purposes. Moreover, the regulatory compliance arising out of being a publicly registered company has dramatically increased our costs.\nWe do not currently have any arrangements or credit facilities in place as a source of funds, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient additional capital if needed on acceptable terms, or at all. If such financing is not available on satisfactory terms, or is not available at all, we may be required to delay, scale back or eliminate the development of business opportunities and our ability to achieve our business objectives, our competitiveness, and our operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected. Our inability to fund our business could thus lead to the loss of your investment.\nIf we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders may be reduced, and accordingly these stockholders may experience substantial dilution. We may also issue equity securities that provide for rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our common stock. Given our need for cash and that equity issuance is the most common type of fundraising for companies like ours, the risk of dilution is particularly significant for stockholders of our company.\nDebt financing, if obtained, may involve agreements that include liens on our assets and covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt. Debt financing would also be required to be repaid regardless of our operating results.\nIf we raise additional funds through collaborations and licensing arrangements, we may be required to relinquish some rights to Locilex\u00ae, or to grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.\nWe have no experience as a company in obtaining regulatory approval for, or commercializing, any product candidate.\nAs a company, we have never obtained regulatory approval for, or commercialized, any product candidate. It is possible that the FDA may refuse to accept our planned NDA for Locilex\u00ae for substantive review, or may conclude after review of our data that our application is insufficient to obtain regulatory approval of Locilex\u00ae or any future product candidates. If the FDA does not accept or approve our planned NDA for Locilex\u00ae, it may require that we conduct additional clinical, preclinical or manufacturing validation studies, which may be costly, and submit that data before it will reconsider our applications. Depending on the extent of these or any other FDA required studies, approval of any NDA or application that we submit may be significantly delayed, possibly for several years, or may require us to expend more resources than we have available. Any delay in obtaining, or an inability to obtain, regulatory approvals would prevent us from commercializing Locilex\u00ae, generating revenues and achieving and sustaining profitability. It is also possible that additional studies, if performed and completed, may not be considered sufficient by the FDA to approve any NDA we submit. If any of these outcomes occur, we may be forced to abandon our planned NDA for Locilex\u00ae, which would materially adversely affect our business and could potentially cause us to cease operations. We face similar risks for any approval in a foreign jurisdiction.\nOur current and future operations substantially depend on our management team and our ability to hire other key personnel, the loss of any of whom could disrupt our business operations.\nOur business depends and will continue to depend in substantial part on the continued service of David P. Luci and Robert J. DeLuccia. Messrs. Luci and DeLuccia are parties to employment agreements for a three year term of service ending in March 2017, subject to automatic one year renewals absent termination with at least six months' notice. Such agreements may also be terminated by us with or without Cause (as defined in the employment agreements) and by each of Messrs. Luci or DeLuccia voluntarily or with Good Reason (as defined in the employment agreements). The loss of the\nservices of either of these individuals would significantly impede implementation and execution of our business strategy and may result in the failure to reach our goals. We do not carry key person life insurance on any of our management, which would leave our company uncompensated for the loss of any of our management.\nOur future viability and ability to achieve sales and profit will also depend on our ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified personnel in the diverse areas required for continuing our operations. There is a risk that we will be unable to attract, train or retain qualified personnel, both near term or in the future, and our failure to do so may severely damage our prospects.\nThere is a risk that Locilex\u00ae will not receive regulatory approval, and without regulatory approval we will not be able to market Locilex\u00ae.\nOur business currently depends entirely on the successful development and commercialization of Locilex\u00ae. Our ability to generate revenue related to product sales, if ever, will depend on the successful development and regulatory approval of Locilex\u00ae for the treatment of Mild DFI.\nWe currently have no products approved for sale and we cannot guarantee that we will ever have marketable products. The development of a product candidate and issues relating to its approval and marketing are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA in the U.S., the European Medicines Agency (or EMA) in Europe and regulatory authorities in other countries, with regulations differing from country to country. We are not permitted to market our product candidates in the U.S. or Europe until we receive approval of a NDA from the FDA or a Marketing Authorisation Application (or MAA) from the EMA, respectively.\nNDAs and MAAs must include extensive data and supporting information to establish the product candidate's safety and effectiveness for each desired indication. NDAs and MAAs must also include significant information regarding the chemistry, manufacturing and controls for the product. Obtaining approval of a NDA or a MAA is a lengthy, expensive and uncertain process, and we may not be successful in obtaining approval. The FDA and the EMA review processes can take years to complete and approval is never guaranteed. If we submit a NDA to the FDA, the FDA must decide whether to accept or reject the submission for filing. We cannot be certain that any submissions will be accepted for filing and review by the FDA. Regulators of other jurisdictions, such as the EMA, have their own procedures for approval of product candidates.\nEven if a product is approved, the FDA or the EMA, as the case may be, may limit the indications for which the product may be marketed, require extensive warnings on the product labeling or require expensive and time-consuming clinical trials or reporting as conditions of approval. Regulatory authorities in countries outside of the U.S. and Europe also have requirements for approval of drug candidates with which we must comply prior to marketing in those countries. Obtaining regulatory approval for marketing of a product candidate in one country does not ensure that we will be able to obtain regulatory approval in any other country.\nIn addition, delays in approvals or rejections of marketing applications in the U.S., Europe or other countries may be based upon many factors, including regulatory requests for additional analyses, reports, data, preclinical studies and clinical trials, regulatory questions regarding different interpretations of data and results, changes in regulatory policy during the period of product development and the emergence of new information regarding Locilex\u00ae or other product candidates we may develop or acquire in the future. Also, regulatory approval for Locilex\u00ae or other product candidates we may develop or acquire in the future may be withdrawn.\nBefore we submit a NDA to the FDA or a MAA to the EMA for Locilex\u00ae , we must successfully complete two Phase 3 trials. We cannot predict whether our future trials and studies will be successful\nor whether regulators will agree with our conclusions regarding the preclinical studies and clinical trials we have conducted to date.\nIf we are unable to obtain approval from the FDA, the EMA or other regulatory agencies for Locilex\u00ae and any other product candidates we may develop or acquire in the future, or if, subsequent to approval, we are unable to successfully commercialize Locilex\u00ae or our other product candidates we may develop or acquire in the future, we will not be able to generate sufficient revenue to become profitable or to continue our operations.\nLocilex\u00ae's prior sponsor encountered certain difficulties in manufacturing Locilex\u00ae on a commercial scale, and there is a risk that we will continue to experience manufacturing issues that may prevent Locilex\u00ae from receiving regulatory approval.\nIn the late 1990s, a prior formulation of Locilex\u00ae was tested by Magainin, Locilex\u00ae's prior sponsor, with over 1,000 human subjects exposed to such prior formulation of Locilex\u00ae, including 835 evaluable patients in two Phase 3 clinical trials. The FDA Advisory Committee reviewing Locilex\u00ae at the time unanimously approved the safety of the product, but did not recommend approval based upon its efficacy and recommended an additional Phase 3 placebo controlled trial. In its 1999 non-approvable letter, the FDA identified certain cGMP manufacturing deficiencies, namely stability and quality control issues, and raised questions regarding the comparability of the product used in the Phase 3 program versus that which was produced at commercial scale.\nSince we acquired rights to Locilex\u00ae, we have worked with our third-party vendors to address the stability and purity concerns previously articulated by the FDA. However, we cannot guarantee that such deficiencies will be deemed resolved to the FDA's satisfaction, that the FDA or other regulatory agencies will not identify new manufacturing concerns, or that, once regulatory approval is granted, our manufacturers will be able to comply with applicable regulations to maintain the quality of our product. If we are unable to resolve any outstanding manufacturing issues, the cost and timing for achieving regulatory approval could materially increase and could prevent us from meeting the developmental milestones necessary to maintain the viability of our business.\nEven if Locilex\u00ae gains regulatory approval, it may never achieve market acceptance or any level of commercial success. Our failure to achieve market acceptance will prevent or delay our ability to generate material revenues.\nOur future financial performance will depend, to a large extent, upon the introduction and physician and patient acceptance of our product candidate, Locilex\u00ae. Even if approved for marketing by the necessary regulatory authorities, Locilex\u00ae may not achieve market acceptance or reimbursement by Medicare, Medicaid or third party payors.\nThe degree of market acceptance for Locilex\u00ae will depend upon a number of factors, including:\n\u2022 regulatory clearance of marketing claims for the uses that we are developing;\n\u2022 demonstration of the advantages, safety and efficacy for Locilex\u00ae;\n\u2022 pricing and reimbursement policies of government and third-party payors such as insurance companies, health maintenance organizations and other health plan administrators;\n\u2022 our ability to attract corporate partners, including pharmaceutical companies, to assist in commercializing our formulation of Locilex\u00ae; and\n\u2022 our ability to timely and effectively manufacture and market Locilex\u00ae, either on our own or through third parties.\nPhysicians, various other healthcare providers, patients, payors or the medical community in general may be unwilling to accept, utilize or recommend Locilex\u00ae. If we are unable to obtain regulatory approval, or are unable (either on our own or through third parties) to manufacture, commercialize and market Locilex\u00ae or any future product candidates we may develop or acquire when planned, we may not achieve any market acceptance or generate revenue, which could cause our business to fail.\nOur failure to complete or meet key milestones relating to the development of Locilex\u00ae or other product candidates we may develop or acquire in the future would significantly impair the viability of our company.\nIn order to be commercially viable, we must successfully research, develop, obtain regulatory approval for, manufacture, introduce, market and distribute Locilex\u00ae and, if applicable, any future product candidates we may develop. With respect to Locilex\u00ae in particular, we must meet a number of critical developmental milestones, including:\n\u2022 demonstration, through clinical trials, that Locilex\u00ae is safe and effective; and\n\u2022 establishment of a viable Good Manufacturing Process capable of potential scale-up.\nThe estimated required capital and time-frames necessary to achieve these developmental milestones as described in this report or as we may state from time to time is subject to inherent risks, many of which may be beyond our control. As such, we may not be able to achieve these or similar milestones for Locilex\u00ae or any product candidate we may develop or acquire in the future. Our failure to meet these or other critical milestones would adversely affect the viability of our company.\nConducting and completing the clinical trials necessary for FDA approval is costly and subject to intense regulatory scrutiny as well as the risk of failing to meet the primary endpoints of such trials. We will not be able to commercialize and sell Locilex\u00ae without completing such trials.\nIn order to conduct clinical trials that are necessary to obtain approval by the FDA to market Locilex\u00ae or any other product candidate we may develop or acquire in the future, it is necessary to receive clearance from the FDA to conduct such clinical trials. We must conduct two Phase 3 clinical trials for Locilex\u00ae. We commenced both Phase 3 trials in the third quarter of 2014. We may not be able to commence, enroll sufficient patients in, properly conduct or complete such trials. If we cannot achieve all of these goals, our viability will be materially impaired.\nIn addition, the FDA can halt clinical trials at any time during the conduct of clinical trials for safety reasons or because we or our clinical investigators did not follow the FDA's requirements for conducting clinical trials. If our trials are permanently halted by the FDA, we would not be able to achieve any revenue from such product as it is illegal to sell any drug for human consumption or use without FDA approval. If our trials are temporarily halted by the FDA, the cost and timing for potentially achieving regulatory approval could be materially increased.\nMoreover, there is a risk that our clinical trials will fail to meet their primary endpoint, which would make them unacceptable in having Locilex\u00ae approved by the FDA. If this were to occur, the announcement of such an event would very likely cause our public stock price to decrease, perhaps significantly, and such event would otherwise materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and viability.\nLocilex\u00ae may have undesirable side effects which may delay or prevent marketing approval, or, if approval is received, require it to be taken off the market, require it to include safety warnings or otherwise limit sales of the product.\nUnforeseen side effects from Locilex\u00ae could arise either during clinical development or, if approved, after Locilex\u00ae has been marketed. This could cause regulatory approvals for, or market acceptance of, Locilex\u00ae more difficult and more costly to obtain.\nTo date, no serious adverse events have been attributed to Locilex\u00ae, though approximately 12% of patients in prior clinical trials experienced serious adverse events unrelated to Locilex\u00ae. The results of our planned or any future clinical trials may show that Locilex\u00ae causes undesirable or unacceptable side effects, which could interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials, and result in delay of, or failure to obtain, marketing approval from the FDA and other regulatory authorities, or result in marketing approval from the FDA and other regulatory authorities with restrictive label warnings.\nIf Locilex\u00ae receives marketing approval and we or others later identify undesirable or unacceptable side effects caused by the use of Locilex\u00ae:\n\u2022 regulatory authorities may withdraw their approval of the product, which would force us to remove Locilex\u00ae from the market;\n\u2022 regulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements, specific warnings, a contraindication or field alerts to physicians and pharmacies;\n\u2022 we may be required to change instructions regarding the way the product is administered, conduct additional clinical trials or change the labeling of the product;\n\u2022 we may be subject to limitations on how we may promote the product;\n\u2022 sales of the product may decrease significantly;\n\u2022 we may be subject to litigation or product liability claims; and\n\u2022 our reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent us or our potential future collaborators from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of Locilex\u00ae or could substantially increase commercialization costs and expenses, which in turn could delay or prevent us from generating significant revenues from the sale of Locilex\u00ae.\nWe currently have no marketing and sales organization and have no experience as a company in marketing pharmaceutical products. If we are unable to establish our own marketing and sales capabilities, or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell our products after they are approved, we may not be able to generate product revenues.\nWe do not have a sales organization for the marketing, sales and distribution of any pharmaceutical products. In order to commercialize Locilex\u00ae or any other product candidate we may develop or acquire in the future, we must develop these capabilities on our own or make arrangements with third parties for the marketing, sales and distribution of our products. The establishment and development of our own sales force would be expensive and time consuming and could delay any product launch, and we cannot be certain that we would be able to successfully develop this capability. As a result, we may seek one or more partners to handle some or all of the sales and marketing of Locilex\u00ae in the U.S. and elsewhere. There also may be certain markets within the U.S. for Locilex\u00ae for which we may seek a co-promotion arrangement. However, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with third parties to sell Locilex\u00ae on favorable terms or at all. In the event we are unable to develop our own marketing and sales force or collaborate with a third-party marketing and sales organization, we would not be able to commercialize Locilex\u00ae or any other product candidates that we\ndevelop, which would negatively impact our ability to generate product revenues. Furthermore, whether we commercialize products on our own or rely on a third party to do so, our ability to generate revenue will be dependent on the effectiveness of the sales force. In addition, to the extent we rely on third parties to commercialize our approved products, we will likely receive less revenues than if we commercialized these products ourselves.\nWe rely heavily on third parties for conducting clinical trials, marketing and distributing Locilex\u00ae.\nWe presently are party to, and expect that we will be required to enter into, agreements with commercial partners to perform clinical trials for us and to engage in sales, marketing and distribution efforts for Locilex\u00ae or other product candidates we may acquire in the future. We may be unable to establish or maintain third-party relationships on a commercially reasonable basis, if at all. In addition, these third parties may have similar or more established relationships with our competitors or other larger customers. Moreover, the loss for any reason of one or more of these key partners could have a significant and adverse impact on our business. If we are unable to obtain or retain third party sales and marketing vendors on commercially acceptable terms, we may not be able to commercialize Locilex\u00ae as planned and we may experience delays in or suspension of our marketing launch of Locilex\u00ae. The same could apply to other product candidates we may develop or acquire in the future. Our dependence upon third parties may adversely affect our ability to generate profits or acceptable profit margins and our ability to develop and deliver such products on a timely and competitive basis.\nWe rely on single source third-party contract manufacturing organizations to manufacture and supply Locilex\u00ae for us. If one of our suppliers or manufacturers fails to perform adequately or fulfill our needs, or if these agreements are terminated by the third parties, we may be required to incur significant costs and devote significant efforts to find new suppliers or manufacturers. We may also face delays in the development and commercialization of Locilex\u00ae or other product candidates that we may develop or acquire in the future.\nWe currently have limited experience in, and we do not own facilities for, manufacturing Locilex\u00ae or any other product candidate we may develop or acquire in the future. We rely upon single source third-party contract manufacturing organizations to manufacture and supply large quantities of our product candidates. We currently utilize PolyPeptide Laboratories, Inc. for the bulk manufacturing of Locilex\u00ae and DPT Laboratories, Inc. (a division of Smith & Nephew) for the formulation of Locilex\u00ae. In addition, we are using Almac Group Limited to label the 15 gram tubes of Locilex\u00ae and distribute as we direct.\nThe manufacture of pharmaceutical products in compliance with current good manufacturing practice (or cGMP) regulations requires significant expertise and capital investment, including the development of advanced manufacturing techniques and process controls. Manufacturers of pharmaceutical products often encounter difficulties in production, including difficulties with production costs and yields, quality control, including stability of the product candidate and quality assurance testing, or shortages of qualified personnel. If our manufacturers were to encounter any of these difficulties or otherwise fail to comply with their obligations to us or under applicable regulations, our ability to provide study materials in our preclinical studies and clinical trials would be jeopardized. Any delay or interruption in the supply of clinical trial materials could delay the completion of our clinical trials, increase the costs associated with maintaining our clinical trial programs and, depending upon the period of delay, require us to commence new trials at significant additional expense or terminate the studies and trials completely.\nOur suppliers and manufacturers for Locilex\u00ae must comply with cGMP requirements enforced by the FDA through its facilities inspection program. These requirements include, among other things, quality control, quality assurance and the maintenance of records and documentation. Manufacturers of our component materials may be unable to comply with these cGMP requirements and with other FDA, state and foreign regulatory requirements. The FDA or similar foreign regulatory agencies at any time may also implement new standards, or change their interpretation and enforcement of existing standards for manufacture, packaging or testing of products. We have little control over our manufacturers' compliance with these regulations and standards. A failure to comply with these requirements may result in fines and civil penalties, suspension of production, suspension or delay in product approval, product seizure or recall, or withdrawal of product approval. If the safety of any product supplied is compromised due to our manufacturers' failure to adhere to applicable laws or for other reasons, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our products, and we may be held liable for any injuries sustained as a result. Any of these factors could cause a delay of clinical trials, regulatory submissions, approvals or commercialization of Locilex\u00ae or any product candidates we may develop or acquire in the future or entail higher costs or impair our reputation.\nOur current agreements with our suppliers do not provide for the entire supply of the bulk drug necessary for full-scale commercialization. In the event that we and our suppliers cannot agree to the terms and conditions for them to provide some or all of our bulk drug clinical and commercial supply needs, or if any single-source supplier terminates the agreement in response to a breach by us, we would not be able to manufacture the bulk drug on a commercial scale until a qualified alternative supplier is identified, which could also delay the development of, and impair our ability to commercialize, Locilex\u00ae or any product candidates we may develop or acquire in the future.\nThe number of third-party suppliers with the necessary manufacturing and regulatory expertise and facilities for our company is limited, and it could be expensive and take a significant amount of time to arrange for alternative suppliers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. New suppliers of any bulk drug would be required to qualify under applicable regulatory requirements and would need to have sufficient rights under applicable intellectual property laws to the method of manufacturing such ingredients. Obtaining the necessary FDA approvals or other qualifications under applicable regulatory requirements and ensuring non-infringement of third-party intellectual property rights could result in a significant interruption of supply and could require the new manufacturer to bear significant additional costs which may be passed on to us.\nWe will need to increase the size of our organization, and we may experience difficulties in managing growth.\nAs of March 15, 2015, we had eight employees and consultants, of which five are full-time employees and three are part-time employees or consultants. We will need to expand our managerial, operational, financial and other resources in order to manage our operations and clinical trials, continue our development activities and commercialize Locilex\u00ae and any other product candidates we may develop or acquire in the future. Our management and personnel, systems and facilities currently in place are not adequate to support this future growth. Our need to effectively execute our business strategy requires that we:\n\u2022 manage our clinical trials effectively, including two Phase 3 clinical trials for Locilex\u00ae. The Phase 3 clinical trials are expected to be conducted at up to 60 trial sites in the U.S. and are expected to be managed on our behalf by RRD International, LLC;\n\u2022 manage our internal development efforts effectively while carrying out our contractual obligations to licensors, contractors, collaborators, government agencies and other third parties;\n\u2022 continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures; and\n\u2022 identify, recruit, maintain, motivate and integrate additional employees in several vocational areas.\nIf we are unable to expand our managerial, operational, financial and other resources to the extent required to manage our development and commercialization activities, our business will be materially adversely affected.\nWe are exposed to product liability, non-clinical and clinical liability risks which could place a substantial financial burden upon us, should lawsuits be filed against us.\nOur business exposes us to potential product liability and other liability risks that are inherent in the testing, manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceutical formulations and products. We expect that such claims are likely to be asserted against us at some point. In addition, the use in our clinical trials of pharmaceutical formulations and products and the subsequent sale of these formulations or products by us or our potential collaborators may cause us to bear a portion of or all product liability risks. We currently have $3 million in insurance coverage relating to personal injury, product liability, medical expenses, and office premises. However, any claim under such insurance policies may be subject to certain exceptions, and may not be honored fully, in part, in a timely manner, or at all, and may not cover the full extent of liability we may actually face. Therefore, a successful liability claim or series of claims brought against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe and our management are parties to a lawsuit which, if adversely decided against, could impact our rights to Locilex\u00ae.\nIn April 2010, we acquired the worldwide rights to develop pexiganan, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Locilex\u00ae, from Genaera Liquidating Trust, which was put in place to liquidate the assets of Genaera Corporation. In June 2012, we, along with our two senior executives and several other unrelated defendants, were sued in the Federal District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania by a former shareholder of Genaera Corporation and purported to be on behalf of other Genaera Corporation shareholders, alleging, in pertinent part, that our company's acquisition of the rights to pexiganan (the active ingredient in Locilex\u00ae, and which rights included the rights to the prior formulation of Locilex\u00ae) was for what was alleged to be inadequate consideration, and as a result, it was alleged that we and our senior executives aided and abetted a breach of fiduciary duty by Genaera Corporation and the Genaera Liquidating Trust to the former shareholders of Genaera Corporation. It was also alleged that we and our senior executives aided and abetted a breach of the duty of the trustee at common law and under a certain trust agreement which was alleged to exist and which was executed by Argyce LLC (or Argyce), as trustee. The agreement called for Argyce to create the Genaera Liquidating Trust pursuant to which Argyce apparently was appointed to liquidate the assets formerly held by Genaera Corporation. One of these assets was pexiganan, which we acquired via public auction conducted by Argyce on behalf of the Genaera Liquidating Trust.\nThe case against our company and our senior executives was dismissed with prejudice by the Federal District Court, and a subsequent motion to reconsider such dismissal was denied. Prior to the dismissal there was no request or action to seek class certification by the plaintiff though it was purportedly filed on behalf of other former Genaera Corporation shareholders. Plaintiff appealed the dismissal of the suit as well as the denial of the motion to reconsider. The appeal was granted by the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit and the Third Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the decision by the Federal District Court and the case was remanded to the Federal District Court.\nUpon remand, the Federal District Court recently requested any additional briefing on the numerous other grounds for dismissal raised by the 30 defendants. Additional briefing was filed in January 2015 and March 2015, and oral argument on alternative grounds is anticipated for the second\nquarter of 2015. The Company argued that Plaintiff's claims for aiding and abetting the breaches of fiduciary duties are not properly or sufficiently plead and/or are not cognizable under Delaware law. Even if the currently pending motions to dismiss are denied, the Company intends to vigorously defend Plaintiff's claims on the factual record, which it believes will prove that the Company is not liable to Plaintiff in any regard.\nIf we were to lose such case, our rights to the prior formulation of Locilex\u00ae could be lost, which may impair the commercial viability of our product or the timeline to potential regulatory approval. If we were required to settle the case, we may lose certain rights to Locilex\u00ae or be required to pay damages, which could have a material adverse effect on our company, our business plans and results of operations.\nWe may form strategic alliances in the future with respect to our Locilex\u00ae development program and we may not realize the benefits of such alliances.\nWe may form one or more strategic alliances, create joint ventures or collaborations or enter into licensing arrangements with one or more third parties with respect to our Locilex\u00ae drug development program that we believe will complement or augment our existing business. For example, we may attempt to find a partner for licensing, development and/or commercialization of Locilex\u00ae in one or more Asian territories, or other unpartnered areas of the world. We routinely engage, and are engaged, in partnering discussions with a range of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and could enter into new collaborations at any time. We face significant competition in seeking appropriate strategic partners, and the negotiation process to secure appropriate terms is time-consuming and complex. Any delays in identifying suitable development partners and entering into agreements to develop our product candidates could also delay the commercialization of our product candidates, which may reduce their competitiveness even if they reach the market.\nIn addition, we may be unable to establish such a strategic partnership for any future product candidates and programs on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. This may be because our product candidates and programs may be deemed to be at too early of a stage of development for collaborative effort, our research and development pipeline may be viewed as insufficient, and/or third parties may not view our product candidates and programs as having sufficient potential for commercialization for several reasons including, but not limited to, lack of patent protections outside the U.S. Even if we are able to enter into a strategic alliance or license arrangement with one or more third parties, there is a risk that the collaboration will not achieve any measure of success, or that any future partner will commit sufficient resources to the development, regulatory approval, and commercialization effort for such products, or that such alliances will result in us achieving revenues that justify such transactions.\nTrends toward managed healthcare and downward price pressures on medical products and services may limit our ability to profitably sell Locilex\u00ae or other product candidates we may develop or acquire in the future.\nLower prices for pharmaceutical products may result from:\n\u2022 third-party payors' increasing challenges to the prices charged for medical products and services;\n\u2022 the trend toward managed healthcare in the U.S. and the concurrent growth of HMOs and similar organizations that can control or significantly influence the purchase of healthcare services and products; and\n\u2022 legislative proposals to reform healthcare or reduce government insurance programs.\nThe cost containment measures that healthcare providers are instituting, including practice protocols and guidelines and clinical pathways, and the effect of any healthcare reform, could limit our ability to profitably sell Locilex\u00ae or any other products that we may develop or acquire which obtain FDA approval. Moreover, any future legislation or regulation, if any, relating to the healthcare industry\nor third-party coverage and reimbursement, may adverse impact our ability to generate sales revenue and cause our business to suffer.\nWe will compete with larger and better capitalized companies, and competitors in the drug development or pharmaceutical industries may develop competing products which outperform or supplant Locilex\u00ae.\nCompetition in the worldwide pharmaceutical industry, including the sector for antibiotic agents that we will operate in, is intense. Pharmaceutical companies and/or other technology companies have developed (and are currently marketing in competition with us), have sought to develop and may in the future seek to develop or acquire and market other products that may successfully treat skin or wound infections in superficial wounds which do and may compete with Locilex\u00ae. Competitors have developed and may in the future develop similar or different products which may become more accepted by the marketplace or which may supplant Locilex\u00ae entirely. In addition, many of our current competitors are, and future competitors may be, significantly larger and better financed than we are, thus giving them a significant advantage. With respect to Mild, Moderate or Severe DFI specifically, such competitors include very large international organizations such as Pfizer, Inc., Eli Lilly and Company, Johnson & Johnson and GlaxoSmithKline plc. We may be unable to respond to competitive forces presently in the marketplace (including competition from larger companies), which would severely impact our business.\nIf ultimate users of Locilex\u00ae or any other product candidates we may develop or acquire in the future are unable to obtain adequate reimbursement from third-party payors, or if new restrictive legislation is adopted, market acceptance of our proposed products may be limited and we may not achieve material revenues.\nThe continuing efforts of government and insurance companies, health maintenance organizations and other payors of healthcare costs to contain or reduce costs of healthcare may affect our future revenues and profitability, and the future revenues and profitability of our potential customers, suppliers and collaborative partners and the availability of capital. For example, in the U.S., given recent federal and state government initiatives directed at lowering the total cost of healthcare, the U.S. Congress and state legislatures will likely continue to focus on healthcare reform, the cost of prescription pharmaceuticals and on the reform of the Medicare and Medicaid systems. While we cannot predict whether any such legislative or regulatory proposals will be adopted, the announcement or adoption of such proposals and related laws, rules and regulations could materially harm our business, financial conditions results of operations or stock price. Moreover, the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in 2010, and efforts to amend or repeal such law, has created significant uncertainty relating to the scope of government regulation of healthcare and related legal and regulatory requirements, which could have an adverse impact on sales of our products.\nIn addition, our ability to commercialize Locilex\u00ae or any future product candidates will depend in part on the extent to which appropriate reimbursement levels for the cost of such products and related treatments are adopted by third party payors, such as by governmental health programs, private health insurers and other organizations, such as HMOs. Consumers and third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for drugs and healthcare services.\nEven if we obtain FDA approval of Locilex\u00ae, or any other product candidate we may develop or acquire in the future, we may never obtain approval or commercialize our products outside of the U.S., which would limit our ability to realize their full market potential. If foreign approval is obtained, there are risks in conducting business in international markets.\nIn order to market Locilex\u00ae or any other products we may develop or acquire outside of the U.S., we must establish and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy. Clinical trials conducted in one country may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other countries, and regulatory approval in one country does not mean that regulatory approval will be obtained in any other country. Approval procedures vary among countries\nand can involve additional product testing and validation and additional administrative review periods. Seeking foreign regulatory approvals could result in significant delays, difficulties and costs for us and require additional preclinical studies or clinical trials which would be costly and time consuming. Regulatory requirements can vary widely from country to country and could delay or prevent the introduction of Locilex\u00ae or any future products in those countries. Satisfying these and other regulatory requirements is costly, time consuming, uncertain and subject to unanticipated delays. In addition, our failure to obtain regulatory approval in the U.S. or any foreign country may delay or have negative effects on the process for regulatory approval in other countries. We do not have any product candidates approved for sale in the U.S. or any foreign country and we do not have experience as a company in obtaining regulatory approval in international markets. If we fail to comply with regulatory requirements in a foreign country or to obtain and maintain required approvals, our potential market for Locilex\u00ae or other products will be reduced and our ability to realize the full market potential of our products will be harmed.\nIf approved for commercialization in a foreign country, we intend to enter into agreements with third parties to market Locilex\u00ae whenever it may be approved and wherever we have the right to market it. Consequently, we expect that we will be subject to additional risks relating to entering into international business relationships, including:\n\u2022 lack of adequate protection from intellectual property rights in foreign countries, which could occur if we do not have issued patents in force in such foreign countries covering our products, their methods of use and methods of manufacture;\n\u2022 the potential for so-called parallel importing, which is what happens when a local seller, faced with high or higher local prices (for instance, because the goods have patent protection in such country), opts to import goods from a foreign market (with low or lower prices) rather than buy them locally;\n\u2022 unexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers and regulatory requirements;\n\u2022 economic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets;\n\u2022 compliance with laws for employees traveling abroad;\n\u2022 foreign taxes, including withholding of payroll taxes;\n\u2022 foreign currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenues;\n\u2022 workforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the U.S.;\n\u2022 production shortages resulting from any events affecting the API and/or finished drug product supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad;\n\u2022 business interruptions resulting from geo-political actions, including war and terrorism, or natural disasters including earthquakes, typhoons, floods and fires; and\n\u2022 failure to comply with Office of Foreign Asset Control rules and regulations and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.\nThese and other risks may materially adversely affect our ability to attain or sustain revenue from international markets.\nFailure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to safeguard our assets and provide reliable financial reports. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports, our operating results could be harmed. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.\nWhile we continue to evaluate and improve our internal controls, we are a small company with limited staff, and we cannot be certain that the measures we implement will ensure that we design, undertake and maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations.\nFailure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a material adverse effect on our stock price. In addition, if our efforts to comply with new or changed laws, regulations, and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be harmed.\nOur internal computer systems, or those of our contract research organization and other key vendors or consultants, may fail or suffer security breaches, which could result in a material disruption of our product development program.\nOur internal computer systems and those of our contract research organization and other key vendors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. While we have not experienced any such system failure, accident or security breach to date, if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our programs. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed or ongoing clinical trials for Locilex\u00ae could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss of or damage to our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and the further development of Locilex\u00ae could be delayed.\nOur employees and consultants may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements.\nWe are exposed to the risk of employee or consultant fraud or other misconduct. Misconduct by our employees or consultants could include intentional failures to comply with FDA regulations, provide accurate information to the FDA, comply with manufacturing standards, comply with federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations, report financial information or data accurately or disclose unauthorized activities to us. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Employee and consultant misconduct could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. It is not always possible to identify and deter such misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental\ninvestigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions.\nBusiness disruptions could seriously harm our future revenues and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses.\nOur operations could be subject to earthquakes, power shortages, telecommunications failures, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics and other natural or manmade disasters or business interruptions. The occurrence of any of these business disruptions could seriously harm our operations and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses.\nWe may engage in strategic transactions that could impact our liquidity, increase our expenses and present significant distractions to our management.\nFrom time to time, we may consider strategic transactions, such as acquisitions of companies, asset purchases, and out-licensing or in-licensing of products, product candidates or technologies. Additional potential transactions that we may consider include a variety of different business arrangements, including spin-offs, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, restructurings, divestitures, business combinations and investments. Any such transaction may require us to incur non-recurring or other charges, may increase our near- and long-term expenditures and may pose significant integration challenges or disrupt our management or business, which could adversely affect our operations and financial results. For example, these transactions may entail numerous operational and financial risks, including:\n\u2022 exposure to unknown liabilities;\n\u2022 disruption of our business and diversion of our management's time and attention in order to develop acquired products, product candidates or technologies;\n\u2022 incurrence of substantial debt or dilutive issuances of equity securities to pay for acquisitions;\n\u2022 higher-than-expected acquisition and integration costs;\n\u2022 write-downs of assets or goodwill or impairment charges;\n\u2022 increased amortization expenses;\n\u2022 difficulty and cost in combining the operations and personnel of any acquired businesses with our operations and personnel;\n\u2022 impairment of relationships with key suppliers or customers of any acquired businesses due to changes in management and ownership; and\n\u2022 inability to retain key employees of any acquired businesses.\nAccordingly, although there can be no assurance that we will undertake or successfully complete any transactions of the nature described above, any transactions that we do complete may be subject to the foregoing or other risks, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nRisks Relating to Our Intellectual Property\nOur ability to achieve commercial success depends to a material extent on our ability to maintain adequate intellectual property protection for our products and technology. If we are unable to obtain and maintain adequate intellectual property rights for Locilex\u00ae, it may materially and adversely affect our ability to market and generate sales of the product.\nDue to the exclusivity that intellectual property protection can afford, our commercial success depends to a material extent on our ability to obtain and maintain adequate intellectual property protection for Locilex\u00ae (and any other products we may develop in the future) in the U.S. and other countries. As of June 1, 2014, our patent estate included a U.S. patent (U.S. Patent No. 8,530,409), which has corresponding applications pending before the United States Patent and Trademark Office (or USPTO) and Patent Cooperation Treaty (or PCT). We also have an exclusive sublicense from Scripps Research Institute (or Scripps) , the inventor of the pexiganan technology, to a U.S. patent (U.S. Patent No. 5,912,231), directed to pexiganan, the API used in Locilex\u00ae. We consider our U.S. Patent No. 8,530,409, which relates to our new, proprietary formulation of Locilex\u00ae and methods of using it to treat skin or wound infection, to be particularly important to our company primarily due to its substantially longer patent term coverage, its novel attributes as a topical formulation, its potentially broader scope of coverage and its opportunity for foreign patent protection. While we currently have pending a foreign PCT application corresponding to U.S. Patent No. 8,530,409, no assurance can be given that any foreign patents will issue, or that even if any such patents were to issue, such patents would provide meaningful protection for Locilex\u00ae.\nOur patent estate related to Locilex\u00ae is critical to our commercial viability. There is a risk that our pending patent applications may not result in issued patents, and that any of our issued patents will not include claims that are sufficiently broad to provide adequate protection for Locilex\u00ae, including meaningful protection from our competitors. Additionally, the success of an application for the patent term extension of our licensed patent will require the cooperation of the licensor, which cooperation cannot be guaranteed. We will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that Locilex\u00ae (and any other products we may develop in the future) is covered by valid and enforceable patents that are of sufficient scope to effectively prevent competitive products or are effectively maintained as trade secrets within our organization. If third parties disclose or misappropriate or design around our proprietary rights, it may materially and adversely impact our position in the market.\nWe apply for patents covering both our technologies and product candidates, as we deem appropriate. However, we may fail to apply for patents on important technologies or improvements in our technologies in a timely fashion, or at all. Our existing patents and any future patents we obtain may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from using our technologies or from developing competing products and technologies. Moreover, the patent positions of numerous biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies are highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles remain unresolved. As a result, the validity and enforceability of our patents cannot be predicted with certainty. In addition, no assurances can be given that:\n\u2022 we were the first to make the inventions covered by each of our issued patents and pending patent applications;\n\u2022 we were the first to file patent applications for these inventions;\n\u2022 others will not independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies by inventing around our claims;\n\u2022 a third party will not challenge our proprietary rights, and if challenged that a court will hold that our patents are valid and enforceable;\n\u2022 any patents issued to us or our collaboration partners will cover our product as ultimately developed, or provide us with any competitive advantages, or will not be challenged by third parties;\n\u2022 we will develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable; or\n\u2022 the patents of others will not have an adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition, there are numerous recent changes to the patent laws and proposed changes to the rules of the USPTO which may have a significant impact on our ability to protect our technology and enforce our intellectual property rights. For example, on September 16, 2011, President Obama signed the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act which codifies several significant changes to the U.S. patent laws, including, among other things, changing from a \"first to invent' to a \"first inventor to file\" system, limiting where a patentee may file a patent suit, eventually eliminating interference proceedings while maintaining derivation actions, and creating a set of procedures to challenge patents in the USPTO after they have issued. The effects of these changes are currently uncertain as the USPTO has just implemented regulations related to these changes and the courts have yet to address many of these provisions in the context of a dispute. Furthermore, we have not assessed the applicability of the act and new regulations on the specific patents discussed herein. The U.S. Supreme Court has also issued decisions, the full impact of which is not yet known. For example, on March 20, 2012 in Mayo Collaborative Services, DBA Mayo Medical Laboratories, et al. v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc., the Court held that several claims drawn to measuring drug metabolite levels from patient samples and correlating them to drug doses were not patentable subject matter. The decision appears to impact diagnostics patents that merely apply a law of nature via a series of routine steps and it has created uncertainty around the ability to patent certain biomarker-related method claims. Additionally, on June 13, 2013 in Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc., the Court held that claims to isolated genomic DNA are not patentable, but claims to complementary DNA (or cDNA) molecules were held to be valid. The effect of the decision on patents for other isolated natural products is uncertain.\nWe are dependent on a third party to maintain the patent exclusivity for the API in Locilex\u00ae.\nWe hold an exclusive, worldwide sublicense to the composition-of-matter patent, U.S. Patent No. 5,912,231, which expires in June 2016, excluding any patent term restoration that we may seek under the Hatch-Waxman Act. Our rights to practice the pexiganan technology are derived through a license agreement between Scripps and Multiple Peptide Systems Inc. (or MPS). MPS subsequently sublicensed the pexiganan technology to the prior sponsor of the pexiganan clinical and regulatory program. On October 1, 1996, both the license agreement and sublicense agreement were amended by the parties to confirm that the license and sublicense were fully-paid and royalty-free with no further economic obligations for the practice of the pexiganan technology.\nWe will need to enlist the cooperation of Scripps should we decide to apply for a five-year patent term extension of U.S. Patent No. 5,912,231 under the Hatch Waxman Act, and such cooperation is not guaranteed. Although U.S. Patent 5,912,231 supplements our existing intellectual property portfolio, we are chiefly reliant on our U.S. Patent 8,530,409, which covers the novel formulation and method of use for Locilex\u00ae and provides for substantially longer patent coverage (until June 2032) than U.S. Patent 5,912,231. As such, we have not yet engaged in any discussions with Scripps regarding a possible patent term extension for U.S. Patent No. 5,912,231 and a patent term extension is filed only after regulatory approval. If and when we decide to apply for an extension, we will bear the costs of preparing and filing the application, but Scripps, as the owner of U.S. Patent No. 5,912,231, will submit the application. Accordingly, we will need to work with Scripps throughout the application process to facilitate its approval. An inability to extend the patent past 2016 may impair our competitive position\nif other companies use pexiganan as an API to develop a product that, once approved by the FDA, competes with Locilex\u00ae.\nWe may become subject to third parties' claims alleging infringement of their patents and proprietary rights or seeking to invalidate our patents or proprietary rights, or we may need to become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents, which could be costly, time consuming, delay or prevent the development and commercialization of our product candidates, or put our patents and other proprietary rights at risk.\nLitigation relating to infringement or misappropriation of patent and other intellectual property rights in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries is common. We may become subject to third-party claims in the future relating to our technologies, processes, formulations, methods, or products that would cause us to incur substantial expenses and which, if successful, could cause us to pay substantial damages and attorney's fees, if we are found to be infringing a third party's patent rights. We may also become subject to claims that we have misappropriated the trade secrets of others. These risk are exacerbated by the fact that the validity and breadth of claims covered in pharmaceutical patents is, in most instances, uncertain and highly complex. We would be particularly at risk if any such claims relate to our key U.S. Patent No. 8,530,409 covering our particular formulation of and method of use for Locilex\u00ae.\nFurthermore, if a patent infringement suit is brought against us relating to Locilex\u00ae (or any other products we may develop or acquire in the future), our research, development, manufacturing or sales activities relating to Locilex\u00ae or the product candidate that is the subject of the suit may be delayed or terminated. As a result of patent infringement claims, or in order to avoid potential infringement claims, we or our collaborators may choose to seek, or be required to seek, a license from the third party, which would be likely to include a requirement to pay license fees or royalties or both. These licenses may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Even if a license can be obtained on acceptable terms, the rights may be nonexclusive, which would give our competitors access to the same intellectual property rights. If we are unable to enter into a license on acceptable terms, we or our collaborators could be prevented from commercializing Locilex\u00ae (or any other products we may develop or acquire in the future), or forced to modify such product candidates, or to cease some aspect of our business operations, which could harm our business significantly.\nIn addition, competitors may infringe our patents, or misappropriate or violate our other intellectual property rights. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may find it necessary to file infringement or other claims to protect our intellectual property rights. In addition, in any infringement proceeding brought by us against a third party to enforce our rights, a court may decide that a patent of ours is invalid or unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the basis that our patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any such litigation proceeding could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly, which could open us up to additional competition and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe cost to us of any patent litigation or other proceedings, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce our resources available for development activities. We may not have sufficient financial or other resources to adequately conduct such litigation or proceedings, and such litigation could impair our ability to raise funding for our company. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their substantially greater financial resources. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments, and, if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, there could be a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace. Patent\nlitigation and other proceedings may also require significant time and attention of management and technical staff, which may materially and adversely impact our financial position and results of operations. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with any intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation.\nAs a result of any such litigation, we may also be required to: (i) cease selling, making, importing, incorporating or using one or more or all of our products that incorporate intellectual property of others, which would adversely affect our revenue; or (ii) redesign our products, which would be costly and time-consuming.\nRestrictions on our patent rights relating to Locilex\u00ae may limit our ability to prevent third parties from competing against us.\nAssuming FDA approval, our ability to market and sell Locilex\u00ae will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection for Locilex\u00ae (or any products we may develop in the future), preserve our trade secrets, prevent third parties from infringing upon our proprietary rights and operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others. The U.S. patent that we sublicense from Scripps (U.S. Patent No. 5,912,231), which is directed to the composition of matter of pexiganan, expires in 2016. The foreign patents corresponding to U.S. Patent No. 5,912,231 expired in 2009. As a result, we have no foreign patent protection for the pexiganan API. We have recently been issued a U.S. patent, U.S. Patent No. 8,530,409, covering our new formulation of Locilex\u00ae as well as a method of using this new formulation to treat skin or wound infections. The U.S. Patent No. 8,530,409 claims are directed to very specific formulations of the pexiganan API, and their methods of use to treat skin or wound infections. As a result, U.S. Patent No. 8,530,409 would not prevent third party competitors from creating, making and marketing alternative formulations of pexiganan, including topical formulations, that fall outside the scope of the U.S. Patent No. 8,530,409 claims. There can be no assurance that any such alternative formulations will not be equally effective as Locilex\u00ae. Introduction of any such competitive product could have a material adverse effect on sales of Locilex\u00ae. Moreover, even if these competitors do not actively promote their product for our targeted indication, physicians may prescribe these products \"off-label.\" Although off-label prescriptions may infringe or contribute to the infringement of method-of-use patents, the practice is common and such infringement is difficult to prevent or prosecute.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents on Locilex\u00ae or any product candidates we may develop or acquire in the future throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and furthermore, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but where enforcement is not as strong as that in the U.S. These products may compete with our future products in jurisdictions where we do not have any issued patents and our patent claims or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from so competing.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biopharmaceuticals, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial cost and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nThe USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other provisions during the patent process. There are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, competitors might be able to enter the market earlier than would otherwise have been the case.\nIf our Locilex\u00ae trademark is not adequately protected, then we may not be able to build name recognition in our markets of interest and our business may be adversely affected.\nOur registered trademark, Locilex\u00ae, may be challenged, infringed, circumvented or declared generic or determined to be infringing on other marks. We may not be able to protect our rights to this trademark, which we need to build name recognition by potential partners or customers in our markets of interest. Over the long term, if we are unable to establish name recognition based on our trademark, then we may not be able to compete effectively and our business may be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed.\nIn addition to seeking patent protection for Locilex\u00ae, we also rely on trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary information, to maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect these trade secrets, in part, by entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to them, such as our employees, corporate collaborators, outside scientific collaborators, contract manufacturers, consultants, advisors and other third parties. We also enter into confidentiality and invention or patent assignment agreements with our employees and consultants that obligate them to assign their inventions to us. Despite these efforts, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the U.S., including in foreign jurisdictions, are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent them from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to or independently developed by competitor, our competitive position would be harmed.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock may be highly volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nThe trading price of our common stock is likely to be volatile. This volatility may prevent you from being able to sell your shares at or above the price you paid for your shares. Our stock price could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors, which include:\n\u2022 any adverse results or delays in commencement or completion of our planned Phase 3 clinical trials for Locilex\u00ae;\n\u2022 any adverse results or delays in the commencement or completion of our planned Phase 1 clinical trials for Locilex\u00ae;\n\u2022 any delay in preparing or filing our NDA for Locilex\u00ae and any adverse development or perceived adverse development with respect to the FDA's review of the NDA, including without limitation the FDA's issuance of a \"refusal to file\" letter or a request for additional information;\n\u2022 changes in laws or regulations applicable to Locilex\u00ae or any future product candidates, including but not limited to clinical trial requirements for approvals;\n\u2022 unanticipated serious safety concerns related to the use of Locilex\u00ae or any future product candidates;\n\u2022 a decision to initiate a clinical trial, not to initiate a clinical trial or to terminate an existing clinical trial;\n\u2022 our inability to obtain adequate product supply for Locilex\u00ae or any future product candidate, or the inability to do so at acceptable prices;\n\u2022 adverse regulatory decisions;\n\u2022 the introduction of new products or technologies offered by us or our competitors;\n\u2022 the effectiveness of our or our potential partners' commercialization efforts;\n\u2022 the inability to effectively manage our growth;\n\u2022 actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results;\n\u2022 our failure to meet or exceed the estimates and projections of the investment community;\n\u2022 the perception of the pharmaceutical industry by the public, legislatures, regulators and the investment community;\n\u2022 the overall performance of the U.S. equity markets and general political and economic conditions;\n\u2022 developments concerning our sources of manufacturing supply and any commercialization partners;\n\u2022 announcements of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by us or our competitors;\n\u2022 disputes or other developments relating to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters and our ability to obtain patent protection for our technologies;\n\u2022 additions or departures of key scientific or other consultants or management personnel;\n\u2022 adverse market reaction to any indebtedness we may incur or securities we may issue in the future;\n\u2022 sales of our common stock by our stockholders in the future;\n\u2022 significant lawsuits, including patent or stockholder litigation;\n\u2022 changes in the market valuations of similar companies;\n\u2022 the trading volume of our common stock;\n\u2022 effects of natural or man-made catastrophic events or other business interruptions; and\n\u2022 other events or factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and the stock of biotechnology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. Broad market and industry factors\nmay negatively affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.\nOur failure to meet the continued listing requirements of The NASDAQ Capital Market could result in a de-listing of our stock, which could limit investors' ability to make transactions in our securities and subject us to additional trading restrictions.\nOur common stock is listed on The NASDAQ Capital Market, a national securities exchange. If we fail to satisfy the continued listing requirements of The NASDAQ Capital Market, such as the corporate governance requirements or the minimum closing bid price requirement, the NASDAQ Stock Market (or NASDAQ) may take steps to de-list our common stock. Such a de-listing would likely have a negative effect on the price of our common stock and would impair your ability to sell or purchase our common stock when you wish to do so. In the event of a de-listing, we would take actions to restore our compliance with NASDAQ's listing requirements, but we can provide no assurance that any such action taken by us would allow our common stock to become listed again, stabilize the market price or improve the liquidity of our common stock, prevent our common stock from dropping below the NASDAQ minimum bid price requirement or prevent future non-compliance with NASDAQ's listing requirements.\nIf The NASDAQ Capital Market does not maintain the listing of our securities for trading on its exchange, we could face significant material adverse consequences, including:\n\u2022 a limited availability of market quotations for our securities;\n\u2022 reduced liquidity with respect to our securities;\n\u2022 a determination that our shares of common stock are \"penny stock\" which will require brokers trading in our shares of common stock to adhere to more stringent rules, possibly resulting in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our shares of common stock;\n\u2022 a limited amount of news and analyst coverage for our company; and\n\u2022 a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nThe National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996, which is a federal statute, prevents or preempts the states from regulating the sale of certain securities, which are referred to as \"covered securities.\" For as long as our common stock is listed on The NASDAQ Capital Market, our common stock will be covered securities. Although the states are preempted from regulating the sale of our securities, the federal statute does allow the states to investigate companies if there is a suspicion of fraud, and, if there is a finding of fraudulent activity, then the states can regulate or bar the sale of covered securities in a particular case. Furthermore, if we were no longer listed on The NASDAQ Capital Market, our common stock would not be covered securities and we would be subject to regulation in each state in which we offer our securities.\nIf our shares become subject to the penny stock rules, it would become more difficult to trade our shares.\nThe Commission has adopted rules that regulate broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks. Penny stocks are generally equity securities with a price of less than $5.00, other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or authorized for quotation on certain automated quotation systems, provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange or system. If we do not retain a listing on The NASDAQ Capital Market and if the price of our common stock is less than $5.00, our common stock will be deemed a penny stock. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, before a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure\ndocument containing specified information. In addition, the penny stock rules require that before effecting any transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, a broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive (i) the purchaser's written acknowledgment of the receipt of a risk disclosure statement; (ii) a written agreement to transactions involving penny stocks; and (iii) a signed and dated copy of a written suitability statement. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the trading activity in the secondary market for our common stock, and therefore stockholders may have difficulty selling their shares.\nThere can be no assurance that we will ever provide liquidity to our investors through a sale of our company.\nWhile acquisitions of pharmaceutical companies like ours are not uncommon, potential investors are cautioned that no assurances can be given that any form of merger, combination, or sale of our company will take place, or that any merger, combination, or sale, even if consummated, would provide liquidity or a profit for our investors. You should not invest in our company with the expectation that we will be able to sell the business in order to provide liquidity or a profit for our investors.\nThe financial and operational projections that we may make from time to time are subject to inherent risks.\nThe projections that we provide herein or our management may provide from time to time (including, but not limited to, those relating to potential peak sales amounts, clinical and regulatory timelines, production and supply matters, commercial launch dates, and other financial or operational matters) reflect numerous assumptions made by management, including assumptions with respect to our specific as well as general business, regulatory, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. Accordingly, there is a risk that the assumptions made in preparing the projections, or the projections themselves, will prove inaccurate. There may be differences between actual and projected results, and actual results may be materially different from those contained in the projections. The inclusion of the projections in this report should not be regarded as an indication that we, our management, the underwriters or their respective representatives considered or consider the projections to be a guaranteed prediction of future events, and the projections should not be relied upon as such.\nMessrs. Luci and DeLuccia hold a significant concentration of our common stock, which could limit the ability of our other stockholders to influence the direction of our company.\nAs calculated by the Commision rules of beneficial ownership, David P. Luci and Robert J. DeLuccia, each executive officers and directors of our company, each own approximately 21.4% of our outstanding common stock as of March 15, 2015. Accordingly, they collectively may have the ability to significantly influence or determine the election of all of our directors or the outcome of most corporate actions requiring stockholder approval such as: (i) a merger or a sale of our company, (ii) a sale of all or substantially all of our assets, and (iii) amendments to our articles of incorporation and bylaws. This concentration of voting power and control could have a significant effect in delaying, deferring or preventing an action that might otherwise be beneficial to our other stockholders and be disadvantageous to our stockholders with interests different from those individuals. These individuals also have significant control over our business as officers and directors of our company. There is a risk that they may exercise this ability in a manner that advances their best interests and not necessarily those of our other stockholders.\nWe incur significant increased costs as a result of operating as a public company and our management is required to devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as rules subsequently implemented by the\nCommission and NASDAQ, has imposed various requirements on public companies. Our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, compliance with these rules and regulations have increased our legal, accounting and financial compliance costs substantially. In addition, these rules and regulations may make our activities related to legal, accounting and financial compliance more difficult, time-consuming and costly and may also place undue strain on our personnel, systems and resources. If these requirements divert the attention of our management and personnel from other business concerns, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, we expect these rules and regulations to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to incur substantial costs to maintain our current levels of such coverage. We estimate the additional costs we may incur to respond to these requirements to range from $500,000 to $1.0 million annually, although unforeseen circumstances could increase actual costs.\nAn investment in our company may involve tax implications, and you are encouraged to consult your own advisors as neither we nor any related party is offering any tax assurances or guidance regarding our company or your investment.\nThe formation of our company and our financings, as well as an investment in our company generally, involves complex federal, state and local income tax considerations. Neither the Internal Revenue Service nor any State or local taxing authority has reviewed the transactions described herein, and may take different positions than the ones contemplated by management. You are strongly urged to consult your own tax and other advisors prior to investing, as neither we nor any of our officers, directors or related parties is offering you tax or similar advice, nor are any such persons making any representations and warrants regarding such matters.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carry-forwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nUnder Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, referred to as the Internal Revenue Code, if a corporation undergoes an \"ownership change\" (generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period), the corporation's ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carry-forwards and other pre-change tax attributes (such as research tax credits) to offset its post-change income may be limited. We believe that, with our recent IPO, taken together with our private placements within a three-year period and other transactions that have occurred over the past three years, we may have triggered an \"ownership change\" limitation. We may also experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership, including as a result of the completion of our recent IPO when it is taken together with other transactions we may consummate in the succeeding three-year period. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carry-forwards to offset U.S. federal taxable income may be subject to limitations, which potentially could result in increased future tax liability to us.\nAs an \"emerging growth company\" under applicable law, we will be subject to lessened disclosure requirements, which could leave our stockholders without information or rights available to stockholders of more mature companies.\nFor as long as we remain an \"emerging growth company\" as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (which we refer to herein as the JOBS Act), we have elected to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \"emerging growth companies\" including, but not limited to:\n\u2022 not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;\n\u2022 taking advantage of an extension of time to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards;\n\u2022 reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements; and\n\u2022 exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\nWe expect to take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an \"emerging growth company.\" Because of these lessened regulatory requirements, our stockholders would be left without information or rights available to stockholders of more mature companies.\nBecause we have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards for an \"emerging growth company\" our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.\nWe have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act. This election allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates, and thus investors may have difficulty evaluating or comparing our business, performance or prospects in comparison to other public companies, which may have a negative impact on the value and liquidity of our common stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about us, our business or our market, or if they change their recommendations regarding our common stock adversely, the price of our common stock and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock may be influenced by the research and reports that securities or industry analysts may publish about us, our business, our market or our competitors. If any of the analysts who may cover us change their recommendation regarding our common stock adversely, or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors, the price of our common stock would likely decline. If any analyst who may cover us was to cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause the price of our common stock or trading volume to decline.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company and may affect the trading price of our common stock.\nAs of the completion of our corporate conversion on March 12, 2014, we are a Delaware corporation. The anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder, even if a change in control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a change in our management or control over us that stockholders may consider favorable. Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws:\n\u2022 provide that vacancies on our board of directors, including newly created directorships, may be filled only by a majority vote of directors then in office;\n\u2022 not provide stockholders with the ability to take action by written consent;\n\u2022 provide that special meetings of stockholders may only be called by our Chairman and/or President, our board of directors or a super-majority (662/3%) of our stockholders;\n\u2022 place restrictive requirements (including advance notification of stockholder nominations and proposals) on how special meetings of stockholders may be called by our stockholders;\n\u2022 not provide stockholders with the ability to cumulate their votes; and\n\u2022 provide that only a super-majority of our stockholders (662/3%) may amend our bylaws.\nWe do not expect to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe do not expect to pay dividends on our common stock offered in this transaction for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, any potential investor who anticipates the need for current dividends should not purchase our securities.", "PERMNO": 14538, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "PLXP"}
