Risk Factors\nWe are subject to various risks and uncertainties in the course of our business. The following summarizes significant risks and uncertainties that may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. When considering an investment in our common stock, you should carefully consider the risk factors included below as well as those matters referenced in this report under \u201cCautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and other information included and incorporated by reference into this report.\nOil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices are volatile. The continuing and extended decline in oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices since 2014 has adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our business, financial condition and results of operations and may in the future affect our ability to meet our capital expenditure obligations and financial commitments as well as negatively impact our stock price further.\nThe prices we receive for our oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids production heavily influence our revenue, profitability, access to capital and future rate of growth. Oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids are commodities, and therefore, their prices are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand. Historically, the market for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids has been volatile, and this volatility exhibited a negative trend in the second half of 2014 which has continued through 2015 and into the first quarter of 2016. This market will likely continue to be volatile in the future. The prices we receive for our production, and the levels of our production, depend on numerous factors beyond our control. These factors include:\n\u00b7\nworldwide and regional economic and financial conditions impacting the global supply and demand for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids;\n\u00b7\nthe level of global oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids exploration and production;\n\u00b7\nthe level of global oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids supplies, in particular due to supply growth from the United States;\n\u00b7\nforeign and domestic supply capabilities for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids;\n\u00b7\nthe price and quantity of U.S. imports and exports of oil, natural gas, including liquefied natural gas, and natural gas liquids;\n\u00b7\npolitical conditions in or affecting other oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids-producing countries, including the current conflicts in the Middle East, and conditions in South America, Africa, Ukraine and Russia;\n\u00b7\nactions of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (\u201cOPEC\u201d) and state-controlled oil companies relating to oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids production and price controls;\n\u00b7\nthe extent to which U.S. shale producers become \"swing producers\" adding or subtracting to the world supply totals of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids;\n\u00b7\nfuture regulations prohibiting or restricting our ability to apply hydraulic fracturing to our wells;\n\u00b7\ncurrent and future regulations regarding well spacing;\n\u00b7\nprevailing prices on local oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids price indexes in the areas in which we operate;\n\u00b7\nlocalized and global supply and demand fundamentals and transportation availability;\n\u00b7\nweather conditions;\n\u00b7\ntechnological advances affecting energy consumption;\n\u00b7\nthe price and availability of alternative fuels; and\n\u00b7\ndomestic, local and foreign governmental regulation and taxes.\nLower oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices have and will continue to reduce our cash flows and borrowing ability. We may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms, which could lead to a decline in our oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids reserves as existing reserves are depleted. A continuing decrease in oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices could render uneconomic an even larger portion of our exploration, development and exploitation projects. This has already resulted in us having to make significant downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves, and we may need to make further downward adjustments in the future. Furthermore, under our credit agreement providing for a senior secured revolving credit facility (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d) with BOKF, NA dba Bank of Texas (\u201cBank of Texas\u201d), as agent and lead arranger, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (\u201cWells Fargo\u201d), as syndication agent, and the Lenders signatory thereto (collectively with Bank of Texas and Wells Fargo, the \u201cLender\u201d), our initial borrowing base is subject to redetermination during May and November of each year, and the Lender has the right to call for an interim determination of the borrowing base under the specified circumstances. We expect that the extended\ndecline in oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices will adversely impact our borrowing base in future borrowing base redeterminations, which could trigger repayment obligations under our senior secured revolving credit facility to the extent our outstanding loans under it exceed the redetermined borrowing base and otherwise materially and adversely affect our future business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or ability to finance planned capital expenditures. In addition, lower oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids gas prices may cause a further decline in the price of our common stock.\nAs a result of the sustained decrease in prices for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids, we have taken and may be required to take further write-downs of the carrying values of our properties.\nAccounting rules require that we periodically review the carrying value of our properties for possible impairment. Based on prevailing commodity prices and specific market factors and circumstances at the time of prospective impairment reviews, and the continuing evaluation of development plans, production data, economics and other factors, we have been required to, and may be required to further, write-down the carrying value of our properties. A write-down constitutes a non-cash charge to earnings.\nOil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices have significantly declined since mid-2014 and have remained low in the first-quarter of 2016. Primarily as a result of these lower prices, our December 31, 2015 estimated proved reserves decreased 9,618 MBOE from our December 31, 2014 reserves. If prices remain at or below current levels and all other factors remain the same, we will likely incur further charges in the future. Such charges could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for the periods in which they are taken. See Note 5 Asset Impairments to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information.\nAny significant reduction in our borrowing base under our senior secured revolving credit facility as a result of a periodic borrowing base redetermination or otherwise may negatively impact our liquidity and, consequently, our ability to fund our operations, and we may not have sufficient funds to repay borrowings under this facility or any other obligation if required as a result of a borrowing base redetermination.\nAvailability under our senior secured revolving credit facility is currently subject to a borrowing base of $80.0 million. The borrowing base is subject to scheduled semiannual (May 1 and November 1) and other elective borrowing base redeterminations. The lenders can unilaterally adjust the borrowing base and the borrowings permitted to be outstanding under this facility. Reductions in estimates of our oil, NGLs and natural gas reserves will result in a reduction in our borrowing base (if prices are kept constant). Given the ongoing decline in commodity prices for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids, it is likely that reductions in our borrowing base could also arise from other factors, including but not limited to:\n\u00b7\nlower commodity prices or production;\n\u00b7\nincreased leverage ratios;\n\u00b7\ninability to drill or unfavorable drilling results;\n\u00b7\nchanges in oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids reserve engineering;\n\u00b7\nincreased operating and/or capital costs;\n\u00b7\nthe lenders' inability to agree to an adequate borrowing base; or\n\u00b7\nadverse changes in the lenders' practices (including required regulatory changes) regarding estimation of reserves.\nAs of March 9, 2016, we had $11.2 million of borrowings outstanding under our senior secured revolving credit facility. We may make further borrowings under our facility in the future. Any significant reduction in our borrowing base as a result of such borrowing base redeterminations or otherwise will negatively impact our liquidity and our ability to fund our operations and, as a result, would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operation and cash flows. Further, if the outstanding borrowings under the facility were to exceed the borrowing base as a result of any such redetermination, we could be required to repay the excess. We may not have sufficient funds to make such repayments. If we do not have sufficient funds and we are otherwise unable to negotiate renewals of our borrowings or arrange new financing, we may have to sell significant assets. Any such sale could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nUnless we replace our reserves, our reserves and production will decline, which would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nProducing oil and natural gas reservoirs generally are characterized by declining production rates that vary depending upon reservoir characteristics and other factors. Decline rates are typically greatest early in the productive life of a well, particularly horizontal wells. Estimates of the decline rate of an oil or natural gas well are inherently imprecise, and are less precise with respect to new or emerging oil and natural gas formations with limited production histories than for more developed formations with established production histories. Our production levels and the reserves that we currently expect to recover from our wells will change if production from our\nexisting wells declines in a different manner than we have estimated and can change under other circumstances. Thus, our future oil and natural gas reserves and production and, therefore, our cash flows and results of operations are highly dependent upon our success in efficiently developing and exploiting our current properties and economically finding or acquiring additional recoverable reserves. We may not be able to develop, find or acquire additional reserves to replace our current and future production at acceptable costs. If we are unable to replace our current and future production, our cash flows and the value of our reserves may decrease, adversely affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nEstimates of proved oil and natural gas reserves involve assumptions and any material inaccuracies in these assumptions will materially affect the quantities and the value of our reserves.\nThis report contains estimates of our proved oil and natural gas reserves. These estimates are based upon various assumptions, including assumptions required by the SEC relating to oil and natural gas prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. The process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is complex. This process requires significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data for each reservoir. Therefore, these estimates are inherently imprecise.\nActual future production, oil and natural gas prices, revenues, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves will vary from those estimated. Any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and the value of our reserves. In addition, we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history, results of exploration and development, prevailing oil and natural gas prices and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nQuantities of proved reserves are estimated based on economic conditions in existence during the period of assessment. Changes to oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices in the markets for such commodities may have the impact of shortening the economic lives of certain fields because it becomes uneconomic to produce all recoverable reserves on such fields, which reduces proved property reserves estimates. As of December 31, 2015, negative revisions of 9,484 MBOE of previously estimated proved reserve quantities are primarily attributable to 7,013 MBOE of revisions to proved undeveloped reserves. The primary driver of the revision in proved undeveloped reserves was 124 locations that were previously economic at year-end 2014 SEC prices were uneconomic at the year-end 2015 SEC prices. The remaining negative revision of 2,471 MBOE of proved reserves resulted from the combined effect of SEC prices at year-end 2015, performance and other factors that shortened the economic life of the proved reserves.\nNegative revisions in the estimated quantities of proved reserves have the effect of increasing the rates of depletion on the affected properties, which decrease earnings or result in losses through higher depletion expense. These revisions, as well as revisions in the assumptions of future cash flows of these reserves, may also trigger impairment losses on certain properties, which would result in a non-cash charge to earnings. See Note 5 Asset Impairments, to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\nAt December 31, 2015, approximately 32% of our estimated reserves were classified as proved undeveloped. Recovery of proved undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations. The reserve data assumes that we will make significant capital expenditures to develop our reserves. The estimates of these oil and natural gas reserves and the costs associated with development of these reserves have been prepared in accordance with SEC regulations; however, actual capital expenditures will likely vary from estimated capital expenditures, development may not occur as scheduled and actual results may not be as estimated.\nThe standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves will not be the same as the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves.\nYou should not assume that the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves is the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves. In accordance with SEC requirements in effect at December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we based the discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on the 12-month first-day-of-the-month oil and natural gas average prices without giving effect to derivative transactions. Actual future net cash flows from our oil and natural gas properties will be affected by factors such as:\n\u00b7\nthe actual prices we receive for oil and natural gas;\n\u00b7\nthe actual cost of development and production expenditures;\n\u00b7\nthe amount and timing of actual production; and\n\u00b7\nchanges in governmental regulations or taxation.\nThe timing of both our production and our incurrence of expenses in connection with the development and production of oil and natural gas properties will affect the timing and amount of actual future net revenues from proved reserves, and thus their actual present value. In addition, the 10% discount factor we use when calculating standardized measure may not be the most appropriate\ndiscount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and natural gas industry in general. As a corporation, we are treated as a taxable entity for federal income tax purposes and our future income taxes will be dependent on our future taxable income. Actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the present value estimates included in this report which would could have a material effect on the value of our reserves.\nIf commodity prices decrease to a level such that our future undiscounted cash flows from our properties are less than their carrying value for a significant period of time, then we will be required to incur write-downs of the carrying values of our properties in addition to the significant write-down we incurred in 2015.\nAccounting rules require that we periodically review the carrying value of our properties for possible impairment. Based on specific market factors and circumstances at the time of prospective impairment reviews, and the continuing evaluation of development plans, production data, economics and other factors, we may be required to write down the carrying value of our properties. A write-down constitutes a non-cash charge to earnings. We may incur impairment charges in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for the periods in which such charges are taken.\nA write-down of the capitalized cost of individual oil and natural gas properties could occur when oil and natural gas prices are low or if we have substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves, if operating costs or development costs increase over prior estimates, or if exploratory drilling is unsuccessful. A write-down could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nThe capitalized costs of our oil and natural gas properties, on a field-by-field basis, may exceed the estimated future net cash flows of that field. If so, we will record impairment charges to reduce the capitalized costs of such field to our estimate of the field\u2019s fair market value. Unproved properties are evaluated at the lower of cost or fair market value. These types of charges will reduce our earnings and stockholders\u2019 equity.\nWe periodically assess our properties for impairment based on future estimates of proved and non-proved reserves, oil and natural gas prices, production rates and operating, development and reclamation costs based on operating budget forecasts. Once incurred, an impairment charge cannot be reversed at a later date even if we experience increases in the price of oil and/or natural gas or increases in the quantity of our estimated proved reserves.\nThe potential drilling locations for our future wells that we have tentatively internally identified will be drilled, if at all, over many years. This makes them susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of their drilling, which in certain instances could prevent production prior to the expiration date of leases for such locations.\nAlthough our management team has established certain potential drilling locations as a part of our long-range planning related to future drilling activities on our existing acreage, our ability to drill and develop these locations depends on a number of uncertainties, including oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices, the availability and cost of capital, drilling and production costs, the availability of drilling services and equipment, drilling results (including the impact of increased horizontal drilling and longer laterals), lease expirations, gathering systems, marketing and pipeline transportation constraints, regulatory approvals and other factors. Because of these uncertain factors, we cannot be certain if the numerous potential drilling locations we have currently identified will ever be drilled to a substantial degree or if we will be able to produce oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids from these or any other potential drilling locations. In addition, unless production is established within the spacing units covering the undeveloped acres on which some of the potential locations are obtained, the leases for such acreage will expire. As such, our actual drilling activities, especially in the long term, may materially differ from those presently anticipated.\nCurrently, we receive incremental cash flows as a result of our hedging activity. To the extent we are unable to obtain future hedges at attractive prices or our derivative activities are not effective, our cash flows and financial condition may be adversely impacted.\nTo achieve more predictable cash flows and reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in the prices of oil and natural gas, we enter into derivative instrument contracts for a portion of our oil and natural gas production, including swaps, collars, puts and basis swaps. In accordance with applicable accounting principles, we are required to record our derivatives at fair market value, and they are included on our consolidated balance sheet as assets or liabilities and in our consolidated statements of operations as gain (loss) on derivatives. Gain (loss) on derivatives are included in our cash flows from operating activities. Accordingly, our earnings may fluctuate significantly as a result of changes in the fair market value of our derivative instruments. Although our current hedges provide us with a benefit as they are priced above the current depressed prices for oil and natural gas, as these hedges expire, there is significant uncertainty that we will be able to put new hedges in place that will provide us with similar benefit.\nDerivative instruments also expose us to the risk of financial loss in some circumstances, including when:\n\u00b7\nproduction is less than the volume covered by the derivative instruments;\n\u00b7\nthe counter-party to the derivative instrument defaults on its contractual obligations;\n\u00b7\nthere is an increase in the differential between the underlying price in the derivative instrument and actual prices received; or\n\u00b7\nthere are issues with regard to legal enforceability of such instruments.\nFor additional information regarding our hedging activities, please see \"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe oil and gas industry is highly competitive, and our small size puts us at a disadvantage in competing for resources.\nThe oil and gas industry is highly competitive. We compete with major integrated and larger independent oil and gas companies for the acquisition of desirable oil and gas properties and leases, for the equipment and services required to develop and operate properties, and in the marketing of oil and gas to end-users. Many competitors have financial and other resources that are substantially greater than ours, which will make any acquisition of acreage or producing properties at economic prices difficult. In addition, many larger competitors may be better able to respond to factors that affect the demand for oil and natural gas production, such as changes in worldwide oil and natural gas prices and levels of production, the cost and availability of alternative fuels and the application of government regulations. Significant competition also exists in attracting and retaining technical personnel, including geologists, geophysicists, engineers, landmen and other specialists, as well as financial and administrative personnel and we may be at a competitive disadvantage to companies with larger financial resources than ours.\nA failure to complete additional acquisitions would limit our potential growth.\nOur future success is highly dependent on our ability to find, acquire or develop economically recoverable oil and natural gas reserves. Without continued successful acquisition, exploration or development projects, our current oil and natural gas reserves will decline due to continued production activities. Acquiring additional oil and natural gas properties, or businesses that own or operate such properties, when attractive opportunities arise, is an important component of our strategy. If we identify an appropriate acquisition candidate, management may be unable to negotiate mutually acceptable terms with the seller, finance the acquisition or obtain the necessary regulatory approvals. Our limited access to financial resources compared to larger, better capitalized companies may limit our ability to make future acquisitions. If we are unable to complete suitable acquisitions, it will be more difficult to replace and increase our reserves, and an inability to replace our reserves would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAcquisitions involve a number of risks, including the risk that we will discover unanticipated liabilities or other problems associated with the acquired business or property.\nIn assessing potential acquisitions, we will consider information available in the public domain and information provided by the seller. In the event publicly available data is limited, then, by necessity, we may rely to a large extent on information that may only be available from the seller, particularly with respect to drilling and completion costs and practices, geological, geophysical and petrophysical data, detailed production data on existing wells, and other technical and cost data not available in the public domain. Accordingly, the review and evaluation of the business or property to be acquired may not uncover all existing or relevant data, obligations or actual or contingent liabilities that could adversely impact the business or property to be acquired and, hence, could adversely affect us as a result of the acquisition. These issues may be material and could include, among other things, unexpected environmental problems, title defects or other liabilities. If we acquire properties on an \u201cas-is\u201d basis, we will have limited or no remedies against the seller with respect to these types of problems.\nThe success of any acquisition that we complete will depend on a variety of factors, including our ability to accurately assess the reserves associated with the acquired properties, future oil and natural gas prices and operating costs, potential environmental and other liabilities and other factors. These assessments are often inexact and subjective. As a result, we may not recover the purchase price of a property from the sale of production from the property or recognize an acceptable return from such sales. In addition, we may face greater risks to the extent we acquire properties in areas outside of areas in which we currently operate because we may be less familiar with operating, regulatory and other issues specific to those areas.\nOur ability to achieve the benefits that we expect from an acquisition will also depend on our ability to efficiently integrate the acquired operations. Management may be required to dedicate significant time and effort to the integration process, which could divert its attention from other business concerns. The challenges involved in the integration process may include retaining key employees and maintaining employee morale, addressing differences in business cultures, processes and systems and developing internal expertise regarding the acquired properties.\nWe may incur substantial losses and be subject to substantial liability claims as a result of our oil and natural gas operations and drilling operations.\nOil and natural gas exploration, drilling and production activities are subject to numerous significant operating risks, including the possibility of:\n\u00b7\nunanticipated, abnormally pressured formations;\n\u00b7\nmechanical difficulties, such as stuck drilling and service tools and casing collapses;\n\u00b7\nblowouts, fires and explosions;\n\u00b7\npersonal injuries and death;\n\u00b7\nuninsured or underinsured losses; and\n\u00b7\nenvironmental hazards, such as uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas, brine, well fluids, toxic gas or other pollution into the environment, including groundwater contamination.\nAny of these operating hazards could cause damage to properties, reduced cash flows, serious injuries, fatalities, oil spills, discharge of hazardous materials, remediation and clean-up costs and other environmental damages, which could expose us to liabilities. Although we believe we are adequately insured for replacement costs of our wells and associated equipment, the payment of any of these liabilities could reduce the funds available for exploration, development, and acquisition, or could result in a loss of our properties.\nThe nature of our business and assets will expose us to significant compliance costs and liabilities.\nOur operations involving the exploration and production of hydrocarbons are subject to stringent federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment. Our operations are also subject to laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment, operational safety, and related employee health and safety matters. Laws and regulations applicable to us include those relating to the following:\n\u00b7\nland use restrictions;\n\u00b7\ndelivery of our oil and natural gas to market;\n\u00b7\ndrilling bonds and other financial responsibility requirements;\n\u00b7\nspacing of wells;\n\u00b7\nemissions into the air;\n\u00b7\nunitization and pooling of properties;\n\u00b7\nhabitat and endangered species protection, reclamation and remediation;\n\u00b7\ncontainment and disposal of hazardous substances, oil field waste and other waste materials;\n\u00b7\ndrilling permits;\n\u00b7\nuse of saltwater injection wells, which affects the disposal of saltwater from our wells;\n\u00b7\nsafety precautions;\n\u00b7\nprevention of oil spills;\n\u00b7\noperational reporting; and\n\u00b7\ntaxation and royalties.\nCompliance with all of these laws and regulations are a significant cost of doing business. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil, and criminal penalties; the imposition of investigatory and remedial\nliabilities; the issuance of injunctions that may restrict, inhibit or prohibit our operations; and claims of damages to property or persons.\nSome environmental laws and regulations impose strict liability. Strict liability means that in some situations we could be exposed to liability for clean-up costs and other damages as a result of conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred or for the conduct of prior operators of properties we acquired or of other third parties. Similarly, some environmental laws and regulations impose joint and several liability, meaning that we could be held responsible for more than our share of a particular reclamation or other obligation, and potentially the entire obligation, where other parties were involved in the activity giving rise to the liability. In addition, we may be required to make large and unanticipated capital expenditures to comply with applicable laws and regulations, for example by installing and maintaining pollution control devices. Similarly, our plugging and abandonment obligations are and will continue to be substantial and may be more than our estimates. It is not possible for us to estimate reliably the amount and timing of all future expenditures related to environmental matters, but they will be material. Environmental risks are generally not fully insurable.\nFederal, state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing, natural gas venting and transportation restrictions based on crude oil volatility, could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays in our production of oil and natural gas and lower returns on our capital investments.\nHydraulic fracturing is a practice that is used to stimulate production of oil and/or natural gas from tight formations. The process involves the injection of water, proppants and chemicals under pressure into the formation to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. The majority of our proved non-producing and proved undeveloped reserves associated with future drilling projects require hydraulic fracturing. If we are unable to apply hydraulic fracturing to our wells or the process is prohibited or significantly regulated or restricted, we would lose the ability to (i) drill and complete the projects for such proved reserves and (ii) maintain the associated acreage, which would have a material adverse effect on our future business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nThe federal Safe Drinking Water Act (\u201cSDWA\u201d) regulates the underground injection of substances through the Underground Injection Control (\u201cUIC\u201d) Program. However, hydraulic fracturing is generally exempt from regulation under the UIC Program, and thus the process is typically regulated by state oil and gas commissions. Nevertheless, the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority over hydraulic fracturing involving diesel additives under the UIC Program. Under this assertion of authority, the EPA requires facilities to obtain permits to use diesel fuel in hydraulic fracturing operations. The U.S. Energy Policy Act of 2005, which exempts hydraulic fracturing from regulation under the SDWA, prohibits the use of diesel fuel in the fracturing process without a UIC permit. On February 12, 2014, the EPA published a revised UIC Program guidance for oil, NGL and natural gas hydraulic fracturing activities using diesel fuel. The guidance document describes how regulations of Class II wells, which are those wells injecting fluids associated with oil, NGL and natural gas production activities, may be tailored to address the purported unique risks of diesel fuel injection during the hydraulic fracturing process. Although the EPA is not the permitting authority for UIC Class II programs in Texas, where we maintain acreage, the EPA is encouraging state programs to review and consider use of the above-mentioned guidance. Furthermore, legislation has been proposed in recent sessions of Congress to repeal the hydraulic fracturing exemption from the SDWA, provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing, and require public disclosure of the chemicals used in the fracturing process.\nOn May 9, 2014, the EPA issued an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking seeking public comment on its intent to develop and issue regulations under the Toxic Substances Control Act regarding the disclosure of information related to the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing. The public comment period ended on September 18, 2014. The EPA plans to develop a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking by December 2016, which would describe a proposed mechanism, regulatory, voluntary, or a combination of both, to collect data on hydraulic fracturing chemical substances and mixtures.\nAlso, on March 26, 2015, the Bureau of Land Management (the \"BLM\") published a final rule governing hydraulic fracturing on federal and Indian lands. The rule requires public disclosure of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing, implementation of a casing and cementing program, management of recovered fluids, and submission to the BLM of detailed information about the proposed operation, including wellbore geology, the location of faults and fractures, and the depths of all usable water. The rule took effect on June 24, 2015, although it is the subject of several pending lawsuits filed by industry groups and at least four states, alleging that federal law does not give the BLM authority to regulate hydraulic fracturing. On September 30, 2015, the United States District Court for Wyoming issued a preliminary injunction preventing the BLM from implementing the rule nationwide. This order has been appealed to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals.\nFurthermore, there are certain governmental reviews either underway or being proposed that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices. For example, the EPA has commenced a study of the potential adverse effects that hydraulic fracturing may have on water quality and public health. In June 2015, the EPA released its draft assessment report for peer review and public comment, finding that, while there are certain mechanisms by which hydraulic fracturing activities could potentially impact drinking water resources, there is no evidence available showing that those mechanisms have led to widespread, systemic impacts. Also, on February 6, 2015, the EPA released a report with findings and recommendations related to public concern about induced seismic\nactivity from disposal wells. The report recommends strategies for managing and minimizing the potential for significant injection-induced seismic events. Other governmental agencies, including the U.S. Department of Energy, the U.S. Geological Survey, and the U.S. Government Accountability Office, have evaluated or are evaluating various other aspects of hydraulic fracturing. These ongoing or proposed studies, depending on their degree of pursuit and any meaningful results obtained, could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA or other regulatory mechanisms.\nOn August 16, 2012, the EPA published final rules that subject oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids production, processing, transmission, and storage operations to regulation under the New Source Performance Standards (\"NSPS\") and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (\"NESHAP\") programs. The rule includes NSPS Standards for completions of hydraulically fractured gas wells and establishes specific new requirements for emissions from compressors, controllers, dehydrators, storage vessels, natural gas processing plants and certain other equipment. The final rule seeks to achieve a 95% reduction in volatile organic compounds (\"VOC\") emitted by requiring the use of reduced emission completions or \"green completions\" on all hydraulically-fractured wells constructed or refractured after January 1, 2015. The EPA received numerous requests for reconsideration of these rules from both industry and the environmental community, and court challenges to the rules were also filed. In response, the EPA has issued, and will likely continue to issue, revised rules responsive to some of these requests for reconsideration. For example, in September 2013 and December 2014, the EPA amended its rules to extend compliance deadlines and to clarify the NSPS. Further, on July 31, 2015, the EPA finalized two updates to the NSPS to address the definition of low-pressure wells and references to tanks that are connected to one another (referred to as connected in parallel). In addition, on September 18, 2015, the EPA published a suite of proposed rules to reduce methane and VOC emissions from oil and gas industry, including new \"downstream\" requirements covering equipment in the natural gas transmission segment of the industry that was not regulated by the 2012 rules. The public comment period closed on December 4, 2015.\nAlso, on January 22, 2016, the BLM announced a proposed rule to reduce the flaring, venting and leaking of methane from oil and gas operations on federal and Indian lands. The proposed rule would require operators to use currently available technologies and equipment to reduce flaring, periodically inspect their operations for leaks, and replace outdated equipment that vents large quantities of gas into the air. The rule would also clarify when operators owe the government royalties for flared gas.\nThese standards, as well as any future laws and their implementing regulations, may require us to obtain pre-approval for the expansion or modification of existing facilities or the construction of new facilities expected to produce air emissions, impose stringent air permit requirements, or utilize specific equipment or technologies to control emissions. Any failure by us to comply with these requirements could subject us to monetary penalties, injunctions, conditions or restrictions on operations and, potentially, criminal enforcement actions.\nSome states have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that could restrict hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances or otherwise require the public disclosure of chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. For example, pursuant to legislation adopted by the State of Texas in June 2011, the chemical components used in the hydraulic fracturing process, as well as the volume of water used, must be disclosed to the RRC and the public beginning February 1, 2012. Furthermore, on May 23, 2013, the RRC issued the \"well integrity rule,\" which updates the RRC's Rule 13 requirements for drilling, putting pipe down and cementing wells. The rule also includes new testing and reporting requirements, such as (i) the requirement to submit to the RRC cementing reports after well completion or after cessation of drilling, whichever is later, and (ii) the imposition of additional testing on wells less than 1,000 feet below usable groundwater. The \"well integrity rule\" took effect in January 2014. Additionally, on October 28, 2014, the RRC adopted disposal well rule amendments designed, among other things, to require applicants for new disposal wells that will receive non-hazardous produced water and hydraulic fracturing flowback fluid to conduct seismic activity searches utilizing the U.S. Geological Survey. The searches are intended to determine the potential for earthquakes within a circular area of 100 square miles around a proposed, new disposal well. The disposal well rule amendments, which became effective on November 17, 2014, also clarify the RRC's authority to modify, suspend or terminate a disposal well permit if scientific data indicate a disposal well is likely to contribute to seismic activity. The RRC has used this authority to deny permits for waste disposal wells. In addition to state law, local land use restrictions, such as city ordinances, may restrict or prohibit the performance of well drilling in general and/or hydraulic fracturing in particular.\nIf these or any other new laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted or laws or regulations are adopted to restrict water disposal wells, such laws could make it more difficult or costly for us to drill and produce from conventional or tight formations as well as make it easier for third parties opposing the oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids industry to initiate legal proceedings. In addition, if these matters are regulated at the federal level, fracturing and disposal activities could become subject to additional permitting and financial assurance requirements, more stringent construction specifications, increased monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping obligations, plugging and abandonment requirements and also to attendant permitting delays and potential increases in costs. These developments, as well as new laws or regulations, could cause us to incur substantial compliance costs, and compliance or the consequences of failure to comply by us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. At this time, it is not possible to estimate the potential impact on our business that may arise if federal or state legislation governing hydraulic fracturing or water disposal wells are enacted into law.\nAdditional legislation or regulation could make it easier for parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process adversely affect groundwater. There has also been increasing public controversy regarding hydraulic fracturing with regard to use of fracturing fluids, impacts on drinking water supplies, use of water and the potential for adverse impacts to surface water, groundwater and the environment generally. A number of lawsuits and enforcement actions have been initiated in states implicating hydraulic fracturing practices.\nLegislation, regulation, litigation and enforcement actions at the federal, state or local level that restrict hydraulic fracturing services could limit the availability and raise the cost of such services, delay completion of new wells and production of our oil, NGLs and natural gas, lower our return on capital expenditures and have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and quantities of oil and natural gas reserves that may be economically produced.\nCertain states, including North Dakota where we conduct operations, and have interest in numerous non-operated wells, and intend to expand our presence in the future have adopted, and other states are considering the adoption of, regulations that impose new or more stringent permitting, disclosure and threshold requirements on the intentional or inadvertent venting of natural gas. Such efforts have resulted in the delay of certain drilling and/or completion operations until additional natural gas pipelines are built or sufficient transportation capacity is available. The proliferation of these regulations in North Dakota and in other states may limit or delay our ability to conduct operations in a timely manner.\nThe state of North Dakota has issued new conditioning standards requiring certain crude oils produced in North Dakota to be conditioned to remove lighter, volatile hydrocarbons, and thereby make the oil safer to transport by railroad. The new standards seek to address safety concerns stemming from train derailments in U.S. and Canada. The new standard establishes a goal of achieving a vapor pressure of no greater than 13.7 pounds per square inch (psi) rather than the current national standard of 14.7 psi or less. The adoption of these regulations and/or their proliferation to other states may require the installation of new and more costly control equipment, increase the cost of production operations, increase the costs incurred by oil transporters and thereby decrease the price we receive for crude oil sold in North Dakota.\nThe adoption of climate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of \"greenhouse gases\" could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids we produce.\nCongress has from time to time considered legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gasses, \u201cGHGs\u201d, and almost one-half of the states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of GHGs, through the planned development of GHG emission inventories and/or regional GHG cap and trade programs or other mechanisms. Most cap and trade programs work by requiring major sources of emissions, such as electric power plants, or major producers of fuels, such as refineries and gas processing plants, to acquire and surrender emission allowances corresponding with their annual emissions of GHGs. The number of allowances available for purchase is reduced each year until the overall GHG emission reduction goal is achieved. As the number of GHG emission allowances declines each year, the cost or value of allowances is expected to escalate significantly. Some states have enacted renewable portfolio standards, which require utilities to purchase a certain percentage of their energy from renewable fuel sources.\nIn addition, in December 2009, the EPA determined that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other GHGs present an endangerment to human health and the environment, because emissions of such gases are, according to the EPA, contributing to warming of the earth's atmosphere and other climatic changes. These findings by the EPA allow the agency to proceed with the adoption and implementation of regulations that would restrict emissions of GHGs under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act. In response to its endangerment finding, the EPA recently adopted two sets of rules regarding possible future regulation of GHG emissions under the Clean Air Act. The motor vehicle rule, which became effective in July 2010, purports to limit emissions of GHGs from motor vehicles. The EPA adopted the stationary source rule (or the \"tailoring rule\") in May 2010, and it became effective in January 2011. The tailoring rule established new GHG emissions thresholds that determine when stationary sources must obtain permits under the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (\"PSD\") and Title V programs of the Clean Air Act. On June 23, 2014, in Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA (\"UARG v. EPA\"), the Supreme Court held that stationary sources could not become subject to PSD or Title V permitting solely by reason of their GHG emissions. The Court ruled, however, that the EPA may require installation of best available control technology for GHG emissions at sources otherwise subject to the PSD and Title V programs. On December 19, 2014, the EPA issued two memoranda providing initial guidance on GHG permitting requirements in response to the Court's decision in UARG v. EPA. In its preliminary guidance, the EPA indicated it would promulgate a rule to rescind any PSD permits issued under the portions of the tailoring rule that were vacated by the Court. In the interim, the EPA issued a narrowly crafted \"no action assurance\" indicating it will exercise its enforcement discretion not to pursue enforcement of the terms and conditions relating to GHGs in an EPA-issued PSD permit, and for related terms and conditions in a Title V permit. On April 30, 2015, the EPA issued a final rule allowing permitting authorities to rescind PSD permits issued under the invalid regulations.\nIn September 2009, the EPA issued a final rule requiring the reporting of GHG emissions from specified large GHG emission sources in the U.S., including natural gas liquids fractionators and local natural gas/distribution companies, beginning in 2011 for emissions occurring in 2010. In November 2010, the EPA published a final rule expanding the GHG reporting rule to include onshore oil, NGL and natural gas production, processing, transmission, storage and distribution facilities. This rule requires reporting of GHG emissions\nfrom such facilities on an annual basis, with reporting beginning in 2012 for emissions occurring in 2011. In October 2015, the EPA amended the GHG reporting rule to add the reporting of GHG emissions from gathering and boosting systems, completions and workovers of oil wells using hydraulic fracturing, and blowdowns of natural gas transmission pipelines.\nThe EPA has continued to adopt GHG regulations applicable to other industries, such as its August 2015 adoption of three separate, but related, actions to address carbon dioxide pollution from power plants, including final Carbon Pollution Standards for new, modified and reconstructed power plants, a final Clean Power Plan to cut carbon dioxide pollution from existing power plants, and a proposed federal plan to implement the Clean Power Plan emission guidelines. Upon publication of the Clean Power Plan on October 23, 2015, more than two dozen states as well as industry and labor groups challenged the Clean Power Plan in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. On February 9, 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court stayed the Clean Power Plan pending disposition of the legal challenges. Nevertheless, as a result of the continued regulatory focus, future GHG regulations of the oil and gas industry remain a possibility.\nIn December 2015, the United States joined the international community at the 21st Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, France. The resulting Paris Agreement calls for the parties to undertake \"ambitious efforts\" to limit the average global temperature, and to conserve and enhance sinks and reservoirs of GHGs. The Paris Agreement, if ratified, establishes a framework for the parties to cooperate and report actions to reduce GHG emissions.\nRestrictions on GHG emissions that may be imposed could adversely affect the oil and natural gas industry. The adoption of legislation or regulatory programs to reduce GHG emissions could require us to incur increased operating costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems, to acquire emissions allowances or comply with new regulatory requirements. Any GHG emissions legislation or regulatory programs applicable to power plants or refineries could also increase the cost of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for, the oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids we produce. Consequently, legislation and regulatory programs to reduce GHG emissions could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, claims have been made against certain energy companies alleging that GHG emissions from oil, NGL and natural gas operations constitute a public nuisance under federal and/or state common law. As a result, private individuals may seek to enforce environmental laws and regulations against us and could allege personal injury or property damages. While we are currently not a party to such litigation, we could be named in actions making similar allegations. An unfavorable ruling in any such case could significantly impact our operations and could have an adverse impact on our financial condition.\nMoreover, there has been public discussion that climate change may be associated with extreme weather conditions such as more intense hurricanes, thunderstorms, tornadoes and snow or ice storms, as well as rising sea levels. Another discussed possible consequence of climate change is increased volatility in seasonal temperatures. Some studies indicate that climate change could cause some areas to experience temperatures substantially colder than their historical averages. Extreme weather conditions can interfere with our production and increase our costs and damage resulting from extreme weather may not be fully insured. However, at this time, we are unable to determine the extent to which climate change may lead to increased storm or weather hazards affecting our operations.\nOur oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids are sold to a limited number of geographic markets so an oversupply in any of those areas could have a material negative effect on the price we receive.\nOur oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids is sold to a limited number of geographic markets which each have a fixed amount of storage and processing capacity. As a result, if such markets become oversupplied with oil, natural gas and/or natural gas liquids, it could have a material negative effect on the price we receive for our products and therefore an adverse effect on our financial condition. There is a risk that refining capacity in the U.S. Gulf Coast may be insufficient to refine all of the light sweet crude oil being produced in the United States. If light sweet crude oil production remains at current levels or continues to increase, demand for our light crude oil production could result in widening price discounts to the world crude prices and potential shut-in of production due to a lack of sufficient markets despite the lift on prior restrictions on the exporting of oil and natural gas.\nDerivatives reform legislation and related regulations could have an adverse effect on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business.\nThe July 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \"Dodd-Frank Act\") provides for federal oversight of the over-the-counter derivatives market and entities that participate in that market and mandates that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the \"CFTC\"), the SEC, and federal regulators of financial institutions (the \"Prudential Regulators\") adopt rules or regulations implementing the Dodd-Frank Act and providing definitions of terms used in the Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Act establishes margin requirements and requires clearing and trade execution practices for certain market participants and may result in certain market participants needing to curtail or cease their derivatives activities.\nAlthough some of the rules necessary to implement the Dodd-Frank Act remain to be adopted, the CFTC, the SEC and the Prudential Regulators have issued many rules to implement the Dodd-Frank Act, including a rule, which we refer to as the \"Mandatory Clearing\nRule,\" requiring clearing of hedges, or swaps, that are subject to it (currently, only certain interest rate and credit default swaps, which we do not presently have), a rule, which we refer to as the \"End User Exception,\" establishing an \"end user\" exception to the Mandatory Clearing Rule, a rule, which we refer to as the \"Margin Rule,\" setting forth collateral requirements in connection with swaps that are not cleared and also an exception to the Margin Rule for end users that are not financial end users, which exception we refer to as the \"Non-Financial End User Exception,\" and a rule, subsequently vacated by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia and remanded to the CFTC for further proceedings, imposing position limits. The CFTC proposed a new version of this rule, which we refer to as the \"Re-Proposed Position Limit Rule,\" with respect to which the comment period has closed but a final rule has not been issued.\nWe qualify for the End User Exception and will utilize it if the Mandatory Clearing Rule is expanded to cover swaps in which we participate, we qualify for the Non-Financial End User Exception and will not be required to post margin in connection with uncleared swaps under the Margin Rule, and the quantities under the swaps in which we participate are well within applicable limits under the Re-Proposed Position Limit Rule, so we do not expect to be directly affected by any of such rules. However, most if not all of our hedge counterparties will be subject to mandatory clearing in connection with their hedging activities with parties who do not qualify for the End User Exception and will be required to post margin in connection with their hedging activities with other swap dealers, major swap participants, financial end users and other persons that do not qualify for the Non-Financial End User Exception. In addition, the European Union and other non-U.S. jurisdictions have enacted laws and regulations, which we refer to collectively as \"Foreign Regulations\" which may apply to our transactions with counterparties subject to such Foreign Regulations. The Dodd-Frank Act, the rules which have been adopted and not vacated, and, to the extent that the Re-Proposed Position Limit Rule is effected, such proposed rule could significantly increase the cost of our derivative contracts, materially alter the terms of our derivative contracts, reduce the availability of derivatives to us that we have historically used to protect against risks that we encounter in our business, reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivative contracts, and increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties. The Foreign Regulations could have similar effects. If we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and regulations and Foreign Regulations, our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable, which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures. Finally, the Dodd-Frank Act was intended, in part, to reduce the volatility of oil and natural gas prices, which some legislators attributed to speculative trading in derivatives and commodity contracts related to oil and natural gas. Our revenues could therefore be adversely affected if a consequence of the Dodd-Frank Act and regulations is to lower commodity prices. Any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on us, our financial condition, and our results of operations.\nWe may incur more taxes and certain of our projects may become uneconomic if certain federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and development are eliminated as a result of future legislation.\nLegislation has been proposed that would, if enacted, eliminate certain key U.S. federal income tax preferences currently available to oil and natural gas exploration and production companies. These changes include, but are not limited to (i) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas properties, (ii) the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs, (iii) the elimination of the deduction for certain U.S. production activities and (iv) an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. In addition, President Obama recently proposed adding a $10.25 per Bbl tax on crude oil produced in the United States. It is unclear whether any of the foregoing changes will actually be enacted or how soon any such changes could become effective. Any such change or similar other change could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations by increasing the costs we incur which would in turn make it uneconomic to drill some locations if commodity prices are not sufficiently high, resulting in lower revenues and decreases in production and reserves.\nOur operations are substantially dependent on the availability, use and disposal of water. New legislation and regulatory initiatives or restrictions relating to water disposal wells could have a material adverse effect on our future business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nWater is an essential component of both the drilling and hydraulic fracturing processes. Historically, we have been able to purchase water from local land owners and other sources for use in our operations. During the past several years, Texas has experienced the lowest inflows of water in recent history. As a result of these conditions, some local water districts may begin restricting the use of water subject to their jurisdiction for drilling and hydraulic fracturing in order to protect the local water supply. If we are unable to obtain water to use in our operations from local sources, we may be unable to economically produce oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nAdditionally, our drilling procedures produce large volumes of water that we must properly dispose. The Clean Water Act of 1977, as amended, the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974, as amended, the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, as amended, and comparable state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants, including produced waters and other natural gas wastes, into federal and state waters. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the \"EPA\") or the state. Furthermore, many states maintain groundwater protection programs that require permits for discharges or operations that may impact groundwater conditions. The underground injection of fluids is subject to permitting and other requirements under state laws and regulation. Obtaining permits has the potential\nto delay the development of oil, NGL and natural gas projects. These same regulatory programs also limit the total volume of water that can be discharged, hence limiting the rate of development, and require us to incur compliance costs. In October 2014, the RRC adopted new regulations effective as of November 17, 2014 that require additional supporting documentation, including records from the U.S. Geological Survey regarding previous seismic events in the area, as part of applications for new disposal wells. The new regulations also clarify the RRC's ability to modify, suspend or terminate a disposal well permit if scientific data indicates it is likely to contribute to seismic activity. The RRC has used this authority to deny permits for waste disposal sites.\nMoreover, the EPA is examining regulatory requirements for \"indirect dischargers\" of wastewater - i.e., those that send their discharges to private or publicly owned treatment facilities, which treat the wastewater before discharging it to regulated waters. On April 7, 2015, the EPA published a proposed rule establishing federal pre-treatment standards for wastewater discharged from onshore unconventional oil and gas extraction facilities to publicly owned treatment works (\u201cPOTWs\u201d). The EPA asserts that wastewater from such facilities can be generated in large quantities and can contain constituents that may disrupt POTW operations and/or be discharged, untreated, from the POTW to receiving waters. If adopted, the new pre-treatment rule would require unconventional oil and gas facilities to pre-treat wastewater before transferring it to POTWs. The public comment period ended on July 17, 2015, and the EPA is expected to publish a final rule in 2016. The EPA is also conducting a study of private wastewater treatment facilities (also known as centralized waste treatment, or CWT, facilities) accepting oil and gas extraction wastewater. The EPA is collecting data and information related to the extent to which CWT facilities accept such wastewater, available treatment technologies (and their associated costs), discharge characteristics, financial characteristics of CWT facilities, and the environmental impacts of discharges from CWT facilities.\nBecause of the necessity to safely dispose of water produced during drilling and production activities, these regulations, or others like them, could have a material adverse effect on our future business, financial condition, operating results and prospects. See Item 1. Business-Regulations, for a further description of the laws and regulations that affect us.\nAny change to government regulation or administrative practices may have a negative impact on our ability to operate and our profitability.\nOil and gas exploration and development is subject to substantial regulation under federal, state and local laws relating to the exploration for, and the development, upgrading, marketing, pricing, taxation, and transportation of, oil and natural gas and related products and other associated matters. Amendments to current laws and regulations governing operations and activities of oil and gas exploration and development operations could have a material adverse impact on our business. In addition, there can be no assurance that income tax laws, royalty regulations and government incentive programs related to our oil and gas properties and the oil and gas industry generally will not be changed in a manner which may adversely affect our progress or cause delays.\nPermits, leases, licenses, and approvals are required from a variety of regulatory authorities at various stages of exploration and development. There can be no assurance that the various government permits, leases, licenses and approvals sought will be granted in respect of our activities or, if granted, will not be cancelled or will be renewed upon expiration. There is no assurance that such permits, leases, licenses, and approvals will not contain terms and provisions which may adversely affect our exploration and development activities.\nThe marketability of our production is dependent upon gathering systems, transportation facilities and processing facilities that we do not own or control. If these facilities or systems are unavailable, our operations can be interrupted and our revenues reduced.\nThe marketability of our oil and natural gas production is dependent upon the availability, proximity and capacity of pipelines, natural gas gathering systems, transportation and processing facilities owned by third parties. In general, we will not control these facilities, and our access to them may be limited or denied due to circumstances beyond our control. A significant disruption in the availability of these facilities could adversely impact our ability to deliver to market the oil and natural gas we produce and thereby cause a significant interruption in our operations. In some cases, our ability to deliver to market our oil and natural gas is dependent upon coordination among third parties that own transportation and processing facilities we use, and any inability or unwillingness of those parties to coordinate efficiently could also interrupt our operations. These are risks for which we generally will not maintain insurance.\nUse of debt financing may adversely affect our strategy.\nWe intend to use debt to fund a portion of our future acquisition and operating activities. Any temporary or sustained inability to service or repay debt will materially adversely affect our ability to access the financing market and to pursue our operating strategies, as well as impair our ability to respond to adverse economic changes in oil and natural gas markets and the economy in general.\nNon-operated properties will be controlled by third parties that may not allow us to proceed with planned explorations and expenditures. Activities on operated properties could also be limited or subject to penalties.\nWhile we intend to operate the majority of our properties, we are not currently the operator of many of our existing properties and, therefore, may not be able to influence production operations or further development activities. At present, we operate wells comprising approximately 67% of our total proved reserves. Joint ownership is customary in the oil and gas industry and is generally conducted under the terms of a Joint Operating Agreement (\u201cJOA\u201d), where one of the working interest owners is designated as the \u201coperator\u201d of the property. For non-operated properties, subject to the specific terms and conditions of the applicable JOA, if we disagree with the decision of a majority of working interest owners, we may be required, among other things, to postpone the proposed activity or decline to participate. If we decline to participate, we might be forced to relinquish our interest through \u201cin-or-out\u201d elections or may be subject to certain non-consent penalties, as provided in a JOA. In-or-out elections may require a joint owner to participate or forever relinquish its position, typically only in specific wells or drilling units, although such relinquished positions could be of a larger scope. Non-consent penalties typically allow participating working interest owners to recover from the proceeds of production, if any, an amount equal to 200% to 500% of the non-participating working interest owner\u2019s share of the cost of such operations. Further, even for properties operated by us, there may be instances where decisions related to drilling, completion and operating cannot be made in our sole discretion. In such instances, we could be limited in our development operations and subject to penalties as specified above if we choose not to participate in operations proposed by a majority of working interest owners.\nBecause we cannot control activities on properties we do not operate, we cannot control the timing of exploration and development projects. If we are unable to fund required capital expenditures with respect to non-operated properties, our interests in those properties may be reduced or forfeited.\nOur ability to exercise influence over operations and costs for the properties we do not operate is limited. Our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects and our limited ability to influence operations and associated costs could prevent the realization of our targeted returns on capital with respect to exploration, exploitation, development or acquisition activities. The success and timing of exploration, exploitation and development activities on properties operated by others depend upon a number of factors that may be outside our control, including:\n\u00b7\nthe timing and amount of capital expenditures;\n\u00b7\nthe operator\u2019s expertise and financial resources;\n\u00b7\nthe approval of other participants in drilling wells; and\n\u00b7\nthe selection of technology.\nWhere we are not the majority owner or operator of a particular oil and natural gas project, we may have no control over the timing or amount of capital expenditures associated with the project. If we are not willing or able to fund required capital expenditures relating to a project when required by the majority owner(s) or operator, our interests in the project may be reduced or forfeited. Also, we could be responsible for plugging and abandonment and other liabilities in excess of our proportionate interest in the property.\nBecause we cannot control the timing and accuracy of financial information regarding the results of operations on properties we do not operate, our ability to timely and accurately report our results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected.\nFor properties we do not operate, we are dependent on the operators of such properties for financial information regarding the results of operations. Any delay in receipt of such information or inaccuracies in calculating and reporting such information by the operator would adversely affect our ability to timely and accurately report our results of operations and financial condition.\nA cyber incident could result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption and/or financial loss.\nThe oil and natural gas industry has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct day-to-day operations including certain exploration, development and production activities. For example, software programs are used to interpret seismic data, manage drilling rigs, production equipment and gathering and transportation systems, conduct reservoir modeling and reserve estimation, for compliance report.\nWe are dependent on digital technologies including information systems and related infrastructure, to process and record financial and operating data, communicate with our employees, business partners, and stockholder, analyze seismic and drilling information, estimate quantities of oil and gas reserves as well as other activities related to our business. Our business partners, including vendors, service providers, purchasers of our production, and financial institutions, are also dependent on digital technology. The technologies needed to conduct oil and natural gas exploration and development activities make certain information the target of theft or misappropriation.\nAs dependence on digital technologies has increased, cyber incidents, including deliberate attacks or unintentional events, also has increased. A cyber-attack could include gaining unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption, or result in denial-of-service on websites.\nOur technologies, systems, networks, and those of our business partners may become the target of cyber-attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of proprietary and other information, or other disruption of our business operations. In addition, certain cyber incidents, such as surveillance, may remain undetected for an extended period of time. A cyber incident involving our information systems and related infrastructure, or that of our business partners, could disrupt our business plans and negatively impact our operations.\nRisks Related to the Ownership of our Common Stock\nWe are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the NYSE MKT rules and, as a result, qualify for, and rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements. As a result, our stockholders do not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to such requirements.\nOVR beneficially owns a majority of our common stock. As a result, we are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the NYSE MKT corporate governance standards. Under the NYSE MKT rules, a company of which more than 50% of the voting power is held by another person or group of persons acting together is a controlled company and may elect not to comply with certain NYSE MKT corporate governance requirements, including the requirements that:\n\u00b7\na majority of our board of directors consist of independent directors;\n\u00b7\nwe have a nominating committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee\u2019s purpose and responsibilities; and\n\u00b7\nwe have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee\u2019s purpose and responsibilities.\nWe are currently utilizing, and intend to continue to utilize, the exemption relating to a majority of our board of directors not being independent, the compensation committee, the nominating committee, and we may utilize this exemption for so long as we are a controlled company. Accordingly, our stockholders do not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of the NYSE MKT.\nOVR holds a substantial majority of our common stock.\nOVR holds the majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock. OVR is entitled to act separately in its own interest with respect to its shares of our common stock, and it has the voting power to elect all of the members of our board of directors and thereby control our management and affairs. In addition, OVR has the ability to determine the outcome of all matters requiring stockholder approval, including mergers and other material transactions, and to cause or prevent a change in the composition of our board of directors or a change in control of our company that could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of our company. The existence of a significant stockholder may also have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers, delaying or preventing changes in control or changes in management, or limiting the ability of our other stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in the best interests of our company.\nSo long as OVR continues to control a significant amount of our common stock, OVR will continue to be able to strongly influence all matters requiring stockholder approval, regardless of whether or not other stockholders believe that a potential transaction is in their own best interests. In any of these matters, the interests of OVR may differ or conflict with the interests of our other stockholders. Moreover, this concentration of stock ownership may also adversely affect the trading price of our common stock to the extent investors perceive a disadvantage in owning stock of a company with a controlling stockholder.\nOur common stock price has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile.\nThe trading price of our common stock is subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors, including quarterly variations in operating results, announcements of drilling and rig activity, economic conditions in the natural gas and oil industry, general economic conditions or other events or factors that are beyond our control.\nIn addition, the stock market in general and the market for oil and natural gas exploration companies, in particular, have experienced large price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating results or asset values of those companies. These broad market and industry factors may seriously impact the market price and trading volume of our common stock regardless of our actual operating performance. In the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has been instituted against certain oil and natural gas exploration\ncompanies. If this type of litigation were instituted against us following a period of volatility in our common stock trading price, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, future cash flows and the results of operations.", "PERMNO": 17073, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "ESTE"}
