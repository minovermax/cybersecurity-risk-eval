Risk Factors.\nRISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the other information included in this annual report, before making an investment decision. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer. In that case, the trading price of our shares of common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. You should read the section entitled \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d for a discussion of what types of statements are forward-looking statements, as well as the significance of such statements in the context of this annual report.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nThere can be no assurance that we can achieve or maintain profitability.\nThe likelihood of our success must be considered in light of the problems, expenses, difficulties, complications and delays that we may encounter because we are a small business. As a result, we may not be profitable and we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to develop as we have planned.\nOur ability to achieve and maintain profitability and positive cash flow will be dependent upon:\n\u25cf management\u2019s ability to maintain the technology and skills necessary for our fuel conversion services;\n\u25cf our ability to keep abreast of changes by government agencies and in the law, particularly in the areas of intellectual property and environmental regulation;\n\u25cf our ability to attract customers who require the products and services we offer;\n\u25cf our ability to generate revenues through the sale of our products and services to potential clients; and\n\u25cf our ability to manage the logistics and operations of our company and the distribution of our products and services.\nWe have had operating losses since formation and expect to incur net losses for the near term.\nWe reported a net loss of $9,141,498 for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to a net loss of $7,152,452 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014. We currently use approximately $460,000 per month to fund operations. We anticipate that we will lose money in the near term and we may not be able to achieve profitable operations. In order to achieve profitable operations we need to secure sales of fuel and Plasma Arc Flow\u00ae System. We anticipate the need to raise additional capital in the near term to satisfy our plan of operations.\nWe will need additional funding to continue operations, which may not be available to us on favorable terms or at all.\nTo date, we have generated only limited revenue from our products and have not achieved positive cash flows or profitability. We expect to continue to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future as we incur costs associated with the continuation of our research and development programs, expand our sales and marketing capabilities, increase manufacturing of our products, pursue potential acquisitions and comply with the requirements related to being a U. S. public company listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market. As a result, additional funding will be needed and it may not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all. If we raise additional funding through the issuance of equity securities, our stockholders may suffer dilution and our ability to use our net operating losses to offset future income may be limited. If we raise additional funding through debt financing, we may be required to accept terms that restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, require us to use our cash to make payments under such indebtedness, force us to maintain specified liquidity or other ratios or restrict our ability to pay dividends or make acquisitions. If we are unable to secure additional funding, our development programs and our commercialization efforts would be delayed, reduced or eliminated, our relationships with our suppliers and customers may be harmed, and we may not be able to continue our operations.\nThe growth of our business depends upon the development and successful commercial acceptance of our products.\nWe depend upon a variety of factors to ensure that our MagneGas2\u00ae and the Plasma Arc Flow\u00ae System are successfully commercialized, including timely and efficient completion of design and development, implementation of manufacturing processes, and effective sales, marketing, and customer service. Because of the complexity of our products, significant delays may occur between development, introduction to the market and volume production phases.\nThe development and commercialization of MagneGas2\u00ae and the Plasma Arc Flow\u00ae System involves many difficulties, including:\n\u25cf retention and hiring of appropriate operational, research and development personnel;\n\u25cf determination of the products\u2019 technical specifications;\n\u25cf successful completion of the development process;\n\u25cf successful marketing of MagneGas2\u00ae and the Plasma Arc Flow System\u00ae and achieving customer acceptance;\n\u25cf managing inventory levels, logistics and operations; and\n\u25cf additional customer service and warranty costs associated with supporting product modifications and/or subsequent potential field upgrades.\nWe must expend significant financial and management resources to develop and market MagneGas2\u00ae and the Plasma Arc Flow System\u00ae. We cannot assure that we will receive meaningful revenue from these investments. If we are unable to continue to successfully develop or modify our products in response to customer requirements or technological changes, or our products are not commercially successful, our business may be harmed.\nAcquisitions constitute a key aspect of our growth strategy, and our potential inability to successfully integrate newly acquired companies or businesses could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe may pursue acquisitions of other companies or their businesses in the future. Acquisitions are a key aspect of our growth strategy and, as a result, there can be no assurance that these transactions will be successful from an integration or financial perspective. If we complete acquisitions, we face many risks commonly encountered with growth through these transactions. These risks include:\n\u00b7 incurring significantly higher than anticipated capital expenditures and operating expenses;\n\u00b7 failing to assimilate the operations, customers, and personnel of the acquired company or business;\n\u00b7 disrupting our ongoing business;\n\u00b7 dissipating our management resources;\n\u00b7 dilution to existing stockholders from the issuance of equity securities;\n\u00b7 liabilities or other problems associated with the acquired business;\n\u00b7 incurring debt on terms unfavorable to us or that we are unable to repay;\n\u00b7 becoming subject to adverse tax consequences, substantial depreciation or deferred compensation charges;\n\u00b7 improper compliance with laws of foreign jurisdictions;\n\u00b7 failing to maintain uniform standards, controls and policies; and\n\u00b7 impairing relationships with employees and customers as a result of changes in management.\nFully integrating an acquired company or business into our operations may take a significant amount of time. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered with acquisitions. To the extent we do not successfully avoid or overcome the risks or problems related to any acquisition, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. Future acquisitions also could impact our financial position and capital needs, and could cause substantial fluctuations in our quarterly and yearly results of operations. Acquisitions could include significant goodwill and intangible assets, which may result in future impairment charges that would reduce our stated earnings.\nFailure to comply with government regulations will severely limit our sales opportunities and future revenue.\nFailure to obtain operating permits, or otherwise to comply with federal and state regulatory and environmental requirements, could affect our abilities to market and sell MagneGas2\u00ae and the Plasma Arc Flow System\u00ae and could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nWe and our customers may be required to comply with a number of federal, state and local laws and regulations in the areas of safety, health and environmental controls. To the extent we intend to market the Plasma Arc Flow\u00ae System internationally, we will be required to comply with laws and regulations and, when applicable, obtain permits in those other countries.\nWe cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain or maintain, required permits and approvals, that new or more stringent environmental regulations will not be enacted or that if they are, that we will be able to meet the stricter standards.\nThe preparation of our financial statements involves use of estimates, judgments and assumptions, and our financial statements may be materially affected if our estimates prove to be inaccurate.\nFinancial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP require the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts. Different estimates, judgments, and assumptions reasonably could be used that would have a material effect on the financial statements, and changes in these estimates, judgments, and assumptions are likely to occur from period to period in the future. These estimates, judgments, and assumptions are inherently uncertain, and, if they prove to be wrong, then we face the risk that charges to income will be required.\nOur technology is unproven on a large-scale industrial basis and could fail to perform in an industrial production environment.\nThe Plasma Arc Flow\u00ae System has never been utilized on a large-scale industrial basis. All of the tests that we have conducted to date with respect to our technology have been performed on limited quantities of liquid waste, and we cannot assure you that the same or similar results could be obtained on a large-scale industrial basis. We cannot predict all of the difficulties that may arise when the technology is utilized on a large-scale industrial basis. In addition, our technology has never operated at a volume level required to be profitable. As our product is an alternative to acetylene, the unstable price of acetylene will impact our ability to become profitable and to sell cost competitive fuel. It is possible that the technology may require further research, development, design and testing prior to implementation of a larger-scale commercial application. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that this technology will perform successfully on a large-scale commercial basis, that it will be profitable to us or that our MagneGas2\u00ae will be cost competitive in the market.\nOur future success is dependent, in part, on the performance and continued service of Ermanno Santilli and other key personnel. Without their continued service, we may be forced to interrupt our operations.\nWe are presently dependent to a great extent upon the experience, abilities and continued services of Ermanno Santilli, our President and CEO. Ermanno has several years of experience regarding the technical operation and deployment of our refineries and has built deep relationships with our partners. The loss of any of his services would delay our business operations substantially.\nOur related party transactions may cause conflicts of interests that may adversely affect our business.\nOur intellectual property was purchased through a related party transaction with Hyfuels, Inc, a company which our former Chairman of our Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d), Dr. Ruggero Santilli, serves as the President and Chief Executive Officer, who through the transaction became a stockholder of our company. We currently lease our building through a related party transaction with a company wholly-owned by Dr. Santilli and his spouse and member of the Board, Carla Santilli. In addition, Dr. Santilli has personally contributed a small refinery for our use and we have received various small notes and loans from related parties, all of which have been paid in full. In addition, we own a 20% interest in MagneGas Europe, a company whose major stockholder is Ermanno Santilli, our Chief Executive Officer.\nWe believe that these transactions and agreements that we have entered into with these affiliates are on terms that are at least as favorable as could reasonably have been obtained at such time from third parties. However, these relationships could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest when our Board is faced with decisions that could have different implications for us and these affiliates. The appearance of conflicts, even if such conflicts do not materialize, might adversely affect the public\u2019s perception of us, as well as our relationship with other companies and our ability to enter into new relationships in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise capital or to do business.\nWe have the potential risk of product liability, which may subject us to litigation and related costs.\nOur Plasma Arc Flow\u00ae System may be utilized in a variety of industrial and other settings, and may be used to handle materials resulting from the user's generation of liquid waste and the creation of a compressed hydrogen based fuel for distribution to end customers. The equipment, cylinders and gas will therefore be subject to risks of breakdowns and malfunctions. There is also inherent risk in the compression, transportation and use of MagneGas2\u00ae fuel. It is possible that claims for personal injury and business losses arising out of these risks, breakdowns and malfunctions will occur. Our insurance may be insufficient to provide coverage against all claims, and claims may be made against us even if covered by our insurance policy for amounts substantially in excess of applicable policy limits. Such an event could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, due to the April 16, 2015 accident (as described above under the heading \u201cAccident at Company Facility\u201d), we may subject to a fine by OSHA as well as litigation costs. Such costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Since no cause of the accident has been determined, we may be subject to sales losses should the cause be determined to require a change in fuel production systems or processes.\nBecause we are smaller and have fewer financial and other resources than many alternative fuel companies, we may not be able to successfully compete in the very competitive alternative fuel industry.\nFuel is a commodity. There is significant competition among existing alternative fuel producers. Our business faces competition from a number of producers that can produce significantly greater volumes of fuel than we can or expect to produce, producers that can produce a wider range of fuel products than we can, and producers that have the financial and other resources that would enable them to expand their production rapidly if they chose to. These producers may be able to achieve substantial economies of scale and scope, thereby substantially reducing their fixed production costs and their marginal productions costs. If these producers are able to substantially reduce their marginal production costs, the market price of fuel may decline and we may be not be able to produce biogas at a cost that allows us to compete economically. Even if we are able to operate profitably, these other producers may be substantially more profitable than us, which may make it more difficult for us to raise any financing necessary for us to achieve our business plan and may have a materially adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nCosts of compliance with burdensome or changing environmental and operational safety regulations could cause our focus to be diverted away from our business and our results of operations may suffer.\nLiquid waste disposal and fuel production involves the discharge of potential contaminants into the water and air and is subject to various regulatory and safety requirements. As a result, we are subject to complicated environmental regulations of the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency and regulations and permitting requirements of the various states. These regulations are subject to change and such changes may require additional capital expenditures or increased operating costs. Consequently, considerable resources may be required to comply with future environmental regulations. In addition, our production plants could be subject to environmental nuisance or related claims by employees, property owners or residents near the plants arising from air or water discharges. Environmental and public nuisance claims, or tort claims based on emissions, or increased environmental compliance costs resulting therefrom could significantly increase our operating costs.\nBecause MagneGas2\u00ae is new to the metalworking market, it may take time for the industry to adapt to it. In addition, the economy may adversely impact consumption of fuel in the metalworking market making it more difficult for us to sell our product.\nMagneGas2\u00ae is a replacement for acetylene for the metalworking market. Because MagneGas2\u00ae is a new product in the industry, it may take time for end users to consider changing from acetylene to MagneGas2\u00ae and as such this may adversely impact our sales. In addition, consumption for fuel in the metalworking market is highly dependent on the economic conditions of the manufacturing industry and as such adverse conditions in the economy may also negatively impact our ability to sell our fuel to market.\nThe possibility of a global financial crisis may significantly impact our business and financial condition and our ability to attract customers to our relatively new technology for the foreseeable future.\nThe turmoil in the global financial system may adversely impact our ability to raise capital, invest in the development and refinement of our technology and to successfully market it to new customers. We may face increasing challenges if conditions in the financial markets do not improve over time. Our ability to access the capital markets may be restricted at a time when we would like, or need, to raise financing, which could have a material negative impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions. The economic situation could have a material negative impact on our ability to attract new customers willing to try our alternative fuel products or purchase our technology.\nMergers or other strategic transactions involving our competitors could weaken our competitive position, which could harm our operating results.\nThere is significant competition among existing alternative fuel producers. Some of our competitors may enter into new alliances with each other or may establish or strengthen cooperative relationships with systems integrators, third-party consulting firms or other parties. Any such consolidation, acquisition, alliance or cooperative relationship could lead to pricing pressure and our loss of market share and could result in a competitor with greater financial, technical, marketing, service and other resources, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur failure to respond to rapid change in the market for alternative fuel products could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur future success will depend significantly on our ability to keep pace with technological developments and evolving industry standards. Our delay or failure to develop or acquire technological improvements, adapt the products we develop to technological changes or provide technology that appeals to our customers may result in us not being able to successfully compete in the marketplace or the loss of customers which could ultimately cause us to cease operations.\nBecause our long-term plan depends, in part, on our ability to expand the sales of our solutions to customers located outside of the United States, our business will be susceptible to risks associated with international operations.\nWe have limited experience operating in foreign jurisdictions. We continue to explore opportunities for joint ventures internationally. Our inexperience in operating our business outside of North America increases the risk that our current and any future international expansion efforts will not be successful. Conducting international operations subjects us to new risks that, generally, we have not faced in the United States, including:\n\u25cf fluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u25cf unexpected changes in foreign regulatory requirements;\n\u25cf longer accounts receivable payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable;\n\u25cf difficulties in managing and staffing international operations;\n\u25cf potentially adverse tax consequences, including the complexities of foreign value added tax systems and restrictions on the repatriation of earnings;\n\u25cf localization of our solutions, including translation into foreign languages and associated expenses;\n\u25cf the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and different legal standards, including laws and regulations related to privacy;\n\u25cf increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities;\n\u25cf political, social and economic instability abroad, terrorist attacks and security concerns in general; and\n\u25cf reduced or varied protection for intellectual property rights in some countries.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nThe success of our business depends, in part, upon proprietary technologies and information that may be difficult to protect and may be perceived to infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties.\nWe believe that the identification, acquisition and development of proprietary technologies are key drivers of our business. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to obtain patents, maintain the secrecy of our proprietary technology and information, and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties. We cannot assure you that the patents of others will not have an adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business, that the patents that provide us with competitive advantages will not be challenged by third parties, that we will develop additional proprietary technology that is patentable or that any patents issued to us will provide us with competitive advantages. Further, we cannot assure you that others will not independently develop similar or superior technologies, duplicate elements of our biomass technology or design around it.\nTo successfully commercialize our proprietary technologies, we may need to acquire licenses to use, or to contest the validity of, issued or pending patents. We cannot assure you that any license acquired under such patents would be made available to us on acceptable terms, if at all, or that we would prevail in any such contest. In addition, we could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves in suits brought against us for alleged infringement of another party's patents or in defending the validity or enforceability of our patents, or in bringing patent infringement suits against other parties based on our patents.\nIn addition to the protection afforded by patents, we also rely on trade secrets, proprietary know-how and technology that we seek to protect, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our prospective joint venture partners, employees and consultants. We cannot assure you that these agreements will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any such breach, or that our trade secrets and proprietary know-how will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by others.\nWe cannot assure you that we will obtain any patent protection that we seek, that any protection we do obtain will be found valid and enforceable if challenged or that it will confer any significant commercial advantage. U. S. patents and patent applications may be subject to interference proceedings, U. S. patents may be subject to re-examination proceedings in the U. S. Patent and Trademark Office and foreign patents may be subject to opposition or comparable proceedings in the corresponding foreign patent offices, which proceedings could result in either loss of the patent or denial of the patent application, or loss or reduction in the scope of one or more of the claims of, the patent or patent application. In addition, such interference, re-examination and opposition proceedings may be costly. Moreover, the U. S. patent laws may change, possibly making it easier to challenge patents. Some of our technology was, and continues to be, developed in conjunction with third parties, and thus there is a risk that such third parties may claim rights in our intellectual property. Thus, any patents that we own or license from others may provide limited or no protection against competitors. Our pending patent applications, those we may file in the future, or those we may license from third parties, may not result in patents being issued. If issued, they may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology.\nMany of our competitors have significant resources and incentives to apply for and obtain intellectual property rights that could limit or prevent our ability to commercialize our current or future products in the United States or abroad.\nMany of our potential competitors who have significant resources and have made substantial investments in competing technologies may seek to apply for and obtain patents that will prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to make, use or sell our products either in the United States or in international markets. Our current or future U. S. or foreign patents may be challenged, circumvented by competitors or others or may be found to be invalid, unenforceable or insufficient. Since patent applications are confidential until patents are issued in the United States, or in most cases, until after 18 months from filing of the application, or corresponding applications are published in other countries, and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that we were the first to make the inventions covered by each of our pending patent applications, or that we were the first to file patent applications for such inventions.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information and know-how, the value of our technology and products could be adversely affected.\nIn addition to patented technology, we rely on our unpatented proprietary technology, trade secrets, processes and know-how. We generally seek to protect this information by confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and third parties. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors. To the extent that our employees, consultants or contractors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.\nRisks Related to Our Securities\nThe market price for our common stock is particularly volatile given our status as a relatively unknown company with a small and thinly traded public float and lack of profits, which could lead to wide fluctuations in our share price. You may be unable to sell your common stock at or above your purchase price, which may result in substantial losses to you.\nThe market for our common stock is characterized by significant price volatility when compared to the shares of larger, more established companies that trade on a national securities exchange and have large public floats, and we expect that our share price will continue to be more volatile than the shares of such larger, more established companies for the indefinite future. The volatility in our share price is attributable to a number of factors. First, as noted above, shares of our common stock are, compared to the shares of such larger, more established companies, sporadically and thinly traded. The price for our shares could, for example, decline precipitously in the event that a large number of our shares of common stock are sold on the market without commensurate demand. Secondly, we are a speculative or \u201crisky\u201d investment due lack of profits to date and uncertainty of future market acceptance for our potential products. As a consequence of this enhanced risk, more risk-adverse investors may, under the fear of losing all or most of their investment in the event of negative news or lack of progress, be more inclined to sell their shares on the market more quickly and at greater discounts than would be the case with the stock of a larger, more established company that trades on a national securities exchange and has a large public float. Stock markets in general have experienced extreme volatility recently that has at times been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. Many of these factors are beyond our control and may decrease the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance.\nFuture sales of our common stocks in the public market by management or our large stockholders could lower our stock price.\nThe members of our Board, our executive officers, and Dr. Santilli collectively beneficially own approximately 12.5% of our outstanding common stock (without the inclusion of outstanding options). If the members of our Board and officers sell, or indicate intent to sell, substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, the trading price of our common stock may decline significantly.\nOur operating results may fluctuate significantly, and these fluctuations may cause the price of our securities to fall.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly in the future due to a variety of factors that could affect our revenues or our expenses in any particular quarter. You should not rely on quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of future performance. Factors that may affect our quarterly results include:\n\u00b7 market acceptance of our products and those of our competitors;\n\u00b7 the sales and fulfillment cycle associated with our products, which is typically lengthy and subject to a number of significant risks over which we have little or no control, and the corresponding delay in our receipt of the associated revenue;\n\u00b7 our ability to complete the technical milestone tests associated with our commercial agreements;\n\u00b7 our ability to attract and retain key personnel;\n\u00b7 development of new designs and technologies; and\n\u00b7 our ability to manage our anticipated growth and expansion.\nWe have a significant number of warrants outstanding, and while these warrants are outstanding, it may be more difficult to raise additional equity capital. Additionally, certain of these warrants contain price-protection provisions that may result in the reduction of their exercise prices if certain transactions occur in the future.\nAs of March 18, 2016, we had outstanding warrants to purchase 7,702,819 shares of common stock. The holders of these warrants are given the opportunity to profit from a rise in the market price of our common stock. We may find it more difficult to raise additional equity capital while these warrants are outstanding. At any time during which these warrants are likely to be exercised, we may be unable to obtain additional equity capital on more favorable terms from other sources. Furthermore, the majority of these warrants contain price-protection provisions under which, if we were to issue securities in conjunction with a merger, tender offer, sale of assets or reclassification of our common stock at a price lower than the exercise price of such warrants, the exercise price of the warrants would be reduced, with certain exceptions, to the lower price. Additionally, the exercise of these warrants will cause the increase of our outstanding shares of our common stock, which could have the effect of substantially diluting the interests of our current stockholders.\nWe are an emerging growth company within the meaning of the Securities Act, and if we decide to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, our common stock could be less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, or the JOBS Act. For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We could be an emerging growth company through December 31, 2017, although we could lose that status sooner if our revenues exceed $1 billion, if we issue more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt in a three year period, or if the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, in which case we would no longer be an emerging growth company as of the following December 31. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nUnder the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies may also delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.\nThe price of shares of our common stock may not reflect our value and there can be no assurance that there will be an active market for our shares of common stock now or in the future.\nThe price of our common stock, when traded, may not reflect our value. There can be no assurance that there will be an active market for our shares of common stock either now or in the future. Market liquidity will depend on the perception of our operating business and any steps that our management might take to bring us to the awareness of investors. There can be no assurance given that there will be any awareness generated. Consequently, investors may not be able to liquidate their investment or liquidate it at a price that reflects the value of the business. As a result, holders of our securities may have difficulty finding purchasers for our shares should they attempt to sell shares held by them. Even if a more active market should develop, the price of our shares of common stock may be highly volatile. Our shares should be purchased only by investors having no need for liquidity in their investment and who can hold our shares for an indefinite period of time.\nOn December 11, 2014, the Company received notification from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (\u201cNasdaq\u201d) indicating that the Company\u2019s common stock was subject to potential delisting from the Nasdaq because for a period of thirty (30) consecutive business days, the bid price of the Company\u2019s common stock had closed below the minimum $1. 00 per share requirement for continued inclusion under Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 5550(a)(2)(the \u201cBid Price Rule\u201d). The notification had no immediate effect on the listing or trading of the common stock on the Nasdaq.\nNasdaq sent a notice to the Company on June 1, 2015 that the Company had regained compliance because the bid price of the Company\u2019s common stock closed at $1.00 per share or more for a minimum of ten consecutive business days.\nNo assurances can be made that our common stock will remain listed on Nasdaq Capital Market. If we are not able to comply with the Nasdaq Capital requirements, our common stock will be delisted from Nasdaq and our common stock would likely be quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board or on the OTC Pink Sheets. As a consequence of any such delisting, a stockholder would likely find it more difficult to dispose of, or to obtain accurate quotations as to the prices of our common stock. Also, a delisting of our common stock would adversely affect our ability to obtain financing for the continuation of our operations and harm our business.\nIf and when a larger trading market for our common stock develops, the market price of our common stock is still likely to be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations, and you may be unable to resell your shares at or above the price at which you acquired them.\nThe market price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a number of factors that are beyond our control, including, but not limited to:\n\u00b7 Variations in our revenues and operating expenses;\n\u00b7 Actual or anticipated changes in the estimates of our operating results or changes in stock market analyst recommendations regarding our common stock, other comparable companies or our industry generally;\n\u00b7 Market conditions in our industry, the industries of our customers and the economy as a whole;\n\u00b7 Actual or expected changes in our growth rates or our competitors\u2019 growth rates;\n\u00b7 Developments in the financial markets and worldwide or regional economies;\n\u00b7 Announcements of innovations or new products or services by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7 Announcements by the government relating to regulations that govern our industry;\n\u00b7 Sales of our common stock or other securities by us or in the open market; and\n\u00b7 Changes in the market valuations of other comparable companies.\nWe currently have shares of preferred stock outstanding that limit the rights of holders of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock with designations, rights, and preferences determined from time to time by our board of directors. Accordingly, our board of directors is empowered, without stockholder approval, to issue preferred stock with dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights superior to those of holders of our common stock. For example, an issuance of shares of preferred stock could:\n\u00b7 adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our common stock;\n\u00b7 make it more difficult for a third party to gain control of us;\n\u00b7 discourage bids for our common stock at a premium; and\n\u00b7 limit or eliminate any payments that the holders of our common stock could expect to receive upon our liquidation; or otherwise adversely affect the market price or our common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock outstanding, which entitles the Santilli Family (as defined below) to voting rights in the aggregate of 100,000,000,000 votes. Such preferred stock has liquidation and dividend rights over common stock, which is not in excess of its par value. Further, the preferred stock does not have any conversion rights or mandatory redemption features. The rights, preferences and privileges granted to or imposed upon these shares of preferred stock significantly limit or impair the voting, dividend and liquidation rights of holders of our common stock.\nCertain members of our Board, their affiliates and our executive officers, as stockholders, control our company.\nThe members of our Board, our executive officers, and Dr. Santilli collectively beneficially own approximately 12.5% of our outstanding common stock (without the inclusion of outstanding options). As a result of this ownership, they have the ability to significantly influence all matters requiring approval by stockholders of our company, including the election of directors. In particular, Dr. Santilli, the former Chairman of our Board together with his spouse Carla Santilli (a member of our Board), beneficially own 6.25% of our outstanding common stock (without the inclusion of outstanding options). In addition to ownership of our common stock, Dr. Santilli and his spouse Carla Santilli, together with their children, Ermanno Santilli, our Chief Executive Officer, and Luisa Ingargiola, our Chief Financial Officer (the \u201cSantilli Family\u201d), beneficially maintain voting control over 100% of our outstanding 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, which entitles the Santilli Family to voting rights in the aggregate of 100,000,000,000 votes. As a result, the Santilli Family has the ability to significantly influence all matters requiring approval by stockholders of our company. This concentration of ownership also may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company that may be favored by other stockholders. This could prevent transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over current market prices.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about us, or publish negative reports about our business, our share price could decline.\nSecurities analysts from Northland Capital Markets currently cover our common stock but may not do so in the future. Our lack of analyst coverage might depress the price of our common stock and result in limited trading volume. If we do receive analyst coverage in the future, any negative reports published by such analysts could have similar effects.\nFuture issuance of our common stock could dilute the interests of existing stockholders.\nWe may issue additional shares of our common stock in the future. The issuance of a substantial amount of common stock could have the effect of substantially diluting the interests of our current stockholders. In addition, the sale of a substantial amount of common stock in the public market, either in the initial issuance or in a subsequent resale by the target company in an acquisition which received such common stock as consideration or by investors who acquired such common stock in a private placement could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nThe application of the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules to our common stock could limit trading activity in the market, and our stockholders may find it more difficult to sell their stock.\nOur common stock trades at less than $5. 00 per share and is therefore subject to the SEC\u2019s penny stock rules. Penny stocks generally are equity securities with a price of less than $5. 00. Penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document that provides information about penny stocks and the risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction, and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer\u2019s account. The broker-dealer must also make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser\u2019s written agreement to the transaction. These requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity, if any, in the secondary market for a security that becomes subject to the penny stock rules. The additional burdens imposed upon broker-dealers by such requirements may discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in our securities, which could severely limit their market price and liquidity. These requirements may restrict the ability of broker-dealers to sell our common stock and may affect your ability to resell our common stock.\nFINRA sales practice requirements may also limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to buy and sell our securities.\nIn addition to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules described above, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (\u201cFINRA\u201d) has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer\u2019s financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. The FINRA requirements may make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our securities, which may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to buy and sell our securities and have an adverse effect on the market for our securities.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future, and you must rely on increases in the market price of our common stock for returns on equity investment.\nFor the foreseeable future, we intend to retain any earnings to finance the development and expansion of our business, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock. Accordingly, investors must be prepared to rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation to earn an investment return, which may never occur. Investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our Board and will depend on our results of operations, financial condition, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors our Board deems relevant.\nOur certificate of incorporation, bylaws and the Delaware General Corporation Law may delay or deter a change of control transaction.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of deterring takeovers, such as those provisions authorizing our Board to issue, from time to time, any series of preferred stock and fix the designation, powers, preferences and rights of the shares of such series of preferred stock; prohibiting stockholders from acting by written consent in lieu of a meeting; requiring advance notice of stockholder intention to put forth director nominees or bring up other business at a stockholders\u2019 meeting; prohibiting stockholders from calling a special meeting of stockholders; requiring a 66 2/3% majority stockholder approval in order for stockholders to amend certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or adopt new bylaws; providing that, subject to the rights of preferred shares, the directors will be divided into three classes and the number of directors is to be fixed exclusively by our Board; and providing that none of our directors may be removed without cause. Section203 of the DGCL, from which we did not elect to opt out, provides that if a holder acquires 15% or more of our stock without prior approval of our Board, that holder will be subject to certain restrictions on its ability to acquire us within three years. These provisions may delay or deter a change of control of us, and could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 13556, "SIC": 2810, "TIC": "TRNX"}
