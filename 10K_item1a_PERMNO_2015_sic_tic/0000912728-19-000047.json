{"cik": "912728", "company": "FORWARD AIR CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-02-20", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nThe following are important risk factors that could affect our financial performance and could cause actual results for future periods to differ materially from our anticipated results or other expectations, including those expressed in any forward-looking statements made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or our other filings with the SEC or in oral presentations such as telephone conferences and webcasts open to the public. You should carefully consider the following factors and consider these in conjunction with \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Item 7 and our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes in Item 8.\nOverall economic conditions that reduce freight volumes could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and ability to achieve growth.\nWe are sensitive to changes in overall economic conditions that impact customer shipping volumes, industry freight demand and industry truck capacity. The transportation industry historically has experienced cyclical fluctuations in financial results due to economic recession, downturns in business cycles of our customers, interest rate fluctuations, inflation and other economic factors beyond our control. Changes in U.S. trade policy could lead to \u2018trade wars\u2019 impacting the volume of economic activity in the United States, and as a result, trucking freight volumes may be materially reduced. Such a reduction may materially and adversely affect our business. Deterioration in the economic environment subjects our business to various risks, including the following, that may have a material and adverse impact on our operating results and cause us not to maintain profitability or achieve growth:\n\u2022\nA reduction in overall freight volumes reduces our revenues and opportunities for growth. In addition, a decline in the volume of freight shipped due to a downturn in customers\u2019 business cycles or other factors (including our ability to assess dimensional-based weight increases) generally results in decreases in freight pricing and decreases in average revenue per pound of freight, as carriers compete for loads to maintain truck productivity.\n\u2022\nOur base transportation rates are determined based on numerous factors such as length of haul, weight per shipment and freight class. During economic downturns, we may also have to lower our base transportation rates based on competitive pricing pressures and market factors.\n\u2022\nSome of our customers may face economic difficulties and may not be able to pay us, and some may go out of business. In addition, some customers may not pay us as quickly as they have in the past, causing our working capital needs to increase.\n\u2022\nA significant number of our transportation providers may go out of business and we may be unable to secure sufficient equipment or other transportation services to meet our commitments to our customers.\n\u2022\nWe may not be able to appropriately adjust our expenses to changing market demands. In order to maintain high variability in our business model, it is necessary to adjust staffing levels to changing market demands. In periods of rapid change, it is more difficult to match our staffing levels to our business needs.\nIf we have difficulty attracting and retaining owner-operators or freight handlers, or are unable to contract with a sufficient number of third-party carriers to supplement our owner-operator fleet, our profitability and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe depend on owner-operators for most of our transportation needs. In 2018, owner-operators provided 49.2% of our purchased transportation. Competition for owner-operators is intense, and sometimes there are shortages of available owner-operators. In addition, a decline in the availability of trucks, tractors and trailers for owner-operator purchase or use may negatively affect our ability to hire, attract or retain available owner-operators. We also need a large number of freight handlers to operate our business efficiently. During periods of low unemployment in the areas where our terminals are located, we may have difficulty hiring and retaining a sufficient number of freight handlers. If we have difficulty attracting and retaining enough qualified freight handlers and owner-operators, we may be forced to increase wages and benefits or to increase the cost at which we contract with our owner-operators, either of which would increase our operating costs. This difficulty may also impede our ability to maintain our delivery schedules, which could make our service less competitive and force us to curtail our planned growth. A capacity deficit may lead to a loss of customers and a decline in the volume of freight we receive from customers.\nTo augment our fleet of owner-operators, from time to time we purchase transportation from third-party carriers at a higher cost. As with owner-operators, competition for third-party carriers is intense, and sometimes there are shortages of available third-party carriers. If we cannot secure a sufficient number of owner-operators and have to purchase transportation from third-party carriers, our operating costs will increase. If our labor and operating costs increase, we may be unable to offset the increased costs by increasing rates without adversely affecting our business. As a result, our profitability and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nA determination by regulators that our independent owner-operators are employees rather than independent contractors could expose us to various liabilities and additional ongoing expenses, and related litigation can subject us to substantial costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our financial condition.\nAt times, the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Labor and state authorities have asserted that owner-operators are \u201cemployees,\u201d rather than \u201cindependent contractors.\u201d In addition, the topic of the classification of individuals as employees or independent contractors has gained increased attention among the plaintiffs\u2019 bar. One or more governmental authorities may challenge our position that the owner-operators we use are not our employees. A determination by regulators that our independent owner-operators are employees rather than independent contractors could expose us to various liabilities and additional ongoing expenses, including but not limited to, employment-related expenses such as workers\u2019 compensation insurance coverage and reimbursement of work-related expenses. Our exposure could include prior period compensation, as well as potential liability for employee benefits and tax withholdings. In addition, certain states have recently seen numerous class action lawsuits filed against transportation companies that engage independent contractors, some of which have resulted in significant damage awards and/or monetary settlements for workers who have been allegedly misclassified as independent contractors. The legal and other costs associated with any of these matters can be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our financial condition.\nIf we fail to maintain our information technology systems, or if we fail to successfully implement new technology or enhancements, we may be at a competitive disadvantage and experience a decrease in revenues.\nWe rely heavily on our information technology systems to efficiently run our business, and they are a key component of our growth strategy and competitive advantage. We expect our customers to continue to demand more sophisticated, fully integrated information systems from their transportation providers. To keep pace with changing technologies and customer demands, we must correctly interpret and address market trends and enhance the features and functionality of our information technology systems in response to these trends, which may lead to significant ongoing software development costs. We may be unable to accurately determine the needs of our customers and the trends in the transportation services industry or to design and implement the appropriate features and functionality of our information technology systems in a timely and cost-effective manner, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage and result in a decline in our efficiency, decreased demand for our services and a corresponding decrease in our revenues. In addition, we could incur software development costs for technology that is ultimately not deployed and thus, would require us to write-off these costs, which would negatively impact our financial results. Furthermore, as technology improves, our customers may be able to find alternatives to our services for matching shipments with available freight hauling capacity.\nOur information technology systems can also play an integral role in managing our internal freight and transportation information and creating additional revenue opportunities including assessing available backhaul capacity. A failure to capture and utilize our internal freight and transportation information may impair our ability to service our existing customers or grow\nrevenue.\nOur information technology systems are dependent upon global communications providers, web browsers, telephone systems and other aspects of the Internet infrastructure that have experienced significant system failures and electrical outages in the past. While we take measures to ensure our major systems have redundant capabilities, our systems are susceptible to outages from fire, floods, power loss, telecommunications failures, data leakage, human error, break-ins, cyber-attacks and similar events. The occurrence of any of these events could disrupt or damage our information technology systems and hamper our internal operations, impede our customers\u2019 access to our information technology systems and adversely impact our customer service, volumes, and revenues and result in increased cost. In addition, we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future.\nOur information technology systems are subject to cybersecurity risks, some of which are beyond our control.\nWe depend on the proper functioning and availability of our information systems in operating our business, including communications and data processing systems. It is important that the data processed by these systems remains confidential, as it often includes competitive customer information, confidential customer transaction data, employee records, and key financial and operational results and statistics. Some of our software applications are utilized by third parties who provide outsourced administrative functions, which exposes us to additional cybersecurity risks. Although our information systems are protected through physical and software safeguards as well as backup systems considered appropriate by management, it is difficult to fully protect against the possibility of damage or breach created by cybersecurity attacks or other security attacks in every potential circumstance that may arise. As cybersecurity attacks are increasing in frequency and sophistication it becomes even more difficult to protect against a breach of our information systems.\nCybersecurity incidents that impact the availability, reliability, speed, accuracy, or other proper functioning of these information systems could have a significant impact on our operations. Failure to prevent or mitigate data loss or system intrusions from cybersecurity attacks, including system failure, security breach, disruption by malware, or other damage, could expose us or our vendors or customers to a risk of loss or misuse of such information, interrupt or delay our operations, damage our reputation, cause a loss of customers, result in litigation or potential liability for us and otherwise harm our business. Likewise, data privacy breaches by employees and others who access our systems may pose a risk that sensitive customer or vendor data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public, adversely impacting our customer service, employee relationships and our reputation.\nWe may have difficulty effectively managing our growth, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur growth strategy includes increasing freight volume from existing customers, expanding our service offerings and pursing strategic transactions. Our growth plans will place significant demands on our management and operating personnel. Our ability to manage our future growth effectively will require us to, among other things, regularly enhance our operating and management information systems, evaluate and change our service offerings and continue to attract, retain, train, motivate and manage key employees, including through training and development programs. If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nVolatility in fuel prices, shortages of fuel or the ineffectiveness of our fuel surcharge program can have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and profitability.\nWe are subject to risks associated with the availability and price of fuel. Fuel prices have fluctuated dramatically over recent years. Future fluctuations in the availability and price of fuel could adversely affect our results of operations. Fuel availability and prices can be impacted by factors beyond our control, such as natural or man-made disasters, adverse weather conditions, political events, disruption or failure of technology or information systems, price and supply decisions by oil producing countries and cartels, terrorist activities, armed conflict and world supply and demand imbalance. Over time we have been able to mitigate the impact of the fluctuations through our fuel surcharge programs. Our fuel surcharge rates are set weekly based on the national average for fuel prices as published by the U.S. Department of Energy and our fuel surcharge table. Our fuel surcharge revenue is the result of our fuel surcharge rates and the tonnage transiting our networks. There can be no assurance that our fuel surcharge revenue programs will be effective in the future as the fuel surcharge may not capture the entire amount of the increase in fuel prices. Additionally, decreases in fuel prices reduce the cost of transportation services and accordingly, could reduce our revenues and may reduce margins for certain lines of business. In addition to changing fuel prices, fluctuations in volumes and related load factors may subject us to volatility in our fuel surcharge revenue. Fuel shortages, changes in fuel prices and the potential volatility in fuel surcharge revenue may adversely impact our results of operations and overall profitability.\nBecause a portion of our network costs are fixed, any factors that result in a decrease in the volume or revenue per pound of freight shipped through our networks will adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur operations, particularly our networks of hubs and terminals, represent substantial fixed costs. As a result, any decline in the volume or revenue per pound of freight we handle will have an adverse effect on our operating margin and our results of operations. Several factors can result in such declines, including adverse business and economic conditions affecting shippers of freight as discussed above. In addition, volumes shipped through our network may be negatively impacted by lack of customer contractual obligations or cancellations of existing customer contracts. Typically, we do not enter into long-term contracts with our customers. Rather, our customer contracts typically allow for cancellation within 30 to 60 days. As a result, we cannot guarantee that our current customers will continue to utilize our services or that they will continue at the same levels. Any one of the foregoing factors that results in a decrease in the volume or revenue per pound of freight shipped will adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenue from a few major customers, the loss of one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFor the calendar year ended December 31, 2018, our top 10 customers, based on revenue, accounted for approximately 31% of our revenue. Our Expedited LTL, TLS and Intermodal segments typically do not have long-term contracts with their customers. While our Pool segment business may involve a long-term written contract, those contracts may contain cancellation clauses, and there is no assurance that our current customers will continue to utilize our services or continue at the same levels. A reduction in or termination of our services by one or more of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nWe operate in highly competitive and fragmented segments of our industry, and our business will suffer if we are unable to adequately address downward pricing pressures and other factors that may adversely affect our results of operations, growth prospects and profitability.\nThe segments of the freight transportation industry in which we participate are highly competitive, very fragmented and historically have few barriers to entry. We compete with a large number of other asset-light logistics companies, asset-based carriers, integrated logistics companies, and third-party freight brokers. To a lesser extent, we also compete with integrated air cargo carriers and passenger airlines. Our competition ranges from small operators that compete within a limited geographic area to companies with substantially greater financial and other resources, including greater freight capacity. We also face competition from freight forwarders who decide to establish their own networks to transport expedited ground freight, as well as from logistics companies, Internet matching services and Internet and third-party freight brokers, and new entrants to the market. In addition, customers can bring in-house some of the services we provide to them. We believe competition is based primarily on quality service, available capacity, on-time delivery, flexibility, reliability and security, transportation rates as well as the ability to acquire and maintain terminal facilities in desirable locations at reasonable rates. Many of our competitors periodically reduce their rates to gain business, especially during times of economic decline. In the past several years, several of our competitors have reduced their rates to unusually low levels that we believe are unsustainable in the long-term, but that may materially adversely affect our business in the short-term.\nIn addition, competitors may pursue other strategies to gain a competitive advantage such as developing superior information technology systems or establishing cooperative relationships to increase their ability to address customer needs. Furthermore, the transportation industry continues to consolidate. As a result of consolidation, our competitors may increase their market share and improve their financial capacity, and may strengthen their competitive positions. Business combinations could also result in competitors providing a wider variety of services at competitive prices, which could adversely affect our financial performance. These competitive pressures may cause a decrease in our volume of freight, require us to lower the prices we charge for our services and adversely affect our results of operations, growth prospects and profitability.\nOur results of operations will be materially and adversely affected if our new service offerings do not gain market acceptance or result in the loss of our current customer base.\nOne element of our growth strategy is to expand our service offerings to customers. As a result, we have added additional services in the past few years. We may not succeed in making our customers sufficiently aware of existing and future services or in creating customer acceptance of these services at the prices we would want to charge. In addition, we may be required to devote substantial resources to educate our customers, with no assurance that a sufficient number of customers will use our services for commercial success to be achieved. We may not identify trends correctly, or may not be able to bring new services to market as quickly, effectively or price-competitively as our competitors. In addition, new services may alienate existing customers or cause\nus to lose business to our competitors. If any of the foregoing occurs, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe have grown and may grow, in part, through acquisitions, which involve various risks, and we may not be able to identify or acquire companies consistent with our growth strategy or successfully integrate acquired businesses into our operations.\nWe have grown through acquisitions, and we intend to pursue opportunities to expand our business by acquiring other companies in the future. Acquisitions involve risks, including those relating to:\n\u2022\nidentification of appropriate acquisition candidates;\n\u2022\nnegotiation of acquisitions on favorable terms and valuations;\n\u2022\nintegration of acquired businesses and personnel;\n\u2022\nimplementation of proper business and accounting controls;\n\u2022\nability to obtain financing, at favorable terms or at all;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management attention;\n\u2022\nretention of employees and customers;\n\u2022\nnon-employee driver attrition;\n\u2022\nunexpected liabilities;\n\u2022\ndetrimental issues not discovered during due diligence.\nAcquisitions also may affect our short-term cash flow and net income as we expend funds, potentially increase indebtedness and incur additional expenses. If we are not able to identify or acquire companies consistent with our growth strategy, or if we fail to successfully integrate any acquired companies into our operations, we may not achieve anticipated increases in revenue, cost savings and economies of scale, our operating results may actually decline and acquired goodwill and intangibles may become impaired.\nWe could be required to record a material non-cash charge to income if our recorded intangible assets or goodwill are determined to be impaired.\nWe have $113.7 million of recorded net definite-lived intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2018. Our definite-lived intangible assets primarily represent the value of customer relationships and non-compete agreements that were recorded in conjunction with our various acquisitions. We review our long-lived assets, such as our definite-lived intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Impairment is recognized on these assets when the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value. If such measurement indicates impairment, we would be required to record a non-cash impairment charge to our consolidated statement of comprehensive income in the amount that the carrying value of these assets exceed the estimated fair value of the assets.\nWe also have recorded goodwill of $199.1 million on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2018. Goodwill is assessed for impairment annually (or more frequently if circumstances indicate possible impairment) for each of our reporting units. This assessment includes comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to the carrying value of the assets assigned to each reporting unit. If the carrying value of the reporting unit was to exceed our estimated fair value of the reporting unit, we would then be required to estimate the fair value of the individual assets and liabilities within the reporting unit to ascertain the amount of fair value of goodwill and any potential impairment. If we determine that our fair value of goodwill is less than the related book value, we could be required to record a non-cash impairment charge to our consolidated statement of comprehensive income, which could have a material adverse effect on our earnings.\nWe are dependent on our senior management team and other key employees, and the loss of any such personnel could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur future performance depends, in significant part, upon the continued service of our senior management team and other key employees. We cannot be certain that we can retain these employees. The loss of the services of one or more of these or other key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition if we are unable to secure replacement personnel internally or through our recruitment programs and initiatives that have sufficient experience in our industry or in the management of our business. If we fail to develop, compensate, and retain a core group of senior management and other key employees and address issues of succession planning, it could hinder our ability to execute on our business strategies and maintain our level of service.\nClaims for property damage, personal injuries or workers\u2019 compensation and related expenses could significantly reduce our earnings.\nUnder DOT regulations, we are liable for property damage and personal injuries caused by owner-operators and Company-employed drivers while they are operating on our behalf. Additionally, from time to time, the drivers employed and engaged by the third-party transportation carriers we contract with are involved in accidents, which may result in serious personal injuries. The resulting types and/or amounts of damages may be excluded by or exceed the amount of insurance coverage maintained by the contracted carrier. Although these drivers are not our employees and all of these drivers are employees, owner-operators, or independent contractors working for carriers, from time to time, claims may be asserted against us for their actions, or for our actions in retaining them.\nWe currently maintain liability insurance coverage that we believe is adequate to cover third-party claims. We have a self-insured retention (\"SIR\") of $3.0 million per occurrence for vehicle and general liability claims and will be responsible for any damages and personal injuries below that self-insured amount. We are also responsible for varying annual aggregate deductible amounts of liability for claims in excess of the SIR/deductible. For the policy year that began April 1, 2018, we have an annual $6.0 million aggregate deductible for claims between $3.0 million and $5.0 million. We also have a $2.5 million aggregate deductible for claims between $5.0 million and $10.0 million. As a result, we are responsible for the first $7.5 million per claim, until we meet the $6.0 million aggregate deductible for claims between $3.0 million and $5.0 million and the $2.5 million aggregate deductible for claims between $5.0 million and $10.0 million. This insurance covers claims for the LTL Expedited and Pool Distribution segments. TLS maintains separate liability insurance coverage for claims between $0 and $5.0 million, and for the policy year that began April 1, 2018, TLS had no SIR for claims in this layer. Intermodal maintains separate liability insurance coverage for all liability claims. For the policy year that began April 1, 2018, Intermodal had an SIR of $50 thousand for each claim. We cannot guarantee that our SIR levels will not increase and/or that we have to agree to more unfavorable policy terms as a result of market conditions, poor claims experience or other factors.\nWe may also be subject to claims for workers\u2019 compensation. We maintain workers\u2019 compensation insurance coverage that we believe is adequate to cover such claims. We have a SIR of approximately $0.4 million for each such claim, except in Ohio, where we are a qualified self-insured entity with an approximately $0.5 million SIR. We could incur claims in excess of our policy limits or incur claims not covered by our insurance. Any claims beyond the limits or scope of our insurance coverage may have a material adverse effect on us. Because we do not carry \u201cstop loss\u201d insurance, a significant increase in the number of claims that we must cover under our self-insurance retainage could adversely affect our profitability. In addition, we may be unable to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts or scope to protect us against losses.\nWe face risks related to self-insurance and third-party insurance that can be volatile to our earnings.\nWe self-insure a significant portion of our claims exposure and related expenses for cargo loss, employee medical expense, bodily injury, workers\u2019 compensation and property damage, and maintain insurance with insurance companies above our limits of self-insurance. Self-insurance retention and other limitations are detailed in Part II, Item 7, under \u201cSelf-Insurance Loss Reserves.\u201d Our large self-insured retention limits can make our insurance and claims expense higher or more volatile. Additionally, if our third-party insurance carriers or underwriters leave the trucking sector, as was the case during 2017, or if they decline to renew us as an insured, it could materially increase our insurance costs or collateral requirements, or create difficulties in finding insurance in excess of our self-insured retention limits. Additionally, we could find it necessary to raise our self-insured retention, pay higher premiums or decrease our aggregate coverage limits when our policies are renewed or replaced, any of which will negatively impact our earnings.\nWe accrue for the costs of the uninsured portion of pending claims, based on the nature and severity of individual claims and historical claims development trends. Estimating the number and severity of claims, as well as related judgment or settlement amounts is inherently difficult. This, along with legal expenses, incurred but not reported claims, and other uncertainties can cause unfavorable differences between actual self-insurance costs and our reserve estimates.\nOur business is subject to seasonal trends.\nHistorically, our operating results have been subject to seasonal trends when measured on a quarterly basis. Our first and second quarters have traditionally been the weakest compared to our third and fourth quarters. This trend is dependent on numerous factors including economic conditions, customer demand and weather. Because revenue is directly related to the available working days of shippers, national holidays and the number of business days during a given period may also create seasonal impact on our results of operations. After the winter holiday season and during the remaining winter months, our freight volumes are typically lower because some customers reduce shipment levels. In addition, a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from customers in industries whose shipping patterns are tied closely to consumer demand which can sometimes be difficult to predict\nor are based on just-in-time production schedules. Therefore, our revenue is, to a large degree, affected by factors that are outside of our control. There can be no assurance that our historic operating patterns will continue in future periods as we cannot influence or forecast many of these factors.\nOur results of operations may be affected by harsh weather conditions and disasters.\nCertain weather-related conditions such as ice and snow can disrupt our operations. Our operating expenses have historically been higher in the winter months because of cold temperatures and other adverse winter weather conditions, which result in decreased fuel efficiency, increased cold weather-related maintenance costs of revenue equipment and increased insurance and claims costs. Harsh weather could also reduce our ability to transport freight, which could result in decreased revenues. Disasters, whether natural or man-made can also adversely affect our performance by reducing demand and reducing our ability to transport freight, which could result in decreased revenue and increased operating expenses.\nWe operate in a regulated industry, and increased costs of compliance with, or liability for violation of, existing or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe DOT and various state and federal agencies have been granted broad regulatory powers over our business in the United States, and we are licensed by the DOT and U.S. Customs. Additionally, our Canada business activities are subject to the similar laws and regulations of Canada and its provinces. If we fail to comply with any applicable regulations, our licenses may be revoked or we could be subject to substantial fines or penalties and to civil and criminal liability. The transportation industry is subject to legislative and regulatory changes that can affect the economics of our business by requiring changes in operating practices or influencing the demand for, and the cost of providing, transportation services.\nIn December 2010, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (\u201cFMCSA\u201d) established the Compliance Safety Accountability (\u201cCSA\u201d) motor carrier oversight program under which drivers and fleets are evaluated based on certain safety-related standards. Carriers\u2019 safety and fitness ratings under CSA include the on-road safety performance of the carriers\u2019 drivers. The FMCSA has also implemented changes to the hours of service (\u201cHOS\u201d) regulations which govern the work hours of commercial drivers and adopted a rule that requires commercial drivers who use paper log books to maintain hours-of-service records with electronic logging devices (\u201cELDs\u201d) and will require commercial drivers who use automatic on-board recording devices (\u201cAOBRDs\u201d) to record HOS to use ELDs by December 2019. The vast majority of our companies\u2019 fleets utilize AOBRDs, and we are currently in the process of updating our fleets to meet the ELD requirement deadline of December 2019. At any given time, there are also other proposals for safety-related standards that are pending legislative or administrative approval or adoption. If additional or more stringent standards are adopted, such may result in a reduction of the pool of qualified drivers available to us and to other motor carriers in our industry. If we experience safety and fitness violations, our safety and fitness scores could be adversely impacted and our fleets could be ranked poorly as compared to our peers. A reduction in our safety and fitness scores or those of our contracted drivers could also reduce our competitiveness in relation to other companies that have higher scores. Additionally, competition for qualified drivers and motor carriers with favorable safety ratings may increase and thus result in increases in driver-related compensation costs.\nIn addition, there may be changes in applicable federal or state tax or other laws or interpretations of those laws. If this happens, we may incur additional taxes, as well as higher workers\u2019 compensation and employee benefit costs, and possibly penalties and interest for prior periods. This could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe are subject to various environmental laws and regulations, and costs of compliance with, or liabilities for violations of, existing or future laws and regulations could significantly increase our costs of doing business.\nOur operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations dealing with, among other things, the handling of hazardous materials, discharge and retention of stormwater, and emissions from our vehicles. We operate in industrial areas, where truck terminals and other industrial activities are located, and where groundwater or other forms of environmental contamination may have occurred. Our operations involve the risks of fuel spillage, environmental damage, and hazardous waste disposal, among others. If we are involved in a spill or other accident involving hazardous substances, or if we are found to be in violation of applicable environmental laws or regulations, it could significantly increase our cost of doing business. Under specific environmental laws and regulations, we could be held responsible for all of the costs relating to any contamination at our past or present terminals and at third-party waste disposal sites. If we fail to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations, we could be subject to substantial fines or penalties and to civil and criminal liability.\nIn addition, as global warming issues become more prevalent, federal and local governments and our customers are beginning to respond to these issues. This increased focus on sustainability may result in new regulations and customer requirements that could negatively affect us. This could cause us to incur additional direct costs or to make changes to our operations in order\nto comply with any new regulations and customer requirements, as well as increased indirect costs or loss of revenue resulting from, among other things, our customers incurring additional compliance costs that affect our costs and revenues. We could also lose revenue if our customers divert business from us because we have not complied with their sustainability requirements. These costs, changes and loss of revenue could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Even without any new legislation or regulation, increased public concern regarding greenhouse gases emitted by transportation carriers could harm the reputations of companies operating in the transportation logistics industries and shift consumer demand toward more locally sourced products and away from our services.\nThe FMCSA\u2019s CSA initiative could adversely impact our ability to hire qualified drivers or contract with qualified owner-operators or third-party carriers, meet our growth projections and maintain our customer relationships, each of which could adversely impact our results of operations.\nThe FMCSA\u2019s Compliance, Safety, Accountability initiative (\u201cCSA\u201d) is an enforcement and compliance program designed to monitor and improve commercial motor vehicle safety by measuring the safety record of both the motor carrier and the driver. These measurements are scored and used by the FMCSA to identify potential safety risks and to direct enforcement action. CSA scores are dependent upon safety and compliance experience, which could change at any time. In addition, the safety standards prescribed in CSA could change and our ability as well as our independent contractors\u2019 ability to maintain an acceptable score could be adversely impacted. Public disclosure of certain CSA scores was restricted through the enactment of the Fixing America\u2019s Surface Transportation Act of 2015 (the \u201cFAST Act\u201d) on December 4, 2015; however, the FAST Act does not restrict public disclosure of all data collected by the FMCSA. If we receive unacceptable CSA scores, and this data is made available to the public, our relationships with our customers could be damaged, which could result in a loss of business.\nThe requirements of CSA could also shrink the industry\u2019s pool of drivers as those with unfavorable scores could leave the industry. As a result, the costs to attract, train and retain qualified drivers, owner-operators or third-party carriers could increase. In addition, a shortage of qualified drivers could increase driver turnover, decrease asset utilization, limit growth and adversely impact our results of operations.\nIf our employees were to unionize, our operating costs would likely increase.\nNone of our employees is currently represented by a collective bargaining agreement. However, we have no assurance that our employees will not unionize in the future, which could increase our operating costs and force us to alter our operating methods. This could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nOur charter and bylaws and provisions of Tennessee law could discourage or prevent a takeover that may be considered favorable.\nOur charter and bylaws and provisions of Tennessee law may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or change in control that may be considered favorable. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for shareholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. Among other things, these provisions:\n\u2022\nauthorize us to issue preferred stock, the terms of which may be determined at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors and may adversely affect the voting or economic rights of our shareholders; and\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the Board of Directors and for proposing matters that can be acted on by shareholders at a meeting.\nOur charter and bylaws and provisions of Tennessee law may discourage transactions that otherwise could provide for the payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our Common Stock and also could limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our Common Stock.\nOur financing costs may be adversely affected by changes in LIBOR.\nLIBOR, the London interbank offered rate, is the basic rate of interest used in lending between banks on the London interbank market and is widely used as a reference for setting the interest rate on loans globally. We use LIBOR as a reference rate in our revolving credit facility to calculate interest due to our lender. On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced its intention to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. It is unclear if LIBOR will cease to exist at that time or if new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021. If LIBOR ceases to exist, we may need to renegotiate our credit agreement with our lender. This could have an adverse effect on our financing costs.", "PERMNO": 79841, "SIC": 4210, "TIC": "FWRD"}
