{"cik": "1070154", "company": "STERLING BANCORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-02-27", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nChanges in laws, government regulation and monetary policy may have a material effect on our results of operations.\nFinancial institutions are the subject of significant legislative and regulatory laws, rules and regulations and may be subject to further additional legislation, rulemaking or regulation in the future, none of which is within our control. Significant new laws, rules or regulations or changes in, or repeals of, existing laws, rules or regulations, including, but not limited to, those with respect to federal and state taxation and the Dodd-Frank Act, may cause our results of operations to differ materially. In addition, the costs and burden of compliance have significantly increased and could adversely affect our ability to operate profitably. Further, federal monetary policy significantly affects credit conditions for the Bank, as well as for our borrowers, particularly as implemented through the Federal Reserve System, primarily through open market operations in U.S. government securities, the discount rate for bank borrowings and reserve requirements. A material change in any of these conditions could have a material impact on the Bank or our borrowers, and therefore on our results of operations.\nLegislative and regulatory initiatives to support the financial services industry have been coupled with numerous restrictions and requirements that could detrimentally affect our business.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder have and continue to significantly impact the United States bank regulatory structure and affect the lending, deposit, investment, trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act significantly impacts the various consumer protection laws, rules and regulations applicable to financial institutions. First, it rolls back the federal preemption of state consumer protection laws that was enjoyed by national banks by (1) requiring that a state consumer financial law prevent or significantly interfere with the exercise of a national bank\u2019s powers before it can be preempted, (2) mandating that any preemption decision be made on a case by case basis rather than a blanket rule, and (3) ending the applicability of preemption to subsidiaries and affiliates of national banks. As a result, we may be subject to state consumer protection laws in each state where we do business, and those laws may be interpreted and enforced differently in each state. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act created the CFPB, which has assumed responsibility for supervising financial institutions which have assets of $10 billion or more for their compliance with the principal federal consumer protection laws, such as the Truth in Lending Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and the Truth in Savings Act, among others (institutions which have assets of $10 billion or less will continue to be supervised in this area by their primary federal regulators). The Bank\u2019s total assets exceed $10 billion, thus making it subject to the CFPB\u2019s supervision. Therefore, in addition to a variety of consumer protection laws, rules and regulations that we may be subject to, the Bank is also subject to the CFPB\u2019s evolving regulations and practices.\nThe scope and impact of many of the Dodd-Frank Act provisions, including the authority provided to the CFPB, will continue to be determined over time as rules and regulations are issued and become effective. As a result, we cannot predict the ultimate impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on us at this time, including the extent to which it could increase costs or limit our ability to pursue business opportunities in an efficient manner, or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and our ability to pay dividends or repurchase shares. However, it is expected that at a minimum they will increase our operating and compliance costs.\nIn addition, as a result of the Volcker Rule, banking entities are prohibited from, among other things, engaging in short-term proprietary trading of securities, derivatives, commodity futures and options on these instruments for their own account; or owning, sponsoring, or having certain relationships with \u201ccovered funds,\u201d including hedge funds or private equity funds. The Volcker Rule also requires covered banking entities, including us and the Bank, to implement certain compliance programs, policies and procedures. We have implemented compliance programs, policies and procedures to assist us in our compliance with the Volcker Rule.\nCompliance with the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act, including the Volcker Rule, may necessitate that we hire additional compliance or other personnel, design and implement additional internal controls, or incur other significant expenses, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations and our ability to pay dividends or repurchase shares.\nWe are subject to extensive regulatory oversight.\nWe and our subsidiaries are subject to extensive supervision and regulation. We are supervised and regulated by the Federal Reserve and the Bank is supervised and regulated by the OCC, as its primary federal regulator, by the FDIC, as the insurer of its deposits, and the CFPB, which has broad authority to regulate financial service providers and financial products. The application of laws, rules and\nregulations may vary as administered primarily by the Federal Reserve and the OCC. In addition, we are subject to consolidated capital requirements and must serve as a source of strength to the Bank.\nAs a result, we are limited in the manner in which we conduct our business, undertake new investments and activities and obtain financing. This regulatory structure is designed primarily for the protection of the DIF and our depositors, as well as other consumers and not to benefit our shareholders. This regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to capital levels, the timing and amount of dividend payments, the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes, all of which can have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and our ability to pay dividends or repurchase shares. Our regulators have also intensified their focus on bank lending criteria and controls, and on the USA PATRIOT Act\u2019s anti-money laundering and Bank Secrecy Act compliance requirements. There is also increased scrutiny of our compliance with the rules enforced by the Office of Foreign Assets Control. In order to comply with laws, rules, regulations, guidelines and examination procedures in the anti-money laundering area, we have been required to adopt new policies and procedures and to install new systems. We cannot be certain that the policies, procedures and systems we have in place to ensure compliance are without error, and there is no assurance that in every instance we are in full compliance with these requirements.\nOur failure to comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations could result in a range of sanctions, legal proceedings and enforcement actions, including the imposition of civil monetary penalties, formal agreements and cease and desist orders. In addition, the OCC and the FDIC have specific authority to take \u201cprompt corrective action,\u201d depending on our capital levels. For example, currently, we are considered \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d for prompt corrective action purposes. If we are designated by the OCC as \u201cadequately capitalized,\u201d we would become subject to additional restrictions and limitations, such as the Bank\u2019s ability to take brokered deposits becoming limited. If we were to be designated by the OCC in one of the lower capital levels (such as \u201cundercapitalized,\u201d \u201csignificantly undercapitalized\u201d or \u201ccritically undercapitalized\u201d), we would be required to raise additional capital and also would be subject to progressively more severe restrictions on our operations; management, including the replacement of senior executive officers and directors; and capital distributions; and, if we became \u201ccritically undercapitalized,\u201d to the appointment of a conservator or receiver.\nIn addition, and as mentioned above in \u201cRisk Factors - Legislative and regulatory initiatives to support the financial services industry have been coupled with numerous restrictions and requirements that could detrimentally affect our business,\u201d the Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing regulations impose various additional requirements on bank holding companies with $10 billion or more in total assets, including compliance with portions of the Federal Reserve\u2019s enhanced prudential oversight requirements and annual stress testing requirements. Compliance with the annual stress testing requirements, which shall apply to the Company and the Bank for the first time in 2017, part of which must be publicly disclosed, may also be misinterpreted by the market generally or our customers and, as a result, may adversely affect our stock price or our ability to retain our customers or effectively compete for new business opportunities. Further, we may incur compliance-related costs and our regulators may also consider our level of compliance with these regulatory requirements when examining our operations generally or considering any request for regulatory approval we may make, even requests for approvals on unrelated matters.\nBasel III capital rules generally require insured depository institutions and their holding companies to hold more capital, which could limit our ability to pay dividends, engage in share repurchases and pay discretionary bonuses.\nThe Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the OCC adopted final rules for the Basel III capital framework which substantially amended the regulatory risk-based capital rules applicable to us. The rules phase in over time becoming fully effective in 2019. The rules apply to us as well as to the Bank. Beginning in 2016, a capital conservation buffer will phase in over three years, ultimately resulting in a requirement of 2.5% on top of the common Tier 1, Tier 1 and total capital requirements, resulting in a required common Tier 1 equity ratio of 7%, a Tier 1 ratio of 8.5%, and a total capital ratio of 10.5%. Failure to satisfy any of these three capital requirements will result in limits on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases and paying discretionary bonuses. These limitations will establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions.\nGeneral economic conditions in our market area could adversely affect us.\nWe are affected by the general economic conditions in the local markets in which we operate. Several years ago, the market experienced a significant downturn in which we saw falling home prices, rising foreclosures and an increased level of commercial and consumer delinquencies. Although the economic conditions have improved, real estate prices have rebounded and consumer confidence has shown improvement, the economy remains in a slow-growth mode in many respects. A return to elevated levels of unemployment, declines in the values of real estate, or other events that affect household and/or corporate incomes could impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans in accordance with their terms and reduce demand for our products and services and increase our problem assets, foreclosures and loan losses. Future economic conditions in our market will depend on factors outside of\nour control such as political and market conditions, broad trends in industry and finance, legislative and regulatory changes, changes in government, monetary and fiscal policies and inflation, any of which could negatively affect our performance and financial condition.\nAn inadequate allowance for loan losses would negatively impact our results of operations.\nWe are exposed to the risk that our customers will be unable to repay their loans according to their terms and that any collateral securing the payment of their loans will not be sufficient to avoid losses. Credit losses are inherent in the lending business and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Volatility and deterioration in the broader economy may also increase our risk of credit losses. The determination of an appropriate level of allowance for loan losses is an inherently uncertain process and is based on numerous assumptions. The amount of future losses is susceptible to changes in economic, operating and other conditions, including changes in interest rates, that may be beyond our control, and charge-offs may exceed current estimates. We evaluate the collectability of our loan portfolio and provide an allowance for loan losses that we believe is adequate based upon such factors as, including, but not limited to: the risk characteristics of various classifications of loans; previous loan loss experience; specific loans that have loss potential; delinquency trends; the estimated fair market value of the collateral; current economic conditions; the views of our regulators; and geographic and industry loan concentrations. If any of our evaluations are incorrect and/or borrower defaults result in losses exceeding our allowance for loan losses, our results of operations could be significantly and adversely affected. We cannot assure you that our allowance will be adequate to cover probable loan losses inherent in our portfolio.\nThe need to account for assets at market prices may adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe report certain assets, including investments and securities, at fair value. Generally, for assets that are reported at fair value we use quoted market prices or valuation models that utilize market data inputs to estimate fair value. Because we carry these assets on our books at their fair value, we may incur losses even if the assets in question present minimal credit risk. We may be required to recognize other-than-temporary impairments in future periods with respect to securities in our portfolio. The amount and timing of any impairment recognized will depend on the severity and duration of the decline in fair value of the securities and our estimation of the anticipated recovery period.\nChanges in the value of goodwill and intangible assets could reduce our earnings.\nThe Company accounts for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d), which, in general, requires that goodwill not be amortized, but rather that it be tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level using the two step approach. Testing for impairment of goodwill and intangible assets is performed annually and involves the identification of reporting units and the estimation of fair values. The estimation of fair values involves a high degree of judgment and subjectivity in the assumptions used. As of December 31, 2016, the fair value of Sterling Bancorp shares exceeds the recorded book value. Changes in the local and national economy, the federal and state legislative and regulatory environments for financial institutions, the stock market, interest rates and other external factors (such as natural disasters or significant world events) may occur from time to time, often with great unpredictability, and may materially impact the fair value of publicly traded financial institutions and could result in an impairment charge at a future date.\nCommercial real estate, commercial & industrial and ADC (as defined below) loans expose us to increased risk and earnings volatility.\nWe consider our commercial real estate loans, commercial & industrial loans and ADC loans to be higher risk categories in our loan portfolio. These loans are particularly sensitive to economic conditions. At December 31, 2016, our portfolio of commercial real estate loans, including multi-family loans, totaled $4.1 billion, or 43.5% of total loans, our portfolio of commercial & industrial loans (including traditional C&I, asset-based lending, payroll finance, warehouse lending, factored receivables, equipment finance and public sector finance) totaled $4.2 billion, or 43.8% of total loans, and our portfolio of ADC loans totaled $230.1 million, or 2.4% of total loans. We plan to continue to emphasize the origination of these types of loans, other than acquisition and development loans. We originate vertical construction loans to well qualified builders, generally in our market area. Since 2011, we deemphasized acquisition and development lending activity.\nCommercial mortgage loans generally involve a higher degree of credit risk than residential loans because they typically have larger balances and are more affected by adverse conditions in the economy. Because payments on loans secured by commercial real estate often depend on the successful operation and management of the businesses which hold the loans, repayment of such loans may be affected by factors outside the borrower\u2019s control, such as adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy or changes in government regulation. In the case of commercial & industrial loans, although we strive to maintain high credit standards and limit exposure to any one borrower, the collateral for these loans often consists of accounts receivable, inventory and equipment. This type of collateral typically does not yield substantial recovery in the event we need to foreclose on it and may rapidly deteriorate, disappear, or be misdirected in advance of foreclosure. This adds to the potential that our charge-offs will be more volatile than we have\nexperienced in the past, which could significantly negatively affect our earnings in any quarter. In addition, some of our ADC loans pose higher risk levels than the levels expected at origination, as projects may stall or sell at prices lower than expected. We continue to seek pay downs on loans with or without sales activity. In addition, many of our borrowers also have more than one commercial real estate or ADC loan outstanding with us. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship may expose us to significantly greater risk of loss.\nWhile this portfolio may cause us to incur additional bad debt expense even if losses are not realized, such ADC loans only comprise 2.4% of our loan portfolio.\nOur continuing concentration of loans in our primary market area may increase our risk.\nOur success depends primarily on the general economic conditions in the counties in which we conduct most of our business. Most of our loans and deposits are generated from customers primarily in the New York Metro Market, which includes Manhattan, the boroughs and Long Island, and certain portions of the New York Suburban Market including Rockland, Westchester and Orange Counties in New York. We also have a presence in Ulster, Sullivan and Putnam Counties in New York and in Bergen County, New Jersey, as well as other counties in northern New Jersey. Our expansion into New York City and continued growth in Westchester County and Bergen County has helped us diversify our geographic concentration with respect to our lending activities. Deterioration in economic conditions in our market area would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nEnvironmental liability associated with our lending activities could result in losses.\nIn the course of business, we may acquire, through foreclosure, properties securing loans originated or purchased that are in default. Particularly in commercial real estate lending, there is a risk that material environmental violations could be discovered on these properties. In this event, we might be required to remedy these violations at the affected properties at our sole cost and expense. The cost of remedial action could substantially exceed the value of affected properties. We may not have adequate remedies against the prior owner or other responsible parties and could find it difficult or impossible to sell the affected properties. These events could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in market interest rates could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur financial condition and results of operations are significantly affected by changes in market interest rates. Our results of operations substantially depend on our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income that we earn on our interest-earning assets and the interest expense that we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities. In recent years, our balance sheet has become more asset sensitive because our assets mature or re-price at a faster pace than our liabilities. If interest rates were to continue at existing levels or decline, net interest income would be adversely affected as asset yields would be expected to decline at faster rates than deposit or borrowing costs. A decline in net interest income may also occur, offsetting a portion or all gains in net interest income from assets re-pricing and increases in volume, if competitive market pressures limit our ability to maintain or lag deposit costs. Wholesale funding costs may also increase at a faster pace than asset re-pricing.\nWe also are subject to reinvestment risk associated with changes in interest rates. Changes in interest rates may affect the average life of loans and securities. Decreases in interest rates often result in increased prepayments of loans and securities, as borrowers refinance their loans to reduce borrowings costs. Under these circumstances, we are subject to reinvestment risk to the extent that we are unable to reinvest the cash received from such prepayments in loans or other investments that have interest rates that are comparable to the interest rates on existing loans and securities. Additionally, increases in interest rates may decrease loan demand and/or may make it more difficult for borrowers to repay adjustable rate loans.\nChanges in interest rates also affect the value of our interest earning assets and in particular our securities portfolio. Generally, the value of our securities fluctuates inversely with changes in interest rates. As of December 31, 2016, our available for sale securities portfolio totaled $1.7 billion. Decreases in the fair value of securities available for sale could have an adverse effect on stockholders\u2019 equity and comprehensive income.\nOur ability to pay dividends is subject to regulatory limitations and other limitations which may affect our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders or to repurchase our common stock.\nWe are a separate legal entity from our subsidiary, the Bank, and we do not have significant operations of our own. The availability of dividends from the Bank is limited by various statutes and regulations. It is possible, depending upon the financial condition of the Bank and other factors, that the Bank\u2019s regulators could assert that payment of dividends or other payments may result in an unsafe or unsound practice. In addition, under the Dodd-Frank Act, we are subjected to consolidated capital requirements and must serve as a source of strength to the Bank. If the Bank is unable to pay dividends to us or we are required to retain capital or contribute capital to the Bank, we may not be able to pay dividends on our common stock or to repurchase shares of common stock.\nA breach of information security could negatively affect our earnings.\nIncreasingly, we depend upon data processing, communication and information exchange on a variety of computing platforms and networks, and over the Internet from both internal sources and external, third-party vendors. We may be required to spend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches and computer viruses, or to alleviate problems caused by security breaches or viruses. While to date we have not been subject to material cyber-attacks or other cyber incidents, we cannot guarantee all our systems are free from vulnerability to attack, despite safeguards we and our vendors have instituted. In addition, disruptions to our vendors\u2019 systems may arise from events that are wholly or partially beyond our and our vendors\u2019 control (including, for example, computer viruses or electrical or telecommunications outages). If information security is breached, despite the controls we and our third-party vendors have instituted, information can be lost or misappropriated, resulting in financial losses or costs to us or damages to others. These costs or losses could materially exceed the amount of insurance coverage we have, if any, which would adversely affect our earnings. If significant, sustained or repeated, a system breach, failure or service disruption could compromise our ability to operate effectively, damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, and/or subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and therefore on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to competition from both banks and non-bank companies.\nThe financial services industry, including commercial banking, is highly competitive, and we encounter strong competition for deposits, loans and other financial services in our market area. Our principal competitors include commercial banks, savings banks and savings and loan associations, mutual funds, money market funds, finance companies, trust companies, insurers, leasing companies, credit unions, mortgage companies, real estate investment trusts (REITs), private issuers of debt obligations, venture capital firms, and suppliers of other investment alternatives, such as securities firms. Many of our non-bank competitors are not subject to the same degree of regulation as we are and have advantages over us in providing certain services. Many of our competitors are significantly larger than we are and have greater access to capital and other resources.\nIn addition, financial products and services have become increasingly technology-driven. Our ability to meet the needs of our customers competitively, and in a cost-efficient manner, is dependent on the ability to keep pace with technological advances and to invest in new technology as it becomes available. Many of our competitors have greater resources to invest in technology than we do and may be better equipped to market new technology-driven products and services. The ability to keep pace with technological change is important, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business and therefore on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to make opportunistic acquisitions is subject to significant risks, including the risk that regulators will not provide the requisite approvals.\nWe continue to evaluate potential acquisitions and may make opportunistic whole or partial acquisitions of other banks, branches, financial institutions, or related businesses from time to time that we expect may further our business strategy, including through participation in FDIC-assisted acquisitions or assumption of deposits from troubled institutions. Any possible acquisition will be subject to regulatory approval, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such approval in a timely manner or at all. Even if we obtain regulatory approval, these acquisitions could involve numerous risks, including lower than expected performance or higher than expected costs, difficulties related to integration, difficulties and costs associated with consolidation and streamlining inefficiencies, diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business activities, changes in relationships with customers, and the potential loss of key employees. In addition, we may not be successful in identifying acquisition candidates, integrating acquired institutions, or preventing deposit erosion or loan quality deterioration at acquired institutions. Competition for acquisitions can be highly competitive, and we may not be able to acquire other institutions on attractive terms. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in completing or will even pursue future acquisitions, or if such transactions are completed, that we will be successful in integrating acquired businesses into operations. Our ability to grow may be limited if we choose not to pursue or are unable to successfully make acquisitions in the future.\nThe success of the Company\u2019s and the Bank\u2019s mergers and acquisitions may depend, in part, on our ability to realize the estimated cost savings from combining the acquired businesses with the Company\u2019s and the Bank\u2019s existing operations. It is possible that the potential cost savings could turn out to be more difficult to achieve than anticipated. The cost savings estimates also depend on our ability to combine the businesses in a manner that permits those cost savings to be realized. If the estimates turn out to be incorrect or if we are unable to successfully execute our strategy for combining businesses, our anticipated cost savings may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected.\nMoreover, although we have successfully integrated business acquisitions in recent years, difficulty or failure in successfully integrating, subsequent to the completion of, any future acquisitions could delay or prevent the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions from being realized fully or at all. In addition, acquisitions typically involve the payment of a premium over book and trading value and thus may result in the dilution of our book value per share.\nVarious factors may make takeover attempts more difficult to achieve.\nThe Board has no current intention to sell control of the Company. Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, federal regulations, Delaware law and various other factors may make it more difficult for companies or persons to acquire control of us without the consent of our Board. A shareholder may want a takeover attempt to succeed because, for example, a potential acquirer could offer a premium over the then prevailing market price of our common stock. The factors that may discourage takeover attempts or make them more difficult include:\n(a) Certificate of Incorporation and statutory provisions.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law may make it more difficult and expensive to pursue a takeover attempt that our Board opposes. These provisions also would make it more difficult to remove our current Board, or to elect new directors. These provisions also include limitations on voting rights of beneficial owners of more than 10% of our common stock, supermajority voting requirements for certain business combinations, and plurality voting. Our bylaws also contain provisions regarding the timing and content of stockholder proposals and nominations and qualification for service on the Board.\n(b) Required change in control payments and issuance of stock options and recognition and retention plan shares.\nWe have entered into employment agreements with executive officers, which require payments to be made to them in the event their employment is terminated following a change in control of us or the Bank. We have issued stock grants and stock options in accordance with the 2004 Provident Bancorp Inc. Stock Incentive Plan, the Sterling Bancorp 2014 Stock Incentive Plan and the Sterling Bancorp 2015 Omnibus Equity and Incentive Plan. In the event of a change in control, the vesting of stock and option grants would accelerate. In 2006, we adopted the Provident Bank & Affiliates Transition Benefit Plan. The plan calls for severance payments ranging from 12 weeks to one year for employees not covered by separate agreements if they are terminated in connection with a change in control of us.\nOur results of operations, financial condition or liquidity may be adversely impacted by issues arising from certain industry deficiencies in foreclosure practices, including delays and challenges in the foreclosure process.\nOver the past few years, foreclosure time lines have generally increased due to, among other reasons, delays associated with the significant increase in the number of foreclosure cases as a result of the economic downturn, federal and state legal and regulatory actions, including additional consumer protection initiatives related to the foreclosure process and voluntary and, in some cases, mandatory programs intended to permit or require lenders to consider loan modifications or other alternatives to foreclosure. Residential mortgages in particular may present us with foreclosure process issues. Residential mortgages, for example, were 7.3% of our total loan portfolio as of December 31, 2016, but constituted 19.2% of our non-accrual loans on the same date. Collateral for many of our residential loans is located within the States of New York and New Jersey, where there may continue to be foreclosure process and timeline issues.\nWe depend on our executive officers and key personnel to continue the implementation of our long-term business strategy and could be harmed by the loss of their services.\nWe believe that our continued growth and future success will depend in large part on the skills of our management team and our ability to motivate and retain these individuals and other key personnel. In particular, we rely on the leadership of our Chief Executive Officer, Jack Kopnisky. The loss of service of Mr. Kopnisky or one or more of our other executive officers or key personnel could reduce our ability to successfully implement our long-term business strategy, our business could suffer, and the value of our common stock could be materially adversely affected. Leadership changes will occur from time to time, and we cannot predict whether significant resignations will occur or whether we will be able to recruit additional qualified personnel. We believe our management team possesses valuable knowledge about the banking industry and our markets and that their knowledge and relationships would be very difficult to replicate. Although the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and other executive officers have entered into employment agreements with us, it is possible that they may not complete the term of their employment agreements or renew them upon expiration. Our success also depends on the experience of our financial center managers and lending officers and on their relationships with the customers and communities they serve. The loss of these key personnel could negatively impact our banking operations. The loss of key personnel, or the inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results.", "PERMNO": 86582, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "STL"}
