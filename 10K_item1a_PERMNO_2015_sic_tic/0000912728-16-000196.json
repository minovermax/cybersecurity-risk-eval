{"cik": "912728", "company": "FORWARD AIR CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-19", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to the other information in this Form 10-K and other documents we have filed with the SEC from time to time, the following factors should be carefully considered in evaluating our business. Such factors could affect results and cause results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by, or on behalf of, us. Some or all of these factors may apply to our business.\nOur business is subject to general economic and business factors that are largely out of our control, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur business is dependent upon a number of factors that may have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include increases or rapid fluctuations in fuel prices, freight volumes, capacity in the trucking industry, insurance premiums, self-insured retention levels, difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified owner-operators and freight handlers as well as needed outside capacity and the status of our owner-operators as independent contractors. Our profitability would decline if we were unable to anticipate and react to increases in our operating costs, including purchased transportation and labor, or decreases in the amount of revenue per pound of freight shipped through our networks. As a result of competitive factors, we may be unable to raise our prices to meet increases in our operating costs, which could result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nEconomic conditions may adversely affect our customers and the amount of freight available for transport. This may require us to lower our rates, and this may also result in lower volumes of freight flowing through our network. Customers\nencountering adverse economic conditions represent a greater potential for loss, and we may be required to increase our reserve for bad-debt losses.\nOur results of operations may be affected by seasonal factors. Volumes of freight tend to be lower in the first quarter after the winter holiday season. In addition, it is not possible to predict the short or long-term effects of any geopolitical events on the economy or on consumer confidence in the United States, or their impact, if any, on our future results of operations.\nIn order to grow our business, we will need to increase the volume and revenue per pound of the freight shipped through our networks.\nOur growth depends in significant part on our ability to increase the amount and revenue per pound of freight shipped through our networks. The amount of freight shipped through our networks and our revenue per pound depend on numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, such as economic conditions and our competitors\u2019 pricing. Therefore, we cannot guarantee that the amount of freight shipped or the revenue per pound we realize on that freight will increase or even remain at current levels. If we fail to increase the volume of the freight shipped through our networks or the revenue per pound of the freight shipped, we may be unable to maintain or increase our profitability.\nOur rates, overall revenue and expenses are subject to volatility.\nOur rates are subject to change based on competitive pricing and market factors. Our overall transportation rates consist of base transportation and fuel surcharge rates. Our base transportation rates exclude fuel surcharges and are set based on numerous factors such as length of haul, freight class and weight per shipment. The base rates are subject to change based on competitive pricing pressures and market factors. Most of our competitors impose fuel surcharges, but there is no industry standard for the calculation of fuel surcharge rates. Our fuel surcharge rates are set weekly based on the national average for fuel prices as published by the U.S. Department of Energy (\u201cDOE\u201d) and our fuel surcharge table. Historically, we have not adjusted our method for determining fuel surcharge rates.\nOur net fuel surcharge revenue is the result of our fuel surcharge rates and the tonnage transiting our networks. The fuel surcharge revenue is then netted with the fuel surcharge we pay to our owner-operators and third party transportation providers. The fuel surcharge may not capture the entire amount of the increase in fuel prices. Decreases in fuel prices reduce the cost of transportation services and accordingly, could reduce our revenues and may reduce margins for certain lines of business. In addition to changing fuel prices, fluctuations in volumes and related load factors may subject us to volatility in our net fuel surcharge revenue. This potential volatility in net fuel surcharge revenue may adversely impact our overall revenue, base transportation revenue plus net fuel surcharge revenue, and results of operations.\nBecause a portion of our network costs are fixed, we will be adversely affected by any decrease in the volume or revenue per pound of freight shipped through our networks.\nOur operations, particularly our networks of hubs and terminals, represent substantial fixed costs. As a result, any decline in the volume or revenue per pound of freight we handle may have an adverse effect on our operating margin and our results of operations. Typically, Forward Air does not have contracts with its customers. FASI does have contracts with its customers but these contracts typically have terms allowing cancellation within 30 to 60 days. As a result, we cannot guarantee that our current customers will continue to utilize our services or that they will continue at the same levels. The actual shippers of the freight moved through our networks include various manufacturers, distributors and/or retailers of electronics, clothing, telecommunications equipment, machine parts, trade show exhibit materials and medical equipment. Adverse business conditions affecting these shippers or adverse general economic conditions are likely to cause a decline in the volume of freight shipped through our networks.\nWe operate in highly competitive and fragmented segments of our industry, and our business will suffer if we are unable to adequately address downward pricing pressures and other factors that may adversely affect our operations and profitability.\nThe segments of the freight transportation industry in which we participate are highly competitive, very fragmented and historically have few barriers to entry. Our principal competitors include national and regional truckload and less-than-truckload brokers and carriers. To a lesser extent, we also compete with integrated air cargo carriers and passenger airlines. Our competition ranges from small operators that compete within a limited geographic area to companies with substantially greater financial and other resources, including greater freight capacity. We also face competition from freight forwarders who decide to establish their own networks to transport expedited ground freight. We believe competition is based primarily on quality service, on-time delivery, flexibility, reliability and security, as well as rates. Many of our competitors periodically reduce their rates to gain business, especially during times of economic decline. In the past several years, several of our competitors have reduced their rates to\nunusually low levels that we believe are unsustainable in the long-term, but that may materially adversely affect our business in the short-term. These competitors may cause a decrease in our volume of freight, require us to lower the prices we charge for our services and adversely affect both our growth prospects and profitability.\nIf we have difficulty attracting and retaining owner-operators or freight handlers, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe depend on owner-operators for most of our transportation needs. In 2015, owner-operators provided 57.4% of our purchased transportation. Competition for owner-operators is intense, and sometimes there are shortages of available owner-operators. In addition, we need a large number of freight handlers to operate our business efficiently. During periods of low unemployment in the areas where our terminals are located, we may have difficulty hiring and retaining a sufficient number of freight handlers. If we have difficulty attracting and retaining enough qualified owner-operators or freight handlers, we may be forced to increase wages and benefits, which would increase our operating costs. This difficulty may also impede our ability to\nmaintain our delivery schedules, which could make our service less competitive and force us to curtail our planned growth. If our labor costs increase, we may be unable to offset the increased labor costs by increasing rates without adversely affecting our business. As a result, our profitability may be reduced.\nA determination by regulators that our independent owner-operators are employees rather than independent contractors could expose us to various liabilities and additional costs.\nAt times, the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Labor and state authorities have asserted that owner-operators are \u201cemployees,\u201d rather than \u201cindependent contractors.\u201d One or more governmental authorities may challenge our position that the owner-operators we use are not our employees. A determination by regulators that our independent owner-operators are employees rather than independent contractors could expose us to various liabilities and additional costs including, but not limited to, employment-related expenses such as workers\u2019 compensation insurance coverage and reimbursement of work-related expenses. Additionally, the exposure could include prior period compensation, as well as potential liability for employee benefits and tax withholdings.\nIf we have difficulty contracting with a sufficient number of third-party carriers to supplement our owner-operator fleet and satisfy our customers\u2019 fast-growing transportation needs, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nTo augment our fleet of owner-operators, we purchase transportation from third-party carriers. As with owner-operators, competition for third-party carriers is intense, and sometimes there are shortages of available third-party carriers. If we cannot secure a sufficient number of owner-operators and have to purchase transportation from third-party carriers, our operating costs will increase. This capacity deficit may lead to a loss of customers and a decline in the volume of freight we receive from customers.\nClaims for property damage, personal injuries or workers\u2019 compensation and related expenses could significantly reduce our earnings.\nUnder DOT regulations, we are liable for property damage and personal injuries caused by owner-operators and Company-employed drivers while they are operating on our behalf. We currently maintain liability insurance coverage that we believe is adequate to cover third-party claims. Forward Air and FASI have a self-insured retention of $0.5 million per occurrence for vehicle and general liability claims. We may also be subject to claims for workers\u2019 compensation. We maintain workers\u2019 compensation insurance coverage that we believe is adequate to cover such claims. We have a self-insured retention of approximately $0.3 million for each such claim, except in Ohio, where we are a qualified self-insured entity with an approximately $0.5 million self-insured retention. We could incur claims in excess of our policy limits or incur claims not covered by our insurance. Any claims beyond the limits or scope of our insurance coverage may have a material adverse effect on us. Because we do not carry \u201cstop loss\u201d insurance, a significant increase in the number of claims that we must cover under our self-insurance retainage could adversely affect our profitability. In addition, we may be unable to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts or scope to protect us against losses.\nWe face risks related to self-insurance and third-party insurance that can be volatile to our earnings.\nWe self-insure a significant portion of our claims exposure and related expenses for cargo loss, employee medical expense, bodily injury, workers\u2019 compensation and property damage, and maintain insurance with insurance companies above our limits of self-insurance. Self-insurance retention and other limitations are detailed in Part II, Item 7, under \u201cSelf-Insurance Loss Reserves.\u201d Our large self-insured retention limits can make our insurance and claims expense higher or more volatile. Additionally, if our third-party insurance carriers or underwriters leave the trucking sector, it could materially increase our insurance costs or collateral\nrequirements, or create difficulties in finding insurance in excess of our self-insured retention limits. Additionally, we could find it necessary to raise our self-insured retention or decrease our aggregate coverage limits when our policies are renewed or replaced.\nWe accrue for the costs of the uninsured portion of pending claims, based on the nature and severity of individual claims and historical claims development trends. Estimating the number and severity of claims, as well as related judgment or settlement amounts is inherently difficult. This, along with legal expenses, incurred but not reported claims, and other uncertainties can cause unfavorable differences between actual self-insurance costs and our reserve estimates.\nWe have grown and may grow, in part, through acquisitions, which involve various risks, and we may not be able to identify or acquire companies consistent with our growth strategy or successfully integrate acquired businesses into our operations.\nWe have grown through acquisitions, and we intend to pursue opportunities to expand our business by acquiring other companies in the future. Acquisitions involve risks, including those relating to:\n\u2022\nidentification of appropriate acquisition candidates;\n\u2022\nnegotiation of acquisitions on favorable terms and valuations;\n\u2022\nintegration of acquired businesses and personnel;\n\u2022\nimplementation of proper business and accounting controls;\n\u2022\nability to obtain financing, at favorable terms or at all;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management attention;\n\u2022\nretention of employees and customers;\n\u2022\nunexpected liabilities;\n\u2022\npotential erosion of operating profits as new acquisitions may be unable to achieve profitability comparable with our core airport-to-airport business; and\n\u2022\ndetrimental issues not discovered during due diligence.\nAcquisitions also may affect our short-term cash flow and net income as we expend funds, potentially increase indebtedness and incur additional expenses. If we are not able to identify or acquire companies consistent with our growth strategy, or if we fail to successfully integrate any acquired companies into our operations, we may not achieve anticipated increases in revenue, cost savings and economies of scale, our operating results may actually decline and acquired goodwill may become impaired.\nSevere economic downturns like the recession experienced in 2008 and 2009 can result in weaker demand for ground transportation services, which may have a significant negative impact on our results of operations.\nDuring 2008 and 2009, we experienced significantly weaker demand for our airport-to-airport and pool distribution services as a result of the severe downturn in the economy. During the time in question, we adjusted the size of our owner-operator fleet and reduced employee headcount to compensate for the drop in demand. No assurance can be given that reductions in owner-operators and employees or other steps we may take during similar times in the future will be adequate to offset the effects of reduced demand. If we experience another economic downturn it may have a significant negative impact on our results of operations.\nExtreme or unusual weather conditions can disrupt our operations, impact freight volumes and increase our costs, all of which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nCertain weather conditions such as ice and snow can disrupt our operations. Increases in the cost of operations, such as towing and other maintenance activities, frequently occur during the winter months. Natural disasters such as hurricanes and flooding can also impact freight volumes and negatively impact our results of operations. Any such event affecting one of our key locations could result in a significant interruption in or disruption of our business.\nWe could be required to record a material non-cash charge to income if our recorded intangible assets or goodwill are determined to be impaired.\nWe have $127.8 million of recorded net definite-lived intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2015. Our definite-lived intangible assets primarily represent the value of customer relationships and non-compete agreements that were recorded in conjunction with our various acquisitions. We review our long-lived assets, such as our definite-lived\nintangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Impairment is recognized on these assets when the sum of undiscounted estimated cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset is less than the carrying value. If such measurement indicates an impairment, we would be required to record a non-cash impairment charge to our consolidated statement of comprehensive income in the amount that the carrying value of these assets exceed the estimated fair value of the assets.\nWe also have recorded goodwill of $205.6 million on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2015. Goodwill is assessed for impairment annually (or more frequently if circumstances indicate possible impairment) for each of our reporting units. This assessment includes comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to the carrying value of the assets assigned to each reporting unit. If the carrying value of the reporting unit was to exceed our estimated fair value of the reporting unit, we would then be required to estimate the fair value of the individual assets and liabilities within the reporting unit to ascertain the amount of fair value of goodwill and any potential impairment. If we determine that our fair value of goodwill is less than the related book value, we could be required to record a non-cash impairment charge to our consolidated statement of comprehensive income, which could have a material adverse effect on our earnings.\nWe may have difficulty effectively managing our growth, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur growth plans will place significant demands on our management and operating personnel. Our ability to manage our future growth effectively will require us to regularly enhance our operating and management information systems and to continue to attract, retain, train, motivate and manage key employees. If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to maintain and enhance our information technology systems, we may lose orders and customers or incur costs beyond expectations.\nWe must maintain and enhance our information technology systems to remain competitive and effectively handle higher volumes of freight through our networks. We expect customers to continue to demand more sophisticated, fully integrated information systems from their transportation providers. If we are unable to maintain and enhance our information systems to handle our freight volumes and meet the demands of our customers, our business and results of operations will be adversely affected. If our information systems are unable to handle higher freight volumes and increased logistics services, our service levels and operating efficiency may decline. This may lead to a loss of customers and a decline in the volume of freight we receive from customers.\nOur information technology systems are subject to risks that we cannot control.\nOur information technology systems are dependent upon global communications providers, web browsers, telephone systems and other aspects of the Internet infrastructure that have experienced significant system failures and electrical outages in the past. While we take measures to ensure our major systems have redundant capabilities, our systems are susceptible to outages from fire, floods, power loss, telecommunications failures, break-ins, cyber-attacks and similar events. Despite our implementation of network security measures, our servers are vulnerable to computer viruses, break-ins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems. The occurrence of any of these events could disrupt or damage our information technology systems and hamper our internal operations, our ability to provide services to our customers and the ability of our customers to access our information technology systems. A material network breach in the security of our information technology systems could include the theft of our intellectual property or trade secrets, personal information of our employees and confidential information of certain customers. To the extent that any disruptions or security breach results in a loss or damage to our data, or in inappropriate disclosure of confidential information, it could cause significant damage to our reputation, affect our relationships with our customers, reduce the demand for our services, lead to claims against us and ultimately harm our business. In addition, we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future.\nWe operate in a regulated industry, and increased costs of compliance with, or liability for violation of, existing or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe DOT and various state and federal agencies have been granted broad regulatory powers over our business, and we are licensed by the DOT and U.S. Customs. If we fail to comply with any applicable regulations, our licenses may be revoked or we could be subject to substantial fines or penalties and to civil and criminal liability.\nThe transportation industry is subject to legislative and regulatory changes that can affect the economics of our business by requiring changes in operating practices or influencing the demand for, and the cost of providing, transportation services.\nHeightened security concerns may continue to result in increased regulations, including the implementation of various security measures, checkpoints or travel restrictions on trucks.\nIn addition, there may be changes in applicable federal or state tax or other laws or interpretations of those laws. If this happens, we may incur additional taxes, as well as higher workers\u2019 compensation and employee benefit costs, and possibly penalties and interest for prior periods. This could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe are subject to various environmental laws and regulations, and costs of compliance with, or liabilities for violations of, existing or future laws and regulations could significantly increase our costs of doing business.\nOur operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations dealing with, among other things, the handling of hazardous materials and discharge and retention of stormwater. We operate in industrial areas, where truck terminals and other industrial activities are located, and where groundwater or other forms of environmental contamination may have occurred. Our operations involve the risks of fuel spillage, environmental damage, and hazardous waste disposal, among others. If we are involved in a spill or other accident involving hazardous substances, or if we are found to be in violation of applicable environmental laws or regulations, it could significantly increase our cost of doing business. Under specific environmental laws and regulations, we could be held responsible for all of the costs relating to any contamination at our past or present terminals and at third-party waste disposal sites. If we fail to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations, we could be subject to substantial fines or penalties and to civil and criminal liability.\nIn addition, as global warming issues become more prevalent, federal and local governments and our customers are beginning to respond to these issues. This increased focus on sustainability may result in new regulations and customer requirements that could negatively affect us. This could cause us to incur additional direct costs or to make changes to our operations in order to comply with any new regulations and customer requirements, as well as increased indirect costs or loss of revenue resulting from, among other things, our customers incurring additional compliance costs that affect our costs and revenues. We could also lose revenue if our customers divert business from us because we have not complied with their sustainability requirements. These costs, changes and loss of revenue could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are dependent on our senior management team, and the loss of any such personnel could materially and adversely affect our business.\nOur future performance depends, in significant part, upon the continued service of our senior management team. We cannot be certain that we can retain these employees. The loss of the services of one or more of these or other key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. We must continue to develop and retain a core group of management personnel and address issues of succession planning if we are to realize our goal of growing our business. We cannot be certain that we will be able to do so.\nIf our employees were to unionize, our operating costs would likely increase.\nNone of our employees is currently represented by a collective bargaining agreement. However, we have no assurance that our employees will not unionize in the future, which could increase our operating costs and force us to alter our operating methods. This could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nOur charter and bylaws and provisions of Tennessee law could discourage or prevent a takeover that may be considered favorable.\nOur charter and bylaws and provisions of Tennessee law may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or change in control that may be considered favorable. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for shareholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. Among other things, these provisions:\n\u2022\nauthorize us to issue preferred stock, the terms of which may be determined at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors and may adversely affect the voting or economic rights of our shareholders; and\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the Board of Directors and for proposing matters that can be acted on by shareholders at a meeting.\nOur charter and bylaws and provisions of Tennessee law may discourage transactions that otherwise could provide for the payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our Common Stock and also could limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our Common Stock.", "PERMNO": 79841, "SIC": 4210, "TIC": "FWRD"}
