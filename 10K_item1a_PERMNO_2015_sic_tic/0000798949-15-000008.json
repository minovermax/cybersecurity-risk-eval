Risk Factors\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS/CAUTIONARY STATEMENT AND RISK FACTORS\nThis report contains \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d - meaning, statements related to future events within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, included or incorporated by reference in this document which addresses activities, events or developments which we expect or anticipate will or may occur in the future, are forward-looking statements.

This report modifies and supersedes documents filed by us before this report. In addition, certain information that we file with the SEC in the future will automatically update and supersede information contained in this report.\nThese forward-looking statements include, among others, such things as:\n\u2022\nthe amount and nature of our future capital expenditures and how we expect to fund our capital expenditures;\n\u2022\nthe number of wells we plan to drill or rework;\n\u2022\nprices for oil, NGLs, and natural gas;\n\u2022\ndemand for oil, NGLs, and natural gas;\n\u2022\nour exploration and drilling prospects;\n\u2022\nthe estimates of our proved oil, NGLs, and natural gas reserves;\n\u2022\noil, NGLs, and natural gas reserve potential;\n\u2022\ndevelopment and infill drilling potential;\n\u2022\nexpansion and other development trends of the oil and natural gas industry;\n\u2022\nour business strategy;\n\u2022\nour plans to maintain or increase production of oil, NGLs, and natural gas;\n\u2022\nthe number of gathering systems and processing plants we plan to construct or acquire;\n\u2022\nvolumes and prices for natural gas gathered and processed;\n\u2022\nexpansion and growth of our business and operations;\n\u2022\ndemand for our drilling rigs and drilling rig rates;\n\u2022\nour belief that the final outcome of our legal proceedings will not materially affect our financial results;\n\u2022\nour ability to timely secure third-party services used in completing our wells;\n\u2022\nour ability to transport or convey our oil, NGLs, or natural gas production to established pipeline systems;\n\u2022\nimpact of federal and state legislative and regulatory actions impacting our costs and increasing operating restrictions or delays as well as other adverse impacts on our business;\n\u2022\nour projected production guidelines for the year;\n\u2022\nour anticipated capital budgets; and\n\u2022\nthe number of wells our oil and natural gas segment plans to drill during the year.\nThese statements are based on certain assumptions and analyses made by us in light of our experience and our perception of historical trends, current conditions, and expected future developments as well as other factors we believe are appropriate in the circumstances. Whether actual results and developments will conform to our expectations and predictions is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties any one or combination of which could cause our actual results to differ materially from our expectations and predictions, including:\n\u2022\nthe risk factors discussed in this document and in the documents (if any) we incorporate by reference;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic, market, or business conditions;\n\u2022\nthe availability of and nature of (or lack of) business opportunities that we pursue;\n\u2022\ndemand for our land drilling services;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws or regulations;\n\u2022\ndecreases or increases in commodity prices; and\n\u2022\nother factors, most of which are beyond our control.\nYou should not place undue reliance on any of these forward-looking statements. Except as required by law, we disclaim any current intention to update forward-looking information and to release publicly the results of any future revisions we may make to forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this document to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.\nIn order to help provide you with a more thorough understanding of the possible effects of some of these influences on any forward-looking statements made by us, the following discussion outlines some (but not all) of the factors that could in the future cause our consolidated results to differ materially from those that may be presented in any forward-looking statement made by us or on our behalf.\nDemand for our contract drilling and mid-stream services is substantially dependent on the levels of expenditures by the oil and gas industry. A substantial or an extended decline in oil and gas prices could result in lower expenditures by the oil and gas industry, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Demand for our contract drilling and mid-stream services depends substantially on the level of expenditures by the oil and gas industry for the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas reserves. These expenditures are generally dependent on the industry\u2019s view of future oil and natural gas prices and are sensitive to the industry\u2019s view of future economic growth and the resulting impact on demand for oil and natural gas. Declines, as well as anticipated declines, in oil and gas prices could also result in project modifications, delays or cancellations, general business disruptions, and delays in payment of, or nonpayment of, amounts that are owed to us. These effects could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe oil and gas industry has historically experienced periodic downturns, which have been characterized by diminished demand for oilfield services and downward pressure on the prices we charge. A significant downturn in the oil and gas industry could result in a reduction in demand for oilfield services and could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOil, NGLs, and Natural Gas Prices. In addition to the impact oil and gas prices may have on our contract drilling and mid-stream segments, the prices we receive for our oil, NGLs, and natural gas production have a direct impact on our revenues, profitability, and cash flow as well as our ability to meet our projected financial and operational goals. The prices for oil, NGLs, and natural gas are determined on a number of factors beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nthe demand for and supply of oil, NGLs, and natural gas;\n\u2022\ncurrent weather conditions in the continental United States (which can greatly influence the demand and prices for natural gas at any given time);\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of liquid natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas imports and exports;\n\u2022\nthe ability of current distribution systems in the United States to effectively meet the demand for oil, NGLs, and natural gas at any given time, particularly in times of peak demand which may result because of adverse weather conditions;\n\u2022\nthe ability or willingness of the OPEC to set and maintain production levels for oil;\n\u2022\noil and gas production levels by non-OPEC countries;\n\u2022\nthe level of excess production capacity;\n\u2022\npolitical and economic uncertainty and geopolitical activity;\n\u2022\ngovernmental policies and subsidies;\n\u2022\nthe costs of exploring for producing and delivering oil and gas;\n\u2022\ntechnological advances affecting energy consumption; and\n\u2022\nweather conditions.\nOil prices are extremely sensitive to influences domestic and foreign based on political, social or economic underpinnings, any one of which could have an immediate and significant effect on the price and supply of oil. In addition, prices of oil, NGLs, and natural gas have been at various times influenced by trading on the commodities markets. That trading, at times, has tended to increase the volatility associated with these prices resulting in large differences in prices even on a week-to-week and month-to-month basis. All of these factors, especially when coupled with the fact that much of our product prices are determined on a daily basis, can, and at times do, lead to wide fluctuations in the prices we receive.\nBased on our 2014 production, a $0.10 per Mcf change in what we receive for our natural gas production, without the effect of derivatives, would result in a corresponding $466,000 per month ($5.6 million annualized) change in our pre-tax operating cash flow. A $1.00 per barrel change in our oil price, without the effect of derivatives, would have a $308,000 per month ($3.7 million annualized) change in our pre-tax operating cash flow and a $1.00 per barrel change in our NGLs price, without the effect of derivatives, would have a $368,000 per month ($4.4 million annualized) change in our pre-tax operating cash flow.\nIn order to reduce our exposure to short-term fluctuations in the price of oil, NGLs, and natural gas, we sometimes enter into derivative contracts such as swaps and collars. To date, we have derivatives in part, but not on all of our production which only provides price protection against declines in oil, NGLs, and natural gas prices on the production subject to our derivatives, but not otherwise. Should market prices for the production we have derivatives exceed the prices due under our derivative contracts, our derivative contracts then expose us to risk of financial loss and limit the benefit to us of those increases in market prices. During 2014, all of our NGLs volumes and about half of our oil and natural gas volumes were sold at market responsive prices. To help manage our cash flow and capital expenditure requirements, we had derivative contracts on approximately 69% and 56% of our 2014 average daily production for oil and natural gas, respectively. A more thorough discussion of our derivative arrangements is contained in the Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of this report contained in Item 7.\nUncertainty of Oil, NGLs, and Natural Gas Reserves; Ceiling Test. There are many uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of oil, NGLs, and natural gas reserves and their values, including many factors beyond our control. The oil, NGLs, and natural gas reserve information included in this report represents only an estimate of these reserves. Oil, NGLs, and natural gas reservoir engineering is a subjective and an inexact process of estimating underground accumulations of oil, NGLs, and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner. Estimates of economically recoverable oil, NGLs, and natural gas reserves depend on a number of variable factors, including historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas, and assumptions concerning:\n\u2022\nreservoir size;\n\u2022\nthe effects of regulations by governmental agencies;\n\u2022\nfuture oil, NGLs, and natural gas prices;\n\u2022\nfuture operating costs;\n\u2022\nseverance and excise taxes;\n\u2022\noperational risks;\n\u2022\ndevelopment costs; and\n\u2022\nworkover and remedial costs.\nSome or all of these assumptions may vary considerably from actual results. For these and other reasons, estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of oil, NGLs, and natural gas attributable to any particular group of properties, classifications of those oil, NGLs, and natural gas reserves based on risk of recovery, and estimates of the future net cash flows from oil, NGLs, and natural gas reserves prepared by different engineers or by the same engineers but at different times may vary substantially. Accordingly, oil, NGLs, and natural gas reserve estimates may be subject to periodic downward or upward adjustments. Actual production, revenues, and expenditures with respect to our oil, NGLs, and natural gas reserves will likely vary from estimates and those variances may be material.\nThe information regarding discounted future net cash flows included in this report is not necessarily the current market value of the estimated oil, NGLs, and natural gas reserves attributable to our properties. The use of full cost accounting requires us to use the unweighted arithmetic average of the commodity prices existing on the first day of each of the 12 months before the end of the reporting period to calculate discounted future revenues, unless prices were otherwise determined under contractual arrangements. Actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower. Actual future net cash flows are also affected, in part, by the following factors:\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of oil, NGLs, and natural gas production;\n\u2022\nsupply and demand for oil, NGLs, and natural gas;\n\u2022\nincreases or decreases in consumption; and\n\u2022\nchanges in governmental regulations or taxation.\nIn addition, the 10% discount factor, required by the SEC for use in calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting purposes, is not necessarily the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and the risks associated with our operations or the oil and natural gas industry in general.\nWe review quarterly the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties under the full cost accounting rules of the SEC. Under these rules, capitalized costs of proved oil and natural gas properties may not exceed the present value of estimated future net revenues from those proved reserves, discounted at 10%. Application of this \u201cceiling test\u201d generally requires pricing future revenue at the unescalated 12-month average price and requires a write-down for accounting purposes if we exceed the ceiling. We may be required to write-down the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties when oil, NGLs, and natural gas prices are depressed. If a write-down is required, it would result in a charge to earnings but would not impact our cash flow from operating activities. Once incurred, a write-down is not reversible.\nDebt and Bank Borrowing. We have incurred and currently expect to continue to incur substantial capital expenditures in our operations. Historically, we have funded our capital needs through a combination of internally generated cash flow and borrowings under our bank credit agreement. In 2011 and 2012, we issued $250.0 million (the 2011 Notes) and $400.0 million (the 2012 Notes), respectively, of senior subordinated notes (collectively, the Notes). We currently have, and will continue to have, a certain amount of indebtedness. At December 31, 2014, we had $166.0 million of outstanding long-term debt under our credit agreement and the amount of the Notes, net of unamortized discount, was $646.2 million.\nDepending on the amount of our debt, the cash flow needed to satisfy that debt and the covenants contained in our bank credit agreement and those applicable to the Notes could:\n\u2022\nlimit funds otherwise available for financing our capital expenditures, our drilling program or other activities or cause us to curtail these activities;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage to those of our competitors that are less indebted than we are;\n\u2022\nmake us more vulnerable during periods of low oil, NGLs, and natural gas prices or in the event of a downturn in our business; and\n\u2022\nprevent us from obtaining additional financing on acceptable terms or limit amounts available under our existing or any future credit facilities.\nOur ability to meet our debt obligations depends on our future performance. If the requirements of our indebtedness are not satisfied, a default could be deemed to occur and our lenders or the holders of the Notes would be entitled to accelerate the payment of the outstanding indebtedness. If that were to happen, we would not have sufficient funds available (and probably would not be able to obtain the financing required) to meet our obligations.\nThe amount of our existing debt, as well as our future debt, if any, is, largely, based on the costs associated with the projects we undertake at any given time and of our cash flow. Generally, our normal operating costs are those resulting from the drilling of oil and natural gas wells, the acquisition of producing properties, the costs associated with the maintenance, upgrade, or expansion of our drilling rig fleet, and the operations of our natural gas buying, selling, gathering, processing, and treating systems. To some extent, these costs, particularly the first two, are discretionary and we maintain a degree of control regarding the timing or the need to incur them. But, in some cases, unforeseen circumstances may arise, such as in the case of an unanticipated opportunity to make a large acquisition or the need to replace a costly drilling rig component due to an unexpected loss, which could force us to incur additional debt above that which we had expected or forecasted. Likewise, if our cash flow should prove to be insufficient to cover our current cash requirements we would need to increase our debt either through bank borrowings or otherwise.\nRISK FACTORS\nMany other factors could adversely affect our business. The following discussion describes the material risks currently known to us. However, additional risks that we do not know about or that we currently view as immaterial may also impair our business or adversely affect the value of our securities. You should carefully consider the risks described below together with the other information contained in, or incorporated by reference into, this report.\nIf demand for oil, NGLs, and natural gas is reduced, our ability to market as well as produce our oil, NGLs, and natural gas may be negatively affected.\nHistorically, oil, NGLs, and natural gas prices have been extremely volatile, with significant increases and significant price drops being experienced from time to time. In the future, various factors beyond our control will have a significant effect\non oil, NGLs, and natural gas prices. Such factors include, among other things, the domestic and foreign supply of oil, NGLs, and natural gas, the price of foreign imports, the levels of consumer demand, the price and availability of alternative fuels, the availability of pipeline capacity, and changes in existing and proposed federal regulation and price controls.\nThe oil, NGLs, and natural gas markets are also unsettled due to a number of factors. Production from oil and natural gas wells in some geographic areas of the United States has been curtailed for considerable periods of time due to a lack of market demand and transportation and storage capacity. It is possible, however, that some of our wells may in the future be shut-in or that oil, NGLs, and natural gas will be sold on terms less favorable than might otherwise be obtained should demand for oil, NGLs, and natural gas decrease. Competition for available markets has been vigorous and there remains great uncertainty about prices that purchasers will pay. Oil, NGLs, and natural gas surpluses could result in our inability to market oil, NGLs, and natural gas profitably, causing us to curtail production and/or receive lower prices for our oil, NGls, and natural gas, situations which would adversely affect us.\nDisruptions in the financial markets could affect our ability to obtain financing or refinance existing indebtedness on reasonable terms and may have other adverse effects.\nCommercial-credit market disruptions may result in tight credit markets in the United States. Liquidity in the global-credit markets can be severely contracted by market disruptions making terms for certain financings less attractive, and in certain cases, result in the unavailability of certain types of financing. As a result of credit-market turmoil, we may not be able to obtain debt financing, or refinance existing indebtedness on favorable terms, which could affect operations and financial performance.\nOil, NGLs, and natural gas prices are volatile, and low prices have negatively affected our financial results and could do so in the future.\nOur revenues, operating results, cash flow, and future rate of growth depend substantially on prevailing prices for oil, NGLs, and natural gas. Historically, oil, NGLs, and natural gas prices and markets have been volatile, and they are likely to continue to be volatile in the future. Any decline in prices in the future would have a negative impact on our future financial results.\nPrices for oil, NGLs, and natural gas are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the actual or perceived supply of and demand for oil, NGLs, and natural gas, market uncertainty, and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control. These factors include:\n\u2022\npolitical conditions in oil producing regions;\n\u2022\nthe ability of the members of the OPEC to agree on prices and their ability to maintain production quotas;\n\u2022\nactions taken by foreign oil and natural gas companies;\n\u2022\nthe price of foreign oil imports;\n\u2022\nimports and exports of liquefied natural gas;\n\u2022\nactions of governmental authorities;\n\u2022\nthe domestic and foreign supply of oil, NGLs, and natural gas;\n\u2022\nthe level of consumer demand;\n\u2022\nUnited States storage levels of oil, NGLs, and natural gas;\n\u2022\nweather conditions;\n\u2022\ndomestic and foreign government regulations;\n\u2022\nthe price, availability, and acceptance of alternative fuels;\n\u2022\nvolatility in ethane prices causing rejection of ethane as part of the liquids processed stream; and\n\u2022\nworldwide economic conditions.\nThese factors and the volatile nature of the energy markets make it impossible to predict with any certainty the future prices of oil, NGLs, and natural gas.\nOur contract drilling operations depend on levels of activity in the oil, NGLs, and natural gas exploration and production industry.\nOur contract drilling operations depend on the level of activity in oil, NGLs, and natural gas exploration and production in our operating markets. Both short-term and long-term trends in oil, NGLs, and natural gas prices affect the level of that activity. Because oil, NGLs, and natural gas prices are volatile, the level of exploration and production activity can also be volatile. Any decrease from current oil, NGLs, and natural gas prices would further depress the level of exploration and production activity. This, in turn, would likely result in further declines in the demand for our drilling services and would have an adverse effect on our contract drilling revenues, cash flows, and profitability. As a result, the future demand for our drilling services is uncertain.\nThe industries in which we operate are highly competitive, and many of our competitors have greater resources than we do.\nThe drilling industry in which we operate is generally very competitive. Most drilling contracts are awarded on the basis of competitive bids, which may result in intense price competition. Some of our competitors in the contract drilling industry have greater financial and human resources than we do. These resources may enable them to better withstand periods of low drilling rig utilization, to compete more effectively on the basis of price and technology, to build new drilling rigs or acquire existing drilling rigs, and to provide drilling rigs more quickly than we do in periods of high drilling rig utilization.\nThe oil and natural gas industry is also highly competitive. We compete in the areas of property acquisitions and oil and natural gas exploration, development, production, and marketing with major oil companies, other independent oil and natural gas concerns, and individual producers and operators. In addition, we must compete with major and independent oil and natural gas concerns in recruiting and retaining qualified employees. Many of our competitors in the oil and natural gas industry have substantially greater resources than we do.\nThe midstream industry is also highly competitive. We compete in areas of gathering, processing, transporting, and treating natural gas with other midstream companies. We are continually competing with larger midstream companies for acquisitions and construction projects. Many of our competitors have greater financial resources, human resources, and larger geographic presence than we do currently.\nContinued growth through acquisitions is not assured.\nIn the past, we have experienced growth in each of our segments, in part, through mergers and acquisitions. The contract land drilling industry, the exploration and development industry, as well as the gas gathering and processing industry, have experienced significant consolidation over the past several years, and there can be no assurance that acquisition opportunities will continue to be available. Additionally, we are likely to continue to face intense competition from other companies for available acquisition opportunities.\nThere can be no assurance that we will:\n\u2022\nbe able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities;\n\u2022\nhave sufficient capital resources to complete additional acquisitions;\n\u2022\nsuccessfully integrate acquired operations and assets;\n\u2022\neffectively manage the growth and increased size;\n\u2022\nmaintain the crews and market share to operate any future drilling rigs we may acquire; or\n\u2022\nsuccessfully improve our financial condition, results of operations, business or prospects in any material manner as a result of any completed acquisition.\nWe may incur substantial indebtedness to finance future acquisitions and also may issue debt instruments, equity securities, or convertible securities in connection with any acquisitions. Debt service requirements could represent a significant burden on our results of operations and financial condition and the issuance of additional equity would be dilutive to existing shareholders. Also, continued growth could strain our management, operations, employees, and other resources.\nSuccessful acquisitions, particularly those of oil and natural gas companies or of oil and natural gas properties, require an assessment of a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include recoverable reserves,\nexploration potential, future oil, NGLs, and natural gas prices, operating costs, and potential environmental and other liabilities. Such assessments are inexact and their accuracy is inherently uncertain.\nOur operations have significant capital requirements, and our indebtedness could have important consequences.\nWe have experienced and may continue to experience substantial capital needs for our operations. We have $646.2 million of indebtedness outstanding (net of unamortized discount) under the senior subordinated notes we have issued to date and in addition, have the right to borrow up to $500.0 million under our credit agreement. As of February 13, 2015, we had $201.5 million outstanding borrowings under our credit agreement. Our level of indebtedness, the cash flow needed to satisfy our indebtedness, and the covenants governing our indebtedness could:\n\u2022\nlimit funds available for financing capital expenditures, our drilling program or other activities or cause us to curtail these activities;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to changes in, our business;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage to some of our competitors that are less leveraged than we are;\n\u2022\nmake us more vulnerable during periods of low oil, NGLs, and natural gas prices or in the event of a downturn in our business; and\n\u2022\nprevent us from obtaining additional financing on acceptable terms or limit amounts available under our existing or any future credit facilities.\nOur ability to meet our debt service and other contractual and contingent obligations will depend on our future performance. In addition, lower oil, NGLs, and natural gas prices could result in future reductions in the amount available for borrowing under our credit agreement, reducing our liquidity, and even triggering mandatory loan repayments.\nThe instruments governing our indebtedness contain various covenants limiting the conduct of our business.\nThe indentures governing our senior subordinated notes and our credit agreement contain various restrictive covenants that limit the conduct of our business. In particular, these agreements will place certain limits on our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness, guarantee obligations or issue disqualified capital stock;\n\u2022\npay dividends or distributions on our capital stock or redeem, repurchase or retire our capital stock;\n\u2022\nmake investments or other restricted payments;\n\u2022\ngrant liens on assets;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with stockholders or affiliates;\n\u2022\nsell assets;\n\u2022\nissue or sell capital stock of certain subsidiaries; and\n\u2022\nmerge or consolidate.\nIn addition, our credit agreement also requires us to maintain a minimum current ratio and a maximum leverage ratio.\nIf we fail to comply with the restrictions in the indentures governing our senior subordinated notes, our credit agreement or any other subsequent financing agreements, a default may allow the creditors, if the agreements so provide, to accelerate the related indebtedness as well as any other indebtedness to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies. If that occurs, we may not be able to make all of the required payments or borrow sufficient funds to refinance that debt. Even if new financing were available at that time, it may not be on terms acceptable to us. In addition, lenders may be able to terminate any commitments they had made to make available further funds.\nOur future performance depends on our ability to find or acquire additional oil, NGLs, and natural gas reserves that are economically recoverable.\nIn general, production from oil and natural gas properties declines as reserves are depleted, with the rate of decline depending on reservoir characteristics. Unless we successfully replace the reserves that we produce, our reserves will decline, resulting eventually in a decrease in oil, NGLs, and natural gas production and lower revenues and cash flow from operations. Historically, we have succeeded in increasing reserves after taking production into account through exploration and development. We have conducted these activities on our existing oil and natural gas properties as well as on newly acquired properties. We may not be able to continue to replace reserves from these activities at acceptable costs. Lower prices of oil, NGLs, and natural gas may further limit the kinds of reserves that can economically be developed. Lower prices also decrease our cash flow and may cause us to decrease capital expenditures.\nWe are continually identifying and evaluating opportunities to acquire oil and natural gas properties, including acquisitions that would be significantly larger than those consummated to date by us. We cannot assure you that we will successfully consummate any acquisition, that we will be able to acquire producing oil and natural gas properties that contain economically recoverable reserves or that any acquisition will be profitably integrated into our operations.\nThe competition for producing oil and natural gas properties is intense. This competition could mean that to acquire properties we will have to pay higher prices and accept greater ownership risks than we have in the past.\nOur exploration and production and mid-stream operations involve a high degree of business and financial risk which could adversely affect us.\nExploration and development involve numerous risks that may result in dry holes, the failure to produce oil, NGLs, and natural gas in commercial quantities and the inability to fully produce discovered reserves. The cost of drilling, completing, and operating wells is substantial and uncertain. Numerous factors beyond our control may cause the curtailment, delay, or cancellation of drilling operations, including:\n\u2022\nunexpected drilling conditions;\n\u2022\npressure or irregularities in formations;\n\u2022\ncapacity of pipeline systems;\n\u2022\nequipment failures or accidents;\n\u2022\nadverse weather conditions;\n\u2022\ncompliance with governmental requirements; and\n\u2022\nshortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs or delivery crews and the delivery of equipment.\nExploratory drilling is a speculative activity. Although we may disclose our overall drilling success rate, those rates may decline. Although we may discuss drilling prospects that we have identified or budgeted for, we may ultimately not lease or drill these prospects within the expected time frame, or at all. Lack of drilling success will have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition.\nOur mid-stream operations involve numerous risks, both financial and operational. The cost of developing gathering systems and processing plants is substantial and our ability to recoup these costs is uncertain. Our operations may be curtailed, delayed, or canceled as a result of many things beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in the deliverability of natural gas reserves from the wells connected to the gathering systems;\n\u2022\navailability of competing pipelines in the area;\n\u2022\ncapacity of pipeline systems;\n\u2022\nequipment failures or accidents;\n\u2022\nadverse weather conditions;\n\u2022\ncompliance with governmental requirements;\n\u2022\ndelays in the development of other producing properties within the gathering system\u2019s area of operation; and\n\u2022\ndemand for natural gas and its constituents.\nMany of the wells from which we gather and process natural gas are operated by other parties. As a result, we have little control over the operations of those wells which can act to increase our risk. Operators of those wells may act in ways that are not in our best interests.\nCompetition for experienced technical personnel may negatively impact our operations or financial results.\nOur continued oil and natural gas segment and mid-stream segment success and the success of other activities integral to our operations will depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain experienced geologists, engineers, and other professionals. Competition for these professionals can be extremely intense, particularly when the industry is experiencing favorable conditions.\nOur derivative arrangements might limit the benefit of increases in oil, NGLs, and natural gas prices.\nIn order to reduce our exposure to short-term fluctuations in the price of oil, NGLs, and natural gas, we sometimes enter into derivative contracts. These derivative contracts apply to only a portion of our production and provide only partial price protection against declines in oil, NGLs, and natural gas prices. These derivative contracts may expose us to risk of financial loss and limit the benefit to us of increases in prices.\nEstimates of our reserves are uncertain and may prove to be inaccurate.\nThere are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and their values, including many factors beyond our control. The reserve data represents only estimates. Reservoir engineering is a subjective and inexact process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner. Estimates of economically recoverable oil, NGLs, and natural gas reserves depend on a number of variable factors, including historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas, and assumptions concerning:\n\u2022\nthe effects of regulations by governmental agencies;\n\u2022\nfuture oil, NGLs, and natural gas prices;\n\u2022\nfuture operating costs;\n\u2022\nseverance and excise taxes;\n\u2022\ndevelopment costs; and\n\u2022\nworkover and remedial costs.\nSome or all of these assumptions may vary considerably from actual results. For these reasons, estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of oil, NGLs, and natural gas attributable to any particular group of properties, classifications of those reserves based on risk of recovery, and estimates of the future net cash flows from reserves prepared by different engineers or by the same engineers but at different times may vary substantially. Accordingly, reserve estimates may be subject to downward or upward adjustment. Actual production, revenues and expenditures with respect to our reserves will likely vary from estimates, and those variances may be material.\nThe information regarding discounted future net cash flows should not be considered as the current market value of the estimated oil, NGLs, and natural gas reserves attributable to our properties. As required by the SEC, the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves are based on prices on the first day of the month for each month within the 12-month period before the end of the reporting period and costs as of the date of the estimate, while actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower. Actual future net cash flows also will be affected by the following factors:\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of actual production;\n\u2022\nsupply and demand for oil, NGLs, and natural gas;\n\u2022\nincreases or decreases in consumption; and\n\u2022\nchanges in governmental regulations or taxation.\nIn addition, the 10% per year discount factor, which is required by the SEC to be used in calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting purposes, is not necessarily the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with our operations or the oil and natural gas industry in general.\nIf oil, NGLs, and natural gas prices decrease or are unusually volatile, we may be required to take write-downs of our oil and natural gas properties, the carrying value of our drilling rigs or our natural gas gathering and processing systems.\nWe review quarterly the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties under the full cost accounting rules of the SEC. Under these rules, capitalized costs of proved oil and natural gas properties may not exceed the present value of estimated future net revenues from proved reserves, discounted at 10% per year. Application of the ceiling test generally requires pricing future revenue at the unweighted arithmetic average of the price on the first day of month for each month within the 12-month period prior to the end of the reporting period, unless prices were defined by contractual arrangements, and requires a write-down for accounting purposes if the ceiling is exceeded. We may be required to write-down the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties when oil, NGLs, and natural gas prices are depressed. If a write-down is required, it would result in a charge to earnings, but would not impact cash flow from operating activities. Once incurred, a write-down of oil and natural gas properties is not reversible at a later date. Because our ceiling tests use a rolling 12-month look back average price it is possible that a write down during a reporting period will not remove the need for us to take additional write downs in one or more succeeding periods. This would be the case when months with higher commodity prices roll off the 12-month period and are replaced with more recent months having lower commodity prices.\nOur drilling equipment, transportation equipment, gas gathering and processing systems, and other property and equipment are carried at cost. We are required to periodically test to see if these values, including associated goodwill and other intangible assets, have been impaired whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If any of these assets are determined to be impaired, the loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. An estimate of fair value is based on the best information available, including prices for similar assets. Changes in these estimates could cause us to reduce the carrying value of property, equipment, and related intangible assets. Once these values have been reduced, they are not reversible.\nOur operations present inherent risks of loss that, if not insured or indemnified against, could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur contract drilling operations are subject to many hazards inherent in the drilling industry, including blowouts, cratering, explosions, fires, loss of well control, loss of hole, damaged or lost drilling equipment, and damage or loss from inclement weather. Our exploration and production and mid-stream operations are subject to these and similar risks. Any of these events could result in personal injury or death, damage to or destruction of equipment and facilities, suspension of operations, environmental damage, and damage to the property of others. Generally, drilling contracts provide for the division of responsibilities between a drilling company and its customer, and we seek to obtain indemnification from our drilling customers by contract for some of these risks. To the extent that we are unable to transfer these risks to drilling customers by contract or indemnification agreements (or to the extent we assume obligations of indemnity or assume liability for certain risks under our drilling contracts), we seek protection from some of these risks through insurance. However, some risks are not covered by insurance and we cannot assure you that the insurance we do have or the indemnification agreements we have entered into will adequately protect us against liability from all of the consequences of the hazards described above. The occurrence of an event not fully insured or indemnified against, or the failure of a customer to meet its indemnification obligations, could result in substantial losses. In addition, we cannot assure you that insurance will be available to cover any or all of these risks. Even if available, the insurance might not be adequate to cover all of our losses, or we might decide against obtaining that insurance because of high premiums or other costs.\nIn addition, we are not the operator of many of our wells. As a result, our operating risks for those wells and our ability to influence the operations for those wells are less subject to our control. Operators of those wells may act in ways that are not in our best interests.\nGovernmental and environmental regulations could adversely affect our business.\nOur business is subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations on taxation, the exploration for and development, production, and marketing of oil and natural gas, and safety matters. Many laws and regulations require drilling permits and govern the spacing of wells, rates of production, prevention of waste, unitization and pooling of properties, and other matters. These laws and regulations have increased the costs of planning, designing, drilling, installing, operating, and abandoning our\noil and natural gas wells and other facilities. In addition, these laws and regulations, and any others that are passed by the jurisdictions where we have production, could limit the total number of wells drilled or the allowable production from successful wells, which could limit our revenues.\nWe are (or could become) subject to complex environmental laws and regulations adopted by the various jurisdictions where we own or operate. We could incur liability to governments or third parties for discharges of oil, natural gas or other pollutants into the air, soil or water, including responsibility for remedial costs. We could potentially discharge these materials into the environment in any number of ways including the following:\n\u2022\nfrom a well or drilling equipment at a drill site;\n\u2022\nfrom gathering systems, pipelines, transportation facilities, and storage tanks;\n\u2022\ndamage to oil and natural gas wells resulting from accidents during normal operations; and\n\u2022\nblowouts, cratering, and explosions.\nBecause the requirements imposed by laws and regulations are frequently changed, we cannot assure you that laws and regulations enacted in the future, including changes to existing laws and regulations, will not adversely affect our business. The current Congress and White House administration may impose or change laws and regulations that will adversely affect our business. With the trend toward stricter standards, greater regulation, and more extensive permit requirements, our risks related to environmental matters and our environmental expenditures could increase in the future. In addition, because we acquire interests in properties that have been operated in the past by others, we may be liable for environmental damage caused by the former operators, which liability could be material.\nAny future implementation of price controls on oil, NGLs, and natural gas would affect our operations.\nCertain groups have asserted efforts to have the United States Congress impose some form of price controls on either oil, natural gas, or both. There is no way at this time to know what result these efforts will have nor, if implemented, their effect on our operations. However, it is possible that these efforts, if successful, would serve to limit the amount that we might be able to get for our future oil, NGLs, and natural gas production. Any future limits on the price of oil, NGLs, and natural gas could also result in adversely affecting the demand for our drilling services.\nOur shareholders\u2019 rights plan and provisions of Delaware law and our by-laws and charter could discourage change in control transactions and prevent shareholders from receiving a premium on their investment.\nOur by-laws and charter provide for a classified board of directors with staggered terms and authorizes the board of directors to set the terms of preferred stock. In addition, our charter and Delaware law contain provisions that impose restrictions on business combinations with interested parties. We have also adopted a shareholders\u2019 rights plan. Because of our shareholders\u2019 rights plan and these provisions of our by-laws, charter, and Delaware law, persons considering unsolicited tender offers or other unilateral takeover proposals may be more likely to negotiate with our board of directors rather than pursue non-negotiated takeover attempts. As a result, these provisions may make it more difficult for our shareholders to benefit from transactions that are opposed by an incumbent board of directors.\nNew technologies may cause our current exploration and drilling methods to become obsolete, resulting in an adverse effect on our production.\nOur industry is subject to rapid and significant advancements in technology, including the introduction of new products and services using new technologies. As competitors use or develop new technologies, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage, and competitive pressures may force us to implement new technologies at a substantial cost. In addition, competitors may have greater financial, technical, and personnel resources that allow them to enjoy technological advantages and may in the future allow them to implement new technologies before we can. We cannot be certain that we will be able to implement technologies on a timely basis or at a cost that is acceptable to us. One or more of the technologies that we currently use or that we may implement in the future may become obsolete or may not work as we expected and we may be adversely affected.\nWe may be affected by climate change and market or regulatory responses to climate change.\nClimate change, including the impact of potential global warming regulations, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. Restrictions, caps, taxes, or other controls on emissions of greenhouse gasses, including diesel exhaust, could significantly increase our operating costs. Restrictions on emissions could also affect our customers that (a) use commodities that we carry to produce energy, (b) use significant amounts of energy in producing or delivering the commodities we carry, or (c) manufacture or produce goods that consume significant amounts of energy or burn fossil fuels, including chemical producers, farmers and food producers, and automakers and other manufacturers. Significant cost increases, government regulation, or changes of consumer preferences for goods or services relating to alternative sources of energy or emissions reductions could materially affect the markets for the commodities associated with our business, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. Government incentives encouraging the use of alternative sources of energy could also affect certain of our customers and the markets for certain of the commodities associated with our business in an unpredictable manner that could alter our business activities. Finally, we could face increased costs related to defending and resolving legal claims and other litigation related to climate change and the alleged impact of our operations on climate change. Any of these factors, individually or in operation with one or more of the other factors, or other unforeseen impacts of climate change could reduce the amount of business activity we conduct and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\nThe results of our operations depend on our ability to transport oil, NGLs, and gas production to key markets.\nThe marketability of our oil, NGLs, and natural gas production depends in part on the availability, proximity, and capacity of pipeline systems, refineries, and other transportation sources. The unavailability of or lack of available capacity on these systems and facilities could result in the shut-in of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of development plans for properties. Federal and state regulation of oil, NGLs, and natural gas production and transportation, tax and energy policies, changes in supply and demand, pipeline pressures, damage to or destruction of pipelines, and general economic conditions could adversely affect our ability to produce, gather and, transport oil, NGLs, and natural gas.\nThe loss of one or a number of our larger customers could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nDuring 2014, QEP Resources, Inc. was our largest drilling customer accounting for approximately 19% of our total contract drilling revenues. No other third party customer accounted for 10% or more of our contract drilling revenues. Any of our customers may choose not to use our services and the loss of one or a number of our larger customers could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nShortages of completion equipment and services could delay or otherwise adversely affect our oil and natural gas segment\u2019s operations.\nIn the past several years, the increase in horizontal drilling activity in certain areas has, at times, resulted in shortages in the availability of third party equipment and services required for the completion of wells drilled by our oil and natural gas segment. As a result, we have experienced delays in completing some of our wells. Although we have taken steps to try to reduce the delays associated with these services, we anticipate that any shortages in availability of these services could, at times, delay, restrict, or curtail part of our exploration and development operations, which could in turn harm our results.\nOur mid-stream segment depends on certain natural gas producers and pipeline operators for a significant portion of its supply of natural gas and NGLs. The loss of any of these producers could result in a decline in our volumes and revenues.\nWe rely on certain natural gas producers for a significant portion of our natural gas and NGLs supply. While some of these producers are subject to long-term contracts, we may be unable to negotiate extensions or replacements of these contracts on favorable terms, if at all. The loss of all or even a portion of the natural gas volumes supplied by these producers, as a result of competition or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our mid-stream segment unless we were able to acquire comparable volumes from other sources.\nThe counterparties to our commodity derivative contracts may not be able to perform their obligations to us, which could materially affect our cash flows and results of operations.\nTo reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in the prices of oil and natural gas, we currently, and may in the future, enter into commodity derivative contracts for a significant portion of our forecasted oil, NGLs, and natural gas production. The extent of our commodity price exposure is related largely to the effectiveness and scope of our derivative activities, as well as to the ability of counterparties under our commodity derivative contracts to satisfy their obligations to us. If one or more of our counterparties is unable or unwilling to make required payments to us under our commodity derivative contracts, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nReliance on management.\nWe depend greatly on the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees to manage our operations. The loss or unavailability of any of our executive officers or other key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are subject to various claims and litigation that could ultimately be resolved against us requiring material future cash payments and/or future material charges against our operating income and materially impairing our financial position.\nThe nature of our business makes us highly susceptible to claims and litigation. We are subject to various existing legal claims and lawsuits, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Any claims or litigation, even if fully indemnified or insured, could negatively affect our reputation among our customers and the public, and make it more difficult for us to compete effectively or obtain adequate insurance in the future.\nDerivative regulations included in current financial reform legislation could impede our ability to manage business and financial risks by restricting our use of derivative instruments as hedges against fluctuating commodity prices and interest rates.\nIn July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Act) was passed by Congress and signed into law. The Act contains significant derivative regulations, including a requirement that certain transactions be cleared on exchanges and a requirement to post cash collateral (commonly referred to as \u201cmargin\u201d) for such transactions. The Act provides for a potential exception from these clearing and cash collateral requirements for commercial end-users and it includes a number of defined terms that will be used in determining how this exception applies to particular derivative transactions and the parties to those transactions.\nWe use crude oil and natural gas derivative instruments with respect to a portion of our expected production in order to reduce commodity price uncertainty and enhance the predictability of cash flows relating to the marketing of our crude oil and natural gas. As commodity prices increase, our derivative liability positions increase; however, none of our current derivative contracts require the posting of margin or similar cash collateral when there are changes in the underlying commodity prices that are referred to in these contracts.\nDepending on the rules and definitions adopted by the CFTC, we could be required to post collateral with our dealer counterparties for our commodities derivative transactions. Such a requirement could have a significant impact on our business by reducing our ability to execute derivative transactions to reduce commodity price uncertainty and to protect cash flows. Requirements to post collateral would cause significant liquidity issues by reducing our ability to use cash for investment or other corporate purposes, or would require us to increase our level of debt. In addition, a requirement for our counterparties to post collateral would likely result in additional costs being passed on to us, thereby decreasing the effectiveness of our derivative contracts and our profitability.\nProposed federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays.\nHydraulic-fracturing is an essential and common practice in the oil and gas industry used to stimulate production of oil, natural gas, and associated liquids from dense subsurface rock formations. Our oil and natural gas segment routinely apply hydraulic-fracturing techniques to many of our oil and natural gas properties, including our unconventional resource plays in the Granite Wash of Texas and Oklahoma, the Marmaton of Oklahoma, the Wilcox of Texas, and the Mississippian of Kansas. Hydraulic-fracturing involves using water, sand, and certain chemicals to fracture the hydrocarbon-bearing rock formation to allow the flow of hydrocarbons into the wellbore. The process is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions;\nhowever, the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority over certain hydraulic-fracturing activities involving diesel under the Safe Drinking Water Act and has begun the process of drafting guidance documents related to this newly asserted regulatory authority. In addition, legislation has been introduced before Congress, called the Fracturing Responsibility and Awareness of Chemicals Act, to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic-fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic-fracturing process.\nCertain states in which we operate, including Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Colorado, and Wyoming, have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that could impose more stringent permitting, public disclosure of fracking fluids, waste disposal, and well construction requirements on hydraulic-fracturing operations or otherwise seek to ban fracturing activities altogether. For example, Texas adopted a law in June 2011 requiring disclosure to the Railroad Commission of Texas (RCT) and the public of certain information regarding the components used in the hydraulic-fracturing process. In addition to state laws, local land use restrictions, such as city ordinances, may restrict or prohibit the performance of well drilling in general and/or hydraulic fracturing in particular. In the event state, local, or municipal legal restrictions are adopted in areas where we are currently conducting, or in the future plan to conduct operations, we may incur additional costs to comply with such requirements that may be significant in nature, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from the drilling and/or completion of wells.\nThere are certain governmental reviews either underway or being proposed that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic-fracturing practices. The White House Council on Environmental Quality is coordinating a review of hydraulic-fracturing practices, and a committee of the United States House of Representatives has conducted an investigation of hydraulic-fracturing practices. Furthermore, a number of federal agencies are analyzing, or have been requested to review, a variety of environmental issues associated with hydraulic fracturing. The EPA has commenced a study of the potential environmental effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water and groundwater. In addition, the U.S. Department of Energy is conducting an investigation into practices the agency could recommend to better protect the environment from drilling using hydraulic-fracturing completion methods.\nAdditionally, certain members of the Congress have previously called upon the U.S. Government Accountability Office to investigate how hydraulic fracturing might adversely affect water resources, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate the natural gas industry and any possible misleading of investors or the public regarding the economic feasibility of pursuing natural gas deposits in shales by means of hydraulic fracturing, and the U.S. Energy Information Administration to provide a better understanding of that agency\u2019s estimates regarding natural gas reserves, including reserves from shale formations, as well as uncertainties associated with those estimates. These ongoing or proposed studies, depending on their course and results obtained, could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the Safe Drinking Water Act or other regulatory processes.\nFurther, after reviewing extensive comments and making a number of changes to its previously July 28, 2011 proposed rules, on April 17, 2012 the EPA issued its final rules that subject a wide range of oil and gas operations (production, processing, transmission, storage, and distribution) to regulation under the New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPS) programs (with the NSPS and NESHAPS published in the Federal Register on August 16, 2012). The EPA revised the NSPS for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from leaking components at onshore gas processing plants and the NSPS for sulfur dioxide emissions from natural gas processing plants. The EPA also established standards for certain oil and gas operations not covered by existing standards, which will regulate VOC emissions from gas wells, centrifugal and reciprocating compressors, pneumatic controllers, and storage vessels over a certain size. The EPA also made revisions to the existing leak detection and repair requirements for the oil and gas production source category and the natural gas transmission source category and established action limits reflecting most achievable control for certain previously uncontrolled emission sources. There also are additional testing and related notification, record keeping and reporting requirements. These changes were effective October 15, 2012. In July 2014 EPA proposed and on December 19, 2014 EPA finalized updates and clarifications to the rules. They focused on additional detail on requirements for handling of gas and liquids during well completions, clarify requirements for storage tanks, define low pressure wells, clarify certain requirements for leak detection at natural gas processing plants, update requirements for reciprocating compressors, and update definition of \u201cresponsible official.\u201d\nThe EPA regulations also result in the first federal air standards for natural gas wells that are hydraulically fractured. The clarifications identify two distinct stages of the well completion, or \u201cflowback,\u201d operation. The initial stage when it is technically feasible for a separator (\u201cgreen completion\u201d equipment) to function. The next stage is the \u201cseparation flowback stage\u201d when gas, liquid hydrocarbons and water are separated. Wells subject to green completion must begin using green\ncompletions no later than January 1, 2015. Wells not subject to these requirements, such as exploratory wells, must flare the gas during separation.\nIncreased regulation and attention given to the hydraulic fracturing process could lead to greater opposition, including litigation, to oil and gas production activities using hydraulic fracturing techniques. Additional legislation or regulation could also lead to operational delays or increased operating costs in the production of oil, natural gas, and associated liquids including from the development of shale plays, or could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing. The adoption of additional federal, state or local laws or the implementation of regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing could potentially cause a decrease in the completion of new oil and gas wells, increased compliance costs and time, which could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOn October 20, 2011, EPA announced a schedule for development of standards for disposal of wastewater produced from shale gas operations to publicly owned treatment works (POTWs). The regulations will be developed under EPA\u2019s Effluent Guidelines Program under the authority of the Clean Water Act. Although anticipated in 2014, EPA has not yet proposed them. Direct discharges from unconventional oil and gas extraction are subject to NPDES permit regulations (40 CFR Parts 122 through 125). Indirect discharges to POTWs are subject to the General Pretreatment Regulations (40 CFR Part 403).\nOur ability to produce crude oil, natural gas, and associated liquids economically and in commercial quantities could be impaired if we are unable to acquire adequate supplies of water for our drilling operations and/or completions or are unable to dispose of or recycle the water we use at a reasonable cost and in accordance with applicable environmental rules.\nTo our knowledge, there have been no citations, suits, or contamination of potable drinking water arising from our fracturing operations. We do not have insurance policies in effect that are intended to provide coverage for losses solely related to hydraulic fracturing operations; however, it is possible that our general liability and excess liability insurance policies might cover third-party claims related to hydraulic fracturing operations and associated legal expenses depending on the specific nature of the claims, the timing of the claims, as well as the specific terms of such policies.\nUncertainty regarding increased seismic activity in Oklahoma.\nWe conduct oil and natural gas exploration, development and drilling activities in Oklahoma and elsewhere. In recent years, Oklahoma has experienced a significant increase in earthquakes and other seismic activity. Some parties believe that there is a correlation between certain oil and gas activities and the increased occurrence of earthquakes. The extent of this correlation, if any, is the subject of studies by both state and federal agencies the results of which remain uncertain. We cannot state at this time what if any impact this seismic activity may have on us or our industry in the future.\nThe hydraulic fracturing process on which we depend to produce commercial quantities of crude oil, natural gas, and associated NGLs from many reservoirs requires the use and disposal of significant quantities of water.\nOur inability to secure sufficient amounts of water, or to dispose of or recycle the water used in our oil and natural gas segment operations, could adversely impact our operations. Moreover, the imposition of new environmental initiatives and regulations could include restrictions on our ability to conduct certain operations such as hydraulic fracturing or disposal of wastes, including, but not limited to, produced water, drilling fluids, and other wastes associated with the exploration, development or production of oil and natural gas.\nCompliance with environmental regulations and permit requirements governing the withdrawal, storage and, use of surface water or groundwater necessary for hydraulic fracturing of wells may increase our operating costs and cause delays, interruptions, or termination of our operations, the extent of which cannot be predicted, all of which could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.\nWe may decide not to drill some of the prospects we have identified, and locations that we do drill may not yield oil, NGLs, and natural gas in commercially viable quantities.\nOur oil and natural gas segment's prospective drilling locations are in various stages of evaluation, ranging from a prospect that is ready to drill to a prospect that will require additional geological and engineering analysis. Based on a variety of factors, including future oil, NGLs, natural gas prices, the generation of additional seismic or geological information, and other factors, we may decide not to drill one or more of these prospects. As a result, we may not be able to increase or maintain our reserves or production, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, and results of operations.\nIn addition, the SEC's reserve reporting rules include a general requirement that, subject to limited exceptions, proved undeveloped reserves may only be booked if they relate to wells scheduled to be drilled within five years of the date of booking. At December 31, 2014, we had 177 proved undeveloped drilling locations. To the extent that we do not drill these locations within five years of initial booking, they may not continue to qualify for classification as proved reserves, and we may be required to reclassify such reserves as unproved reserves. The reclassification of those reserves could also have a negative effect on the borrowing base under our credit facility.\nThe cost of drilling, completing, and operating a well is often uncertain, and cost factors can adversely affect the economics of a well. Our efforts will be uneconomic if we drill dry holes or wells that are productive but do not produce enough oil, NGLs, and natural gas to be commercially viable after drilling, operating, and other costs.\nThe borrowing base under our credit agreement is determined semi-annually at the discretion of the lenders and is based in a large part on the prices for oil, NGLs, and natural gas.\nSignificant declines in oil, NGLs, and natural gas prices may result in a decrease in our borrowing base. The lenders can unilaterally adjust the borrowing base and therefore the borrowings permitted to be outstanding under our credit agreement. If outstanding borrowings are in excess of the borrowing base, we must (a) repay the loan in excess of the borrowing base, (b) dedicate additional properties to the borrowing base, or (c) begin monthly principal payments in accordance with our credit agreement.\nPotential listing of species as \u201cendangered\u201d under the federal Endangered Species Act could result in increased costs and new operating restrictions or delays on our operations and that of our customers, which could adversely affect our operations and financial results.\nThe federal Endangered Species Act, referred to as the \u201cESA,\u201d and analogous state laws regulate a variety of activities, including oil and gas development, which could have an adverse effect on species listed as threatened or endangered under the ESA or their habitats. The designation of previously unidentified endangered or threatened species could cause oil and natural gas exploration and production operators and service companies to incur additional costs or become subject to operating delays, restrictions or bans in affected areas, which impacts could adversely reduce the amount of drilling activities in affected areas. All three of our business segments could be subject to the effect of one or more species being listed as threatened or endangered within the areas of our operations. Numerous species have been listed or proposed for protected status in areas in which we provide or could in the future undertake operations. For instance, the American Burying Beetle and the Lesser Prairie-Chicken both have habitat in some areas where we operate or provide services. The FWS initiated the process to list the Lesser Prairie-Chicken as threatened in November 2012. On April 10, 2014 the FWS listed the Lesser Prairie-Chicken as \u201cthreatened,\u201d effective May 12, 2014. On April 10, 2014 the FWS also finalized a final rule under section 4(d) of the ESA which \u201cprovides that all of the prohibitions under 50 CFR 17.31 and 17.32 will apply to the lesser prairie-chicken, except . . . that [actions] incidental to activities conducted by a participant enrolled in, and operating in compliance with, the Lesser Prairie-Chicken Interstate Working Group\u2019s Lesser Prairie-Chicken Range-Wide Conservation Plan (rangewide plan) will not be prohibited.\u201d The rangewide plan is administered by the Western Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies (\u201cWAFWA\u201d). \u201cThe rangewide plan identifies the ecoregional population goals . . . for the four ecoregions: the Shinnery Oak Prairie Region (eastern New Mexico and southwest Texas panhandle); the Sand Sagebrush Prairie Region (southeastern Colorado, southwestern Kansas, and western Oklahoma panhandle); the Mixed Grass Prairie Region (northeastern Texas panhandle, western Oklahoma, and south central Kansas); and the Short Grass/CRP Mosaic Region (northwestern Kansas).\u201d In turn, the FWS and the WAFWA entered into the Range-Wide Oil and Gas Candidate Conservation Agreement with Assurances (\u201cCCAA\u201d) dated February 28, 2014. The CCAA will be administered by the WAFWA with FWS oversight and is a voluntary agreement intended to address the effects of oil and gas activities on the Lesser Prairie-Chicken and its habitat in the five states. WAFWA is to work with members of the oil and gas industry to enroll properties in the CCAA using Certificates of Inclusion (\u201cCIs\u201d) which are designed \u201cto facilitate the voluntary cooperation of the oil and gas industry in providing conservation benefits\u201d to the Lesser Prairie-Chicken. Participants will also \u201ccontribute funding [\u2018mitigation fees\u2019] for conservation to offset unavoidable impacts as part of their CIs. The sage grouse and certain wildflower species, among others, are also species that have been or are being considered for protected status under the ESA and whose range can coincide with oil and natural gas production activities. The presence of protected species in areas where we provide contract drilling or mid-stream services or conduct exploration and production operations could impair our ability to timely complete or carry out those services and, consequently, adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.\nOur new drilling rig program to design and build new proprietary BOSS drilling rigs is subject to risks, including delays and cost overruns, and may not meet our expectations.\nWe have launched a new drilling rig program to design and build new proprietary 1,500 horsepower AC electric drilling rigs, which we refer to as BOSS drilling rigs. We anticipate that this new drilling rig will position us to more effectively meet the demands of our existing customers, result in additional new-build contract opportunities and allow us to compete for the work of new customers. The construction of new BOSS drilling rigs is subject to the risks of delays or cost overruns inherent in any large construction project as a result of numerous possible factors, including the following:\n\u2022\nshortages of equipment, materials or skilled labor;\n\u2022\nwork stoppages and labor disputes;\n\u2022\nunscheduled delays in the delivery of ordered materials and equipment;\n\u2022\nunanticipated increases in the cost of equipment, labor and raw materials used in construction of our rigs, particularly steel;\n\u2022\nweather interferences;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in obtaining necessary permits or in meeting permit conditions;\n\u2022\nunforeseen design and engineering problems;\n\u2022\nfailure or delay in obtaining acceptance of the rig from our customer; and\n\u2022\nfailure or delay of third party equipment vendors or service providers.\nAs we design and build new BOSS drilling rigs, there can be no assurance that we will:\n\u2022\nobtain additional new-build contract opportunities; or\n\u2022\nsuccessfully improve our financial condition, results of operations or prospects as a result of the new rigs.\nCyber attacks targeting systems and infrastructure used by the oil and gas industry may adversely impact our operations.\nOur business has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct certain exploration, development and production activities. We depend on digital technology to estimate quantities of natural gas, oil and NGL reserves, process and record financial and operating data, analyze seismic and drilling information, and communicate with our employees and third-party partners. Although we utilize various procedures and controls to mitigate our exposure to such risk, cyber attacks are evolving and unpredictable. These attacks could include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data, other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in critical systems, the unauthorized release of protected information and the corruption or loss of data. The occurrence of such an attack could lead to financial losses and have a negative impact on our results of operations. We are not aware that any such breaches have occurred to date.", "PERMNO": 63781, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "UNTCQ"}
