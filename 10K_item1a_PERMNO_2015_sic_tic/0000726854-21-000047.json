{"cik": "726854", "company": "CITY HOLDING CO", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-24", "item_1A": "Item 1A.Risk Factors\nAn investment in the Company\u2019s common stock is subject to risks inherent to the Company\u2019s business. The material risks and uncertainties that management believes affect the Company are described below. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of or focused on or that management currently deems immaterial may also impair the Company\u2019s business operations. You should carefully consider the risks described below, as well as the other information included or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before making an investment in the Company\u2019s common stock. If any of the following risks occur, the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected, and you could lose all or part of your investment. In this section, the term \"Company\" includes City National unless the circumstances dictate otherwise.\nEconomic Risks\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is adversely affecting our business and financial results. The ultimate impact will depend on future developments, which cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic and actions taken by governmental authorities in response to the pandemic.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is creating extensive disruptions to the global economy and to the lives of individuals throughout the world. Business and consumer customers of the Company are experiencing varying degrees of financial distress as a result of the unprecedented uncertainty, volatility and disruption in the financial markets and in governmental, commercial and consumer activity caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the ongoing and dynamic nature of the circumstances, it is not possible to accurately predict the extent, severity or duration of these conditions or when normal economic and operating conditions will resume. For this reason, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic affects our business, operations and financial condition, as well as our regulatory capital and liquidity ratios, is highly uncertain and unpredictable and depends on, among other things, new information that may emerge concerning the scope, duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, actions taken by governmental authorities and other parties in response to the pandemic, the scale of distribution and public acceptance of any vaccines for COVID-19 and the effectiveness of such vaccines in stemming or stopping the spread of COVID-19. The adverse impact on the markets in which we operate and on our business, operations and financial condition is expected to remain elevated until the pandemic subsides.\nAs a participating lender in the Paycheck Protection Program, (\"PPP\"), we may be subject to additional risks regarding the risk of holding the PPP loans at unfavorable interest rates, the Company's processing of PPP loans, and the dependency we have on the federal government's continuation and support of the program.\nThe CARES Act was enacted on March 27, 2020. Among many other components, the CARES Act provides for payment forbearance on mortgages or loans to borrowers experiencing a hardship during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company has offered deferral and forbearance plans and made PPP loans with a maturity of two years to small businesses consistent with the CARES Act that are fully guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (\"SBA\"). The PPP loans will be fully forgiven if the funds are used by the borrowers for payroll costs, mortgage interests, rent and utilities and loan payments will also be deferred until the SBA has determined whether the loan is eligible to be partially or fully forgivable. In addition, no collateral or personal guarantees are required for PPP loans. These PPP loans are typically larger in amount than loans to individuals and, therefore, have the potential for larger losses on a single loan basis. The borrowers may not be able to repay the loans if the SBA determines that they are only partially or not forgivable at all. The borrowers, despite having a PPP loan, may not be able to maintain the level of employees and salary levels required for forgiveness due to the current economic conditions and thereby create the risk that the PPP loan will not be forgiven in full. Also, the borrower\u2019s ability to repay the loan may not recover when the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, and the federal government may not timely pay the amounts that it would owe the Company pursuant to the terms of the loans, the guarantees and the PPP. Further, the Company may lend to borrowers under the PPP with creditworthiness or credit supports that are less than normal practice and may be subject to the risk of PPP fraud cases.\nAdditionally, every PPP borrower is in a challenging financial position that may negatively impact its ability to repay if the loans are not subject to forgiveness. If the Company\u2019s borrowers under the PPP loan fail to qualify for loan forgiveness or are unable to repay their loans, the Company is at heightened risk of holding these loans that are at unfavorable interest rates and underwriting standards as compared to the loans to customers to whom the Company would have otherwise lent. Moreover, while the PPP loans are fully guaranteed by the SBA, if the SBA makes a determination that there was a deficiency in the manner in which the PPP loan was originated, funded or serviced by the Company, which may or may not be related to an ambiguity in the law, rules or guidance regarding operation of the PPP, the SBA may deny its liability under the guaranty, reduce the amount of the guaranty, or, if the Company has already been paid under the guaranty, seek recovery from the Company of any loss related to the deficiency.\nFinally, due to the short timeframe between the passing of the CARES Act and the implementing of the PPP, there is some ambiguity in the laws and guidance regarding the operation of the PPP. Several large banks have been subject to\nlitigation as it relates to the process and procedures that banks used in processing applications for the PPP. We may be exposed to the risk of litigation, from both customers and non-customers who approached the Company requesting PPP loans. Any litigation filed against the Company or the Bank may be costly, regardless of the outcome, and result in significant financial liability or adversely affect our reputation. As a result, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nEconomic Conditions in the Company's Market Areas Could Negatively Impact the Company's Business and Financial Condition.\nThe Company\u2019s business is concentrated in West Virginia, Kentucky, Virginia and southeastern Ohio. As a result, the Company\u2019s results of operation, cash flows and financial condition are affected by local and regional economic conditions. A downturn in the economies within the Company\u2019s market areas, or in any one of them, could negatively impact the Company\u2019s results of operation and financial condition. Some examples of economic deterioration include declines in economic growth, declines in consumer and business confidence, increases in inflation, increases in the cost of capital and credit, and limitations in the availability of credit. The Company\u2019s financial performance generally, and the ability of its customers to pay interest on and repay principal of outstanding loans to City National, is highly dependent on the strength of the economic and business environment in the market areas where the Company operates and in the United States as a whole. Additionally, the value of collateral securing loans made and held by City National is impacted by the strength of the economy. Deteriorating economic conditions in the Company\u2019s market areas could cause declines in the overall quality of the loan portfolio requiring charge-off of a greater percentage of loans and/or an increase in the allowance for credit losses, which could negatively impact the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nWhile the economic and business environments in West Virginia, Kentucky, Virginia and southeastern Ohio have shown improvement since the recession of 2007 to 2009, there can be no assurance that such improvement will continue or that the economies in the Company\u2019s market areas, or the United States as a whole, will not slip into another recession. A lack of continued economic improvement or economic recession could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operation and financial condition. An economic slowdown could have the following consequences:\n\u2022Loan delinquencies may increase;\n\u2022Problem assets and foreclosures may increase;\n\u2022Demand for City National's products and services may decline; and\n\u2022Collateral (including real estate) that secures loans made by City National may decline in value, in turn reducing customers\u2019 borrowing power and making existing loans less secure.\nThe oil, natural gas and coal industries, and businesses ancillary thereto, play an important role in the economies of West Virginia, Kentucky, Virginia and southeastern Ohio. The volatility in oil and gas prices since 2014 has negatively impacted oil and gas and other businesses in the Company\u2019s market areas. Additionally, the coal industry continues to be in decline as a result of increased environmental and safety regulatory burden, increased competition from alternative energy sources and a decline in demand for coal. The Company has limited direct exposure to coal industry specific loans. Prolonged low oil and gas prices, and continued decline in the coal industry, could result in downward pressure on businesses in the Company\u2019s market area which could negatively affect City National\u2019s customers (both individuals and businesses). As a result, the Company\u2019s operating results and financial condition could be negatively impacted.\nCredit and Interest Rate Risks\nThe Value of Real Estate Collateral May Fluctuate Significantly Resulting in an Under-Collateralized Loan Portfolio.\nThe market value of real estate, particularly real estate held for investment, can fluctuate significantly in a short period of time as a result of market conditions in the geographic area in which the real estate is located. If the value of the real estate serving as collateral for the Company's loan portfolio were to decline materially, a significant part of the Company's loan portfolio could become under-collateralized. If the loans that are collateralized by real estate become troubled during a time when market conditions are declining or have declined, then, in the event of foreclosure, we may not be able to realize the amount of collateral that we anticipated at the time of originating the loan. This could have a material adverse effect on the Company's provision for credit losses and the Company's operating results and financial condition.\nThe Company Is Subject to Lending Risk.\nThere are inherent risks associated with the Company\u2019s lending activities. These risks include, among other things, the impact of changes in interest rates and changes in the economic conditions in the markets where the Company operates. Increases in interest rates and/or weakening economic conditions could adversely impact the ability of borrowers to repay\noutstanding loans or the value of the collateral securing these loans. The Company is also subject to various laws and regulations that affect its lending activities. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject the Company to regulatory enforcement action that could result in restrictions of the Company's activities or the assessment of significant civil money penalties against the Company.\nA substantial portion of the Company's loan portfolio is comprised of residential and commercial real estate loans. The Company's concentration of real estate loans may subject the Company to additional risk, such as market fluctuations in market value of collateral, environmental liability associated with hazardous or toxic substances found on, in or around the collateral, and difficulty monitoring income-producing property serving as a source of repayment and collateral. Any of these or other risks relating to real estate loans could adversely affect the collection by the Company of the outstanding loan balances.\nThe Company Is Subject to Environmental Liability Risk.\nA significant portion of the Company\u2019s loan portfolio is secured by real property. In the ordinary course of the Company's business, it sometimes takes title to real property collateral through foreclosure after a borrower defaults on the loan for which the real property is collateral. There is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be present on properties that the Company acquires by way of foreclosure. The Company may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage relating to any hazardous or toxic substances present on the properties it acquires in foreclosure. Environmental laws may require the Company to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected property\u2019s value or limit the Company\u2019s ability to use or sell the affected property. Furthermore, remediation costs and financial and other liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company Is Subject to Interest Rate Risk.\nChanges in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, could influence not only the interest income the Company receives on loans and securities and the amount of interest it pays on deposits and borrowings, but such changes could also affect (i) the Company\u2019s ability to originate loans and obtain deposits, (ii) the fair value of the Company\u2019s financial assets and liabilities, and (iii) the average duration of the Company\u2019s mortgage-backed securities portfolio. The Company\u2019s earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon its net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities, and interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowed funds. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond the Company\u2019s control, including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and, in particular, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. If the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments, the Company\u2019s net interest income, and therefore its earnings and net profit, could be adversely affected. Earnings also could be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings.\nAlthough management believes it has implemented effective asset and liability management strategies, including the use of derivatives as hedging instruments, to reduce the potential effects of changes in interest rates on the Company\u2019s results of operations, any substantial, unexpected, prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. See the section in Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk located elsewhere in this report for further discussion related to the Company\u2019s management of interest rate risk.\nThe Company\u2019s Allowance for Credit Losses May Not be Sufficient.\nThe Company maintains an allowance for credit losses, which is a valuation account that is deducted from the loans' amortized cost basis to present the net amount expected to be collected on the loans. Loans are charged off against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed. Expected recoveries do not exceed the aggregate of amounts previously charged-off and expected to be charged-off. Management estimates the allowance balance using relevant available information, from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses. Adjustments to historical loss information are made for differences in current loan-specific risk characteristics, such as differences in underwriting standards, portfolio mix, delinquency level, or term as well as for changes in environmental conditions, such as changes in unemployment rates, property values, or other relevant factors. These evaluations are conducted at least quarterly and more frequently if deemed necessary.\nThe determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires the Company to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes. Changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans and other factors, both within and outside of the Company\u2019s control, may require an increase in the allowance for credit losses. In addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review the Company\u2019s allowance for credit losses and may require an increase in the provision for credit losses or the recognition of further loan charge-offs based on judgments different than those of management. Any increases in the allowance for credit losses will result in a decrease in net income and capital, and may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nSee the section captioned \"Allowance for Credit Losses\" in Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations located elsewhere in this report for further discussion related to the Company\u2019s process for determining the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses.\nWe may be adversely affected by changes in the method of determining LIBOR, or the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate, for our variable rate loans, derivative contracts and other financial assets and liabilities.\nOur business includes loans, derivative contracts and other financial instruments which are directly or indirectly dependent on LIBOR to establish their interest rate and/or value. The administrator of LIBOR has proposed to extend publication of the most commonly used U.S. Dollar LIBOR settings to June 30, 2023 and to cease publishing other LIBOR settings on December 31, 2021. The U.S. federal banking agencies have issued guidance strongly encouraging banking organizations to cease using U.S. dollar LIBOR as a reference rate in new contracts as soon as practicable and in any event by December 31, 2021. It is not possible to know whether LIBOR will continue to be viewed as an acceptable benchmark, what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, or what the effect of any such changes in views or alternatives may have on the financial markets for LIBOR-linked financial instruments.\nRisks Related to an Investment in the Company's Securities\nThe Value of the Company\u2019s Common Stock Fluctuates.\nThe market for the Company\u2019s common stock may experience significant price and volume fluctuations in response to a number of factors including actual or anticipated quarterly variations in operating results, changes in expectations of future financial performance, changes in estimates by securities analysts, governmental regulatory action, banking industry reform measures, customer relationship developments and other factors, many of which will be beyond the Company\u2019s control.\nFurthermore, the stock market in general, and the market for financial institutions in particular, have experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock, regardless of actual operating performance.\nThe Trading Volume in the Company\u2019s Common Stock Is Less Than That of Other Larger Financial Services Companies.\nAlthough the Company\u2019s common stock is listed for trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, the trading volume in its common stock is less than that of other financial services companies. A public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth, liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence in the marketplace of willing buyers and sellers of the Company\u2019s common stock at any given time. This presence depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which the Company has no control. Given the lower trading volume of the Company\u2019s common stock, significant sales of the Company\u2019s common stock, or the expectation of these sales, could cause the Company\u2019s stock price to fall.\nFuture Sales of Shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock Could Negatively Affect its Market Price.\nFuture sales of substantial amounts of the Company\u2019s common stock, or the perception that such sales could occur, could adversely affect the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock in the open market. We make no prediction as to the effect, if any, that future sales of shares, or the availability of shares for future sale, will have on the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nShares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock Are Not FDIC Insured.\nNeither the FDIC nor any other governmental agency insures the shares of the Company\u2019s common stock. Therefore, the value of your common stock of the Company will be based on their market value and may decline.\nStrategic Risks\nDue to Increased Competition, the Company May Not be Able to Attract and Retain Banking Customers.\nThe Company faces substantial and intense competition in all areas of its operation, including interest rates and other terms for loans and deposits and the range and quality of services provided. Competition comes from a variety of different competitors, many of which have competitive advantages over the Company. The Company faces competition from:\n\u2022local, regional and national banks;\n\u2022savings and loans associations;\n\u2022Internet banks;\n\u2022credit unions;\n\u2022mutual funds;\n\u2022mortgage banking firms;\n\u2022finance companies;\n\u2022financial technology (\"fin-tech\") companies;\n\u2022brokerage firms;\n\u2022investment advisory and wealth management firms;\n\u2022investment banking firms; and\n\u2022other entities.\nIn particular, many of City National\u2019s competitors are larger banks and financial institutions whose greater resources may afford them a marketplace advantage by enabling them to maintain numerous banking locations and mount extensive promotional and advertising campaigns. Additionally, the Company\u2019s competitors may have products and services not offered by the Company, which may cause current and potential customers to choose those institutions over the Company. The financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory, and technological changes and the continued consolidation within the banking industry. Consumer preferences and expectations continue to evolve, and technology and regulatory changes have lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for banks to expand their geographic reach by providing services over the internet and for non-banks to offer products and services typically provided by banks. Many of our non-bank competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and expenses associated with regulatory compliance and may have lower cost structures, such as credit unions that are not subject to federal income tax.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, including our ability to develop, maintain, and build long-term customer relationships; our ability to expand our market area and range of services and products offered; our ability to keep up-to-date with technological advancements, both with respect to new and existing products and with respect to cybersecurity; customer satisfaction with our products and services; and general industry and economic trends. Failure to perform successfully in any of these areas could significantly weaken our competitive position. If the Company is unable to attract new customers and retain current customers, loan and deposit growth could decrease, causing the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition to be negatively impacted.\nNew Lines of Business or New Products and Services May Subject the Company to Additional Risks.\nFrom time to time, the Company may implement new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business. There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts, particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed. In developing and marketing new lines of business and/or products and services, the Company may invest significant time and resources. External factors, such as compliance with regulations, competitive alternatives, and shifting market preferences, may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business or a new product or service. If we are unable to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business or new products or services, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and result of operations.\nThe Company Faces Technology Change and the Emergence of Nonbank Alternatives to the Financial System.\nConsumers may decide not to use banks to complete their financial transactions or invest or deposit their funds. Technology and other changes, including the emergence of fin-tech companies are allowing parties to complete financial\ntransactions through alternative methods that historically have involved banks. For example, consumers can pay bills and transfer funds directly without the assistance of banks. The process of eliminating banks as intermediaries, known as \"disintermediation,\" could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits. The loss of these revenue streams and the lower cost of deposits as a source of funds could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe banking and financial services industry continually undergoes technological change, with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The Company\u2019s future success depends on its ability to addresses the needs and preferences of its customers by using technology to provide products and services that enhance customer convenience and that create additional efficiencies in the Company\u2019s operations. Many of the Company\u2019s competitors have greater resources to invest in technological improvements, and the Company may not be able to implement new technology-driven products and services as quickly and effectively as its competitors. In addition, the necessary process of updating technology can itself lead to disruptions in the availability or function of systems. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nThe Value of the Company's Investments Could Decline.\nThe Company holds available-for-sale investment securities, which are carried at fair value. The determination of fair value for certain of these securities requires significant judgment of the Company\u2019s management. Therefore, the market price the Company receives for its investment securities could be less than the carrying value for such securities. Further, the value of the Company\u2019s investment portfolio could decline for numerous reasons, many of which are outside the Company\u2019s control, including general market conditions, volatility in the securities market, and inflation rates or expectations of inflation. A portion of the Company\u2019s investment portfolio consists of municipal securities. The value of these securities is subject to additional factors, including the financial condition of the government issuer and general demand for municipal securities.\nThe Company May Be Required to Write Down Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, Causing Its Financial Condition and Results to Be Negatively Affected.\nWhen the Company acquires a business, a portion of the purchase price of the acquisition is allocated to goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired determines the amount of the purchase price that is allocated to goodwill acquired. At December 31, 2020, the Company\u2019s goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets were approximately $119 million. Under current accounting standards, if the Company determines goodwill or intangible assets are impaired, it would be required to write down the value of these assets. The Company conducts an annual review to determine whether goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets are impaired. The Company recently completed such an impairment analysis and concluded that no impairment charge was necessary for the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company cannot provide assurance whether it will be required to take an impairment charge in the future. Any impairment charge would have a negative effect on its shareholders\u2019 equity and financial results and may cause a decline in the Company's stock price.\nThe Company May Require Additional Capital in the Future, But That Capital May Not Be Available or May Be Dilutive.\nThe Company faces liquidity risk, which is the possibility that the Company may not be able to meet its obligations as they come due, both to creditors and customers, or capitalize on growth opportunities because of a lack of liquidity. Lack of liquidity can be caused by an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate financing on a timely basis, at a reasonable cost and on other reasonable terms, and within acceptable risk tolerances. The Company is also required by its regulators to maintain specified levels of capital to maintain its operations. The Company\u2019s business needs and future growth, including future acquisitions or organic growth into new markets and business lines, may require it to raise additional capital.\nOne of the Company\u2019s main sources for liquidity is customer deposits. Increased competition and the availability of alternative products may reduce the Company\u2019s ability to attract and retain core deposits. If customers move money out of bank deposits into other investments, we could lose a relatively low cost source of funds.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to raise additional capital, whether in the form of debt or equity, is dependent on several factors, including the condition of capital markets, investment demand, and the Company\u2019s financial condition and performance. We cannot assure that we will be able to raise additional capital in the future on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us, or at all.\nThe issuance of debt may increase our capital costs and reduce our liquidity. The issuance of equity securities, including common stock or one or more series of preferred stock, of the Company may reduce the value of our common stock and have a dilutive effect on holders of our common stock. The Company may issue debt or equity securities that are senior in priority to our common stock as to distributions and liquidation, which could negatively affect the value of our common stock.\nAcquisition and Other Growth Opportunities May Present Challenges.\nAny future acquisitions may result in unforeseen difficulties, which could require significant time and attention from the Company\u2019s management that would otherwise be directed at developing its existing business, and expenses. In addition, the Company could discover undisclosed liabilities resulting from any acquisitions for which it may become responsible. Further, the benefits that the Company anticipates from these acquisitions may not develop. We may experience difficulty integrating businesses acquired through mergers and acquisitions and may fail to realize the expected revenue increases, cost savings, increases in market presence, and other projected benefits from acquisition activity. Acquisitions utilizing the Company\u2019s common stock as consideration may dilute the value of the Company\u2019s common stock, which dilution may not be recouped or recovered for a significant amount of time after the acquisition, if ever.\nAny merger or acquisition opportunity that we decide to pursue will ultimately be subject to regulatory approval and other closing conditions. We may expend significant time and resources pursing potential acquisitions that are never consummated due to lack of regulatory approval or other issues. Competition for acquisition candidates in the banking industry is intense. We may expend significant time and resources evaluating acquisition candidates and conducting due diligence that does not lead to an acquisition opportunity.\nThe Company may implement new lines of business, enter new market areas, or offer new products and services from time to time. There can be substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts, especially where markets are not fully developed. The Company may invest significant time and resources in developing and marketing new lines of business, but the benefits that the Company anticipates from these activities may not develop as expected. External factors, such as compliance with regulations, competitive alternatives, and shifting market preferences may impact the Company\u2019s ability to successfully implement organic growth strategies. Failure to successfully manage these risks could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nOperational Risks\nThe Company May be Adversely Affected by the Soundness of Third Parties, Including Other Financial Institutions.\nThe Company's business is highly dependent on third party vendors, especially with respect to information technology and telecommunication systems, payment processing system, and mobile and online banking systems. Our operations rely heavily on the secure processing, storage, transmission, and monitoring of information and transactions, and many of these services are outsourced to third party vendors. The failure of these systems or the inability of a third party vendor to continue providing these services on a reliable basis could adversely affect our operations. In addition, the failure of third parties to comply with applicable laws and regulations, or fraud or misconduct on the part of any of these third parties, could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our reputation. It may be difficult for us to replace some of our critical third party vendors, particularly vendors providing our core banking, debit card services and information services, in a timely manner and on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us. Any of these events could increase our expenses and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFinancial services institutions are interrelated with one another as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, and other relationships. The Company has exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, brokers and dealers, investment banks, and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose the Company to credit risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or client. In addition, the Company\u2019s credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by the Company cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit or derivative exposure due to the Company. Any such losses could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, as a result of financial entities and technology systems becoming more interdependent and complex, a cybersecurity incident, information breach or loss, or technology failure that comprises the systems or data of one financial entity could have a material impact on counterparties or other market participants, including the Company.\nThe Company Depends on the Accuracy and Completeness of Information About Our Customers and Counterparties.\nThe Company relies on information provided to us by or on behalf of customers and other third parties, including financial statements, credit reports, and other financial information, in deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions and in evaluating and monitoring our loan portfolio. The Company also relies on representations from our customers, counterparties, and other third parties, such as independent auditors, as to the accuracy and completeness of that information. Reliance on inaccurate, incomplete, fraudulent or misleading financial or business information could result in credit losses, reputational damage, or other effects that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation.\nCustomers May Default on the Repayment of Loans.\nCity National\u2019s customers may default on the repayment of loans, which may negatively impact the Company\u2019s earnings due to loss of principal and interest income. Increased operating expenses may result from management's allocation of time and resources to the collection and work-out of the loan. Collection efforts may or may not be successful causing the Company to write off the loan or repossess the collateral securing the loan, which may or may not exceed the balance of the loan.\nThe Company May Be Required to Repurchase Mortgage Loans or Indemnify Mortgage Loan Purchasers.\nThe Company sells some of the fixed rate residential mortgage loans it originates to mortgage loan purchasers in the secondary market. Purchasers of residential mortgage loans, such as government sponsored entities, often require sellers of residential mortgage loans to either repurchase loans previously sold or reimburse purchasers for losses related to loans previously sold under certain circumstances, such as failure to comply with the purchaser\u2019s purchase criteria, breach of a representation or warranty related to the loan or its origination, or borrower fraud. There is no assurance that a purchaser of the Company\u2019s residential mortgage loans will not demand repurchase or indemnification for losses, which could increase the Company\u2019s expenses in defending such claims and negatively affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operation.\nThe Company's Risk Management Practices May Prove to be Inadequate or Not Fully Effective.\nThe Company's risk management framework seeks to mitigate risk and appropriately balance risk and return. The Company has established policies and procedures intended to identify, monitor and manage the types of risk which it is subject to, including credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, operational risk and reputational risk. Although the Company has devoted significant resources to develop its risk management policies and procedures and expects to continue to do so in the future, these policies and procedures, as well as its risk management techniques, may not be fully effective. In addition, as regulations and markets in which the Company operates continue to evolve, its risk management framework may not always keep sufficient pace with those changes. If the Company's risk management framework does not effectively identify or mitigate its risks, the Company could suffer unexpected losses and could be materially adversely affected. Management of the Company's risks in some cases depends upon the use of analytical and/or forecasting models. If the models the Company uses to mitigate these risks are inadequate, it may incur increased losses. In addition, there may be risks that exist, or that develop in the future, that the Company has not appropriately anticipated, identified or mitigated.\nNew Accounting Standard Will Result in a Significant Change in How the Company Estimates Credit Losses.\nEffective January 1, 2020, the Company implemented the provision of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-13, \"Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.\" This standard replaced the incurred loss impairment methodology for estimating credit losses with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of information to inform credit loss estimates. The new current expected credit loss (CECL) model applies to the Company\u2019s allowance for credit losses, available-for-sale and held-to-maturity debt securities, purchased financial assets with credit deterioration, and certain off-balance sheet credit exposures. The measurement of expected credit losses under this new standard takes place at the time the financial asset is first added to the Company\u2019s balance sheet and periodically thereafter. This differs significantly from the \"incurred loss\" model previously required under current generally accepted accounting principles, that delayed recognition until it was probable a loss had been incurred. This new standard could create more volatility in the level of the allowance for credit losses and in our earnings.\nOur adoption of CECL resulted in an increase to the allowance for credit losses of $5.8 million. The impact of CECL in future periods will be significantly influenced by the composition, characteristics and quality of our loan portfolio, as well as the prevailing economic conditions and forecasts utilized. Should these factors materially change, we may be\nrequired to increase or decrease our allowance for credit losses, decrease or increase our reported income, and introduce additional volatility into our reported earnings.\nRisks Related to Legal, Reputational and Compliance Matters\nCertain Banking Laws May Have an Anti-Takeover Effect.\nApplication of certain federal banking laws and regulations applicable to the Company and City National, including regulatory approval requirements for change in control, merger or other business combination transactions, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire the Company or City National, even if doing so would be perceived to be beneficial to the Company's shareholders. These laws and regulations effectively inhibit a non-negotiated merger or other business combination, which, in turn, could adversely affect the market price of the Company's common stock.\nThe Company\u2019s Ability to Pay Dividends Is Limited.\nAlthough the Board of Directors has declared cash dividends in the past, the Company's current ability to pay dividends is largely dependent upon the receipt of dividends from City National. Federal laws impose restrictions on the ability of City National to pay dividends. Holders of shares of the Company\u2019s common stock are entitled to dividends if, and when, they are declared by the Company\u2019s Board of Directors out of funds legally available for that purpose. Additional restrictions are placed upon the Company by the policies of federal regulators, including the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s November 14, 1985 policy statement, which provides that bank holding companies should pay dividends only out of the past year\u2019s net income, and then only if their prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with their capital needs, asset quality, and overall financial condition. In general, future dividend policy is subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend upon a number of factors, including the Company\u2019s and City National\u2019s future earnings, capital requirements, regulatory constraints and financial condition. There can be no assurance that the Company will continue to pay dividends to its shareholders in the future.\nThe Company and City National Are Extensively Regulated.\nThe Company operates in a highly regulated environment and is subject to supervision and regulation by a number of governmental regulatory agencies, including the Federal Reserve Board, the OCC and the FDIC. Regulations adopted by these agencies, which are generally intended to provide protection for depositors and customers rather than for the benefit of shareholders, govern a comprehensive range of matters including but not limited to (i) ownership and control of the Company's equity, (ii) acquisition of other companies and businesses, (iii) permissible activities, (iv) maintenance of adequate capital levels and (v) other operational aspects. Compliance with banking regulations is costly and restricts certain of our activities, including the payment of dividends, mergers and acquisitions, investments, loan amounts and concentrations, interest rates, opening and closing branch locations, and other activities. The bank regulatory agencies also possess broad authority to prevent or remedy unsafe or unsound practices or violations of law. These agencies have significant discretion in their ability to enforce penalties and further limit the Company's activities if the Company fails to comply with applicable regulations.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act instituted major changes to the bank and financial institutions regulatory regimes, and additional changes continue to be proposed and implemented by various regulatory agencies. Other changes to statutes, regulations or regulatory policies, including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes, regulations or policies, could affect the Company in substantial and unpredictable ways. Such changes could subject the Company to reduced revenues, additional costs, limit the types of financial services and products the Company may offer and/or increase the ability of non-banks to offer competing financial services and products, among other things. The burden and expenses associated with regulatory compliance have been increasing and may continue to increase. Failure to comply with laws, regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties and/or reputation damage, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.\nProposals to change the laws and regulations governing financial institutions are frequently raised in Congress and before bank regulatory authorities. Changes in applicable laws or regulations could materially affect the Company\u2019s business, and the likelihood of any major changes in the future and their effects are impossible to determine. Moreover, it is impossible to predict the ultimate form any proposed legislation might take or how it might affect the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s Controls and Procedures May Fail or Be Circumvented.\nAny failure or circumvention of the Company\u2019s controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and\nfinancial condition. Management regularly reviews and updates the Company\u2019s internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls, no matter how well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met.\nSignificant Legal Actions Could Result in Substantial Liabilities.\nFrom time to time, the Company is subject to claims related to its operations. These claims and legal actions, including supervisory actions by its regulators, could involve large monetary claims and cause the Company to incur significant defense expenses. As a result, the Company may be exposed to substantial liabilities, which could negatively affect its shareholders\u2019 equity and financial results.\nThe Company Faces Reputational Risk.\nThe Company faces threats to its reputation from many sources, including adverse sentiment about financial institutions generally, unethical practices, employee misconduct, failure to deliver expected standards of service or quality, regulatory compliance deficiencies, and questionable or fraudulent activities of the Company\u2019s employees and customers. Negative publicity may arise regarding the Company\u2019s business, employees, or customers, with or without merit, and could result in the loss of customers, investors and employees, costly litigation, a decline in revenue, and increased regulatory oversight.\nThe Company Is Subject to Possible Claims and Litigation Relating to Fiduciary Activities.\nA significant portion of the business conducted in the Company's trust division involves the Company assuming the special role of a fiduciary to its customers and to the beneficiaries of its customers' assets. Customers or beneficiaries could make claims and take legal action relating to the Company\u2019s fiduciary activities. Whether such claims and legal action related to the Company's performance of its fiduciary responsibilities are founded or unfounded, if such matters are not resolved in a manner favorable to the Company, they may result in significant financial liability. Furthermore, the mere existence of a claim or legal action related to the Company\u2019s fiduciary activities could adversely affect the Company\u2019s reputation among customers and prospective customers. Any financial liability or reputation damage could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in Tax Law and Accounting Standards Could Materially Affect the Company's Operations.\nChanges in tax laws, or changes in the interpretation of existing tax laws, could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s operations. Similarly, new accounting standards, changes to existing accounting standards, and changes to the methods of preparing financial statements could impact the Company\u2019s reported financial condition and results of operations. These factors are outside the Company\u2019s control and it is impossible to predict changes that may occur and the effect of such changes.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act went into effect on January 1, 2018 and significantly impacted the federal income taxation of the Company and its customers. While there are benefits to the Company from the new law, including a reduction of its federal income tax rate, there are also adverse consequences, including an elimination of certain deductible expenses. There is also substantial uncertainty regarding the consequences of the new law on the Company and its customer base.\nRisks Related to Privacy and Technology\nSystem Failure, Cybersecurity Breaches, Fraud and Employee Misconduct Could Subject the Company to Increased Operating Costs, as Well as Litigation and Other Potential Losses.\nThe computer systems and network infrastructure that the Company uses could be vulnerable to unforeseen hardware and cybersecurity issues, including \"hacking\" and \"identity theft.\" The Company\u2019s operations are dependent upon its ability to protect its computer equipment against damage from fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or a similar catastrophic event. Any damage or failure that causes an interruption in the Company\u2019s operations could have an adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the Company\u2019s operations are dependent upon its ability to protect the computer systems and network infrastructure utilized by the Company, including our mobile and Internet banking activities, against damage from physical break-ins, cybersecurity breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, theft of information, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors, and other disruptive problems. The Company is further exposed to the risk that its third-party service providers may be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations with respect to managing the Company\u2019s information and systems. Any cybersecurity breach or other disruptions, whether by the\nCompany or our third-party vendors, would jeopardize the security of information stored in and transmitted through the Company\u2019s computer systems and network infrastructure, which may result in significant liability to the Company, damage its reputation and inhibit current and potential customers from its using Internet banking services. The Company could incur substantial costs and suffer other negative consequences, such as: remediation costs, such as liability for stolen assets or information, repairs of system damage, and incentives to customers in an effort to maintain relationships after an attack; increased cybersecurity protection costs, such as organizational changes, deploying additional personnel and protection technologies, training employees, and engaging third party experts and consultants; and damage to the Company's competitiveness, stock price, and long-term shareholder values.\nDespite efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems, we will not be able to anticipate all security breaches of these types, nor will we be able to implement guaranteed preventive measures against such security breaches. Persistent attackers may succeed in penetrating defenses given enough resources, time and motive. The techniques used by cyber criminals change frequently, may not be recognized until launched, and can originate from a wide variety of sources, including outside groups such as external service providers, organized crime affiliates, terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments. These risks may increase in the future as we continue to increase our mobile payment and other Internet-based product offerings and expand our internal usage of web-based products and applications.\nA successful attack to our system security or the system security of one of our critical third-party vendors could cause us serious negative consequences, including significant disruption of operations, misappropriation of confidential information, and damage to our computers or systems or those of our customers and counterparties. A successful security breach could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws, financial loss to us or to our customers, loss of confidence in our security measures, significant litigation exposure, and harm to our reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nCriminals are committing fraud at an increasing rate and are using more sophisticated techniques. The Company faces risk of fraudulent activity in many forms, including online payment transfer fraud, debit card fraud, check fraud, mechanical devices attached to ATMs or ITMs, phishing attacks to obtain personal information, email-related frauds and the impersonation of Company executives or vendors, and impersonation of clients through the use of falsified or stolen credentials. The Company may suffer losses as a result of fraudulent activity committed against it, its customers, and other counterparties.\nThe Company could be adversely affected if one of its employees causes a significant operational breakdown or failure, either as a result of human error or where an individual purposefully sabotages or fraudulently manipulates the Company\u2019s operations or systems. Misconduct by employees could include fraudulent, improper or unauthorized activities on behalf of customers or improper use of confidential information. Employee errors or misconduct could subject the Company to regulatory enforcement action, legal action, reputational damage, and other losses.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nThe Company Relies Heavily on Its Management Team, and the Unexpected Loss of Key Management May Adversely Affect Its Operations.\nThe Company's success to date has been strongly influenced by its ability to attract and to retain senior management personnel experienced in banking in the markets it serves. Competition for key personnel is intense. The Company's ability to retain executive officers and the current management teams will continue to be important to the successful implementation of its strategies. The Company has employment agreements with these key employees in the event of a change of control, as well as confidentiality, non-solicitation and non-competition agreements related to its stock options. The unexpected loss of services of any key management personnel, or the inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future, could have an adverse effect on the Company's business and financial results.\nSevere Weather, Natural Disasters, Acts of War or Terrorism, and Other External Events Could Significantly Impact the Company's Business.\nSevere weather, natural disasters, health emergencies, acts of war or terrorism, and other adverse external events, especially those that directly affect the Company\u2019s market areas, could have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s ability to conduct business. These events could adversely affect the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, decrease the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant property and infrastructure damage, and affect the stability of the Company\u2019s deposit base. The Company may experience decreased revenue, increased charge-offs, and other expenses.", "PERMNO": 11442, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "CHCO"}
