{"cik": "913341", "company": "C & F FINANCIAL CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-03", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORS\nRisk Factors Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe Corporation\u2019s results of operations and financial condition have been, and will likely continue to be, adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and, depending on future developments, may be materially adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe outbreak of the novel coronavirus and the resulting COVID-19 pandemic, the widespread government response and the impact on consumers and businesses have caused significant disruption in the United States and international economies and financial markets and have had and will likely continue to have a significant impact on consumers and businesses in our market area and the operations and financial performance of the Corporation. Governments, businesses and the public have taken unprecedented actions to try and contain the spread of COVID-19 and to mitigate its effects including quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, state of emergency declarations, travel bans, closures of businesses and schools, fiscal stimulus and legislative initiatives to deliver monetary aid and other relief. Many of these actions have adversely impacted the economy and forced temporary closures of nonessential business, and as a result, the businesses of many of our customers have been adversely impacted, which could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAlthough the scope, duration and full effects of the pandemic are evolving and cannot be fully known at this time, consequences of the pandemic and efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19 and mitigate the pandemic\u2019s effects have included and may include further market volatility, lower interest rates, disrupted trade and supply chains, increased unemployment and reduced economic activity. The period of recovery from the negative economic effects of the pandemic cannot be predicted and may be protracted. If these effects continue for a prolonged period of time, the Corporation may experience significant delinquencies and credit losses due to the inability of borrowers to make timely payments on loans, net interest margin compression, lower demand for our products and services, decreased capital, which may affect the Corporation\u2019s ability to originate new loans, disruption of operational processes arising from practices of social distancing and telecommuting and potential impairment of assets, including securities available for sale and goodwill. Credit deterioration in the Corporation\u2019s loan portfolio due to the pandemic may be masked or obscured by loan payment deferral programs or government stimulus or relief efforts, such as the PPP. The COVID-19 pandemic may also exacerbate many of the risk factors identified in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including risk related to our credit quality, collateral, capital, liquidity, operations, interest rate risk, strategic risk and technology.\nAlthough banks have generally been permitted to continue operating during the COVID-19 outbreak, the outbreak has caused the Corporation to change its business operations, including updating branch operations to comply with governmental recommendations and increasing work from home options for our employees. These changes may have adverse impacts on the Corporation\u2019s business due to reduced effectiveness of operations, unavailability of personnel, increased cybersecurity risks related to use of remote technology, and increased costs related to these operational changes. Additionally, our business operations may be disrupted if key personnel or significant portions of our employees are unable to work effectively, including because of illness. The changes in business operations could also have a detrimental effect on the Corporation\u2019s relationships with its customers and could reduce demand for the Corporation\u2019s products and services.\nUnfavorable economic conditions and elevated unemployment due to the pandemic may make it difficult for the Corporation to maintain deposit levels and loan origination volume. Such unfavorable conditions may cause the value of our investment portfolio and of the collateral securing the Corporation\u2019s loans to decline. The Federal Reserve has lowered the federal funds rate to a range of zero to 0.25 percent in part as a result of the pandemic. A prolonged period of very low interest rates could reduce the Corporation\u2019s net income and have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s cash flows.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including, but not limited to the duration, spread, severity and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the actions required to contain and mitigate it, the effectiveness of vaccines and vaccine distribution efforts, the effects of the pandemic on our customers and vendors, the remedial actions and stimulus measures adopted by local, state and federal governments, the timing and availability of government support for the economy and financial markets including indirect governmental support for various financial assets including mortgage loans, the short- and long-term health impacts of the pandemic, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume, if at all. If the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic worsens, additional actions may be taken by federal, state, and local governments to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact, including additional shelter-in-place orders. There can be no assurance that any efforts by the Corporation to address the adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic will be effective. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may continue to experience adverse impacts to our business as a result of any economic recession or depression that has occurred or may occur in the future, or as a result of changes in the behavior of customers, businesses and their employees. Furthermore, the financial condition of our customers and vendors may be adversely impacted, which may result in an elevated level of loan losses, a decrease in demand for our products and services, or reduced availability of services provided by third parties on which we rely. Any of these events may, in turn, have a material adverse impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisk Factors Related to our Lending Activities and Economic Conditions\nOur business is subject to various lending and other economic risks that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nDeterioration in economic conditions could adversely affect our business. Our business is directly affected by general economic and market conditions; broad trends in industry and finance; legislative and regulatory changes; changes in governmental monetary and fiscal policies; and inflation, all of which are beyond our control. A deterioration in economic conditions, in particular a prolonged economic slowdown within our geographic region or a broader disruption in the economy, possibly as a result of a pandemic or other widespread public health emergency, could result in the following consequences, any of which could hurt our business materially: an increase in loan delinquencies; an increase in problem assets and foreclosures; a decline in demand for our products and services; and a deterioration in the value of collateral for loans made by our various business segments.\nAdverse changes in economic conditions in our market areas or adverse conditions in an industry on which a local market in which we do business is dependent could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe provide full service banking and other financial services between Hampton Roads and Charlottesville, and in the Northern Neck region of Virginia. Our loan and deposit activities are directly affected by, and our financial success depends on, economic conditions within these markets, as well as conditions in the industries on which those markets are economically dependent. A deterioration in local economic conditions or in the condition of an industry on which a local market depends, such as the U.S. military and related defense contractors and industries, could adversely affect such factors as unemployment rates, business formations and expansions and housing market conditions. Adverse developments in any of these factors could result in among other things, a decline in loan demand, a reduction in the number of creditworthy borrowers seeking loans, an increase in delinquencies, defaults and foreclosures, an increase in classified and nonaccrual loans, a decrease in the value of loan collateral, and a decline in the financial condition of borrowers and guarantors, any of which could adversely affect our financial condition or business.\nWeakness in the secondary residential mortgage loan markets or demand for mortgage loans may adversely affect income from C&F Mortgage.\nOur mortgage banking segment provides a significant portion of our noninterest income. We generate gains on sales of mortgage loans primarily from sales of mortgage loans that we originate. Interest rates, housing inventory, housing demand, cash buyers, new mortgage lending regulations and other market conditions have a direct effect on loan originations across the industry. In particular, in a rising or higher interest rate environment, our originations of mortgage loans may decrease, resulting in fewer loans that are available to be sold to investors. This would result in a decrease in noninterest income. In addition, our results of operations are affected by the amount of noninterest expenses (including for personnel and systems infrastructure) associated with mortgage banking activities. During periods of reduced loan demand, our results of operations may be adversely affected to the extent that we are unable to reduce expenses commensurate with the decline in mortgage loan origination activity.\nIf our allowance for loan losses becomes inadequate, our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nMaking loans is an essential element of our business. The risk of nonpayment is affected by a number of factors, including but not limited to: the duration of the credit; credit risks of a particular customer; changes in economic and industry conditions; and, in the case of a collateralized loan, risks resulting from uncertainties about the future value of the collateral. Although we seek to mitigate risks inherent in lending by adhering to specific underwriting practices, our loans may not be repaid. We attempt to maintain an appropriate allowance for loan losses to provide for losses in our loan portfolio. Because any estimate of loan losses is necessarily subjective and the accuracy of any estimate depends on the outcome of future events that are not within our control, we face the risk that charge-offs in future periods will exceed our allowance for loan losses and that additional provision for loan losses will be required, which would have an adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s net income. Although we believe our allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb losses that are\ninherent in our loan portfolio, we cannot predict the timing or severity of such losses nor give any assurance that our allowance will be adequate in the future.\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has issued a new accounting standard that will be effective for the Corporation for the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2023. This standard, Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 326, \u201cFinancial Instruments-Credit Losses\u201d (ASC 326) will require the Corporation to record an allowance for credit losses that represents expected credit losses over the lifetime of all loans in its portfolio. This represents a change from the current method of providing for an allowance for loan losses that have been incurred. We have not yet determined the impact that ASC 326 will have on our consolidated financial statements and regulatory capital. While the adoption of ASC 326 will not affect ultimate loan performance or cash flows of the Corporation from making loans, the period in which expected credit losses affect net income of the Corporation may not be similar to the recognition of loan losses under current accounting guidance. If recognition of the allowance for credit losses results in a reduction of the regulatory capital of C&F Bank, the initial reduction in regulatory capital will be phased in over three years under regulatory guidance. If the reduction in regulatory capital of C&F Bank is significant, it may adversely impact the future ability of the Corporation to pay dividends to shareholders.\nAn increase in mortgage loan defaults or prepayments may result in losses related to loans sold by C&F Mortgage.\nDeterioration in economic conditions may cause borrowers to default on their mortgages. This may result in potential repurchase or indemnification obligations for C&F Mortgage on residential mortgage loans originated and sold into the secondary market. Such obligations may arise in the event of claims by investors of borrower misrepresentation, fraud, early-payment default, or underwriting error, as investors attempt to minimize their losses. We cannot be assured that a prolonged period of payment defaults and foreclosures will not result in an increase in requests for repurchases or indemnifications. Alternatively, during periods of low or falling interest rates, our customers may find opportunities to refinance shortly after obtaining a mortgage loan from C&F Mortgage, which may result in unexpected prepayments on loans that have been sold into the secondary market. This may result in obligations of C&F Mortgage to return a portion of the sales proceeds from such loans to investors pursuant to the terms of the sale. We attempt to maintain an appropriate reserve for indemnification losses and for prepayment obligations. Although we believe our reserves for indemnification losses and prepayment obligations are adequate, these estimates are inherently subjective and actual indemnification losses and prepayment obligations will depend on future events that are often not within our control. Therefore, we can give no assurance that established reserves will be adequate. Additional provision for indemnification losses or additional obligations arising from prepayments would have an adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s net income.\nOur level of credit risk is higher due to the concentration of our loan portfolio in commercial loans and in consumer finance loans.\nAt December 31, 2020, 51.8 percent of our loan portfolio consisted of commercial, financial and agricultural loans, which include loans secured by real estate for builder lines, acquisition and development and commercial development, as well as commercial loans secured by personal property. These loans generally carry larger loan balances and involve a greater degree of financial and credit risk than home equity and residential loans. The increased financial and credit risk associated with these types of loans is a result of several factors, including the concentration of principal in a limited number of loans and to borrowers in similar lines of business, the size of loan balances, the effects of general economic conditions on income-producing properties and the increased difficulty of evaluating and monitoring these types of loans.\nAt December 31, 2020, 23.1 percent of our loan portfolio consisted of consumer finance loans that provide automobile financing for customers in the non-prime market. During periods of economic slowdown or recession, delinquencies, defaults, repossessions and losses may increase in this portfolio. Significant increases in the inventory of used automobiles during periods of economic recession may also depress the prices at which we may sell repossessed vehicles or delay the timing of these sales. Because we focus on non-prime borrowers, the actual rates of delinquencies, defaults, repossessions and losses on these loans are higher than those experienced in the general automobile finance industry and could be dramatically affected by a general economic downturn. In addition, our servicing costs may increase without a corresponding increase in our finance charge income. While we manage the higher risk inherent in loans made\nto non-prime borrowers through our underwriting criteria for installment sales contracts we purchase and collection methods, we cannot guarantee that these criteria or methods will ultimately provide adequate protection against these risks.\nRisk Factors Related to our Industry\nWe are subject to interest rate risk and fluctuations in interest rates may negatively affect our financial performance.\nOur profitability depends in substantial part on our net interest margin, which is the difference between the interest earned on loans, securities and other interest-earning assets, and interest paid on deposits and borrowings divided by total interest-earning assets. Changes in interest rates will affect our net interest margin in diverse ways, including the pricing of loans and deposits, the levels of prepayments and asset quality. We are unable to predict actual fluctuations of market interest rates because many factors influencing interest rates, including changes in economic conditions, are beyond our control. We believe that our current interest rate exposure is manageable and does not indicate any significant exposure to interest rate changes. In March 2020, the FOMC announced emergency rate cuts for the federal funds rate, which is the interest rate at which depository institutions lend reserve balances to other depository institutions overnight, in response to the outbreak of COVID-19. Since March 2020, the FOMC has kept the federal funds rate near zero, and financial markets expect interest rates to remain historically low for a prolonged period as the economy recovers from the recession caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Longer-term market interest rates, including yields on U.S. treasury bonds, have also remained low. Therefore, we are expecting continued pressure on our net interest margin due to intense competition for loans and deposits from both local and national financial institutions and the continued effect of lower interest rates on interest income. In addition, the Corporation could experience further net interest margin compression if it is unable to maintain its current level of loans outstanding by continuing to originate new loans or if it experiences a decrease in deposit balances, which would require the Corporation to seek funding from other sources at higher rates of interest.\nWe rely substantially on deposits obtained from customers in our target markets to provide liquidity and support growth.\nOur business strategies are based on access to funding from local customer deposits. Deposit levels may be affected by a number of factors, including interest rates paid by competitors, general interest rate levels, returns available to customers on alternative investments and general economic conditions that affect savings levels and the amount of liquidity in the economy, including government stimulus efforts in response to economic crises. If our deposit levels fall, we could lose a relatively low cost source of funding and our interest expense would likely increase as we obtain alternative funding to replace lost deposits. If local customer deposits are not sufficient to fund our normal operations and growth, we will look to outside sources, such as borrowings from the FHLB, which is a secured funding source. Our ability to access borrowings from the FHLB will be dependent upon whether and the extent to which we can provide collateral to secure FHLB borrowings. We may also look to federal funds purchased and brokered deposits, although the use of brokered deposits may be limited or discouraged by our banking regulators. We may also seek to raise funds through the issuance of shares of our common stock, or other equity or equity-related securities, or debt securities including subordinated notes as additional sources of liquidity. If we are unable to access funding sufficient to support our business operations and growth strategies or are unable to access such funding on attractive terms, we may not be able to implement our business strategies which may negatively affect our financial performance.\nConsumers may increasingly decide not to use banks to complete their financial transactions, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operations.\nTechnology and other changes are allowing parties to complete financial transactions through alternative methods that historically have involved banks. For example, consumers can now maintain funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits in brokerage accounts, mutual funds or general-purpose reloadable prepaid cards. Consumers can also complete transactions such as paying bills or transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks. The process of eliminating banks as intermediaries, known as \u201cdisintermediation,\u201d could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits. The loss of these revenue streams and the loss of deposits as a lower cost source of funds could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nCompetition from other financial institutions and financial intermediaries may adversely affect our profitability.\nWe face substantial competition in originating loans and in attracting deposits. Our competition in originating loans and attracting deposits comes principally from other banks, mortgage banking companies, consumer finance companies, savings associations, credit unions, brokerage firms, insurance companies and other institutional lenders and purchasers of loans. Additionally, banks and other financial institutions with larger capitalization and financial intermediaries not subject to bank regulatory restrictions have larger lending limits and are thereby able to serve the credit needs of larger clients. These institutions may be able to offer the same loan products and services that we offer at more competitive rates and prices. Increased competition could require us to increase the rates we pay on deposits or lower the rates we offer on loans, which could adversely affect our profitability.\nAccounting for past business combinations may expose us to intangible asset risk, which could affect our results of operations.\nIn connection with accounting for prior acquisitions, we recorded assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their fair value, which resulted in the recognition of certain intangible assets, including goodwill. Adverse conditions in our business climate, including a significant decline in future operating cash flows, changes in interest rates that may lead to net interest margin compression, changes in demand for loans or our ability to originate and hold loans, a sustained period of elevated loan losses, a significant decrease in valuations or stock prices of the Corporation or other bank holding companies, or a deviation from our expected growth rate and performance, may significantly affect the fair value of the Corporation\u2019s reporting units and may trigger impairment losses on intangible assets, which could be materially adverse to our results of operations.\nRisk Factors Related to our Operations and Technology\nOur risk management framework may not be effective in mitigating risk and loss.\nWe maintain an enterprise risk management program that is designed to identify, quantify, monitor, report and control the risks we face. These risks include, but are not limited to, interest rate, credit, liquidity, operational, reputation, legal, compliance, economic and litigation risk. Although we assess our risk management program on an ongoing basis and make identified improvements to it, we can give no assurance that this approach and risk management framework (including related controls) will effectively mitigate the risks listed above or limit losses that we may incur. If our risk management program has flaws or gaps, or if our risk management controls do not function effectively, our results of operations, financial condition or business may be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to security and operational risks, including cybersecurity risks and cyber attacks, relating to our use of technology that could damage our reputation and our business.\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Corporation collects and stores sensitive data, including proprietary business information and personally identifiable information of our customers and employees, in systems and on networks. The secure processing, maintenance and use of this information is critical to operations and the Corporation\u2019s business strategy. The Corporation has invested in information security technologies and continually reviews processes and practices that are designed to protect its networks, computers and data from damage or unauthorized access. Despite these security measures, the Corporation\u2019s computer systems and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or may be breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Security breaches, including cyber incidents, identity theft and hacking events, have been experienced by several of the world\u2019s largest financial institutions that utilize sophisticated security tools to prevent such breaches, incidents and events. Any security breach that we experience could result in legal claims, regulatory penalties, disruption in operation, remediation expenses, costs associated with customer notification and credit monitoring services, increased insurance premiums, loss of customers and business partners and damage to the Corporation\u2019s reputation. We rely on customary security systems and procedures to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect secure collection, transmission and storage of sensitive data. These systems and\nprocedures include but are not limited to (i) regular penetration testing of our network, (ii) regular employee training programs on sound security practices and awareness of security threats, (iii) deployment of tools to monitor our network including intrusion prevention and detection systems, electronic mail spam filters, anti-virus, anti-malware, anti-ransomware, resource logging and patch management, (iv) multifactor authentication for customers using treasury management tools and employees who access our network from outside of our premises, and (v) enforcement of security policies and procedures for the additions and maintenance of user access and rights to resources. However, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, or to disable or degrade systems change frequently and are often not recognized until launched against a target, the Corporation may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate protective measures.\nWhile most of our core data processing is conducted internally, certain key applications are outsourced to third party providers. If our third party providers encounter difficulties or if we have difficulty in communicating with such third parties, it will significantly affect our ability to adequately process and account for customer transactions, which would significantly affect our business operations and reputation. Additionally, in recent years banking regulators have focused on the responsibilities of financial institutions to supervise vendors and other third-party service providers. We may have to dedicate significant resources to manage risks and regulatory burdens presented by our relationship with vendors and third-party service providers, including our data processing and cybersecurity service providers.\nWe rely on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure.\nThird parties provide key components of our businesses\u2019 operations such as data processing, recording and monitoring transactions, online banking interfaces and services, internet connections, and network access. While we have selected these third-party vendors carefully, we do not control their actions. Any problem caused by these third parties, such as poor performance of services, failure to provide services, disruptions in communication services provided by a vendor, or failure to handle current or higher volumes could adversely affect the Corporation\u2019s ability to deliver products and services to its customers and otherwise conduct its business, and may harm its reputation. Financial or operational difficulties of a third-party vendor could also hurt the Corporation\u2019s operations if those difficulties affect the vendor\u2019s ability to serve the Corporation. Replacing these third-party vendors could also create significant delay and expense. Accordingly, use of such third parties creates an unavoidable inherent risk to our businesses\u2019 operations.\nOur business is technology dependent, and an inability to successfully implement technological improvements may adversely affect our ability to be competitive and our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products, systems and services, which may require substantial initial investment to be implemented, including the cost of modifying or adapting existing products, systems and services. The Corporation invests in new technology to enhance customer service, and to increase efficiency and reduce operating costs. Our future success will depend in part upon our ability to create synergies in our operations through the use of technology and to facilitate the ability of customers to engage in financial transactions in a manner that enhances the customer experience. We cannot give any assurance that technological improvements will increase operational efficiency or that we will be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products, systems and services or be successful in marketing new products and services to our customers. A failure to maintain or enhance a competitive position with respect to technology, whether because of a failure to anticipate customer expectations, substantially fewer resources to invest in technological improvements than larger competitors, or because our technological developments fail to perform as desired or are not implemented in a timely manner, could result in higher operating costs, decreased customer satisfaction, and lower market share. An inability to effectively implement new technology and realize operational efficiencies could result in the loss of initial investments in such projects and higher operating costs. Either of these outcomes could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely heavily on our management team and the unexpected loss of key officers may adversely affect our operations.\nWe believe that our growth and future success will depend in large part on the skills of our executive officers. We also depend upon the experience of the officers of our subsidiaries and on their relationships with the communities they\nserve. The loss of the services of one or more of these officers could disrupt our operations and impair our ability to implement our business strategy, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe success of our business strategies depends on our ability to identify and recruit individuals with experience and relationships in our primary markets.\nThe successful implementation of our business strategy will require us to continue to attract, hire, motivate and retain skilled personnel to develop new customer relationships as well as new financial products and services. The market for qualified management personnel is competitive, which has contributed to salary and employee benefit costs that have risen and are expected to continue to rise, which may have an adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s net income. In addition, the process of identifying and recruiting individuals with the combination of skills and attributes required to carry out our strategy is often lengthy, and we may not be able to effectively integrate these individuals into our operations. Our inability to identify, recruit and retain talented personnel to manage our operations effectively and in a timely manner could limit our growth, which could materially adversely affect our business.\nRisks Related to the Regulation of the Corporation\nCompliance with laws, regulations and supervisory guidance, both new and existing, may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to numerous laws, regulations and supervision from both federal and state agencies. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in financial, structural and operational penalties, including receivership. In addition, establishing systems and processes to achieve compliance with these laws and regulations may increase our costs and/or limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities.\nLaws and regulations, and any interpretations and applications with respect thereto, generally are intended to benefit consumers, borrowers and depositors, but not stockholders. The legislative and regulatory environment is beyond our control, may change rapidly and unpredictably and may negatively influence our revenues, costs, earnings, and capital levels. Our success depends on our ability to maintain compliance with both existing and new laws and regulations.\nFuture legislation, regulation and government policy, particularly following changes in political leadership and policymakers in the federal government, could affect the banking industry as a whole, including the Corporation\u2019s business and results of operations, in ways that are difficult to predict. In addition, the Corporation\u2019s results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the way in which existing statutes and regulations are interpreted or applied by courts and government agencies.\nThe CFPB may increase our regulatory compliance burden and could affect the consumer financial products and services that we offer.\nThe CFPB significantly influences consumer financial laws, regulation and policy through rulemaking related to enforcement of the Dodd-Frank Act\u2019s prohibitions against unfair, deceptive and abusive consumer finance products or practices, which are directly affecting the business operations of financial institutions offering consumer financial products or services, including the Corporation. This agency\u2019s broad rulemaking authority includes identifying practices or acts that are unfair, deceptive or abusive in connection with any consumer financial transaction, financial product or service. Although the CFPB has jurisdiction over banks with $10 billion or greater in assets, rules, regulations and policies issued by the CFPB may also apply to the Corporation or its subsidiaries by virtue of the adoption of such policies and practices by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC. Further, the CFPB may include its own examiners in regulatory examinations by the Corporation\u2019s primary regulators. The total costs, limitations and restrictions related to the CFPB may produce significant, material effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur earnings are significantly affected by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies.\nThe policies of the Federal Reserve affect us significantly. The Federal Reserve regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States. Its policies directly and indirectly influence the rate of interest earned on loans and paid on borrowings and interest-bearing deposits and can also affect the value of financial instruments we hold. Those policies determine to a significant extent our cost of funds for lending and investing. Changes in those policies are beyond our control and are difficult to predict. Federal Reserve policies can also affect our borrowers, potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans. For example, a tightening of the money supply by the Federal Reserve could reduce the demand for a borrower's products and services. This could adversely affect the borrower\u2019s earnings and ability to repay a loan, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Alternatively, an expansion of the money supply could make it easier for a borrower to obtain a loan from another financial institution at a lower interest rate, resulting in a payoff of that borrower\u2019s higher rate loan with us, and which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nOur common stock price may be volatile, which could result in losses to our investors.\nOur common stock price has been volatile in the past, and several factors could cause the price to fluctuate in the future. These factors include, but are not limited to, actual or anticipated variations in earnings, changes in analysts\u2019 recommendations or projections with regard to our common stock or the markets and businesses in which we operate, operations and stock performance of other companies deemed to be our peers, and reports of trends and concerns and other issues related to the financial services industry. Fluctuations in our common stock price may be unrelated to our performance. General market declines or market volatility in the future, especially in the financial institutions sector, could adversely affect the price of our common stock, and the current market price may not be indicative of future market prices.\nFuture sales of our common stock by shareholders or the perception that those sales could occur may cause our common stock price to decline.\nAlthough our common stock is listed for trading on NASDAQ Global Select Market, the trading volume in our common stock may be lower than that of other larger financial institutions. A public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth, liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence in the marketplace of willing buyers and sellers of the common stock at any given time. This presence depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which we have no control. Given the potential for lower relative trading volume in our common stock, significant sales of the common stock in the public market, or the perception that those sales may occur, could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline or to be lower than it otherwise might be in the absence of these sales or perceptions.\nFuture issuances of our common stock could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and could be dilutive.\nWe may issue additional shares of common stock or securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, shares of our common stock. Issuances of a substantial number of shares of our common stock, or the expectation that such issuances might occur, including in connection with acquisitions, could materially adversely affect the market price of the shares of our common stock and could be dilutive to shareholders. Any decision we make to issue common stock in the future will depend on market conditions and other factors, and we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing, or nature of possible future issuances of our common stock. Accordingly, our shareholders bear the risk that future issuances of our securities will reduce the market price of the common stock and dilute their stock holdings in the Corporation.\nThe Corporation\u2019s dividends may not be sustained.\nAlthough the Corporation has historically paid cash dividends to holders of its common stock, holders of common stock are not entitled to receive dividends. Financial, regulatory or economic factors may cause the Corporation\u2019s Board of Directors to consider, among other actions, the suspension or reduction of dividends paid on the Corporation\u2019s common stock. Furthermore, the Corporation is a bank holding company that conducts substantially all of its operations through its subsidiaries, including the Bank. As a result, the Corporation relies on dividends from the Bank for substantially all of its revenues. There are various regulatory restrictions on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends or make other payments to the Corporation, and the Corporation\u2019s right to participate in a distribution of assets upon the Bank\u2019s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the Bank\u2019s creditors. If the Bank is unable to pay dividends to the Corporation, the Corporation may not be able to service its outstanding borrowings and other debt, pay its other obligations or pay a cash dividend to the holders of the Corporation\u2019s common stock, and the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.", "PERMNO": 85725, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "CFFI"}
