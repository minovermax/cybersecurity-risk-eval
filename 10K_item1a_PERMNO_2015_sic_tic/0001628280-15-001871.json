{"cik": "96763", "company": "PULSE ELECTRONICS CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-20", "item_1A": "Item 1a\nRisk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the following risks and any of the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in the documents incorporated herein by reference, before deciding to invest in shares of our common stock. The risks described below are not the only ones that we face. Additional risks that are not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. The following risks, among others, could cause our actual results, performance, achievements or industry results to differ materially from those expressed in our forward-looking statements contained herein and presented elsewhere by management from time to time. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business prospects, financial condition or results of operations could be materially harmed and the market price of our common stock would likely decline due to the occurrence of any of these risks.\nOur common stock is now quoted on the OTC Pink tier.\nQuotation of our common stock on the OTC Pink tier may adversely affect the liquidity, trading market and price of our common stock and our ability to raise capital. In October 2014, we voluntarily delisted our common stock from the New York Stock Exchange. Currently, our common stock is quoted under the symbol \u201cPULS\u201d on the OTC Pink tier operated by OTC Market Group, a centralized electronic quotation service for over-the-counter securities. Many over-the-counter stocks trade less frequently and in smaller volumes than securities traded on a national securities exchange such as the NYSE, which would likely have a material adverse effect on the liquidity of our common stock. There may be a limited market for our stock, trading in our stock may become more difficult and our share price could decrease even further. In addition, the trading of our common stock on over-the-counter markets will materially adversely affect our access to the capital markets and our ability to raise capital through alternative financing sources on terms acceptable to us or at all. Securities that trade over-the-counter are no longer eligible for margin loans, and a company trading over-the-counter cannot avail itself of federal preemption of state securities or \u201cblue sky\u201d laws, which adds substantial compliance costs to securities issuances, including those pursuant to employee option plans, stock purchase plans and private or public offerings of securities. There may also be other negative implications, including the potential loss of confidence by suppliers, customers and employees.\nIf our merger with OCM PE Merger Sub, Inc. (the \"Merger Sub\") does not close, our operations after any termination of the Investment Agreement and Agreement and Plan of Merger (the \"Merger Agreement\") may suffer from the effects of business uncertainties resulting from the failure to close the proposed merger and costs associated with the proposed merger. The failure of the proposed merger to close would also likely have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nOn February 28, 2015, we entered into the Merger Agreement, pursuant to which, upon the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, at the effective time of the merger, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company, and we will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of OCM PE Holdings, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (\u201cOCM PE Holdings\u201d), and each of our shares of common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger (other than shares of common stock owned by OCM PE Holdings and its affiliates and shares as to which the holder has properly asserted statutory dissenters rights under the PBCL) will be converted into the right to receive $1.50 in cash without interest, and cease to exist as of the effective time of the merger.\nIf the Merger Agreement is terminated or is materially delayed for any reason, the market price of our common stock may be adversely effected. We cannot provide any assurance that the transaction will be completed, that there will not be a delay in the completion of the transaction, or that all or any of the anticipated benefits of the transaction will be obtained. The termination or material delay may impair our ability to attract, retain, and motivate key personnel, including our executive leadership, and could cause customers, suppliers, financial counterparties, and others to seek to change existing business relationships with us. In addition, the market price of our common stock could decline.\nWe have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant costs, expenses, and fees for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the merger. Many of the fees and costs will be payable by us even if the merger is not completed.\nOur debt levels could adversely affect our financial position, our liquidity and the perception of our financial condition in the financial markets.\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness. As of February 2015, we had aggregate indebtedness, excluding debt discounts, of approximately $149.9 million with interest rates on our Term A and B Loans of 12.0% and 10.0%, respectively. Our high level of debt could have important consequences, including:\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate requirements;\n\u2022\nrequiring a substantial portion of our cash flow to be dedicated to debt service payments instead of other purposes, thereby reducing the amount of cash flow available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in the industry in which we compete;\n\u2022\nplacing us at a disadvantage compared to other, less leveraged competitors or competitors with comparable debt at more favorable interest rates; and\n\u2022\nincreasing our costs of borrowing.\nThe terms of our debt restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions.\nCovenants with our lenders require compliance with specific financial ratios that may make it difficult for us to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms for future acquisitions or other corporate needs. In the fourth quarter of 2012, we did not meet certain of these financial covenants. Oaktree Capital Management L.P. and affiliates (collectively, \u201cOaktree\u201d) agreed to forbear from taking any action, including acceleration of payment of the term loans, if we fail to satisfy these covenants in the fourth quarter of 2012 and in 2013 in a forbearance and commitment letter dated March 11, 2013. Oaktree agreed to a forbearance with respect to the Secured Leverage Ratio, calculated as the ratio of consolidated secured debt, which includes the Oaktree term loans, and our rolling four quarters\u2019 EBITDA, the Total Net Debt Leverage Ratio, calculated as the ratio of (a) the sum of consolidated debt, which includes the Oaktree term loans and senior convertible notes, less unrestricted cash (as defined) and (b) our rolling four quarters\u2019 EBITDA, and our Minimum Liquidity covenant (requiring unrestricted cash to equal at all times $10.0 million or more). On February 21, 2014, we entered into an amendment to the credit agreement, which provides some relief from our financial covenants with respect to the Secured Leverage Ratio, Total Net Debt Leverage Ratio and Minimum Liquidity covenants. Furthermore, for periods after December 27, 2013, the amended credit agreement will relieve us from having to comply with the covenant that previously required us not to permit the Total Net Debt Leverage Ratio to exceed certain specified ratios. In connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, we obtained the written consent (the \u201cConsent\u201d) of the required lenders (\u201cLenders\u201d) under the credit agreement agreeing to the transactions described and contemplated in the Merger Agreement. In addition, pursuant to the Consent, the Lenders also agreed to waive our compliance with the Secured Leverage Ratio covenant of the credit agreement with respect to the 2015 test period end dates.\nAlthough we anticipate meeting our covenants in the future, our ability to remain in compliance with the covenants may be adversely affected by future events potentially beyond our control. Violating any of these covenants could result in being declared in default, which may result in our lenders electing to declare our outstanding borrowings immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit. If the lenders accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we cannot provide assurance that we will have sufficient liquidity to repay our credit facilities or other indebtedness. In addition, certain domestic and international subsidiaries have pledged the shares of certain subsidiaries, as well as accounts receivable, inventory, machinery and equipment, intellectual property and other assets as collateral. If we default on our obligations, our lenders may take possession of the collateral and may license, sell or otherwise dispose of those related assets in order to satisfy our obligations. Refer to Note 6, Debt, to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of our debt covenants.\nOur primary lender and majority stockholder, Oaktree, may have interests that diverge from our interests and the interests of other security holders.\nOaktree is our primary creditor and beneficially owns a majority of our common stock. Oaktree may have interests that diverge from our interests and the interests of other security holders. In addition, so long as Oaktree maintains ownership at specified thresholds, it has the right to nominate a majority of our board of directors and will be entitled to certain information rights and a right to participate in future offerings of our equity securities. Oaktree is in the business of investing in companies and is not restricted by contract from investing in our current or future competitors. Future events may give rise to a divergence of interests between Oaktree and us or our other security holders that would have a material adverse effect on our Company. Oaktree\u2019s ownership\nand control may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control, impeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination with an acquirer other than Oaktree or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer. Oaktree\u2019s ownership and control may also limit our ability to issue stock, incur further debt, or dispose of any material assets of the Company or its subsidiaries.\nOaktree and affiliates can exercise significant control over the Company.\nOaktree beneficially owns a majority equity position in us. As a result, as long as Oaktree maintains ownership at specified thresholds, it has the right to nominate a majority of our board of directors, and therefore, has the ability to exert actual control over our management policies and affairs, the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders, including amendments to the our organizational documents, any proposed merger or other business combination, our financing, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets and other corporate transactions. In addition, Oaktree is entitled to certain information rights and a right to participate in future offerings of our equity securities. This concentration of ownership may also delay or prevent a change of control, impede a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination with an acquirer other than Oaktree or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer. Oaktree\u2019s ownership and control may also limit our ability to issue stock, incur further debt, or dispose of any material assets of the Company or its subsidiaries. On February 28, 2015, we entered into the Merger Agreement, pursuant to which, upon the terms and conditions thereof, an affiliate of Oaktree, the Merger Sub, will be merged with and into us, and as a result, we will be a wholly-owned subsidiary of OCM PE Holdings, L.P.\nCyclical changes in the markets we serve could result in a significant decrease in demand for our products, which may reduce our profitability and/or our cash flow.\nOur components are used in various products sold in the electronics market. Generally, these markets are cyclical based on the end consumers\u2019 demand, so interest in our components also reflects the overall demand for products in the electronics market. A contraction in the electronics market would result in a decrease in sales of our products, as our customers:\n\u2022\nmay cancel existing orders;\n\u2022\nmay introduce fewer new products;\n\u2022\nmay discontinue current product lines; and\n\u2022\nmay decrease their inventory levels.\nA decrease in demand for our products could have a significant adverse effect on our operating results, profitability and cash flows, which may adversely affect our liquidity, our ability to retire debt or our ability to comply with debt covenants. Accordingly, we may experience volatility in our revenues, profits and cash flows.\nReduced prices for our products may adversely affect our profit margins if we are unable to reduce our cost structure.\nThe average selling prices for our products tend to decrease over their life cycle. In addition, foreign currency movements and the desire to retain market share increase the pressure on our customers to seek lower prices from their suppliers. As a result, our customers are likely to continue to demand lower prices from us. To maintain our margins and remain profitable, we must continue to meet our customers\u2019 design needs while concurrently reducing costs through efficient raw material procurement, process and product improvements and reducing our operating expense levels. Our profit margins and cash flows may suffer if we are unable to reduce our overall cost structure relative to decreases in sales prices.\nRising raw material and production costs may decrease our gross margin.\nWe use commodities such as copper and plastic resins in manufacturing our products. Prices of these and other raw materials have experienced significant volatility in the past. Other manufacturing costs, such as direct and indirect labor, energy, freight and packaging costs, also directly impact the costs of our products. If we are unable to pass these increased costs to our customers or recover the increased costs through production efficiencies, our gross margins may suffer.\nAn inability to adequately respond to changes in technology, applicable standards or customer needs may decrease our sales.\nWe operate in an industry characterized by rapid change caused by the frequent emergence of new technologies and standards. Generally, we expect life cycles for products in the electronic components industry to be relatively short. This requires us to anticipate and respond rapidly to changes in industry standards and customer needs, and, also, to develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely and cost-effective basis. Our engineering and development teams place a priority on working\nclosely with our customers to design innovative products and to improve our manufacturing processes. Improving performance and reducing costs for our customers requires the continual development of new products and/or improvement to the components of existing products. Our inability to react quickly and efficiently to changes in technology, standards or customer needs may decrease our sales or margins.\nIf our inventory becomes obsolete, it may adversely affect our future performance and operating results.\nThe life cycles of our products depend heavily upon the life cycles of the end products for which our products are designed. End products with short life cycles require us to closely manage our production and inventory levels, as adverse changes in end market demand may make our products obsolete. Specifically, during market slowdowns, this may result in significant charges for inventory write-offs. Our future operating results may be adversely affected by material levels of inventory reserves for obsolete or excess inventory.\nOur decisions to strategically divest current businesses or our inability to capitalize on prior or future acquisitions may adversely affect our business.\nWe have completed numerous acquisitions and divestitures in the past and we may continue to seek acquisitions to grow our businesses. We may also divest operations to focus on our core businesses. We may fail to derive significant benefits from such transactions. Also, if we fail to achieve sufficient financial performance from an acquisition, certain long-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, could become impaired and result in the recognition of an impairment loss.\nThe success of our acquisitions depends on our ability to:\n\u2022\nsuccessfully execute the integration or consolidation of the acquired operations into our existing businesses;\n\u2022\ndevelop or modify the financial reporting and information systems of the acquired entity to ensure overall financial integrity and adequacy of internal control procedures;\n\u2022\nidentify and take advantage of cost reduction opportunities; and\n\u2022\nfurther penetrate existing markets with the product capabilities we may acquire.\nIntegration of acquisitions may take longer than we expect and may never be achieved to the extent originally anticipated. This could result in lower than expected business growth or higher than anticipated costs. In addition, acquisitions may:\n\u2022\ncause a disruption in our ongoing business;\n\u2022\ndistract our managers;\n\u2022\nincrease our debt and leverage;\n\u2022\nunduly burden other resources in our company; and\n\u2022\nresult in an inability to maintain our historical standards, procedures and controls, which may result in non-compliance with external laws and regulations or contractual requirements.\nAlternatively, we may also consider making strategic divestitures, which may also:\n\u2022\ncause a disruption in our ongoing business;\n\u2022\ndistract our managers;\n\u2022\nunduly burden other resources in our company; and\n\u2022\nresult in an inability to maintain our historical standards, procedures and controls, which may result in non-compliance with external laws and regulations or contractual requirements.\nWe may record impairment losses in the future. We assess the impairment of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an asset\u2019s carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include significant changes in the use of any asset, changes in trends of historical operating performance, a significant decline in the price of our common stock, changes in projected operating performance and significant negative economic trends.\nAn inability to identify, consummate or integrate acquisitions or a lack of appropriate investment in capital expenditure and research, development and engineering may slow our future growth.\nWe may identify and possibly consummate acquisitions in the future to penetrate or expand important markets and to grow our business. We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates at reasonable prices. Even if we identify\npromising acquisition candidates, the timing, price, structure and success of future acquisitions are uncertain. An inability to consummate or integrate attractive acquisitions may reduce our growth rate and our ability to penetrate new markets.\nWe remain committed to technological development through investing in research, development and engineering activities focused on designing next-generation products, improving our existing products and improving our manufacturing processes. If we determine that any of our manufacturing processes would benefit from capital investment, we may allocate resources to fund the expansion of property, plant and equipment used in these processes. An inability to allocate resources to the appropriate investment or an inability to allocate the appropriate amount of resources to an investment may reduce our ability to grow organically.\nIf any of our major customers terminates a substantial amount of existing agreements, chooses not to enter into new agreements or elects not to submit additional purchase orders for our products, then our business may suffer.\nOur sales are predominantly made on a purchase order basis. We have a concentration of several primary customers that we rely on for a material amount of these purchase orders. To the extent we have agreements in place with these customers, most of these agreements are either short-term in nature or provide these customers with the ability to terminate the arrangement. Such agreements typically do not provide us with any material recourse in the event of non-renewal or early termination.\nWe will lose business and our revenues may decrease if one or more of these major customers:\n\u2022\ndoes not submit additional purchase orders;\n\u2022\ndoes not enter into new agreements with us;\n\u2022\nelects to reduce or delay their purchase orders; or\n\u2022\nelects to terminate their relationship with us.\nIf we do not effectively manage our business when facing fluctuations in the size of our organization, then our business may be disrupted.\nWe have changed our capacity as a result of declines in global demand and through divestitures. We may significantly reduce or expand our workforce and facilities in response to rapid changes in demand for our products due to prevailing global market conditions. These rapid fluctuations place strains on our resources and systems. If we do not effectively manage our resources and systems, our business may be adversely affected.\nUncertainty in demand for our products may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have very little visibility into our customers\u2019 future purchasing patterns and are highly dependent on customer forecasts. However, these forecasts are non-binding and can often significantly change. Given the fluctuation in growth rates and the occasional cyclically of demand for our products, as well as our reliance on our customers\u2019 forecasts, it is difficult to accurately manage our production schedule, equipment and personnel needs, as well as our raw material and working capital requirements.\nOur failure to effectively manage these issues may result in:\n\u2022\nproduction delays;\n\u2022\nincreased costs of production;\n\u2022\nexcessive inventory levels and reduced financial liquidity;\n\u2022\nan inability to make timely deliveries; and\n\u2022\na decrease in profits or cash flows.\nA decrease in the availability of our key raw materials could adversely affect our profit margins.\nWe use several types of raw materials in the manufacturing of our products, including:\n\u2022\nbase metals such as copper;\n\u2022\nferrite cores;\n\u2022\nplastics and plastic resins; and\n\u2022\nrare earth metals.\nSome of these materials are only produced by a limited number of suppliers. The limited amount of suppliers may restrict our ability to obtain these raw materials in sufficient quantities, at reasonable prices or in a timely manner to meet customer demand\nfor our products. A lack of availability or a delay in obtaining any of the raw materials used in our products could adversely affect our manufacturing costs and profit margins. In addition, if the price of our raw materials increases significantly over a short period of time due to increased market demand or shortage of supply, customers may be unwilling to bear the increased price for our products and we may be forced to sell our products containing these materials at lower prices causing a reduction in our profit margins.\nOur operating results may be adversely affected by regulations relating to the sourcing of certain raw materials.\nThe products we manufacture utilize materials that are impacted by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d) requirement for disclosure of the use of \u201cconflict minerals\u201d mined in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries.\nWe are in the process of determining the country of origin of certain metals that we purchase from our suppliers, as required by the Dodd-Frank Act. Under regulations promulgated pursuant to that Act, we will be required to submit a report regarding our usage of conflict minerals in 2015. The supply chain due diligence and verification of sources is complex and requires substantial effort to arrive at a substantive conclusion. We are in the process of aggregating and assessing preliminary responses from our vendors. We may face reputational challenges if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of conflict minerals used in our products. Additionally, customers may demand that the products they purchase be free of conflict minerals. This may limit the number of suppliers that can provide products in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices to meet customer demand.\nCompetition may result in reduced demand for our products and reduce our sales.\nWe operate in a highly competitive worldwide industry, with relatively low barriers to competitive entry. We frequently encounter strong competition within individual product lines from various competitors throughout the world, some of which are larger than us and have significantly greater financial resources and technological capabilities. We compete principally on the basis of:\n\u2022\nengineering expertise;\n\u2022\nproduct quality and reliability;\n\u2022\nglobal design and manufacturing capabilities;\n\u2022\nbreadth of product line;\n\u2022\nprice;\n\u2022\ncustomer service; and\n\u2022\ndelivery time.\nOur inability to successfully compete on any or all of the above or other factors may result in reduced sales.\nProducts we manufacture may contain design or manufacturing defects that could result in reduced demand for our products or services and liability claims against us.\nDespite our quality control and quality assurance efforts, defects may occur in the products we manufacture due to design or manufacturing errors or component failure. Product defects may result in delayed shipments and reduced demand for our products. We may be subject to increased costs due to warranty claims on defective products. We may be required to participate in a recall involving products which are, or are alleged to be, defective. We carry insurance for certain legal matters involving product liability; however, we do not have coverage for all costs related to product defects and the costs of such claims, including costs of defense and settlement, may exceed our available coverage.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our operating results.\nWe manufacture and sell our products in various regions of the world and export and import these products to and from a large number of countries. Fluctuations in exchange rates could negatively impact our cost of production and sales which, in turn, could decrease our operating results and cash flow. In addition, if the functional currency of our manufacturing costs strengthens as compared to the functional currency of our competitors\u2019 manufacturing costs, our products may become more costly than our competitors.\nOur international operations subject us to the risks of unfavorable political, regulatory, labor and tax conditions in other countries.\nWe manufacture and assemble most of our products in locations outside the United States, primarily in the People\u2019s Republic of China (\u201cPRC\u201d or China), and a majority of our revenues are derived from sales to customers outside the United States. Our future operations and earnings may be adversely affected by the risks related to, or any other problems arising from, operating in international locations and markets.\nRisks inherent in doing business internationally may include:\n\u2022\nthe inability to repatriate or transfer cash on a timely or efficient basis;\n\u2022\neconomic and political instability;\n\u2022\nexpropriation and nationalization;\n\u2022\ntrade restrictions;\n\u2022\ncapital and exchange control programs;\n\u2022\ntransportation delays;\n\u2022\nuncertain rules of law; and\n\u2022\nuncertain changes in the laws and policies of the United States or of the countries in which we manufacture and sell our products.\nThe majority of our manufacturing occurs in the PRC. Although the PRC has a large and growing economy, its political, legal and labor developments entail uncertainties and risks. For example, the availability of labor is highly seasonal and is significantly affected by the migration of workers in relation to the annual Lunar New Year holiday as well as economic conditions in the PRC. At certain times in the past we have encountered difficulties in attracting and retaining the level of labor required to meet our customers\u2019 demands. Also, wages and benefits have been increasing rapidly over the last several years in China. While China has been receptive to foreign investment, its investment policies may not continue indefinitely into the future and future policy changes may adversely affect our ability to conduct our operations in these countries or the costs of such operations.\nWe have benefited in prior years from favorable tax incentives and we operate in countries where we realize favorable income tax treatment relative to the U.S. statutory rate. We have been granted special tax incentives, including tax holidays, in jurisdictions such as the PRC. This favorable situation could change if these countries were to increase rates or discontinue the special tax incentives, or if we discontinue our manufacturing operations in any of these countries and do not replace them with operations in locations with similar tax incentives or policies. Accordingly, in the event of changes in laws and regulations affecting our international operations, we may not be able to continue to recognize or take advantage of similar benefits in the future.\nWe could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws.\nThe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\") and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws. We operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree, and in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Despite our training and compliance program, we cannot assure you that our internal control policies and procedures always will protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.\nLiquidity requirements could necessitate movements of existing cash balances, which may be subject to restrictions or may cause unfavorable tax and earnings consequences.\nA significant portion of our cash is held offshore by international subsidiaries and may be denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. While we intend to use a significant amount of the cash held overseas to fund our international operations and growth, if we encounter a significant need for liquidity domestically or at a particular location that we cannot fulfill through borrowings, equity offerings, or other internal or external sources, we may experience unfavorable tax and earnings consequences due to necessary cash transfers. For example, these adverse consequences would occur if the transfer of cash into the United States is taxed with no available foreign tax credit to offset the U.S. tax liability, resulting in lower net earnings. Also, we may be prohibited or significantly delayed when transferring cash from a country such as the PRC, as there are foreign exchange ceilings imposed by local governments and often lengthy approval processes, which foreign governments require for international cash\ntransfers. We have not experienced any significant liquidity restrictions in any of the countries in which we operate and we do not presently foresee any.\nAt December 26, 2014, the Company\u2019s majority owned foreign subsidiary located in Taiwan and its subsidiaries held approximately $13.0 million of our total consolidated cash and cash equivalents. Permanent access to funds from this subsidiary could be in the form of a dividend to its shareholders, which could result in income withholding taxes and distributions to minority shareholders. During fiscal 2012, this majority owned subsidiary declared a dividend of approximately $7.0 million, which was paid in November 2012. Distributions to minority shareholders, withholding and other taxes reduced the net proceeds of the dividend to the Company to approximately $4.8 million. Access to this subsidiary's cash in the future could be subject to similar offsets.\nLosing the services of our executive officers or other highly qualified and experienced employees could adversely affect our businesses.\nOur success depends upon the contributions of our executive officers and senior management, many of whom have numerous years of experience and would be extremely difficult to replace. We must also attract and maintain experienced and highly skilled engineering, sales and marketing, finance and manufacturing personnel. Competition for qualified personnel is often intense, and we may not be successful in hiring and retaining these people. If we lose the services of these key employees or cannot attract and retain other qualified personnel, our businesses could be adversely affected.\nWe face risks arising from the restructuring of our operations.\nIn the past, we have undertaken initiatives to restructure our business operations with the intention of improving utilization and realizing cost savings in the future. These initiatives have included changing the number and location of our production facilities, largely to align our capacity and infrastructure with current and anticipated customer demand. This alignment includes transferring programs from higher cost geographies to lower cost geographies. The process of restructuring entails, among other activities, moving production between facilities, closing facilities, reducing the level of staff, realigning our business processes and reorganizing our management.\nWe continuously evaluate our operations and cost structure relative to general economic conditions, market demands, tax rates, cost competitiveness and our geographic footprint as it relates to our customers\u2019 production requirements. As a result of this ongoing evaluation, we could initiate future restructuring plans. Restructurings present significant potential risks of events occurring that could adversely affect us, including a decrease in employee morale, delays encountered in finalizing the scope of, and implementing, the restructurings (including extensive consultations concerning potential workforce reductions, particularly in locations outside of the U.S.), the failure to achieve targeted cost savings and the failure to meet operational targets and customer requirements due to the loss of employees and any work stoppages that might occur. These risks are further complicated by our extensive international operations, which subject us to different legal and regulatory requirements that govern the extent and speed of our ability to reduce our manufacturing capacity and workforce. In addition, the current global economic conditions may change how governments regulate restructuring as the recent global recession has impacted local economies. Finally, we may have to obtain agreements from our affected customers for the relocation of our facilities in certain instances. Obtaining these agreements, along with the volatility in our customers\u2019 demand, can further delay restructuring activities.\nPublic health epidemics (such as flu strains or severe acute respiratory syndrome) or natural disasters (such as earthquakes or fires) may disrupt operations in affected regions and affect operating results.\nWe maintain extensive manufacturing operations in the PRC and elsewhere, similar to many of our customers and suppliers. A sustained interruption of our manufacturing operations or those of our customers or suppliers, resulting from complications caused by a public health epidemic or a natural disaster could have a material adverse effect on our business and our results of operations.\nThe unavailability of insurance against certain business and product liability risks may adversely affect our future operating results.\nAs part of our comprehensive risk management program, we purchase insurance coverage against certain business and product liability risks. However, not all risks are insurable and those that are insured may differ in the amount covered due to the type of risk, end market and customer location. If any of our insurance carriers discontinues an insurance policy, significantly reduces available coverage or increases our deductibles and we cannot find another insurance carrier to provide comparable\ncoverage at similar costs or we are not fully insured for a particular risk in a particular place, then we may be subject to increased costs of uninsured or under-insured losses, which may adversely affect our operating results.\nAlso, our components, modules and other products are used in a broad array of representative end products. If our insurance program does not adequately cover liabilities arising from the direct use of our products or liabilities that arise from use of our customers\u2019 products, we may be subject to increased costs of uninsured losses, which may adversely affect our operating results.\nEnvironmental liability and compliance obligations may adversely affect our operations and results.\nOur manufacturing operations are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations, as well as internal programs and policies governing:\n\u2022\nair emissions;\n\u2022\nwastewater discharges;\n\u2022\nthe storage, use, handling, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances, wastes and chemicals; and\n\u2022\nemployee health and safety.\nIf violations of environmental laws occur, we could be held liable for damages, penalties, fines and remedial actions for contamination discovered at our present or former facilities. Our operations and results could be adversely affected by any material obligations arising from existing laws or new regulations that may be enacted in the future. We may also be held liable for past disposal of hazardous substances generated by our business or businesses we acquire.\nOur stock price has been and may continue to be volatile.\nWe believe that the following factors, among others, may have had and may continue to have a significant negative impact on the market price and volatility of our common stock:\n\u2022\nthe amount, terms, and timing of our debt obligations;\n\u2022\ndevelopments regarding our ability to raise additional capital;\n\u2022\nsoft market demand conditions in certain primary markets;\n\u2022\neconomic and other external factors;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated period-to-period fluctuations in our financial results;\n\u2022\nvariations in our operating performance and the performance of our competitors;\n\u2022\npublication of research reports by securities analysts about us or our competitors or our industry;\n\u2022\nstrategic decisions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions, divestures, spin-offs, joint ventures, strategic investments or changes in business strategy;\n\u2022\nthe passage of legislation or other regulatory developments affecting us or our industry;\n\u2022\nspeculation in the press or investment community;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting principles;\n\u2022\nterrorist acts, acts of war or periods of widespread civil unrest; and natural disasters and other calamities.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nWe collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, and personally identifiable information of our customers and employees, in our data centers and on our networks. The secure maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, and damage our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in our products, which could adversely affect our business, revenues and competitive position.\nDisruptions or volatility in global financial markets could limit our sources of liquidity, or the liquidity of our customers, dealers and suppliers.\nGlobal economic conditions may cause volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets. Since the global economic downturn in 2008, liquidity, credit and credit capacity for certain issuers, including certain of our customers, dealers and suppliers has been restricted. Changes in global economic conditions, including material cost increases and decreases in economic activity in the markets that we serve, and the success of plans to manage cost increases, inventory and other important elements of our business may significantly impact our ability to generate funds from operations. Market volatility, changes in counterparty credit risk, the impact of government intervention in financial markets and general economic conditions may also adversely impact our ability to access capital and credit markets to fund operating needs. An inability to access capital and credit markets may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position.\nIn addition, the global demand for our products generally depends on customers\u2019 ability to pay for our products, which, in turn, depends on their access to funds. Subject to global economic conditions, customers may experience increased difficulty in generating funds from operations. Further, following capital and credit market volatility and uncertainty, many financial institutions have revised their lending standards, thereby decreasing access to capital. If capital and credit market volatility occurs, customers\u2019 liquidity may decline which, in turn, would reduce their ability to purchase our products.\nOur intellectual property rights may not be adequately protected or third parties may claim we have violated their intellectual property rights.\nWe may not be successful in protecting our intellectual property through patent laws, other regulations or by contract. As a result, other companies may be able to develop and market similar products, which could materially and adversely affect our market share and results of operations.\nAlso, from time to time, we may receive claims asserting that our products, processes or technologies infringe the patents or other proprietary rights of third parties. For example, in May 2013, a Federal Court entered a judgment in favor of Halo Electronics, Inc. in its patent infringement suit against us. Both parties have appealed the decision, but in October 2014, the Court of Appeals ruled to keep the district court's judgment intact. Halo has further appealed the judgment and petitioned the Federal Circuit for rehearing en banc of several issues and Pulse has petitioned for rehearing of several issues it raised in the appeal. The Court also permitted two amicus filers to submit briefings in support of Halo's petition for rehearing. The Court has not yet ruled on any of the petitions for rehearing. The Court imposed a permanent injunction halting the U.S. sale of certain surface mount transformers; however, the Court subsequently issued an emergency stay suspending the injunction through October 15, 2013. Although we do not believe the injunction will have a material adverse impact on our relationship with customers and the sales of our products, particularly in light of the stay and the fact that we have developed new products that we believe will not be determined to infringe third party rights, there can be no assurance that such products will be qualified by, and acceptable to, our customers or that such replacements will not infringe the patents or other proprietary rights of third parties.\nAny intellectual property claims, with or without merit, could be time consuming, expensive to litigate or settle and could divert management\u2019s attention from administering our business. Third party infringement claims against us or our customers with respect to our current or future products could result in the overall loss of the right to use technology important to our business, could compel us to enter into costly royalty arrangements, and could cause harm to our reputation and the reputation of our customers. Any of the foregoing could have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax exposure.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions, and our domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the distribution of income among these different jurisdictions. Our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors, including income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws and regulations. We are also subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. The results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures may have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s provision for income taxes and cash tax liability.", "PERMNO": 44513, "SIC": 3679, "TIC": "PULS.1"}
