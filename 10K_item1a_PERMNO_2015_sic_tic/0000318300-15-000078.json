{"cik": "318300", "company": "PEOPLES BANCORP INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-26", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe following are certain risks that management believes are specific to Peoples' business. This should not be viewed as an all-inclusive list of risks or presenting the risk factors listed in any particular order. Additional risks that are not presently known or that Peoples presently deems to be immaterial could also have a material, adverse impact on Peoples' business, financial condition or results of operations.\n\u2022\nConditions in the financial markets, the real estate markets and economic conditions generally may adversely affect Peoples' business.\nPeoples' financial performance generally is highly dependent upon the business environment and economic conditions in the markets where it operates and, to a lesser extent, the U.S as a whole. The local economies of the majority of Peoples' market area historically have been less robust than the economy of the nation as a whole and typically are not subject to the same fluctuations as the national economy. More recently, oil and gas exploration has created more activity in some of Peoples' market areas. A significant decline in this activity could result in more adverse conditions than what may be experienced at the national level. In general, a favorable business environment and economic conditions are generally characterized by, among other factors, economic growth, efficient capital markets, low inflation, low unemployment, high business and investor confidence, and strong business earnings. Unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by declines in economic growth, business activity, or investor or business confidence; limitations on the availability or increases in the cost of credit and capital; increases in inflation or interest rates; high unemployment; natural disasters; or a combination of these or other factors.\nOverall, some economic indicators show signs of improvement, however, many businesses, states and municipalities are still in serious difficulty, due to reduced cash flow and weakened financial condition. Further, there can be no assurance this improvement will continue or be spread evenly throughout the markets served by Peoples. A lack of a return to favorable economic conditions in a reasonable time frame could have an adverse affect on Peoples' asset quality, deposit levels and loan demand and, therefore, Peoples' financial condition and results of operations. Because a significant amount of Peoples' loans are secured by either commercial or residential real estate, decreases in real estate values could adversely affect the value of property used as collateral and Peoples' ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure.\n\u2022\nCompletion of the merger contemplated by the NB&T Agreement is subject to many conditions and if these conditions are not satisfied or waived, the merger between Peoples and NB&T will not be completed.\nThe respective obligations of Peoples and NB&T to complete the merger contemplated by the NB&T Agreement are subject to the fulfillment or written waiver of many conditions, including approval by the requisite vote of the Peoples and the NB&T shareholders, respectively, absence of orders prohibiting completion of the merger, the continued accuracy of the representations and warranties by both parties, and the performance by both parties of their respective covenants and agreements. These conditions to the consummation of the Peoples - NB&T merger may not be fulfilled and, accordingly, the merger may not be completed. In addition, if the merger is not completed by March 31, 2015, either Peoples or NB&T may have the opportunity to choose not to proceed with the merger, and Peoples and NB&T can mutually decide to terminate the NB&T Agreement at any time, before or after the approvals by the requisite vote of the Peoples and the NB&T shareholders, respectively.\n\u2022\nPeoples' ability to complete acquisitions and integrate completed acquisitions could have an adverse affect on Peoples' business, earnings and financial condition.\nPeoples actively evaluates opportunities to acquire other businesses. However, Peoples may not have the opportunity to make suitable acquisitions on favorable terms in the future, which could negatively impact the growth of its business. Peoples expects that other banking and financial companies, many of which have significantly greater resources, will compete to acquire compatible businesses. This competition could increase prices for acquisitions that Peoples would likely pursue, and its competitors may have greater resources to pay such acquisition prices than Peoples does. Also, acquisitions of regulated businesses such as banks are subject to various regulatory approvals. Peoples has entered into an amended loan agreement that requires Peoples to obtain the lender's consent to acquire another financial institution in certain circumstances. If Peoples fails to receive the appropriate approvals, it will not be able to consummate an acquisition that it believes is in its best interest.\nDuring 2014, Peoples completed three bank acquisitions which required integration of the acquired business into Peoples' business platform. Peoples may not be able to integrate new acquisitions without encountering difficulties, including the loss of key employees and customers, the disruption of ongoing businesses or possible inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies. Peoples may not be able to fully achieve the strategic objectives and operating efficiencies anticipated in the acquisitions it completes. Future acquisitions may also result in other unforeseen difficulties, including integration of the combined companies. Further, benefits such as enhanced earnings anticipated from the acquisitions may not develop and future results of the combined companies may be materially lower from those estimated.\n\u2022\nLegislative or regulatory changes or actions, or significant litigation, could adversely impact Peoples or the businesses in which it is engaged.\nThe financial services industry is heavily regulated under both federal and state law. Peoples is subject to regulation and supervision by the Federal Reserve Board, and Peoples Bank is subject to regulation and supervision by the OCC, and secondarily the FDIC. These regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors and the Deposit Insurance Fund, not Peoples' common shareholders. Peoples' non-bank subsidiaries are also subject to the supervision of the Federal Reserve Board, in addition to other regulatory and self-regulatory agencies, including the SEC and state securities and insurance regulators.\nRegulations affecting banks and financial services businesses are undergoing continuous change, and management cannot predict the effect of those changes. The impact of any changes to laws and regulations or other actions by regulatory agencies could adversely affect Peoples' business. Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on the operation of an institution, the classification of assets held by an institution and the appropriateness of an institution's allowance for loan losses. Additionally, actions by regulatory agencies or significant litigation against Peoples could cause Peoples to devote significant time and resources to defending its business and may lead to penalties that materially affect Peoples and its shareholders.\nIn light of current conditions in the global financial markets and the global economy, regulators have increased their focus on the regulation of the financial services industry. Most recently, the U.S. Congress and the federal agencies regulating the financial services industry have acted on an unprecedented scale in responding to the stresses experienced in the global financial markets. Some of the laws enacted by the U.S. Congress and regulations promulgated by federal regulatory agencies subject Peoples, Peoples Bank and other financial institutions to which such laws and regulations apply, to additional restrictions, oversight and costs that may have an impact on Peoples' business, results of operations or the trading price of Peoples' common shares. In addition to laws, regulations and actions directed at the operations of banks, proposals to reform the housing finance market consider winding down Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which could negatively affect sales of loans.\nIn July 2013, Peoples' primary federal regulator, the Federal Reserve, published final rules (the \"Basel III Capital Rules\") establishing a new comprehensive capital framework for U.S. banking organizations. The rules implement the Basel Committee's December 2010 framework known as \"Basel III\" for strengthening international capital standards, as well as certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Basel III Capital Rules substantially revise the risk-based capital requirements applicable to financial holding companies and other bank holding companies as well as depository institutions, including Peoples and Peoples Bank, compared to the previous U.S. risk-based capital rules. The Basel III Capital Rules define the components of capital and address other issues affecting the numerator in banking institutions' regulatory capital ratios. The Basel III Capital Rules also address risk weights and other issues affecting the denominator in banking institutions' regulatory capital ratios and replace the existing risk-weighting approach, which was derived from Basel I capital accords of the Basel Committee, with a more risk-sensitive approach based, in part, on the\nstandardized approach in the Basel Committee's 2004 \"Basel II\" capital accords. The Basel III Capital Rules also implement the requirements of Section 939A of the Dodd-Frank Act to remove references to credit ratings from the federal banking agencies' rules. The Basel III Capital Rules became effective for Peoples and Peoples Bank on January 1, 2015 (subject to a phase-in period). Although the implementation of Basel III, once fully phased in, is not expected to have a material impact on Peoples' or Peoples Bank's capital ratios, any future changes to capital requirements would have such an effect.\nFurther information about government regulation of Peoples' business can be found under the caption \"Supervision and Regulation\" in \"ITEM 1. BUSINESS\" of this Form 10-K.\n\u2022\nThe Dodd-Frank Act and its progeny may adversely impact Peoples' results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act represents a comprehensive overhaul of the financial services industry within the U.S. There are a number of reform provisions that are likely to significantly impact the ways in which banks, as well as financial holding companies and bank holding companies, including Peoples and Peoples Bank, do business. Many provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act still have not been implemented and will require interpretation and rule making by federal regulators, including banking regulators and the SEC. In addition, the CFPB has only recently begun to implement its authority, and there is significant uncertainty as to how its regulations and other authority will affect Peoples' business. Peoples is closely monitoring all relevant sections of the Dodd-Frank Act to ensure continued compliance with laws and regulations. While the full effect of the Dodd-Frank Act on Peoples and Peoples Bank cannot currently be determined, the law and its implemented rules and regulations have already resulted in increased compliance costs and may result in increased fees paid to regulators, along with restrictions on Peoples' and Peoples Bank's operations, all of which may have a material adverse affect on Peoples' operating results and financial condition. A detailed discussion regarding the Dodd-Frank Act can be found under the caption \"Supervision and Regulation\" in \"ITEM 1. BUSINESS\" of this Form 10-K.\n\u2022\nDefaults by larger financial institutions could adversely affect Peoples' business, earnings and financial condition.\nThe commercial soundness of many financial institutions may be closely interrelated as a result of relationships between and among the institutions. As a result, concerns about, or a default or threatened default by, one institution could lead to significant market-wide liquidity and credit problems, losses or defaults by other institutions. This \"systemic risk\" may adversely affect Peoples' business.\nAdditionally, Peoples' investment portfolio continues to include investments in individual bank-issued trust preferred securities. Under current market conditions, the fair value of these security types is based predominately on the present value of cash flows expected to be received in future periods. Significant defaults by other financial institutions could adversely affect conditions within the financial services industry, thereby causing investors to require higher rates of return for these investments. These factors could cause Peoples to recognize additional impairment losses on its investment in bank-issued trust preferred securities in future periods.\n\u2022\nPeoples' failure to be in compliance with any material provision or covenant of debt instruments could have a material adverse effect on Peoples' liquidity and operations.\nThe amended loan agreement governing Peoples' unsecured term note imposes operating and financial restrictions on Peoples. These restrictions may affect Peoples' operations and may limit the ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. Peoples' ability to comply with the covenants included in the amended loan agreement may be affected by events beyond Peoples' control, including deteriorating economic conditions, and these events could require Peoples to seek waivers or amendments of covenants, or alternative sources of financing. Peoples' ability to obtain such waivers, amendments or alternative financing, may be on terms unfavorable to Peoples.\nA breach of any of the covenants or restrictions contained in any of the existing or future financing agreements, including the financial covenants, could result in an event of default under the agreements. Such a default could allow the lenders under the financing agreements, if the agreements so provide, to discontinue lending, to accelerate the related debt, and/or to declare all borrowings outstanding thereunder to be due and payable. In addition, the lenders could terminate any commitments they have to provide Peoples with further funds. If any of these events occur, Peoples may not have sufficient funds available to pay in full the total amount of obligations that become due as a result of any such acceleration, or Peoples may not be able to find additional or alternative financing to refinance any such accelerated obligations. Even if additional or alternative financing is obtained, it may be on terms that would be unfavorable to Peoples.\n\u2022\nIncreases in FDIC insurance premiums may have a material adverse affect on Peoples' earnings.\nPeoples Bank has limited ability to control the amount of premiums it is required to pay for FDIC insurance. The Deposit Insurance Fund maintained by the FDIC to resolve bank failures is funded by fees assessed on insured depository institutions, such as Peoples Bank. The costs of resolving bank failures have increased during the last four years and decreased the Deposit Insurance Fund balance. The FDIC collected a special assessment in 2009 to replenish the Deposit Insurance Fund and also required a prepayment of an estimated amount of future deposit insurance premiums. If the costs of future bank failures increase, deposit insurance premiums may also increase. Increases in FDIC insurance premiums may have a material adverse effect on Peoples' results of operations and ability to continue to pay dividends on its common shares at the current rate or at all.\n\u2022\nChanges in interest rates may adversely affect Peoples' profitability.\nPeoples' earnings and cash flows are dependent to a significant degree on net interest income, which is the amount by which interest income exceeds interest expense. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond Peoples' control, including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and, in particular, the Federal Reserve Board. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, could influence not only the interest Peoples receives on loans and securities and the amount of interest it pays on deposits and borrowings, but such changes could also affect (1) Peoples' ability to originate loans and obtain deposits, (2) the fair value of Peoples' financial assets and liabilities, and (3) the average duration of Peoples' mortgage-backed securities portfolio. If the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments, Peoples' net interest income and, therefore, earnings, could be adversely affected. Earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings.\nManagement uses various measures to monitor interest rate risk and believes it has implemented effective asset and liability management strategies to reduce the potential effects of changes in interest rates on Peoples' results of operations. Management also periodically adjusts the mix of assets and liabilities to manage interest rate risk. However, any substantial, unexpected, prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on Peoples' financial condition and results of operations. See the sections captioned \"Interest Income and Expense\" and \"Interest Rate Sensitivity and Liquidity\" in \"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\" of this Form 10-K for further discussion related to Peoples' interest rate risk.\n\u2022\nPeoples' exposure to credit risk could adversely affect Peoples' earnings and financial condition.\nThere are certain risks inherent in making loans. These risks include interest rate changes over the time period in which loans may be repaid, risks resulting from changes in the economy, risks inherent in dealing with borrowers and, in the case of loans secured by collateral, risks resulting from uncertainties about the future value of the collateral.\nCommercial and commercial real estate loans comprise a significant portion of Peoples' loan portfolio. Commercial loans generally are viewed as having a higher credit risk than residential real estate or consumer loans because they usually involve larger loan balances to a single borrower and are more susceptible to a risk of default during an economic downturn. Since Peoples' loan portfolio contains a significant number of commercial loans, the deterioration of one or a few of these loans could cause a significant increase in nonperforming loans, and ultimately could have a material adverse effect on Peoples' earnings and financial condition.\n\u2022\nPeoples' allowance for loan losses may be insufficient to absorb the probable, incurred losses in its loan portfolio.\nPeoples maintains an allowance for loan losses that is believed to be a reasonable estimate of the probable, incurred losses within the loan portfolio based on management's quarterly analysis of the loan portfolio. The determination of the allowance for loan losses requires management to make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of Peoples' loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of its borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of loans. Additional information regarding Peoples' allowance for loan losses methodology and the sensitivity of the estimates can be found in the discussion of Peoples' \"Critical Accounting Policies\" included in \"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\" of this Form 10-K.\nPeoples' estimation of future loan losses is susceptible to changes in economic, operating and other conditions, including changes in interest rates, which may be beyond Peoples' control, and these losses may exceed current estimates. Peoples cannot be assured of the amount or timing of losses, nor whether the loan loss allowance will be adequate in the future.\nIf Peoples' assumptions prove to be incorrect, Peoples' allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover the probable, incurred losses in its loan portfolio, resulting in additions to the allowance for loan losses which could have a material adverse impact on Peoples' financial condition and results of operations. In addition, bank regulators periodically review Peoples' allowance for loan losses as part of their examination process and may require management to increase the allowance or recognize further loan charge-offs based on judgments different than those of management. Moreover, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") may change its requirements for establishing the allowance. Any increase in the provision for loan losses would decrease Peoples' pretax and net income.\n\u2022\nChanges in accounting standards, policies, estimates or procedures may impact Peoples' reported financial condition or results of operations.\nThe accounting standard setters, including the FASB, the SEC and other regulatory bodies, periodically change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of Peoples' Consolidated Financial Statements. The pace of change continues to accelerate and changes in accounting standards can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how Peoples records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, Peoples could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in the restatement of prior period financial statements.\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (\"US GAAP\") requires management to make significant estimates that affect the financial statements. Due to the inherent nature of these estimates, actual results may vary materially from management's estimates. Additional information regarding Peoples' critical accounting policies and the sensitivity of estimates can be found in the section captioned \"Critical Accounting Policies\" in \"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\" of this Form 10-K.\n\u2022\nPeoples and Peoples Bank may elect or be compelled to seek additional capital in the future, but that capital may not be available when it is needed.\nPeoples and Peoples Bank are required by federal and state regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support their operations. Federal banking agencies have adopted extensive changes to their capital requirements, including raising required amounts and eliminating the inclusion of certain instruments from the calculation of capital. If Peoples Bank experiences significant loan losses, additional capital may be needed. In addition, Peoples and Peoples Bank may elect to raise additional capital to support their businesses or to finance acquisitions, if any, or for other unanticipated reasons. Their ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on financial performance, conditions in the capital markets, economic conditions and a number of other factors, many of which are outside their control. Therefore, there can be no assurance additional capital can be raised when needed or that capital can be raised on acceptable terms. The inability to raise capital may have a material adverse effect on Peoples' financial condition, results of operations and potential acquisitions.\n\u2022\nThe financial services industry is very competitive.\nPeoples experiences significant competition in originating loans, principally from other commercial banks, savings associations and credit unions. Several of Peoples' competitors have greater resources, larger branch systems and a wider array of banking services. This competition could reduce Peoples' net income by decreasing the number and size of loans that Peoples originates and the interest rates it may charge on these loans. Moreover, technology and other changes are allowing businesses and individuals to utilize alternative methods to complete financial transactions that historically have involved banks. For example, consumers can now maintain funds in brokerage accounts or mutual funds that in the past had been held as bank deposits. Consumers can also complete transactions such as paying bills and/or transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks. The process of eliminating the use of banks to complete financial transactions could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits. The loss of these revenue streams and lower cost deposits as a source of funding could have a material adverse effect on Peoples' financial condition and results of operations. If Peoples is unable to compete effectively, Peoples would lose market share, which could reduce income generated from deposits, loans and other products. For a more complete discussion of Peoples' competitive environment, see \"Competition\" in \"ITEM 1. BUSINESS\" of this Form 10-K.\n\u2022\nPeoples' ability to pay dividends is limited.\nPeoples is a separate and distinct legal entity from Peoples' subsidiaries. Peoples receives nearly all of its revenue from dividends from Peoples Bank, which are limited by federal banking laws and regulations. These dividends also serve as the primary source of funds to pay dividends on Peoples' common shares. The inability of Peoples Bank to pay sufficient dividends to Peoples could have a material, adverse effect on its business. Further discussion of Peoples'\nability to pay dividends can be found under the caption \"Supervision and Regulation - Dividend Restrictions\" in \"ITEM 1. BUSINESS\" of this Form 10-K and Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\u2022\nPeoples' business could be adversely affected by interruptions in the effective operations of, or security breaches affecting its computer systems and telecommunications networks or those of a third-party service provider.\nPeoples collects, processes and stores sensitive consumer data by utilizing computer systems and telecommunications networks operated by both Peoples and third-party service providers. Peoples has security and backup and recovery systems in place, as well as a business continuity plan, to ensure the computer systems will not be inoperable, to the extent possible. Peoples also has implemented security controls to prevent unauthorized access to the computer systems and requires Peoples' third-party service providers to maintain similar controls. However, management cannot be certain these measures will be successful. A security breach of the computer systems and release of confidential information, such as customer account numbers and related information, or an attack on Peoples' computer systems or telecommunications networks could negatively affect customers' confidence in Peoples, which may cause a loss of business, and could result in Peoples' incurring financial losses for any fraudulent transactions completed by third parties due to the security breach and being exposed to risks of litigation and increased regulatory scrutiny.\n\u2022\nAnti-takeover provisions may delay or prevent an acquisition or change in control by a third party.\nProvisions in the Ohio General Corporation Law and Peoples' Amended Articles of Incorporation and Code of Regulations, including a staggered board and a supermajority vote requirement for significant corporate changes, could discourage potential takeover attempts and make attempts by shareholders to remove Peoples' Board of Directors and management more difficult. These provisions may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a transaction or change in control that might be in the best interests of Peoples' shareholders.\n\u2022\nPeoples is exposed to operational risk.\nSimilar to any large organization, Peoples is exposed to many types of operational risk, including reputational risk, legal and compliance risk, the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders, unauthorized transactions by employees or operational errors, including clerical or record-keeping errors or those resulting from faulty or disabled computer or telecommunications systems.\nNegative public opinion can result from Peoples\u2019 actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including lending practices, corporate governance and acquisitions, and from actions taken by governmental regulators and community organizations in response to those activities. Negative public opinion can adversely affect Peoples\u2019 ability to attract and keep customers, and can expose Peoples to potential litigation and regulatory action.\nGiven the volume of transactions Peoples processes, certain errors may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and successfully rectified. Peoples\u2019 necessary dependence upon automated systems to record and process its transaction volume may further increase the risk that technical system flaws or employee tampering or manipulation of those systems will result in losses that are difficult to detect. Peoples may also be subject to disruptions of its operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond its control (for example, computer viruses or electrical or telecommunications outages), which may give rise to disruption of service to customers and to financial loss or liability. Peoples is further exposed to the risk that its external vendors may be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations (or will be subject to the same risk of fraud or operational errors by their respective employees as Peoples is) and to the risk that Peoples' (or its vendors\u2019) business continuity and data security systems prove to be inadequate.\n\u2022\nPeoples depends upon the accuracy and completeness of information about customers and counterparties.\nIn deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with customers and counterparties, Peoples may rely on information provided by customers and counterparties, including financial statements and other financial information. Peoples may also rely on representations of customers and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and, with respect to financial statements, on reports of independent auditors. For example, in deciding whether to extend credit to a business, Peoples Bank may assume that the customer\u2019s audited financial statements conform with US GAAP and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the customer. Peoples Bank may also rely on the audit report covering those financial statements. Peoples\u2019 financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted to the extent that Peoples Bank relies on financial statements that do not comply with US GAAP or on financial statements and other financial information that are materially misleading.\n\u2022\nChanges in tax laws could adversely affect Peoples' performance.\nPeoples is subject to extensive federal, state and local taxes, including income, excise, sales/use, payroll, franchise, withholding and ad valorem taxes. Changes to tax laws could have a material adverse effect on Peoples' results of operations. In addition, Peoples' customers are subject to a wide variety of federal, state and local taxes. Changes in\ntaxes paid by Peoples' customers may adversely affect their ability to purchase homes or consumer products, which could adversely affect their demand for loans and deposit products. In addition, such negative effects on Peoples' customers could result in defaults on the loans made by Peoples Bank and decrease the value of mortgage-backed securities in which Peoples has invested.\n\u2022\nPeoples and its subsidiaries are subject to examinations and challenges by tax authorities.\nIn the normal course of business, Peoples and its subsidiaries are routinely subject to examinations and challenges from federal and state tax authorities regarding positions taken regarding their respective tax returns. State tax authorities have become increasingly aggressive in challenging tax positions taken by financial institutions, especially those positions relating to tax compliance and calculation of taxes subject to apportionment. Any challenge or examination by a tax authority may result in adjustments to the timing or amount of taxable net worth or taxable income, or deductions or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions.\nManagement believes it has taken appropriate positions on all tax returns filed, to be filed or not filed, and does not anticipate any examination would have a material impact on Peoples' Consolidated Financial Statements. However, the outcome of such examinations and ultimate resolution of any resulting assessments are inherently difficult to predict. Thus, no assurance can be given that Peoples' tax liability for any tax year open to examination will not be different than what is reflected in Peoples' current and historical Consolidated Financial Statements. Further information can be found in the \"Critical Accounting Policies - Income Taxes\" section of \"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\" of this Form 10-K.\n\u2022\nPeoples or one of its subsidiaries may be a defendant from time to time in the future in a variety of litigation and other actions, which could have a material adverse effect on Peoples' financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nPeoples and its subsidiaries may be involved from time to time in the future in a variety of litigation arising out of their respective businesses. The risk of litigation increases in times of increased troubled loan collection activity. Peoples' insurance may not cover all claims that may be asserted against Peoples and its subsidiaries, and any claims asserted against them, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, may harm their respective reputations. Should the ultimate judgments or settlements in any litigation exceed the applicable insurance coverage, they could have a material adverse effect on Peoples' financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, Peoples or one of its subsidiaries may not be able to obtain appropriate types or levels of insurance in the future, nor may they be able to obtain adequate replacement policies with acceptable terms, if at all.", "PERMNO": 78903, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "PEBO"}
