{"cik": "1461993", "company": "MELINTA THERAPEUTICS, INC. /NEW/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-03-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThis report contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in this report. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below and elsewhere in this report and in any documents incorporated in this report by reference.\nIf any of the following risks, or other risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe to not be significant, develop into actual events, then our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects could be materially adversely affected. If that happens, the market price of our common stock could decline, and shareholders may lose all or part of their investment.\nRisks Related to our Business\nWe have incurred significant operating losses since inception and anticipate that we will incur continued losses for the foreseeable future.\nUntil recently, we have been a development stage company and have incurred losses since inception. As of December 31, 2017, we had an accumulated deficit of $572.7 million and we recorded net losses of $58.9 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. We expect to continue to incur operating losses and negative cash flows through at least 2020. These losses have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on shareholders\u2019 equity and working capital.\nOur limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our business and prospects.\nPrior to our recent commercial launch of Baxdela and our acquisition of Vabomere, Orbactiv and Minocin from Medicines in the first quarter of 2018, our operations have been limited to financing and staffing our company, conducting product development activities, engaging in commercial launch preparation activities, and performing research and development activities. We have not yet demonstrated ability, as a company, to successfully commercialize and launch a product candidate or market and sell products. Consequently, the ability to predict our future performance may not be as accurate as it could be if we had a history of successfully developing and commercializing pharmaceutical products.\nIf we fail to obtain additional financing, we may not be able to fund our operations.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents of $128.4 million. Based on our operating plans, we currently do not have sufficient working capital to fund planned operating expenses for 2018 without additional sources of cash. In their audit opinion issued in connection with the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders\u2019 equity, cash flows, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017, our independent registered public accounting firm stated that our recurring losses from operations and our need to obtain additional capital raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We will need to obtain additional financing to fund future operations, including the ongoing commercialization and launch of Baxdela and Vabomere and to support the ongoing sales of Minocin and Orbactiv, as well as the development and commercialization of our product candidates and to support sales and marketing activities. Moreover, our fixed expenses such as rent, license payments, interest expense and other contractual commitments are substantial. As noted above, as an early commercial-stage company, we have not yet demonstrated the ability, as a company, to successfully commercialize and launch a product candidate, or market and sell products, and our marketed products have very limited sales history, with Baxdela and Vabomere launching in recent months and Medicines launching Orbactiv and Minocin in 2014 and 2015, respectively. As such, even if we obtain additional funding to support our operating plan, it is possible that we may fail to appropriately estimate the timing and amount of our funding requirements and we may need to seek additional funding sooner, and in larger amounts, than we currently anticipate.\nOur future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe costs and timing of establishing sales, marketing, reimbursement capabilities, and the acceptance of our products by the marketplace;\n\u2022\nthe initiation, progress, timing, scope and costs of our nonclinical studies and clinical trials, including the ability to timely enroll patients in our ongoing, planned and potential future clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe time and cost necessary to obtain regulatory approvals;\n\u2022\nthe costs of manufacturing clinical and commercial supplies of our products and product candidates;\n\u2022\npayments of acquisition or other milestones and royalties to third parties;\n\u2022\nthe time and cost necessary to respond to technological and market developments;\n\u2022\nthe costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights; and\n\u2022\nthe terms of any collaborative, license and other commercial relationships that Melinta may establish.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we have not generated any revenue from the sale of any products. Until we can generate a sufficient amount of revenue, we may raise additional funds through collaborations with third parties, out-licensing of rights to our product candidates, and public or private debt or equity financings. Additional funds may not be available when needed on terms that are acceptable, or at all. Further, we are limited in the types of financing that we may pursue given the underlying terms of our credit agreement, which limits our ability to incur more debt or service additional debt payments outside of the additional $50.0 million in debt available thereunder (subject to the satisfaction of certain revenue targets) and the $20.0 million revolver that is permitted thereunder. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of existing shareholders will be diluted, and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of existing shareholders.\nMoreover, changing circumstances may cause us to consume capital significantly faster than we currently anticipate, and we may need to spend more money than currently expected because of circumstances beyond our control. Securing additional financing, however, will require a substantial amount of time and attention from our management and may divert a disproportionate amount of their attention away from our day-to-day activities, which may adversely affect our management\u2019s ability to conduct our day-to-day operations. In addition, we cannot guarantee that future financing will be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nIf we are unable to obtain funding on a timely basis, we may be unable to fund our future operations, including the ongoing commercialization of Baxdela and Vabomere and the ongoing sales of Minocin and Orbactiv, as well as the development and commercialization of our product candidates and the support of sales and marketing activities. As a result, our ability to generate revenues and achieve or sustain profitability may be substantially harmed, and we may be required to significantly curtail some or all of our activities. We also could be required to seek funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or otherwise that may require us to relinquish rights to our product candidates or some of our technologies or otherwise agree to terms unfavorable to us.\nMelinta has substantial indebtedness.\nAs of December 31, 2017, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to our transaction with Medicines and related financing transactions in early January 2018, Melinta has total indebtedness of $147.8 million and, under the Deerfield agreement, has the ability to access another $50.0 million in debt, provided certain revenue targets are achieved. Having a substantial amount of leverage may have important consequences, including:\n\u2022\nrequiring a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on indebtedness, thereby reducing the ability to use cash flow from Melinta\u2019s operations to fund operations, capital expenditures, and future business opportunities;\n\u2022\nlimiting the ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, product and service development, debt service requirements, acquisitions, and general corporate or other purposes including equipment financing at reasonable rates, which is vital to Melinta\u2019s business;\n\u2022\nincreasing the risks of adverse consequences resulting from a breach of any indebtedness agreement, including, for example, a failure to make required payments of principal or interest due to failure of our business to perform as expected;\n\u2022\nincreasing vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nrestricting the ability to make strategic acquisitions or requiring non-strategic divestitures;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to incur additional debt;\n\u2022\nsubjecting Melinta\u2019s operations to restrictive covenants that may limit operating flexibility; and\n\u2022\nplacing Melinta\u2019s operations at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that are less highly leveraged.\nDespite Melinta\u2019s substantial leverage, we may be able to incur significant additional amounts of debt, which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our significant leverage.\nIf we are not successful with the commercial launches of our products, or experience significant delays in doing so, our business likely would be materially harmed.\nIn the first quarter of 2018, we commercially launched Baxdela and acquired from Medicines the rights related to the products Vabomere, Orbactiv and Minocin. Medicines commercially launched Orbactiv in the United States in the third quarter of 2014, launched the new formulation of Minocin in the United States in 2015 and launched Vabomere in the United States in the fourth quarter of 2017. Commercial launches of this number of products in such a short period of time has and will continue to require significant efforts from Melinta and the devotion of substantial resources as we will need to ensure we have manufactured sufficient quantities of product to complete commercial sales and establish and maintain the infrastructure necessary to commercially launch these products and products in development.\nOur ability to successfully commercially launch these products and products in development will depend on our ability to:\n\u2022\ntrain, deploy and manage a qualified sales force to market and sell our newly launched products;\n\u2022\nsecure formulary approvals at our hospital customers;\n\u2022\nhave third parties manufacture and release the products in sufficient quantities;\n\u2022\nimplement and maintain agreements with wholesalers, distributors and group purchasing organizations;\n\u2022\nreceive adequate levels of coverage and reimbursement for these products from governments and third-party payors; and\n\u2022\ndevelop and execute effective marketing and sales strategies and programs for the products.\nWe expect that the revenues from these products and products in development will represent a significant portion of our revenues in the future. As a result, if we are unable to successfully commercialize these products and products in development, our business, results of operations and financial condition likely would be materially harmed.\nWe are building our own marketing and sales organization, but have no experience as a company in marketing drug products. If we are unable to successfully establish our own marketing and sales capabilities, we may not be able to generate product revenues.\nIn order to successfully commercialize, launch and sell our products, we must develop capabilities (or make arrangements with third parties) for the marketing, sales and distribution of our products. We have and will need to incur significant additional expenses and commit significant additional management resources to establish and train a sales force to market and sell. We may not be able to successfully establish these capabilities despite these additional expenditures. In the event we are unable to successfully develop our own marketing and sales force (or collaborate with a third-party marketing and sales organization), we will not be able to commercialize, launch and sell our products, which would negatively impact our ability to generate product revenues. Further, whether we commercialize products on our own or rely on a third party to do so, our ability to generate revenue will be dependent on the effectiveness of the sales force. We compete with other pharmaceutical and life sciences companies to recruit, hire, train and retain sales and marketing personnel. In the event we are unable to successfully market and promote our products, our business may be harmed.\nThe commercial success of our products and any future product of Melinta will depend upon the degree of market acceptance of these products among physicians, patients, health care payors and the medical community.\nIt cannot be assured that our products (including any additional indication thereof) or any of our product candidates that may be approved in the future will gain market acceptance among physicians, patients, health care payors and the medical community. Efforts to educate the medical community and third party payors on the benefits of our products and product candidates may require significant resources and may not be successful. The degree of market acceptance for our products will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of such products as compared to other products pertaining to their respective indications;\n\u2022\nprevalence and severity of adverse side effects;\n\u2022\nacceptance by physicians and payors of each product as a safe and effective treatment;\n\u2022\nlimitations or warnings contained in a product\u2019s FDA approved labeling;\n\u2022\nthe market price and patient out-of-pocket costs of the product relative to other treatment options, including any generics;\n\u2022\nrelative convenience and ease of administration;\n\u2022\nwillingness by clinicians to stop using current treatments and adopt a new treatment;\n\u2022\nrestriction on healthcare provider prescribing of and patient access to products due to a risk evaluation mitigation strategy;\n\u2022\nthe availability and efficacy of competitive drugs;\n\u2022\nour ability to recruit and retain a sales force, if necessary;\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of our or any third-party partner\u2019s sales force and marketing efforts;\n\u2022\nour ability to forecast demand and maintain sufficient supplies of our drug products;\n\u2022\nour ability to manufacture or obtain commercial quantities of our drug products;\n\u2022\nthe strength of our sales and marketing and distribution support;\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of our marketing and advertising campaigns;\n\u2022\nour ability to deliver our products on a timely basis;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which bacteria develop resistance to any antibiotic product candidate that we develop, thereby limiting its efficacy in treating or managing infections;\n\u2022\nour ability to establish and maintain pricing sufficient to realize a meaningful return on our investment;\n\u2022\nacceptance on hospital formularies (which may limit sales activities in those hospitals);\n\u2022\nwhether the product is designated under physician treatment guidelines as a first-line therapy or as a second- or third-line therapy for particular infections;\n\u2022\nthe availability of adequate reimbursement by third parties, such as insurance companies and other health care payors, and/or by government health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid;\n\u2022\nadverse publicity about a product or favorable publicity about competitive products; and\n\u2022\npotential product liability claims.\nThe successful commercialization of our products will depend on the pricing we are able to achieve for our products.\nOur ability to successfully commercialize our products will be dependent on whether we can obtain adequate pricing for any particular product. Pricing may be substantially dependent on our ability to obtain reimbursement from third party payors, both in the United States and in foreign countries. Outside the United States, certain countries, including a number of European Union (\u201cE.U.\u201d) members, set prices and reimbursement for pharmaceutical products, or medicinal products as they are commonly referred to in the E.U., with limited participation from those marketing the products. We cannot be sure that any prices and reimbursement will be acceptable to us or our strategic commercial partners. If the regulatory authorities in these foreign jurisdictions set prices or reimbursement that are not commercially attractive for us or our strategic commercial partners, our revenues from sales by us or our collaborators, and the potential profitability of our product candidates, in those countries would be negatively affected. Further, through contractual or other arrangements, the price we may be able to obtain in foreign countries may be dependent on the price we can achieve in the United States.\nIf we fail to obtain and sustain an adequate level of reimbursement for our products or future approved products by third-party payors, sales would be adversely affected.\nThere will be no commercially viable market for our products or any future approved products without reimbursement from third-party payors. Even if there is a commercially viable market, if the level of reimbursement is below our expectations, our revenue and gross margins will be adversely affected.\nThird-party payors, such as government or private health care insurers, carefully review and increasingly question the coverage of, and challenge the prices charged for, drugs. Reimbursement rates from private health insurance companies vary depending on the company, the insurance plan and other factors. A current trend in the U.S. health care industry is toward cost containment. Large public and private payors, managed care organizations, group purchasing organizations and similar organizations are exerting increasing influence on decisions regarding the use of, and reimbursement levels for, particular treatments. Such third-party payors, including Medicare, are questioning the coverage of, and challenging the prices charged for, medical products and services, and many third-party payors limit coverage of or reimbursement for newly approved health care products. In particular, third-party payors may limit the covered indications. Cost-control initiatives could decrease the price we might establish for products, which could result in product revenues being lower than anticipated. If the prices for our products decrease or if governmental and other third-party payors do not provide adequate coverage and reimbursement levels, our revenue and prospects for profitability will suffer. Further, the availability of numerous generic antibiotics at lower prices than branded antibiotics may also substantially reduce the likelihood of reimbursement for such products.\nSpecifically, in both the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the health care system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. In the United States, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, also called the Medicare Modernization Act (\u201cMMA\u201d), changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products. The legislation expanded Medicare coverage for drug purchases by the elderly and introduced a new reimbursement methodology based on average sales prices for physician-administered drugs. In addition, this legislation provided authority for limiting the number of drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class. As a result of this legislation and the expansion of federal coverage of drug products, we expect that there will be additional pressure to contain and reduce costs. These cost reduction initiatives and other provisions of this legislation could decrease the coverage and price that we receive for any approved products and could seriously harm our business. While the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policies and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates, and any reduction in reimbursement that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments\nfrom private payors. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act (collectively, \u201cACA\u201d) became law in the United States The goal of ACA is to reduce the cost of health care and substantially change the way health care is financed by both governmental and private insurers. While we cannot predict what ultimate impact on federal reimbursement policies this legislation will have in general or on our business specifically, the ACA may result in downward pressure on pharmaceutical reimbursement, which could negatively affect market acceptance of future products. Members of the U.S. Congress and some state legislatures had sought to overturn at least portions of the legislation including those on the mandatory purchase of insurance. However, on June 28, 2012, the United States Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of these provisions. Members of the U.S. Congress have since proposed a number of legislative initiatives, including repeal of all or portions of the ACA. We cannot predict the outcome or impact of current proposals or whether new proposals will be made or adopted, when they may be adopted or what impact they may have on us if they are adopted.\nReimbursement systems in international markets vary significantly by country and by region, and reimbursement approvals must be obtained on a country-by-country basis. Reimbursement in the European Union must be negotiated on a country-by-country basis and in many countries the product cannot be commercially launched until reimbursement is approved. The negotiation process in some countries can exceed 12 months.\nOur estimates of the market for and commercialization potential of our products or for any product candidate, including expanded indications for existing products, may be inaccurate or vary significantly from the market size ultimately realized.\nThe potential market opportunities for our products and any product candidates are difficult to estimate precisely. Our estimates of the potential market opportunities are predicated on many assumptions, including industry knowledge and publications, third party research reports and other surveys. While we believe that our internal assumptions are reasonable, these assumptions involve the exercise of significant judgment on the part of our management, are inherently uncertain and the reasonableness of these assumptions has not been assessed by an independent source. If any of the assumptions proves to be inaccurate, the actual markets for our products and candidates could be smaller than our estimates of the potential market opportunities.\nIn addition, our estimates regarding the timing and amount of acceptance of any product or product candidate, and the pricing achievable for any product or product candidate may prove incorrect. Further, our plans for commercialization of any product candidate may not materialize in the time or manner we anticipate and may be adversely impacted by any required label warnings, any perceived safety or efficacy concerns, or the actions of our competitors. Finally, we may underestimate the demand for a product or product candidate, which could lead to lack of commercial quantities when needed and result in market backlash against the product or product candidate. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our plans for commercialization of and the generation of any revenue from any product or product candidate.\nA failure to maintain optimal inventory levels to meet commercial demand for any of our products or any future approved products could harm our reputation and subject us to financial losses.\nOur manufacturing lead time varies by product; for some products it can exceed two years. Accurate product planning is necessary to ensure that we maintain optimal inventory levels for any of our products or any future approved products, significant differences between our estimates and judgments and future actual demand for any of our products or any future approved products and the shelf life of inventory may result in significant charges for excess inventory or purchase commitments in the future. If we are required to recognize charges for excess inventories, such charges could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Our ability to maintain optimal inventory levels also depends on the performance of third-party contract manufacturers. If our manufacturers are unsuccessful in either obtaining raw materials, if we are unable to release inventory on a timely and consistent basis, if we fail to maintain an adequate level of product inventory, if inventory is destroyed or damaged, or if our inventory reaches its expiration date, patients might not have access to our products, sales could be lost, our reputation and brands could be harmed, and physicians may be less likely to prescribe our products in the future, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf our competitors are able to develop and market products that are preferred over our products or any future approved products, our commercial opportunity for such products will be reduced.\nWe face competition from established pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as from academic institutions, government agencies and private and public research institutions, which may in the future develop products to treat ABSSSI, CABP, cUTI or other diseases or conditions that our products and product candidates target. In many cases, however, we believe that competition often will be determined by antibiotic class and any limitations of that antibiotic class in general, and the antibiotic treating a particular disease or population.\nIn particular, there are a variety of available therapies marketed for the treatment of ABSSSI. Some of these products are branded and subject to patent protection, and others are available on a generic basis. Many of these approved products are well established therapies and are widely accepted by physicians, patients and hospital decision-makers. Vancomycin, for instance, which is sold in a relatively inexpensive generic form, has been widely used for over 50 years, is the most frequently used IV antibiotic, and we believe, based on our market research, is prescribed to approximately two-thirds of all hospitalized ABSSSI patients. Insurers and other third-party payers may encourage the use of generic products.\nWe face competition from both established and early-stage pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. There are also a number of products in clinical development by third parties to treat ABSSSI.\nIf any of these product candidates or any other products developed by our competitors are more effective, safer, more convenient or less costly than our products, or would otherwise render our products obsolete or non-competitive, our anticipated revenues from our products could be adversely affected.\nWe expect that our ability to compete effectively will depend upon, among other things, our ability to:\n\u2022\nsuccessfully and rapidly complete clinical trials and obtain all required regulatory approvals in a timely and cost-effective manner;\n\u2022\nmaintain patent protection for and otherwise prevent the introduction of generics;\n\u2022\nattract and retain key personnel;\n\u2022\nbuild an adequate sales and marketing infrastructure; and\n\u2022\nobtain adequate reimbursement from third-party payors.\nOur dependence upon third parties for the manufacture and supply of our marketed products and any of our product candidates that may be approved in the future, may cause delays in, or prevent us from, successfully developing, commercializing and/or marketing our products.\nWe do not currently have nor do we plan to build the infrastructure or capability internally to manufacture our marketed products or product candidates. We rely upon and expect to continue to rely upon third-parties for the manufacture and supply of the active pharmaceutical ingredients (\u201cAPI\u201d) contained in our products and product candidates, as well as the preparation of finished products and their packaging.\nBefore any of our products manufactured by contract manufacturers can be distributed, an NDA containing appropriate chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information must be approved by the FDA. In addition, our contract manufacturers must maintain a compliance status that is acceptable to the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities. In addition, pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities are continuously subject to inspection by the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities, before and after product approval. Due to the complexity of the processes used to manufacture pharmaceutical products and product candidates, any potential third-party manufacturer may be unable to continue to pass or initially pass federal, state or international regulatory inspections in a cost-effective manner or at all.\nAlthough we do not control the day-to-day operations of our contract manufacturers, we are responsible for ensuring that our products are manufactured in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements, including cGMPs. If a third-party manufacturer with whom we contract is unable to comply with manufacturing regulations, our product candidates may not be approved or we may be subject to fines, unanticipated compliance expenses, recall or seizure of our products, total or partial suspension of production and/or enforcement actions, including injunctions, and criminal or civil prosecution. These possible sanctions would adversely affect our financial results and financial condition.\nIn addition, our reliance on foreign suppliers poses risks due to possible shipping delays, import restrictions and foreign regulatory regimes.\nWe also could experience manufacturing delays if our third-party manufacturers give greater priority to the supply of other products over our products or otherwise do not satisfactorily perform according to the terms of the agreement between us. If any supplier of API or finished drug product for our products experiences any significant difficulties in its respective manufacturing processes, does not comply with the terms of the agreement between us or does not devote sufficient time, energy and care to providing our manufacturing needs, we could experience significant interruptions in the supply of API, which could prevent or delay our development, commercialization and/or sales activities. In addition there is a risk that we may be obligated to purchase quantities of API that exceed our needs, or at prices which exceed our commercial returns, including, for example, pursuant to our arrangements with Toyama and Fujifilm, as further described in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Finally, any manufacturing facility is at risk of natural or man-made disaster, which could significantly reduce our clinical and commercial supplies of drug product.\nThese same risks apply to procuring comparator API or other comparator supplies needed for clinical trials in which we may compare our product candidates to currently approved drugs.\nThe timing of the milestone and royalty payments we are required to make to third parties is uncertain and could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations.\nWe are party to various agreements pursuant to which we are obligated to make milestone payments or pay royalties in connection with the development and commercialization of our product candidates or sales of our marketed products. In particular, we have to pay $30.0 million upon receiving approval of Vabomere for European commercialization, and make two $25.0 million payments twelve and eighteen months after the acquisition date to Medicines as part of the IDB Transaction. The timing of our achievement of these milestones and the corresponding milestone payments, or the amount of our royalty payments, is subject to factors which are difficult to predict and for which many are beyond our control. We may become obligated to make a milestone or other payment at a time when we do not have sufficient funds to make such payment, or at a time that would otherwise require us to use funds needed to continue to operate our business, which could delay our clinical trials, curtail our operations, necessitate a scaling back of our commercialization and marketing efforts or cause us to seek funds to meet these obligations on terms unfavorable to us. If we are unable to make any payment when due or if we fail to use commercially reasonable efforts to achieve certain development and commercialization milestones within the timeframes required by certain of these agreements, the other party may have the right to terminate the agreement and all of our rights to develop and commercialize product candidates using the applicable technology.\nWe may not realize the benefits of our recent acquisition from Medicines.\nIntegrating the acquired operations of the infectious disease business of Medicines successfully or otherwise realizing any of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition, including additional revenue opportunities, involves a number of challenges. The failure to meet these integration challenges could seriously harm Melinta\u2019s results of operations and the market price of Melinta\u2019s common stock may decline as a result. As part of the acquisition, Melinta and Medicines entered into a transition services agreement to assist with integration following the acquisition. Our inability or failure to implement an orderly transition or the insufficiency of our integration plans and procedures could result in failure of or delays in the integration and could adversely impact Melinta\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be required to take write-downs or write-offs, restructuring and impairment or other charges related to our acquisition from Medicines that could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition, results of operations and stock price.\nAlthough Melinta has conducted due diligence on the products it acquired from Medicines, we cannot assure you that this diligence revealed all material issues that may be present, that it would be possible to uncover all material issues through a customary amount of due diligence, or that factors outside of Melinta\u2019s control will not later arise. As a result, we may be forced to later write down or write off assets, restructure our operations, or incur impairment or other charges that could result in losses. Even if our due diligence successfully identifies certain risks, unexpected risks may arise and previously known risks may materialize in a manner not consistent with its preliminary risk analysis. Even though these charges may be non-cash items and may not have an immediate impact on our liquidity, the fact that Melinta reports charges of this nature could contribute to negative market perceptions about Melinta or its securities. In addition, charges of this nature may cause Melinta to be unable to obtain future financing on favorable terms or at all.\nWe may not be successful in establishing and maintaining development and commercialization collaborations, which could adversely affect our ability to develop certain of our product candidates and our financial condition and operating results.\nDeveloping pharmaceutical products, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approval, establishing manufacturing capabilities and marketing approved products is expensive. For example, we have established significant commercial relationships to market Baxdela outside the United States with Menarini, Eurofarma, and Malin Life Sciences Holdings Limited. We have also entered into a collaboration agreement with a clinical research organization for the development of radezolid and a relationship related to solithromycin with Toyama in Japan. We plan to establish additional collaborations for development and commercialization of product candidates and research programs, including funding the continued development of Baxdela, radezolid and potentially other products and indications. Additionally, we intend to enter into sales and marketing arrangements with third parties for international sales, and to develop our own sales force in the United States If we are unable to maintain our existing arrangements or enter into any new such arrangements on acceptable terms, if at all, we may be unable to effectively market and sell our products in our target markets. We expect to face competition in seeking appropriate collaborators. Moreover, collaboration arrangements are complex and time consuming to negotiate, document and implement and may require substantial resources to maintain. We may not be successful in our efforts to establish and implement collaborations or other alternative arrangements for the development of our product candidates.\nIf we partner with a third party for development and commercialization of a product candidate, we can expect to relinquish some or all of the control over the future success of that product candidate to the third party. Our collaboration partner may not devote sufficient resources to the commercialization of our product candidates or may otherwise fail in commercialization. The terms of any collaboration or other arrangement that we establish may not be favorable to us. In addition, any collaboration that we enter into may\nbe unsuccessful in the development and commercialization of our product candidates. In some cases, we may be responsible for continuing preclinical and initial clinical development of a partnered product candidate or research program, and the payment we receive from our collaboration partner may be insufficient to cover the cost of this development. If we are unable to reach favorable agreements with suitable collaborators for our product candidates, we would face increased costs, we may be forced to limit the number of our product candidates we can commercially develop or the territories in which we commercialize them, we might fail to commercialize products or programs for which a suitable collaborator cannot be found, and we will need to pursue other financing alternatives. If we fail to achieve successful collaborations, our operating results and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected.\nClinical trials involve a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome, and results of earlier studies and trials may not be predictive of future trial results.\nClinical testing is expensive, can take many years to complete and its outcome is highly uncertain. Failure can occur at any time during the clinical trial process due to inadequate performance of a drug or inadequate adherence by patients or investigators to clinical trial protocols. Pursuant to FDA guidelines, new antibiotic drugs generally must show non-inferiority or superiority to existing approved treatments in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials, if such approved treatments exist. We face these same risks for our pre-clinical and clinical product candidates.\nIn addition, the results of pre-clinical studies and early clinical trials of product candidates may not be predictive of the results of later-stage clinical trials. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, including those with greater resources and experience than us, have suffered significant setbacks in Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials despite achieving successful results in earlier stage trials. The failure to obtain positive results in any of our Phase 2 or Phase 3 clinical trials could seriously impair the development prospects, and even prevent regulatory approval of, any of our product candidates. Even with positive clinical trial results, there is risk that regulators will not accept the clinical trial findings or will require additional trials or other data. For example, our NDAs for oral and intravenous solithromycin received complete response letters from the FDA, which stated that the FDA could not approve the NDAs in their present form and noted that additional clinical safety information and the satisfactory resolution of manufacturing facility inspection deficiencies were required before the NDAs may be considered for approval. Melinta has not been successful in acquiring sufficient funding to perform the clinical safety study necessary to support approval of solithromycin in the United States, and therefore, has decided not to execute the clinical safety study.\nFurther, regulatory approvals in foreign countries are subject to risks associated with different regulatory requirements, including clinical trial guidance, and regulatory schemes, including, for example, multiple country regulation within the European Union. As a result, clinical trial results and other regulatory processes undertaken by us within the United States may not be accepted in foreign countries, which would add to the cost and time to develop our product candidates in foreign countries.\nMelinta cannot be certain that its product candidates will receive regulatory approval, or that its existing products will receive regulatory approval for additional uses, or that it will receive the requested exclusivity periods.\nMelinta is evaluating Baxdela in a Phase 3 clinical program for serious CABP and plans to initiate a clinical trial in patients with cUTI. Beyond the commercial launch and potential label expansion of Baxdela, Melinta will continue to pursue other pipeline opportunities. Melinta is conducting clinical studies for radezolid for the treatment of acne vulgaris, plans to deliver compounds of antibiotics for bacterial \u201csuperbugs\u201d for human clinical trials under its ESKAPE pathogen program, and is in pre-clinical phase for its compounds in the macrolide program, which have potential to treat the bacteria typically identified in skin and lung infections. Melinta\u2019s business is dependent in part on its ability to complete the development of, obtain regulatory approval for, and successfully commercialize such current and future products and product candidates in a timely manner. The process to develop, obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize product candidates is long, complex, uncertain and costly.\nThe development of a product candidate and issues relating to its approval and sale are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA in the United States and regulatory authorities in other countries, with regulations differing from country to country. Melinta is not permitted to commercialize, market or sell Melinta\u2019s product candidates in the United States until it receives approval of an NDA from the FDA. An NDA must include extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to establish the product candidate\u2019s safety and effectiveness for each desired indication. The NDA must also include significant information regarding the chemistry, manufacturing and controls for the product. Melinta is currently dependent on the work conducted by contract organizations for these activities. Obtaining approval of an NDA is a lengthy, expensive and uncertain process, and may not be obtained. The FDA review process typically has defined timelines, but may take significantly longer if additional development work is required by the FDA. FDA approvals are never guaranteed. If Melinta submits an NDA to the FDA, the FDA must decide whether to accept or reject the submission for filing. Melinta cannot be certain that any submissions will be accepted for filing and review by the FDA. Even if a product is approved, the FDA may limit the indications for which the product may be marketed, include extensive warnings on the product labeling or require expensive and time-consuming post-approval clinical trials or reporting as conditions of approval. Foreign regulatory authorities also have requirements for approval of drug candidates with which Melinta must comply prior to marketing. Obtaining regulatory approval for marketing of a product candidate in one country does not ensure that Melinta will be\nable to obtain regulatory approval in other countries. In addition, delays in approvals or rejections of marketing applications in the United States or foreign countries may be based upon many factors, including:\n\u2022\nMelinta\u2019s inability to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities that a product candidate is safe and effective for any indication;\n\u2022\nthe results of clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical significance required by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities for approval;\n\u2022\nthe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authority may make requests for additional analyses, reports, data and studies;\n\u2022\nthe FDA\u2019s or comparable foreign regulatory authority\u2019s disagreement regarding Melinta\u2019s interpretation of data and results;\n\u2022\ninability to demonstrate that the clinical and other benefits of a product candidate outweigh its safety risks;\n\u2022\nthe potential for changes in regulatory policy during the period of product development that may render Melinta\u2019s clinical data insufficient for approval;\n\u2022\ninability to identify and maintain a sufficient number of trial sites, many of which may already be engaged in other clinical trial programs, including some that may be for the same indication as Melinta\u2019s product candidates; or\n\u2022\nthe emergence of new information regarding Melinta\u2019s product candidates or other products.\nCompounds developed in the ESKAPE pathogen program and the macrolide program are still under preclinical development and may never advance to clinical testing or be successfully commercialized. The failure to enter clinical development and ultimately successfully commercialize one or more of the compounds could adversely affect the business and prospects of Melinta.\nUnder the GAIN Act, the FDA may designate a product as a QIDP. Upon approval of a drug designated by the FDA as a QIDP, five-year NCE exclusivity, three-year exclusivity, and seven-year orphan drug exclusivity are extended by an additional five years. In December 2013, the FDA designated Vabomere as a QIDP, and in a letter dated August 29, 2017, the FDA stated that the Vabomere application meets the criteria for the five-year GAIN exclusivity extension. Currently, Vabomere\u2019s application for five-year NCE exclusivity is pending before the CDER Exclusivity Board. If the FDA does not grant Vabomere the requested NCE exclusivity and instead grants three-year exclusivity, we would still obtain our GAIN exclusivity, but our total exclusivity period would be eight years rather than ten years, which could adversely affect our business related to Vabomere.\nDelays in clinical trials are common and have many causes, and any such delays could result in increased costs to us and jeopardize or delay our ability to obtain regulatory approval and commence product sales as currently contemplated.\nWe may experience delays in clinical trials of our product candidates. Our planned clinical trials might not begin on time, may be interrupted or delayed once commenced, might need to be redesigned, might not enroll a sufficient number of patients or might not be completed on schedule, if at all. Clinical trials can be delayed for a variety of reasons, including the following:\n\u2022\ndelays in obtaining regulatory approval to commence a trial;\n\u2022\nimposition of a clinical hold following an inspection of our clinical trial operations or trial sites by the FDA or other regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\ndelays in reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective CROs and clinical trial sites;\n\u2022\ndelays in obtaining required institutional review board, or IRB, approval at each site;\n\u2022\ndelays in identifying, recruiting and training suitable clinical investigators;\n\u2022\ndelays in recruiting suitable patients to participate in a trial;\n\u2022\ndelays in having patients complete participation in a trial or return for post-treatment follow-up;\n\u2022\nclinical sites dropping out of a trial to the detriment of enrollment;\n\u2022\ntime required to add new sites;\n\u2022\ndelays in obtaining sufficient supplies of clinical trial materials, including suitable active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, whether of our product candidates or comparator drugs; or\n\u2022\ndelays resulting from negative or equivocal findings of the data safety monitoring board, or DSMB, for a trial.\nPatient enrollment, a significant factor in the timing of clinical trials, is affected by many factors, including the size and nature of the patient population, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for the trial, the design of the clinical trial, competing clinical trials and clinicians\u2019 and patients\u2019 perceptions as to the potential advantages of the drug being studied in relation to other available therapies, including any new drugs that may be approved for the indications we are investigating. In addition, the timing of our clinical trials may be dependent on specific disease seasonality. We could encounter delays in our ongoing and future clinical trials of products if participating physician investigators encounter unresolved ethical issues associated with enrolling patients in clinical trials of any product in lieu of prescribing approved antibiotics that have established safety and efficacy profiles. Any of these delays in completing our clinical trials could increase our costs, slow down our product development and approval process and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenues.\nMelinta\u2019s approved products or product candidates may have undesirable side effects which may delay or prevent marketing approval, or if approval is received, require them to be taken off the market, require them to include safety warnings, become subject to FDA required risk evaluation and mitigation strategies or other remediation activities.\nIf any of Melinta\u2019s approved products or product candidates that receive marketing approval and Melinta or another party later identifies undesirable or unacceptable side effects caused by such products:\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements, specific warnings, a contraindication or field alerts to physicians and pharmacies;\n\u2022\nMelinta may be required to change the way the product is administered, conduct additional clinical trials or change the labeling of the product;\n\u2022\nMelinta may be subject to limitations on how it may promote the product;\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may require Melinta to take its approved product off the market;\n\u2022\nMelinta may be subject to litigation or product liability claims;\n\u2022\nMelinta\u2019s reputation may suffer;\n\u2022\nrelationships with Melinta\u2019s licensing partners may be harmed; and\n\u2022\nsales of the product may decrease significantly or fail to gain market acceptance.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may be delayed in obtaining, or may ultimately not be able to obtain, regulatory approval for or commercialize any of our product candidates.\nWe have relied, and plan to continue to rely, on CROs to recruit patients, monitor and manage data for our on-going clinical programs, as well as for the execution of our pre-clinical and non-clinical studies. We control only certain aspects of our CROs\u2019 activities; nevertheless, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our studies is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol, legal, regulatory and scientific standards and our reliance on the CROs does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. We and our CROs are required to comply with the FDA\u2019s cGCPs which are regulations and guidelines enforced by the FDA for all of our products in clinical development. The FDA enforces these cGCPs through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and clinical trial sites. If we or our CROs fail to comply with applicable cGCPs, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable, and the FDA may require us to perform additional clinical trials before deciding whether to approve our product candidates. We cannot assure you that, upon inspection, the FDA will determine that any of our clinical trials comply with cGCPs. In addition, to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of any product candidate to a statistically significant degree CROs conducting our clinical trials abroad will require an adequately large number of test subjects. Accordingly, if our CROs fail to comply with these regulations or recruit a sufficient number of patients, we may have to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process.\nIn addition, our CROs are not our employees and we cannot control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to our on-going clinical, non-clinical and pre-clinical programs. Our CROs may also have relationships with other commercial entities, including our competitors, for whom they may also be conducting clinical studies or other drug development activities, which could impede their ability to devote appropriate time to our clinical programs. If our CROs do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines, if they need to be replaced, or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements, or for other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize product candidates that we seek to develop. As a result, our financial results and the commercial prospects for these product candidates that we seek to develop would be harmed, our costs could increase and our ability to generate revenues could be delayed or ended.\nWe typically engage one or more CROs on a project-by-project basis for each study or trial. While we have developed and plan to maintain our relationships with CROs that we have previously engaged, we also expect to enter into agreements with other CROs to obtain additional resources and expertise in an attempt to accelerate our progress with regard to on-going clinical, non-clinical and pre-clinical programs. Switching or entering into new relationships with CROs involves substantial cost and requires extensive management time and focus. In addition, there is a natural transition period when a new CRO commences work. As a result, delays occur, which can materially impact our ability to meet our desired clinical development timelines. Although we try to carefully manage our relationships with our CROs, we may encounter challenges or delays in the future or that these delays or challenges will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.\nWe are obligated to provide Toyama with clinical and commercial supply of solithromycin at prices determined by our contract, which could negatively impact our results of operations in the event we cannot provide those supplies on our own, have to purchase them outside of our contracted suppliers or are required to purchase them at a price higher than which we can resell them to Toyama. To provide this supply, we entered into a supply agreement with Fujifilm, which contains a minimum purchase requirement, which if triggered, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. Further, if the Fujifilm plant is successfully registered and we never purchase product from Fujifilm, we could be required to reimburse Fujifilm for up to $18 million.\nPursuant to the terms of our supply agreement with Toyama, we are the exclusive supplier (with certain limitations) to Toyama and its sublicensees of API for solithromycin for use in licensed products in Japan, as well as the exclusive supplier to Toyama and its sublicensees of finished forms of solithromycin to be used in clinical trials in Japan. Pursuant to the supply agreement, Toyama will pay us for such clinical supply of finished product and all supplies of API for solithromycin for any purpose, other than the manufacture of products for commercial sale in Japan, at prices equal to our costs. All API for solithromycin supplied by us to Toyama for use in the manufacture of finished product for commercial sale in Japan will be ordered from us at prices determined by our contract with Toyama, and which may, depending on such costs, equal, exceed, or be less than such costs. The supply agreement will continue until the expiration or termination of the license agreement. In the event we cannot provide Toyama\u2019s supplies under our own contracts with manufacturers, we would have to either reduce our own supply of solithromycin or purchase it outside of our contracted manufacturers, which would negatively impact our results of operations. In January 2016, we entered into an API supply agreement with Fujifilm to provide a supply source in Japan to meet our obligations under the supply agreement with Toyama, but circumstances could occur that might render this source insufficient for our purposes. In the event that supply validation studies are completed and Fujifilm has constructed a facility to provide us the supply, we may be subject to a minimum purchase requirement for a period of time that could run to an aggregated approximately $80 million, although such expense would be offset by sales to Toyama, if any. If the Fujifilm facility is validated and we fail to order product, we could be required to reimburse Fujifilm for the cost of the plant up to $18 million.\nWhether our current products or product candidates are successful or not, our future growth will depend in part on our ability to identify, develop, acquire or in-license products and if we do not successfully identify develop, acquire or in-license additional products or product candidates or integrate them into our operations, we may have limited growth opportunities.\nAn important part of our business strategy is to continue to develop a pipeline of product candidates by developing, acquiring or in-licensing products, businesses or technologies that we believe are a strategic fit with our focus developing anti-infectives to treat infectious diseases. However, these business activities may entail numerous operational and financial risks, including:\n\u2022\ninability to successfully identity new products and product candidates;\n\u2022\ndifficulty or inability to secure financing to fund development activities for such development, acquisition or in-licensed products or technologies;\n\u2022\nincurrence of substantial debt or dilutive issuances of securities to pay for development, acquisition or in-licensing of new products;\n\u2022\ndisruption of our business and diversion of our management\u2019s time and attention;\n\u2022\nhigher than expected development, acquisition or in-license and integration costs;\n\u2022\nexposure to unknown liabilities;\n\u2022\ndifficulty and cost in combining the operations and personnel of any acquired businesses with our operations and personnel;\n\u2022\ninability to retain key employees of any acquired businesses;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in managing multiple product development programs; and\n\u2022\ninability to successfully develop new product candidates or clinical failure of new product candidates.\nWe have limited resources to identify and execute the development, acquisition or in-licensing of products, businesses and technologies and integrate them into our current infrastructure. We may compete with larger pharmaceutical companies and other competitors in our efforts to establish new collaborations and in-licensing opportunities. These competitors likely will have access to greater financial resources than us and may have greater expertise in identifying and evaluating new opportunities. Moreover, we may devote resources to potential development, acquisitions or in-licensing opportunities that are never completed, or we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such efforts.\nWe may need to grow our organization if we make progress on the development of any of our product candidates, and we may experience difficulties in managing this growth, which could disrupt our operations.\nAs of March 2, 2018, we had approximately 300 employees. As our development and commercialization plans and strategies progress and develop, we may need to expand our employee base for managerial, operational, financial and other resources, including sales and marketing resources. Future growth would impose significant added responsibilities on members of management, including the need to identify, recruit, maintain, motivate and integrate additional employees. Also, our management may need to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from their day-to-day activities and devote a substantial amount of time to managing these growth activities. We may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations which may result in weaknesses in our infrastructure, give rise to operational mistakes, loss of business opportunities, loss of employees and reduced productivity among remaining employees. Future growth could require significant capital expenditures and may divert financial resources from other projects, such as the development of additional product candidates. If our management is unable to effectively manage any future growth, our expenses may increase more than expected, our ability to generate and/or grow revenues could be reduced and we may not be able to implement our business strategy. Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize our product candidates and compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to effectively manage any future growth in our organization.\nComprehensive tax reform legislation could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nOn December 22, 2017, the US government signed into law comprehensive tax legislation, referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act). The Tax Act introduced significant changes to the US tax laws.\nThe Tax Act, among other things, contains significant changes to corporate taxation, including (i) reduction of the corporate tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35% to a flat rate of 21%; (ii) limitation of the tax deduction for interest expense to 30% of adjusted earnings (except for certain small businesses); (iii) limitation of the deduction for net operating losses to 80% of current year taxable income in respect of losses arising in taxable years beginning after 2017; (iv) elimination of net operating loss carrybacks; (v) one time taxation of offshore earnings at reduced rates regardless of whether they are repatriated; (vi) immediate deductions for certain new investments instead of deductions for depreciation expense over time; and (vii) modifying or repealing many business deductions and credits (including reducing the business tax credit for certain clinical testing expenses incurred in the testing of certain drugs for rare diseases or conditions generally referred to as \u201corphan drugs\u201d). Our federal net operating loss carryovers for taxable years beginning after 2017 will be carried forward indefinitely pursuant to the Tax Act.\nThe Tax Act did not have a material impact on our financial statements because our deferred temporary differences are fully offset by a valuation allowance and we do not have any significant offshore earnings from which to record the mandatory transition tax. However, given the significant complexity of the Tax Act, anticipated guidance from the US Treasury about implementing the Tax Act, and the potential for additional guidance from the SEC or the FASB related to the Tax Act, these estimates may be adjusted during the measurement period. We continue to examine the impact the Tax Act may have on our business. Notwithstanding the reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate, the overall impact of the Tax Act is uncertain and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nBacteria might develop resistance to our products or product candidates, which would decrease the efficacy and commercial viability of that product.\nBacteria develop resistance to antibiotics over time due to the genetic mutation of the bacteria. Many current and previous antibiotics have suffered reduced efficacy over time due to the development of resistance to such drugs. It is probable that, over time, bacteria will also develop resistance to our products and our drug candidates. If resistance were to develop rapidly to our products or our drug candidates, this would reduce the commercial potential for our business.\nWe are subject to existing and potential additional regulation and government inquiry, which can impose burdens on our operations and narrow the markets for our products.\nWe are subject, both directly and indirectly, to the adverse impact of existing and potential future government regulation of our operations and markets. Our products and product candidates are, and any future approved product candidates will be, subject to regulation by the FDA and equivalent foreign regulatory authorities. These regulations govern a wide variety of product related activities, from quality management, design and development to labeling, manufacturing, promotion, sales and distribution. If we or any of our suppliers or distributors fail to comply with the FDA and other applicable regulatory requirements, or are perceived to\npotentially have failed to comply, we may face, among other things, warning letters; adverse publicity affecting both us and our customers; investigations or notices of non-compliance, fines, injunctions, and civil penalties; import or export restrictions; partial suspensions or total shutdown of production facilities or the imposition of operating restrictions; increased difficulty in obtaining required FDA clearances or approvals or foreign equivalents; seizures or recalls of its products or those of its customers; or the inability to sell such products. Any such FDA actions could disrupt our business and operations, lead to significant remedial costs and have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations.\nWe face extensive regulatory requirements and our products may face future development and regulatory difficulties.\nThe FDA may impose significant restrictions on a product\u2019s indicated uses or marketing or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly post-approval studies or post-market surveillance. Our products are subject to ongoing FDA requirements governing the labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, safety surveillance, advertising, promotion, record keeping and reporting of safety and other post-market information. The holder of an approved NDA is subject to obligations to monitor and report adverse events and instances of the failure of a product to meet the specifications in the NDA. Application holders must submit new or supplemental applications and obtain FDA approval for certain changes to the approved product, product labeling or manufacturing process. Application holders must also submit advertising and other promotional material to the FDA and report on ongoing clinical trials. Legal requirements have also been enacted to require disclosure of clinical trial results on publicly available databases.\nIn addition, manufacturers of drug products and their facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with cGMP regulations. If we or a regulatory agency discovers previously unknown problems with a product, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured, a regulatory agency may impose restrictions on that product, the manufacturing facility or us, including requiring recall or withdrawal of the product from the market or suspension of manufacturing, requiring new warnings or other labeling changes to limit use of the drug, requiring that we conduct additional clinical trials, imposing new monitoring requirements, or requiring that we establish risk evaluation and mitigation strategies. Advertising and promotional materials must comply with FDA rules in addition to other potentially applicable federal and state laws. The distribution of product samples to physicians must comply with the requirements of the Prescription Drug Marketing Act. Government pricing and rebate programs must comply with statutory and regulatory requirements. Our products that are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration are subject to additional requirements. All of these activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. If we or our third party collaborators fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory agency may:\n\u2022\nconduct an investigation into our practices and any alleged violation of law;\n\u2022\nissue warning letters or untitled letters asserting that we are in violation of the law;\n\u2022\nseek an injunction or impose civil or criminal penalties or monetary fines;\n\u2022\nsuspend or withdraw regulatory approval;\n\u2022\nsuspend any ongoing clinical trials;\n\u2022\nrefuse to approve pending applications or supplements to applications filed by us;\n\u2022\nsuspend or impose restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements;\n\u2022\nseize or detain products, refuse to permit the import or export of products, or require us to initiate a product recall; or\n\u2022\nrefuse to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts.\nThe occurrence of any event or penalty described above may force us to expend significant amounts of time and money and may significantly inhibit our ability to bring to market or continue to market our products and generate revenues. Similar regulations apply in foreign jurisdictions.\nBecause we may not be able to obtain necessary regulatory clearances or approvals for some of our products or product candidates, we may not generate revenue in the amounts we expect, or in the amounts necessary to continue our business.\nAll of our proposed and existing products are subject to regulation in the U.S. by the FDA and/or other domestic and international governmental, public health agencies, regulatory bodies or non-governmental organizations. In particular, we are subject to strict governmental controls on the development, manufacture, labeling, distribution and marketing of our products and product candidates. The process of obtaining required approvals or clearances varies according to the nature of and uses for, a specific product or product candidate. These processes can involve lengthy and detailed laboratory testing, human clinical trials, sampling activities, and other costly, time-consuming procedures. The submission of an application to a regulatory authority does not guarantee that the authority will grant an approval or clearance for a product or product candidate. Each authority may impose its own requirements and can delay or refuse to grant approval or clearance, even though a product or product candidate has been approved in another country.\nThe time taken to obtain approval or clearance varies depending on the nature of the application and may result in the passage of a significant period of time from the date of submission of the application. Delays in the approval or clearance processes increase the risk that we will not succeed in introducing or selling the subject products or product candidates, and we may be required to abandon a proposed product or product candidate after devoting substantial time and resources to its development.\nChanges in domestic and foreign government regulations could increase our costs and could require us to undergo additional trials or procedures, or could make it impractical or impossible for us to market our products for certain uses, in certain markets, or at all.\nChanges in government regulations may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations because we may have to incur additional expenses if we are required to change or implement new testing, manufacturing and control procedures. If we are required to devote resources to develop such new procedures, we may not have sufficient resources to devote to research and development, marketing, or other activities that are critical to our business.\nAny product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval could be subject to post-marketing restrictions or recall or withdrawal from the market, and we may therefore be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if we experience unanticipated problems with our drug candidates, when and if any of them are approved.\nAny product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval, along with manufacturing processes, post-approval clinical data, labeling, advertising and promotional activities for such candidate, will be subject to continual requirements of and review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration and listing requirements, cGMP requirements relating to manufacturing, quality control, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents, requirements regarding the distribution of samples to physicians and recordkeeping. Even if marketing approval of a product candidate is granted, the approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or to the conditions of approval, including the requirement to implement a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy. If any of our product candidates receives marketing approval, the accompanying labeling may limit the approved use of our product, which could limit its sales.\nThe FDA may also impose requirements for costly post-marketing studies or clinical trials and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product. The FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of prescription products such as antibiotics to ensure such products are marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. The FDA imposes stringent restrictions on manufacturers\u2019 communications regarding off-label use, and if we do not market our products for their approved indications, we may be subject to enforcement action for off-label marketing. Violations of the FDCA relating to the promotion of prescription products may lead to investigations alleging violations of federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws, as well as state consumer protection laws.\nIn addition, later discovery of previously unknown adverse events or other problems with our products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may have negative consequences, including:\n\u2022\nrestrictions on such products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the labeling or marketing of a product;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on product distribution or use;\n\u2022\nrequirements to conduct post-marketing studies or clinical trials;\n\u2022\nwarning or untitled letters;\n\u2022\nrecall or withdrawal of the products from the market;\n\u2022\nrefusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we submit;\n\u2022\nclinical holds;\n\u2022\nfines, restitution or disgorgement of revenue or profit;\n\u2022\nsuspension or withdrawal of marketing approvals;\n\u2022\nrefusal to permit the import or export of our products or components of our products;\n\u2022\nproduct seizure; or\n\u2022\ninjunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nWe are subject to healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm and diminished profits and future earnings.\nWe are subject to additional healthcare statutory and regulatory requirements and enforcement by the federal government and the states and foreign governments in which we conduct our business. Healthcare providers, physicians and others will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of our product candidate, if approved. Our future arrangements with third-party payors will expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute our product candidate, if we obtain marketing approval. Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations include the following:\n\u2022\nThe federal healthcare anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid.\n\u2022\nThe federal False Claims Act imposes criminal and civil penalties, including those from civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease, or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government.\n\u2022\nThe federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information.\n\u2022\nThe federal false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.\n\u2022\nThe federal transparency requirements, sometimes referred to as the \"Sunshine Act,\" under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, require manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies that are reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program to report on an annual basis to the Department of Health and Human Services information related to transfers of value to certain healthcare professionals, teaching hospitals and physician ownership and investment interests.\n\u2022\nAnalogous state laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws and transparency laws, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers, and some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures and drug pricing.\nEnsuring that our future business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations could be costly. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations, including anticipated activities to be conducted by our sales team, were found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines and exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, any of which could substantially disrupt our operations. If any of the physicians or other providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found not to be in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs.\nFuture legislation, and/or regulations and policies adopted by the FDA or other regulatory health authorities may increase the time and cost required for us to conduct and complete clinical trials for product candidates that we develop.\nThe FDA has established regulations, guidelines and policies to govern the drug development and approval process, as have foreign regulatory authorities. Any change in regulatory requirements due to the adoption by the FDA and/or foreign regulatory authorities of new legislation, regulations, or policies may require us to amend existing clinical trial protocols or add new clinical trials to comply with these changes. Such amendments to existing protocols and/or clinical trial applications or the need for new ones, may significantly impact the cost, timing and completion of the clinical trials.\nIn addition, increased scrutiny by the U.S. Congress of the FDA\u2019s approval process, particularly in our areas of focus, may significantly delay or prevent regulatory approval, as well as impose more stringent product labeling and post-marketing testing and other requirements.\nIf we market any of our product candidates that receive approval in a manner that violates applicable health care laws, including laws prohibiting \u201coff-label\u201d promotion, disclosure laws or other similar laws, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties.\nAny regulatory approval of drug products is limited to those specific diseases and indications for which a product is deemed to be safe and effective by the FDA. In addition to the FDA approval required for new formulations, any new indication for an approved product also requires FDA approval. Physicians may choose to prescribe drugs for uses that are not described in the product\u2019s labeling and for uses that differ from those tested in clinical studies and approved by the regulatory authorities. Regulatory authorities in the United States generally do not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments, and such off-label uses by healthcare professionals are common. Regulatory authorities do, however, restrict communications by pharmaceutical companies on the subject of off-label use. A company that is found to have promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability, including civil and administrative remedies, as well as criminal sanctions. If we are not able to obtain FDA approval for any desired future indications for any marketed products, our ability to market and sell such products will be limited and our business may be adversely affected.\nNotwithstanding the regulatory restrictions on off-label promotion, the FDA and other regulatory authorities permit companies to engage in truthful, non-misleading and non-promotional scientific exchange concerning their products. In addition, recent FDA guidance suggests that there are circumstances in which the FDA would not object to the promotion of certain information that is not included in the approved labeling, provided that this information is consistent with the approved labeling and otherwise complies with applicable regulations.\nIn addition, in recent years, several states and localities have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state or make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials, health care provider payments and other activities. Additionally, the federal government has enacted the Physician Payment Sunshine Act which requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to report annually to the Secretary of Health and Human Services payments or other transfers of value made by that entity to physicians and teaching hospitals. We are required to report certain information with respect to such payments, which will be made publicly available on a searchable website. We may also have to comply with similar reporting obligations in foreign countries. We will need to expend significant efforts to maintain and enhance such reporting systems and processes in order to comply with these requirements. Failure to comply with the reporting requirements would result in significant civil monetary penalties. The ACA also includes various provisions designed to strengthen significantly fraud and abuse enforcement, such as increased funding for enforcement efforts and the lowering of the intent requirement of the federal anti-kickback statute and criminal health care fraud statute such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it.\nEven if we obtain FDA approval of a given product candidate, we may fail to obtain approval for or be able to commercialize such product outside of the United States, which would limit our ability to realize their full market potential. If foreign approval is obtained, there are risks in conducting business in international markets.\nIn order to market a product outside of the United States, we must establish and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy. Clinical trials conducted in one country may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other countries, and regulatory approval in one country does not mean that regulatory approval will be obtained in any other country. Approval procedures vary among countries and can involve additional product testing and validation and additional administrative review periods. Seeking foreign regulatory approvals could result in significant delays, difficulties and costs for us and require additional pre-clinical studies or clinical trials which would be costly and time consuming. Regulatory requirements can vary widely from country to country and could delay or prevent the introduction of our products in those countries. Satisfying these and other regulatory requirements is costly, time consuming, uncertain and subject to unanticipated delays.\nIn addition, our failure to obtain regulatory approval in the United States or any foreign country may delay or have negative effects on the process for regulatory approval in other countries. If we fail to comply with regulatory requirements in a foreign country or to obtain and maintain required approvals, our potential market for products will be reduced and our ability to realize the full market potential of our products will be harmed.\nIf we obtain approval to commercialize any of our products or product candidates outside of the United States, a variety of risks associated with international operations could materially adversely affect our business.\nIf any of our products or product candidates are approved outside the United States, we have entered into and will likely enter into additional agreements with third parties to commercialize such product outside the United States. We expect that we will be subject to additional risks related to entering into or maintaining these international business relationships, including:\n\u2022\ndifferent regulatory requirements for drug approvals in foreign countries;\n\u2022\ndiffering U.S. and foreign drug import and export rules;\n\u2022\nreduced protection for intellectual property rights in foreign countries;\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers and regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\ndifferent reimbursement systems;\n\u2022\neconomic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets;\n\u2022\ncompliance with tax, employment, immigration and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad;\n\u2022\nforeign taxes, including withholding of payroll taxes;\n\u2022\nforeign currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenues, and other obligations incident to doing business in another country;\n\u2022\nworkforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the United States;\n\u2022\nproduction shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad;\n\u2022\npotential liability resulting from development work conducted by these distributors; and\n\u2022\nbusiness interruptions resulting from geopolitical actions, including war and terrorism, or natural disasters.\nFailure to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, as well as the anti-bribery laws of the nations in which we conduct business, could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences.\nWe are subject to the FCPA, which generally prohibits U.S. companies from engaging in bribery or other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business and requires companies to maintain accurate books and records and internal controls. In addition, we are subject to other anti-bribery laws of the nations in which we conduct business that apply similar prohibitions as the FCPA. Our employees or other agents may engage in prohibited conduct without our knowledge under our policies and procedures and the FCPA and other anti-bribery laws that we may be subject to for which we may be held responsible. If our employees or other agents are found to have engaged in such practices, we could suffer severe penalties and other consequences that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nProduct liability lawsuits could divert our resources, result in substantial liabilities and reduce the commercial potential of our products.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability as a result of sales of our marketed products as well from the clinical testing of our product candidates despite obtaining appropriate informed consents from our clinical trial participants. For example, we may be sued if any product we develop allegedly causes injury or is found to be otherwise unsuitable during clinical testing, manufacturing, marketing or sale. Any such product liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product, negligence, strict liability or a breach of warranties. Claims could also be asserted under state consumer protection acts. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit commercialization of our product candidates. Even successful defense would require significant financial and management resources. Regardless of the merits or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u2022\ndecreased demand for our products or product candidates that we may develop;\n\u2022\nloss of revenue;\n\u2022\ninjury to our reputation;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u2022\ninitiation of investigations by regulators;\n\u2022\ncosts to defend the related litigation;\n\u2022\na diversion of management\u2019s time and our resources;\n\u2022\nsubstantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients;\n\u2022\nproduct recalls, withdrawals or labeling, marketing or promotional restrictions;\n\u2022\nexhaustion of any available insurance and our capital resources;\n\u2022\nthe inability to commercialize our products or product candidates; and\n\u2022\na decline in our stock price.\nThe cost of any product liability litigation or other proceeding, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial. In addition, inability to obtain or maintain sufficient insurance coverage at an acceptable cost or to otherwise protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the development and commercial production and sale of our products, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nWe are subject to various environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, in connection with which we could become subject to liabilities, fines, penalties or other sanctions, or incur costs, that could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.\nWe are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment, release and disposal of, and exposure to, hazardous materials and wastes. From time to time our operations involve and may, in the future, involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological materials, and may also produce hazardous waste products. Even if we contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and wastes, we cannot eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from our handling, use, storage, treatment, release or disposal of hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability, which in certain cases could be joint and several, could exceed our resources. We also could incur significant costs, civil or criminal fines, penalties, or other sanctions for failure to comply with such laws and regulations. In addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental health and safety laws and regulations, which have tended to become more stringent over time. These current or future laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts.\nAlthough we maintain workers\u2019 compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from hazardous materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. We do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims.\nIf we are not successful in retaining or attracting as necessary highly qualified personnel, we may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy.\nOur ability to compete in the highly competitive biotechnology and pharmaceuticals industries depends in large part on our ability to retain or attract as necessary highly qualified managerial, scientific, medical and sales and marketing personnel. Competition for skilled personnel is very intense and competition for experienced scientists may limit our ability to hire and retain highly qualified personnel on acceptable terms or at all. Our current levels of total compensation may be below the level of companies who seek to hire our current employees, impacting our ability to retain members of our team. Despite our efforts to retain valuable employees, members of our management, scientific and medical teams may terminate their employment with us on short notice. The loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees could potentially harm our business, operating results or financial condition. Our success also depends on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled scientific and medical personnel.\nOther biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies with which we compete for qualified personnel have greater financial and other resources, different risk profiles and longer histories than we do. They also may provide more diverse opportunities and better chances for career advancement. Some of these characteristics may be more appealing to high quality candidates than what we offer. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain high quality personnel, our ability to discover, develop and commercialize drug candidates will be limited.\nFailure to achieve and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our business and share price.\nDue to factors arising from the relatively recent closing of our reverse merger transaction with Cempra, Inc., we were not required to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(a) (\u201cSection 404\u201d) of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes Oxley Act\u201d) for the year ended December 31, 2017. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\u201d for further information. We anticipate being required to meet these standards in the course of preparing our financial statements as of, and for the year ended, December 31, 2018, and our management will be required to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for such year. The rules governing the standards that must be met for our management to assess our internal control over financial reporting are complex and require significant documentation, testing and possible remediation.\nIn connection with our implementation of the necessary procedures and practices related to internal control over financial reporting, we may identify deficiencies that we may not be able to remedy in time to meet the deadline imposed by the Sarbanes Oxley Act for compliance with the requirements of Section 404. In addition, we may encounter problems or delays in completing the implementation of any requested improvements and receiving a favorable attestation in connection with the attestation provided by our independent registered public accounting firm. In the event we are un able to receive a favorable attestation report in a timely manner, the market price of our common stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by NASDAQ, the SEC or other regulatory agencies, which could require additional financial and management resources. Additionally, we will be unable\nto issue securities in the public markets through the use of a shelf registration if we are not in compliance with Section 404. Furthermore, failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could have a material adverse effect on our business and share price and could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely.\nOur employees may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements and insider trading.\nWe are exposed to the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct. Misconduct by employees could include intentional failures to comply with FDA regulations, provide accurate information to the FDA, comply with federal and state health care fraud and abuse laws and regulations, report financial information or data accurately or disclose unauthorized activities to us. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the health care industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, misconduct, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Employee misconduct could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. We have adopted a Code of Conduct, but it is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with these laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions.\nRisks Related to our Intellectual Property\nOur ability to pursue the development and commercialization of certain of our products depends upon the continuation of certain licenses.\nWe rely on certain licenses to certain patent rights and proprietary technology from third parties that are important or necessary to the development of our technology and products.\nBaxdela. Our license agreement with Wakunaga Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. provides us with a worldwide exclusive license to develop and sell Baxdela. In particular, we obtained an exclusive license to certain patents, patent applications and proprietary information, including patents and proprietary information owned by AbbVie Inc. and licensed to Wakunaga, covering the composition of matter to Baxdela, its manufacturing process, salt forms, pharmaceutical compositions containing Baxdela, methods of using Baxdela, and other proprietary information. Our license agreement with Wakunaga further grants us non-exclusive rights to other patents and applications. The license requires us to make certain milestone and royalty payments to Wakunaga. If we are unable to make any of these required payments under the license agreement, or if we do not use commercially reasonable efforts to achieve certain development and commercialization milestones for Baxdela within the timeframes required by the license agreement, our rights to develop and commercialize Baxdela could be terminated. In addition, Wakunaga may terminate the license agreement on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis based upon our material breach of the license agreement if not cured within 90 days from written notice of breach. If our license agreement with Wakunaga were terminated, we would lose our rights to develop and commercialize Baxdela, and would have to grant Wakunaga a perpetual, non-royalty bearing, exclusive license to our proprietary information reasonably necessary to commercialize Baxdela. Loss of our license agreement would materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and future prospects.\nOrbactiv. As a result of the IDB Transaction, we are a party to a license agreement with Eli Lilly and Company (\u201cEli Lilly\u201d). Under the terms of the agreement, we have exclusive worldwide rights to patents and other intellectual property related to Orbactiv and other compounds claimed in the licensed patent rights. We are required to make payments to Eli Lilly upon reaching specified regulatory and sales milestones. In addition, we are obligated to pay royalties based on net sales of products containing Orbactiv or the other compounds in any jurisdiction in which we hold license rights to a valid patent. The royalty rate due to Eli Lilly on sales increases as annual sales of these products increase. We are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain regulatory approval for Orbactiv in the United States and to commercialize Orbactiv in the United States. If we breach that obligation, Eli Lilly may terminate our license in the United States, license rights to Orbactiv could revert to Eli Lilly and we would lose our rights to develop and commercialize Orbactiv. The license rights under the agreement remain in force, on a country-by-country basis, until there is no valid patent in such country and our obligation to pay royalties ceases in that country. Either party may terminate the agreement upon an uncured material breach by the other party. In addition, either party may terminate the agreement upon the other party\u2019s insolvency or bankruptcy.\nIn addition, disputes may arise regarding intellectual property subject to a licensing agreement, including:\n\u2022\nthe scope of rights granted under the license agreement and other interpretation-related issues;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which our technology and processes infringe on or misappropriate the intellectual property of the licensor that is not subject to the licensing agreement;\n\u2022\nthe sublicensing of patent and other rights under the license agreement;\n\u2022\nour diligence obligations under the license agreement and what activities satisfy those diligence obligations;\n\u2022\nthe payment of royalty fees, milestones or other costs under the license agreements; and\n\u2022\nthe priority of invention of patented technology.\nIf disputes over intellectual property that we have licensed prevent or impair our ability to maintain our current licensing arrangements on acceptable terms, we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize the affected product candidates.\nIn addition, the agreements under which we currently license intellectual property or technology from third parties are complex, and certain provisions in such agreements may be susceptible to multiple interpretations. The resolution of any contract interpretation disagreement that may arise could narrow what we believe to be the scope of our rights to the relevant intellectual property or technology, or increase what we believe to be our financial or other obligation under the relevant agreement, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIf our efforts to protect the proprietary nature of the intellectual property related to our products and product candidates are not adequate, we may not be able to compete effectively in our market.\nOur commercial success will depend in part on our ability to obtain additional patents and protect our existing patent position as well as our ability to maintain adequate protection of other intellectual property for current and any future products in the United States and other countries. If we do not adequately protect our intellectual property, competitors may be able to use our technologies and erode or negate any competitive advantage we may have, which could harm our business and ability to achieve profitability. The patent positions of pharmaceutical companies are highly uncertain. The legal principles applicable to patents are in transition due to changing court precedent and legislative action and we cannot assure you that the historical legal standards surrounding questions of validity will continue to be applied or that current defenses relating to issued patents in these fields will be sufficient in the future. Changes in patent laws in the United States such as the America Invents Act of 2011 may affect the scope, strength and enforceability of our patent rights or the nature of proceedings which may be brought by us related to our patent rights. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and we may encounter significant problems in protecting our proprietary rights in these countries. We will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary technologies any future products are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets.\nThese risks include the possibility that:\n\u2022\nthe patent applications that we licensed or have filed on our own may fail to result in issued patents in the United States or in foreign countries;\n\u2022\npatents issued or licensed to us or our partners may be challenged, discovered to have been issued on the basis of insufficient or incorrect information and/or held to be invalid or unenforceable;\n\u2022\nthe scope of any patent protection may be too narrow to exclude other competitors from developing or designing around these patents;\n\u2022\nwe or our licensors were not the first to make the inventions covered by each of our issued patents and pending patent applications;\n\u2022\nwe or our licensors were not the first to file patent applications for these inventions;\n\u2022\nwe may fail to comply with procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process, which can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights;\n\u2022\nfuture product candidates may not be patentable;\n\u2022\nothers will claim rights or ownership with regard to patents and other proprietary rights which we hold or license;\n\u2022\ndelays in development, testing, clinical trials and regulatory review may reduce the period of time during which we could market our product candidates under patent protection; and\n\u2022\nwe may fail to timely apply for patents on our technologies, products or product candidates.\nWhile we apply for patents covering both our technologies, products, and our potential products, as we deem appropriate, many biopharmaceutical companies and university and research institutions already have filed patent applications or have received patents in our areas of product development. These entities\u2019 applications, patents and other intellectual property rights may conflict with patent applications to which we have rights and could prevent us from obtaining patents or could call into question the validity of any of our patents, if issued, or could otherwise adversely affect our ability to develop, manufacture or commercialize antibiotic candidates. In addition, if third parties file patent applications in the technologies that also claim technology to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference, derivation or other proceedings with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (\u201cUSPTO\u201d) or applicable foreign patent regulatory authorities, as applicable, to determine our rights in the invention, which may be time-consuming and expensive. Moreover, issued patents may be challenged during post-grant proceedings brought by a third party or the USPTO, or in foreign countries, or in the courts. These proceedings may result in loss of patent claims or adverse changes to the scope of the claims. Patent applications may also be challenged during pre-grant proceedings. If we are unsuccessful in defending any such opposition, only part of such patent would issue or the patent might not issue at all.\nIf we or our licensors or partners fail to obtain and maintain patent protection for our products and product candidates, or our proprietary technologies and their uses, companies may be dissuaded from collaborating with us. In such event, our ability to commercialize our products and product candidates may be threatened, we could lose our competitive advantage and the competition we face could increase, all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nIf we are sued for infringing intellectual property rights of third parties, litigation will be costly and time consuming and could prevent us or delay us from developing or commercializing our products and product candidates.\nOur commercial success depends, in part, on our not infringing the patents and proprietary rights of other parties and not breaching any collaboration or other agreements we have entered into with regard to our technologies, products and product candidates. Numerous third-party U.S. and non-U.S. issued patents and pending applications exist in the areas of antibacterial treatment, including compounds, formulations, treatment methods and synthetic processes that may be applied towards the synthesis of antibiotics. Although no legal action has been commenced or threatened against us by a third party for infringing intellectual property rights, we cannot provide assurances that we or our partners will be free to manufacture or market our product candidates as planned, or that we or our licensors\u2019 and partners\u2019 patents will not be opposed or litigated by third parties.\nThere is a substantial amount of litigation involving intellectual property in the biopharmaceutical industry generally. If a third party asserts that we infringe its patents or other proprietary rights, we could face a number of risks that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects, including:\n\u2022\ninfringement and other intellectual property claims, which would be costly and time consuming to defend, whether or not we are ultimately successful, which in turn could delay the regulatory approval process, consume our capital and divert management\u2019s attention from our business;\n\u2022\nsubstantial damages for past infringement, which we may have to pay if a court determines that our products, product candidates or technologies infringe a competitor\u2019s patent or other proprietary rights;\n\u2022\na court prohibiting us from selling or licensing our technologies, products or future products unless the third party licenses its patents or other proprietary rights to us on commercially reasonable terms, which it is not required to do;\n\u2022\nif a license is available from a third party, we may have to pay substantial royalties or lump sum payments or grant cross licenses to our patents or other proprietary rights to obtain that license; and\n\u2022\nredesigning our products or product candidates so they do not infringe, which may not be possible or may require substantial monetary expenditures and time.\nAlthough we are not currently party to any legal proceedings relating to our intellectual property, in the future, third parties may file claims asserting that our technologies, processes or products infringe on their intellectual property. We cannot predict whether third parties will assert these claims against us or our partners or against the licensors of technology licensed to us, or whether those claims will harm our business. In addition, the outcome of intellectual property litigation is subject to uncertainties that cannot be adequately quantified in advance. If we or our partners were to face infringement claims or challenges by third parties relating to our product candidates, an adverse outcome could subject us to significant liabilities to such third parties, and force us or our partners to curtail or cease the development of some or all of our products and product candidates, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nWe may be required to file lawsuits or take other actions to protect or enforce our patents or the patents of our licensors, which could be expensive and time consuming.\nCompetitors may infringe our patents or the patents of our licensors. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming. Moreover, there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient financial or other resources to file and pursue such infringement claims, which typically last for years before they are concluded. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biopharmaceuticals, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally.\nIn addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours or our licensors is not valid or is unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents, or those of our licensors, do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents, or those of our licensors, at risk of being invalidated, held unenforceable or interpreted narrowly and could put our patent applications, or those of our licensors, at risk of not issuing. Moreover, we may not be able to prevent, alone or with our licensors, misappropriation of our proprietary rights, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect those rights as fully as in the United States. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. In addition, if securities analysts or investors perceive public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments to be negative, the price of our common stock could be adversely affected. The occurrence of any of the above could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of certain information, the value of our products and product candidates and technology could be materially adversely affected.\nWe rely on trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological advancement to develop and maintain our competitive position. To protect this competitive position, we regularly enter into confidentiality and proprietary information agreements with third parties, including employees, independent contractors, suppliers and collaborators. We cannot, however, ensure that these protective arrangements will be honored by third parties, and we may not have adequate remedies if these arrangements are breached. In addition, enforcement of claims that a third party has illegally obtained and is using trade secrets, know-how and technological advancements is expensive, time consuming and uncertain. Non-U.S. courts are sometimes less willing than U.S. courts to protect this information. Moreover, our trade secrets, know-how and technological advancements may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors in a manner providing us with no practical recourse against the competing parties. If any such events were to occur, they could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nWe have not yet registered our trademarks in all of our potential markets, and failure to secure those registrations could adversely affect our business.\nWe have filed trademark applications with the USPTO for our marks, including \u201cMELINTA,\u201d \u201cMELINTA THERAPEUTICS,\u201d \u201cMELINTA THE ANTIBIOTICS COMPANY\u201d and \u201cBAXDELA\u201d for use in connection with our goods and services. The MELINTA, MELINTA THERAPEUTICS and MELINTA THE ANTIBIOTICS COMPANY marks have matured to registration in the United States. We also have filed and anticipate filing foreign trademark applications for the same marks for goods and services outside the United States, and have obtained registrations for some trademarks in jurisdictions outside the United States. The registrations will be subject to use and maintenance requirements. We may not register all of our trademarks in all of our potential markets, and it is also possible that there are names or symbols other than the foregoing that may be protectable marks for which we have not sought registration, and failure to secure those registrations could adversely affect our business. We cannot assure you that opposition or cancellation proceedings will not be filed against our trademarks or that our trademarks would survive such proceedings.\nAs a result of the IDB Transaction, we have acquired trademarks and trademark applications filed with the USPTO or other jurisdictions for additional marks, including \u201cORBACTIV,\u201d \u201cTARGANTA,\u201d \u201cVAYMERIS,\u201d \u201cVABOMERE,\u201d \u201cMERVABIA,\u201d \u201cBAVREM,\u201d \u201cCARBAVANCE,\u201d for use in connection with our goods and services. We have also acquired a license to the \u201cMINOCIN\u201d mark. The ORBACTIV and CARBAVANCE marks have matured to registration in the United States. We also have filed and anticipate filing foreign trademark applications for the same marks for goods and services outside the United States, and have obtained registrations for some trademarks in jurisdictions outside the United States. The registrations will be subject to use and maintenance requirements. We may not register all of our trademarks in all of our potential markets, and it is also possible that there are names or symbols other than the foregoing that may be protectable marks for which we have not sought registration, and failure to secure those registrations could adversely affect our business. We cannot assure you that opposition or cancellation proceedings will not be filed against our trademarks or that our trademarks would survive such proceedings.\nAny of our existing or future trademark applications in the United States and any other jurisdictions where we may file may not be allowed for registration, and registered trademarks may not be obtained, maintained or enforced. During trademark registration proceedings, we may receive rejections. Although we are given an opportunity to respond to those rejections, we may be unable to overcome such rejections. In addition, in the USPTO and in comparable agencies in many foreign jurisdictions, third parties are given an opportunity to oppose pending trademark applications and to seek to cancel registered trademarks. Opposition or cancellation proceedings may be filed against our trademarks, and our trademarks may not survive such proceedings.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers.\nAs is common in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, we employ individuals who were previously employed at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. We may be subject to claims that these employees, or we, have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Such claims may lead to material costs for us, or an inability to protect or use valuable intellectual property rights, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nMelinta relies on certain third-party software in its business, including in the operation of its research and development operations, and the loss of such rights or the disruption of the software could result in a material disruption of its product development programs.\nMelinta licenses and uses certain third-party software, any third-party software may include bugs or failures, may fail to continue to be compatible with Melinta\u2019s systems, as necessary, or may be found to infringe other third-party rights, such that Melinta may be unable to continue to use the software for its current purposes. While alternative software is commercially available, implementing new software and related systems could have a material impact on Melinta\u2019s business and specifically its research and development operations.\nMelinta\u2019s internal computer systems, or those of its CROs or other contractors or consultants, may fail or suffer security breaches, which could result in a material disruption of its product development programs.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, Melinta\u2019s internal computer systems and those of its CROs and other contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage or disruption from computer viruses, software bugs, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war, and telecommunication, equipment and electrical failures. While Melinta has not, to its knowledge, experienced any significant system failure, accident or security breach to date, if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in its operations, it could result in a material disruption of its programs. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed or ongoing clinical trials for any of its product candidates could result in delays in its regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase its costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss of or damage to its data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure or theft of confidential or proprietary information, Melinta could incur liability, the further development of its product candidates could be delayed or its competitive position could be compromised.\nOur agreement with BARDA includes provisions that grant rights and remedies to the U.S. government that, if incurred, may make it more costly and difficult for us to successfully market Vabomere and, in certain circumstances, may allow the government to seek title to the work performed under the BARDA agreement.\nIn February 2014, our subsidiary, Rempex Pharmaceuticals, Inc., entered into a cost-sharing agreement with BARDA to support the development of Vabomere, which includes provisions that reflect the U.S. government\u2019s substantial rights and remedies, many of which are not typically found in commercial contracts. These rights and remedies include powers of the government to claim rights to data, including intellectual property rights, developed under such contracts under certain circumstances. The government may also impose U.S. manufacturing requirements for products that embody inventions conceived or first reduced to practice under such contracts. We may not have the right to prohibit the U.S. government from using certain technologies funded by the government and developed by us related to Vabomere, and we may not be able to prohibit third party companies, including our competitors, from using those technologies in providing products and services to the U.S. government. The U.S. government generally takes the position that it has the right to royalty-free use of technologies that are developed under U.S. government contracts. Failure to comply with provisions within the BARDA contract may make it more costly and difficult for us to successfully conduct our business. In addition, certain provisions of the BARDA contract may allow in some circumstances the government to seek title to certain inventions made in the performance of work under the contract.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nOur shareholders may sell a significant portion of our common stock into the market, which could cause our stock price to decline.\nThe shares issued to the pre-closing shareholders of the former Melinta prior to its merger with Cempra, representing a total of 11,433,611 shares, become eligible for resale in May 2018. In addition, we have re-sale shelf registration statements on file with the SEC pursuant to which (i) Medicines may sell an aggregate of 3,313,702 shares of common stock (1,656,851 of which are subject to a contractual lock-up through July 2018), (ii) affiliates of Deerfield may sell an aggregate of 6,920,714 shares of common stock (3,792,868 of which are issuable upon the exercise of warrants at an exercise price of $16.50 per share) and (iii) Vatera and certain other stockholders may sell an aggregate of 2,662,739 shares of common stock which they purchased in the equity financing of the IDB Transaction. The sale of a substantial number of our shares within a short period of time could cause our stock price to decline, make it more difficult for us to raise funds through future offerings of our common stock or acquire other businesses using our common stock as consideration.\nWe are subject to a putative securities class action and shareholder derivative lawsuits, which may require significant management time and attention and significant legal expenses and may result in unfavorable outcomes, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAs discussed in Item 1, on November 3, 2017, the Company merged with Cempra, Inc. in a business combination. Prior to the merger, on November 4, 2016, a securities class action lawsuit was commenced in the United States District Court, Middle District of North Carolina, Durham Division, naming Cempra, Inc. (now known as Melinta Therapeutics, Inc.) (for purposes of this and the following descriptions of legal proceedings, \u201cCempra\u201d) and certain of Cempra\u2019s officers as defendants. Two substantially similar lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court, Middle District of North Carolina on November 22, 2016 and December 30, 2016, respectively. Pursuant to the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, on July 6, 2017, the court consolidated the three lawsuits into a single action and appointed a lead plaintiff and co-lead counsel in the consolidated case. On August 16, 2017, the plaintiff filed a consolidated amended complaint. Plaintiff alleges violations of the Exchange Act in connection with allegedly false and misleading statements made by the defendants between July 7, 2015 and November 4, 2016 (the \u201cClass Period\u201d). Plaintiff seeks to represent a class comprised of purchasers of Cempra\u2019s common stock during the Class Period and seeks damages, costs and expenses and such other relief as determined by the court. On September 29, 2017, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint. On November 13, 2017, the plaintiff filed an opposition to the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint. On December 4, 2017, the defendants filed a reply brief. The motion remains pending and oral argument has yet to be scheduled.\nOn December 21, 2016, a shareholder derivative lawsuit was commenced in the North Carolina Durham County Superior Court, naming certain of Cempra\u2019s former and current officers and directors as defendants and Cempra as a nominal defendant, and asserting claims for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, abuse of control, gross mismanagement, and corporate waste (the \u201cDecember 2016 Action\u201d). A substantially similar lawsuit was filed in the North Carolina Durham County Superior Court on February 16, 2017 (the \u201cFebruary 2017 Action\u201d). The complaints are based on similar allegations as asserted in the securities lawsuits described above, and seek unspecified damages and attorneys\u2019 fees. Both cases were served and transferred to the North Carolina Business Court as mandatory complex business cases. The Business Court consolidated the February 2017 Action into the December 2016 Action and appointed counsel for the plaintiff in the December 2016 Action as lead counsel. On July 6, 2017, the court stayed the action pending resolution of the putative securities class action. That stay has since been lifted. The plaintiff filed an amended complaint on December 29, 2017, and was required to file a further amended complaint by February 6, 2018. On February 6, 2018, the plaintiff filed his second amended complaint.\nOn January 3, 2018, the plaintiff who commenced the February 2017 Action, which was subsequently consolidated into the December 2016 Action, transmitted to the Acting Chief Executive Officer of Cempra a litigation demand (the \u201cDemand\u201d). The Demand requested that Cempra\u2019s Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d) \u201ccommence an independent investigation into the matters raised\u201d in the complaint filed in the February 2017 Action and the Demand, \u201ctake any and all appropriate steps for Cempra to recover, through litigation if necessary, the damages proximately caused by the directors' and officers' alleged breaches of fiduciary duty,\u201d and \u201cimplement corporate governance enhancements to prevent recurrence of the alleged wrongdoing.\u201d The Board has not yet formally responded to the Demand.\nOn July 31, 2017, a shareholder derivative lawsuit was commenced in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, naming certain of Cempra\u2019s former and current officers and directors as defendants and Cempra as nominal defendant, and asserting claims for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, and corporate waste. The complaint is based on similar allegations as asserted in the putative securities class action described above, and seeks unspecified damages and attorneys\u2019 fees. On October 23, 2017, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, stay, the complaint, which was supported by an opening brief filed on November 9, 2017. On January 8, 2018, the plaintiff filed his answering brief in opposition to the defendants\u2019 motion. The defendants filed their reply in support of their motion on February 7, 2018. The motion remains pending.\nOn September 15, 2017, a shareholder derivative lawsuit was commenced in the United States District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina, Durham Division, naming certain of Cempra\u2019s former and current officers and directors as defendants and Cempra as nominal defendant, and asserting claims for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, abuse of control, gross mismanagement, corporate waste, and violation of Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act. The complaint is based on similar allegations as asserted in the putative securities class action described above, and seeks unspecified damages and attorneys\u2019 fees. . On December 1, 2017, the parties filed a joint motion seeking to stay the shareholder derivative lawsuit pending resolution of the putative securities class action, which stipulation was ordered by the court on December 11, 2017.\nOn September 27, 2017 and October 6, 2017, putative class action complaints were filed against Cempra, members of its board of directors and Melinta Therapeutics, Inc. (now known as Melinta Subsidiary Corp.) (for the purposes of the description of these legal proceedings, \u201cMelinta\u201d) on behalf of the public stockholders of Cempra in the United States District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina. The complaints allege that the preliminary proxy statement issued in connection with the proposed merger between Cempra and Melinta omitted material information in violation of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act, rendering the preliminary proxy statement false and misleading. On February 7, 2018, the plaintiffs and the defendants executed a settlement agreement that resolved the plaintiffs\u2019 claims with prejudice as to the named plaintiffs and without prejudice to any other member of the putative class. Defendants have agreed to pay attorneys\u2019 fees of $262,500.00 in connection with settlement of the actions.\nWhile we believe that we have meritorious defenses to the claims in these lawsuits and intend to vigorously defend the cases, these lawsuits could divert management\u2019s attention from our ordinary business operations. Further, the outcome of these proceedings is difficult to predict and quantify, and the defense against the proceedings could be costly. The ultimate resolution of these cases could result in payments of monetary damages or other costs, materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, or adversely affect our reputation, and consequently, could negatively impact the trading price of our common stock.\nWe have various insurance policies related to the risks associated with our business, including directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance policies. However, there is no assurance that our insurance coverage will be sufficient or that our insurance carriers will cover all claims in that litigation. If we are not successful in our defense of the claims asserted in these cases and those claims are not covered by insurance or exceed our insurance coverage, we may have to pay damage awards, indemnify our officers from damage awards that may be entered against them and pay the costs and expenses incurred in defense of, or in any settlement of, such claims.\nIn addition, it is possible that similar lawsuits may be filed in the future in the same or other courts that name the same or additional defendants, in which case we could be similarly materially and adversely affected by such additional litigation.\nThe trading market for our common stock may not provide our shareholders with adequate liquidity.\nOur common stock has at times been thinly traded and may be so again. We cannot assure you that an active trading market for our common stock will be maintained. You may not be able to sell your shares quickly or at the market price if trading in our common stock is not active.\nThe market price of our common stock may be highly volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nOur stock price could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors. In addition, the stock market in general, and the NASDAQ Global Market and the stock of biotechnology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. Broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.\nOur principal shareholders and management own a significant percentage of our stock and are able to exert significant control over matters subject to shareholder approval.\nAs of March 2, 2018, our principal shareholders, executive officers, directors and entities affiliated with certain of our directors beneficially owned approximately 60.4% of our outstanding voting common stock. Therefore, these shareholders have the ability to influence us through their ownership position. These shareholders may be able to determine the outcome of all matters requiring shareholder approval. For example, these shareholders may be able to control elections of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, or approval of any merger, sale of assets, or other major corporate transaction. This may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our common stock that you may feel are in your best interest as one of our shareholders.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock so any returns will be limited to the value of our stock.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital shares. We currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings to support our operations and finance the growth and development of our business. We do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. In addition, under our credit agreement with Deerfield, we are prohibited from declaring or paying any cash dividends. Any future determination related to dividend policy will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on then-existing conditions, including our financial condition, operating results, contractual restrictions, capital requirements, business prospects and other factors our board of directors may deem relevant.\nSome provisions of our charter documents and Delaware law may have anti-takeover effects that could discourage an acquisition of us by others, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our shareholders and may prevent attempts by our shareholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us or increase the cost of acquiring us, even if an acquisition would benefit our shareholders, and could also make it more difficult to remove our current management. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nauthorizing the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without shareholder approval;\n\u2022\nlimiting the removal of directors by the shareholders;\n\u2022\ncreating a staggered board of directors;\n\u2022\nprohibiting shareholder action by written consent, thereby requiring all shareholder actions to be taken at a meeting of shareholders;\n\u2022\neliminating the ability of shareholders to call a special meeting of shareholders; and\n\u2022\nestablishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at shareholder meetings.\nThese provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our shareholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for shareholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management. In addition, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with an interested shareholder for a period of three years following the date on which the shareholder became an interested shareholder, unless such transactions are approved by the board of directors. This provision could have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing someone from acquiring us or merging with us, whether or not it is desired by or beneficial to our shareholders. Any provision of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our shareholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.", "PERMNO": 13263, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "MLNTQ"}
