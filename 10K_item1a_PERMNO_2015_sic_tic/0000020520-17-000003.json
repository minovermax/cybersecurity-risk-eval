{"cik": "20520", "company": "FRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\n\ufeff\nBefore you make an investment decision with respect to any of our securities, you should carefully consider all the information we have included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our subsequent periodic filings with the SEC. In particular, you should carefully consider the risk factors described below and the risks and uncertainties related to \u201cForward-Looking Statements,\u201d any of which could materially adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made in this annual report. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing Frontier. Additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial or that are not specific to us, such as general economic conditions, may also adversely affect our business and operations. The following risk factors should be read in conjunction with the balance of this annual report, including the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this report.\n\ufeff\nRisks Related to Our Business\n\ufeff\nWe will likely face further reductions in voice customers, switched access minutes of use, long distance revenues and subsidy revenues.\n\ufeff\nWe have experienced declining voice customers, switched access minutes of use and related revenues, long distance revenues, federal and state subsidies and related revenues because of economic conditions, increasing competition, changing technology and consumer behavior (such as wireless displacement of wireline use, e-mail use, instant messaging and increasing use of VoIP), technology and regulatory constraints, and financial decisions by governmental authorities. We will likely continue to experience further reductions in the future. These factors, among others, are likely to cause our local network service, switched network access, long distance and subsidy revenues to continue to decline, and these factors may cause our cash generated by operations to decrease.\n\ufeff\nWe face intense competition.\n\ufeff\nThe communications industry is extremely competitive. Through mergers and various service expansion strategies, service providers are striving to provide integrated solutions both within and across geographic markets. Our competitors include competitive local exchange carriers, Internet service providers, wireless companies, OTT, VoIP providers and cable companies, some of which may be subject to less regulation than we are; these entities may provide services competitive with the services that we offer or intend to introduce. We also believe that wireless and cable telephony providers have increased their penetration of various services in our markets. We expect that competition will remain robust. Our revenue and cash flow will be adversely impacted if we cannot reverse our customer losses or continue to provide high-quality services.\n\ufeff\nWe cannot predict which of the many possible future technologies, products or services will be important in order to maintain our competitive position or what expenditures will be required to develop and provide these technologies, products or services. Our ability to compete successfully will depend on the effectiveness of capital expenditure investments in our properties, our marketing efforts, our ability to anticipate and respond to various competitive factors affecting the industry, including a changing regulatory environment that may affect our business and that of our competitors differently, new services that may be introduced, changes in consumer preferences, demographic trends, economic conditions and pricing strategies by competitors. Increasing competition may reduce our revenues and increase our marketing and other costs as well as require us to increase our capital expenditures and thereby decrease our cash flows.\n\ufeff\nSome of our competitors have superior resources, which may place us at a cost and price disadvantage.\n\ufeff\nSome of our competitors have market presence, engineering, technical, marketing and financial capabilities, substantially greater than ours. In addition, some of these competitors are able to raise capital at a lower cost than we are able to. Consequently, some of these competitors may be able to develop and expand their communications and network infrastructures more quickly, adapt more swiftly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, take advantage of acquisition and other opportunities more readily and devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their products and services than we will be able to. Additionally, the greater brand name recognition of some competitors may require us to price our services at lower levels in order to retain or\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nobtain customers. Finally, the cost advantages and greater financial resources of some of these competitors may give them the ability to reduce their prices for an extended period of time if they so choose. Our business and results of operations may be materially adversely impacted if we are not able to effectively compete.\n\ufeff\nWe may be unable to stabilize or grow our revenues and cash flows despite the initiatives we have implemented.\n\ufeff\nWe must produce adequate revenues and cash flows that, when combined with cash on hand and funds available under our revolving credit facility and other financings, will be sufficient to service our debt, fund our capital expenditures, pay our taxes, fund our pension and other employee benefit obligations and pay dividends pursuant to our dividend policy. We have experienced revenue declines in 2016 and 2015 as compared to prior years for our Frontier legacy operations, and our recently acquired operations have also experienced revenue declines. While we have identified potential areas of opportunity and implemented several revenue and cost initiatives, we cannot assure you that these efforts will be successful or that these initiatives will improve our financial position or our results of operations.\n\ufeff\nWeak economic conditions may decrease demand for our services or necessitate increased discounts.\n\ufeff\nWe could be adversely impacted by weak economic conditions or their effects. Downturns in the economy and competition in our markets could cause some of our customers to reduce or eliminate their purchases of our basic and enhanced voice services, broadband and video services and make it difficult for us to obtain new customers or retain existing customers. In addition, if economic conditions are depressed or further deteriorate, our customers may delay or discontinue payment for our services or seek more competitive pricing from other service providers, or we may be required to offer increased discounts in order to retain our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\n\ufeff\nDisruption in our networks, infrastructure and information technology may cause us to lose customers and/or incur additional expenses.\n\ufeff\nTo attract and retain customers, we must provide reliable service. Some of the risks to our networks, infrastructure and information technology include physical damage, security breaches, capacity limitations, power surges or outages, software defects and other disruptions beyond our control, such as natural disasters and acts of terrorism. From time to time in the ordinary course of business, we experience short disruptions in our service due to factors such as cable damage, theft of our equipment, inclement weather and service failures of our third-party service providers. We could experience more significant disruptions in the future. We could also face disruptions due to capacity limitations if changes in our customers\u2019 usage patterns for our broadband services result in a significant increase in capacity utilization, such as through increased usage of video or peer-to-peer file sharing applications. Disruptions may cause interruptions in service or reduced capacity for customers, either of which could cause us to lose customers and/or incur additional expenses, and thereby adversely affect our business, revenues and cash flows.\n\ufeff\nOur business is sensitive to the creditworthiness of our wholesale customers.\n\ufeff\nWe have substantial business relationships with other communications carriers for which we provide service. While bankruptcies of these carriers have not had a material adverse effect on our business in recent years, future bankruptcies in the industry could result in the loss of significant customers, as well as cause more price competition and an increased allowance for doubtful accounts receivable. Such bankruptcies may be more likely in the future if economic conditions stagnate. As a result, our revenues and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\n\ufeff\nA significant portion of our workforce is represented by labor unions.\n\ufeff\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 28,300 employees. Approximately 17,900 of our total employees were represented by unions and were subject to collective bargaining agreements. As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 600 employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement that expired in 2016, but have been extended and are still effective for 2017. Of the union-represented employees as of December 31, 2016, approximately 3,800, or 21%, of the unionized workforce are covered by collective agreements that expire in 2017 and approximately 3,500, or 20%, of the unionized workforce are covered by collective bargaining agreements that expire in 2018.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\ufeff\nWe cannot predict the outcome of negotiations of the collective bargaining agreements covering our employees. If we are unable to reach new agreements or renew existing agreements, employees subject to collective bargaining agreements may engage in strikes, work slowdowns or other labor actions, which could materially disrupt our ability to provide services. New labor agreements or the renewal of existing agreements may impose significant new costs on us, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in the future.\n\ufeff\nIf we are unable to hire or retain key personnel, we may be unable to operate our business successfully.\n\ufeff\nOur success will depend in part upon the continued services of our management. We cannot guarantee that our key personnel will not leave or compete with us. The loss, incapacity or unavailability for any reason of key members of our management team could have a material impact on our business. In addition, our financial results and our ability to compete will suffer if we are unable to attract, integrate or retain other qualified personnel in the future.\n\ufeff\nWe may be unable to realize the anticipated benefits of recent acquisitions.\n\ufeff\nIn recent years, we have completed multiple acquisitions. We cannot assure you that we will be able to realize the full benefit of any anticipated growth opportunities or cost synergies from such acquisitions or that these benefits will be realized within the expected time frames.\n\ufeff\nWe may complete a future significant strategic transaction that may not achieve intended results or could increase the number of our outstanding shares or amount of outstanding debt.\n\ufeff\nWe continuously evaluate and may in the future enter into additional strategic transactions. Any such transaction could happen at any time, could be material to our business and could take any number of forms, including, for example, an acquisition, merger or a sale of certain of our assets.\n\ufeff\nEvaluating potential transactions and integrating completed ones may divert the attention of our management from ordinary operating matters. The success of these potential transactions will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated growth opportunities and cost synergies through the successful integration of the businesses we acquire with our existing business. Even if we are successful in integrating acquired businesses, we cannot assure you that these integrations will result in the realization of the full benefit of any anticipated growth opportunities or cost synergies or that these benefits will be realized within the expected time frames. In addition, acquired businesses may have unanticipated liabilities or contingencies.\n\ufeff\nIf we complete an acquisition, investment or other strategic transaction, we may require additional financing that could result in an increase in the number of our outstanding shares of stock or the aggregate amount and/or cost of our debt, which may result in an adverse impact to our ratings. The number of shares of our stock or the aggregate principal amount of our debt that we may issue may be significant. Moreover, the terms of any debt financing may be expensive or adversely impact our results of operations.\n\ufeff\nNegotiations with the providers of content for our video systems may not be successful, potentially resulting in our inability to carry certain programming channels on our FiOS and Vantage video systems, which could result in the loss of subscribers. Alternatively, because of the power of some content providers, we may be forced to pay an increasing amount for some content, resulting in higher expenses and lower profitability.\n\ufeff\nWe must negotiate with the content owners of the programming that we carry on our multichannel video systems (marketed as FiOS video and Vantage video). These content owners are the exclusive provider of the channels they offer. If we are unable to reach a mutually-agreed contract with a content owner, including pricing and carriage provisions, our existing agreements to carry this content may not be renewed, resulting in the blackout of these channels. The loss of content could result in our loss of customers who place a high value on the particular content that is lost. In addition, many content providers own multiple channels. As a result, we typically have to negotiate the pricing for multiple channels rather than one, and carry and pay for content that customers do not much value, in order to have access to other content that customers value quite highly. Some of our competitors have materially larger scale than we do, and may, as a result, be better positioned than we are in such\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nnegotiations. As a result of these factors, the expense of content acquisition may continue to increase, and this could result in higher expenses and lower profitability.\n\ufeff\nRisks Related to Liquidity, Financial Resources and Capitalization\n\ufeff\nWe expect to make contributions to our pension plan in future years, the amount of which will be impacted by volatility in asset values related to Frontier\u2019s pension plan and/or changes in pension plan assumptions.\n\ufeff\nFrontier made contributions of $28 million and $62 million to its pension plan in 2016 and 2015, respectively, and we expect to continue to make contributions in future years. Volatility in our asset values, liability calculations, or returns may impact the costs of maintaining our pension plan and our future funding requirements. Any future material contribution could have a negative impact on our liquidity by reducing cash flows.\nWe currently have a significant amount of indebtedness, including secured indebtedness, and are able to incur substantial additional indebtedness and grant substantial additional liens in the future. Such debt and debt service obligations may adversely affect us.\n\ufeff\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness, which amounted to $18.2 billion outstanding at December 31, 2016, of which $2.3 billion was secured. We also have access to a $750 million secured Revolving Credit Facility, which currently is undrawn.\n\ufeff\nThe terms of our indentures and credit facilities allow us to incur substantial additional indebtedness and grant substantial additional liens in the future. In addition, these terms do not prevent us or our restricted subsidiaries from incurring various types of obligations that do not constitute \u201cindebtedness\u201d under these terms.\n\ufeff\nIf we incur any additional indebtedness that ranks equally with our senior notes and debentures, the holders of that new debt will be entitled to share ratably with holders of our senior notes and debentures in any proceeds distributed in connection with any insolvency, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution or other winding up of Frontier. If any such additional indebtedness is secured, it will be effectively senior to our unsecured senior notes and debentures to the extent of the collateral securing such indebtedness. This may have the effect of reducing the probability of payment, or the amount of proceeds paid, to holders of our senior notes and debentures.\n\ufeff\nIn addition, to the extent other new debt is added to our and our subsidiaries\u2019 current debt levels, the substantial leverage risks described below would increase.\n\ufeff\nThe potential significant negative consequences on our financial condition and results of operations that could result from our substantial debt include:\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\nlimitations on our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms or at all;\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\ninstances in which we are unable to comply with the covenants contained in our indentures and credit agreements or to generate cash sufficient to make required debt payments, which circumstances have the potential of accelerating the maturity of some or all of our outstanding indebtedness;\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\nthe allocation of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our debt, thus reducing the amount of our cash flows available for other purposes, including capital expenditures and dividends that would otherwise improve our competitive position, results of operations or stock price;\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\nrequiring us to issue debt or equity securities or to sell some of our core assets, possibly on unfavorable terms, to meet payment obligations;\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\ncompromising our flexibility to plan for, or react to, competitive challenges in our business and the telecommunications industry; and\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\nthe possibility of our being put at a competitive disadvantage with competitors who; relative to their size, do not have as much debt as we do, and competitors who may be in a more favorable position to access additional capital resources.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\ufeff\nIn addition, our senior notes and debentures are rated below \u201cinvestment grade\u201d by independent rating agencies. This can result in higher borrowing costs for us. We cannot assure you that these rating agencies will not lower our current debt ratings, if in the rating agencies\u2019 judgment such an action is appropriate. A lowering of a rating may further increase our future borrowing costs and reduce our access to capital.\n\ufeff\nThe indentures and agreements governing our debt, including our senior notes and debentures and our credit facilities, contain covenants that impose restrictions on us and certain of our subsidiaries that may affect our ability to operate our business, make payments on our debt, and pay dividends.\n\ufeff\nThe indentures and agreements governing our existing indebtedness contain covenants that, among other things, limit our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to:\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\nincur additional indebtedness, guarantee indebtedness or issue preferred stock;\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\ncreate liens;\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\nenter into mergers or consolidations, or transfer or sell all or substantially all of our assets;\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\npay dividends on, or make distributions in respect of, or redeem or repurchase, capital stock, make certain investments or make other restricted payments;\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\nmake certain asset sales;\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\nenter into agreements that might prevent certain of our subsidiaries from making distributions, loans or advances to us or other subsidiaries; and\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\nengage in transactions with affiliates.\n\ufeff\nIn addition, our credit facilities require us to comply with additional covenants, including financial ratios. Any future indebtedness may also require us to comply with similar or other covenants. These restrictions on our ability to operate our business could seriously harm our business by, among other things, limiting our ability to take advantage of financings, mergers, acquisitions and other corporate opportunities.\n\ufeff\nVarious risks, uncertainties and events beyond our control could affect our ability to comply with these covenants. Failure to comply with any of the covenants in our existing or future financing indentures and agreements could result in a default under those documents and under other agreements containing cross-default provisions. A default would permit lenders to accelerate the maturity of the debt and to foreclose upon any collateral securing the debt. Under these circumstances, we might not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of our obligations. In addition, the limitations imposed by indentures and credit agreements on our ability to incur additional debt and to take other actions might significantly impair our ability to obtain other financing.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nFrontier is primarily a holding company and, as a result, we rely on the receipt of funds from our subsidiaries in order to meet our cash needs and service our indebtedness, including our senior notes and debentures.\n\ufeff\nFrontier is primarily a holding company and its principal assets consist of the shares of capital stock or other equity instruments of its subsidiaries. As a holding company, we depend on dividends, distributions and other payments from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations, including those arising under our senior notes and debentures, and meet our cash needs. We cannot assure you that the operating results of our subsidiaries at any given time will be sufficient to make dividends, distributions or other payments to us in order to allow us to make payments on our indebtedness, including our senior notes and debentures. In addition, the payment of these dividends, distributions and other payments, as well as other transfers of assets, between our subsidiaries and from our subsidiaries to us may be subject to legal, regulatory or contractual restrictions. Some state regulators have imposed and others may consider imposing on regulated companies, including us, cash management practices that could limit the ability of such regulated companies to transfer cash between subsidiaries or to the parent company. While none of the existing state regulations materially affects our cash management, any changes to the existing regulations or imposition of new regulations or restrictions may materially adversely affect our ability to transfer cash within our consolidated companies.\n\ufeff\nOur senior notes and debentures are structurally subordinated to liabilities of our subsidiaries.\n\ufeff\nOur subsidiaries have not guaranteed our senior notes and debentures. As a result, holders of such securities will not have any claim as a creditor against our subsidiaries. Accordingly, all obligations of our subsidiaries (including any liens granted by our subsidiaries on any of their assets to secure any of our obligations) will have to be satisfied before any of the assets of such subsidiaries would be available for distribution, upon a liquidation or otherwise. Although the indentures governing our senior notes and debentures, and our credit agreements, limit the indebtedness our subsidiaries may incur, our subsidiaries are able to incur a substantial amount of additional debt. Additionally, although the indentures and credit agreements limit the liens that may be granted on the assets of our subsidiaries, our subsidiaries are able to grant liens to secure a substantial amount of liabilities, including, without limitation, certain indebtedness under our credit facilities.\n\ufeff\nOur senior notes and debentures are unsecured and subordinated to any secured indebtedness.\n\ufeff\nOur senior notes and debentures are unsecured and therefore are subordinated to our existing and future secured indebtedness, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. At December 31, 2016, our secured indebtedness consisted of obligations under the 2015 Credit Agreement, the CoBank Credit Agreements, the Revolving Credit Agreement and the Continuing Agreement for Standby Letters of Credit dated February 4, 2008 between Frontier and Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch, each of which is secured equally and ratably by a pledge of all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Frontier North Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary. In the event of a bankruptcy or similar proceeding, the assets that serve as collateral for our secured indebtedness will be available to satisfy the obligations under the secured indebtedness before any payments are made on the senior notes and debentures from the proceeds of such assets. The indentures governing our senior notes and debentures permit us, subject to specified limitations, to incur a substantial amount of additional secured debt.\n\ufeff\nIf the senior notes issued in September 2015 are rated investment grade by at least two of Moody\u2019s, S&P or Fitch, many of the covenants will not apply and the holders of the notes will lose the protection of the covenants.\n\ufeff\nEach of the supplemental indentures governing our senior notes issued in September 2015 contain certain covenants that will be suspended during any period in which such series of notes are rated investment grade by at least two of Moody\u2019s, S&P or Fitch and no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing. Such covenants limit, among other things, our ability to pay distributions, incur debt and enter into certain other transactions. There can be no assurance that any series of notes will ever be rated investment grade, or that if they are rated investment grade, that the series of notes will maintain these ratings. To the extent the covenants are subsequently reinstated, any such actions taken while the covenants were suspended would not result in an event of default under the supplemental indentures governing the applicable series of notes.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\ufeff\nOur variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase.\n\ufeff\nAt December 31, 2016, approximately 12% of our total debt is subject to variable rates of interest. Borrowings under our credit facilities are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates were to increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, would correspondingly decrease. In the future, we may enter into interest rate swaps that involve the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments in order to reduce interest rate volatility. However, we might not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our variable rate indebtedness, and any swaps we enter into might not fully mitigate our interest rate risk.\n\ufeff\nWe may not have sufficient funds to repurchase our senior notes upon a change of control triggering event.\n\ufeff\nThe terms of our senior notes require us to make an offer to repurchase the notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control and Ratings Decline (as defined in the indentures governing the notes) at a purchase price equal to 101% of the respective principal amounts of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the date of the purchase. It is possible that we would not have sufficient funds at the time of such a change of control triggering event to make the required repurchase of the applicable series of notes and would be required to obtain third party financing to do so. We may not be able to obtain this financing on commercially reasonable terms, or on terms acceptable to us, or at all. In addition, the occurrence of certain change of control events may constitute an event of default under the terms of our credit facilities. Such an event of default would entitle the lenders under our credit facilities to, among other things, cause all outstanding debt thereunder to become due and payable.\n\ufeff\nWe cannot assure that we will be able to continue paying dividends.\n\ufeff\nThe amount and timing of future dividend payments is subject to applicable law and will be made at the discretion of our Board of Directors based on factors such as cash flow and cash requirements, capital expenditure requirements, financial condition and other factors.\nOur ability to declare and pay dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock may be limited.\nOur declaration and payment of dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock in the future will be determined by our Board of Directors in its sole discretion and will depend on business conditions, our financial condition, earnings and liquidity and other factors. Our ability to declare and pay dividends and make other distributions with respect to our capital stock, including the Series A Preferred Stock, is restricted by the terms of certain of our existing financing arrangements and may be restricted by the terms of financing arrangements that we enter into in the future. In the event that the agreements governing any such indebtedness restrict our ability to declare and pay dividends in cash on the shares of Series A Preferred Stock, we may be unable to declare and pay dividends in cash on the shares of Series A Preferred Stock unless we can repay or refinance the amounts outstanding under such agreements.\nIn addition, under Delaware law, our Board of Directors may only declare and pay dividends on shares of our capital stock out of our statutory \u201csurplus\u201d (which is the amount equal to total assets minus total liabilities, in each case at fair market value, minus statutory capital), or if there is no such surplus, out of our net profits for the then current and/or immediately preceding fiscal year. Further, even if we are permitted under our contractual obligations and Delaware law to declare and pay cash dividends on the shares of Series A Preferred Stock, we may not have sufficient cash to do so through the mandatory conversion date of June 29, 2018.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe have a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets on our balance sheet. If our goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a non-cash charge to earnings and reduce our stockholders\u2019 equity.\n\ufeff\nUnder generally accepted accounting principles, intangible assets are reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. Frontier monitors relevant circumstances, including general economic conditions, enterprise value EBITDA multiples for other providers of communications services, our overall financial performance, and the market prices for our stock, and the potential impact that changes in such circumstances might have on the valuation of Frontier\u2019s goodwill or other intangible assets. If our goodwill or other intangible assets are determined to be impaired in the future, we may be required to record a non-cash charge to earnings during the period in which the impairment is determined, which would reduce our stockholders\u2019 equity.\n\ufeff\nRisks Related to Regulation\n\ufeff\nChanges in federal or state regulations may reduce the switched access charge revenues we receive.\n\ufeff\nA portion of Frontier\u2019s total revenues ($170 million, or 2%, in 2016 and $177 million, or 3%, in 2015) are derived from switched access charges paid by other carriers for services we provide in originating and terminating intrastate and interstate long distance traffic. Frontier expects a portion of our revenues will continue to be derived from switched access charges paid by these carriers for these services. The amount of switched access charge revenues that Frontier will receive for these services is regulated by the FCC and state regulatory agencies and the rate Frontier can charge for terminating switched access is expected to decline in 2017.\n\ufeff\nIn 2011, the FCC adopted the 2011 Order regarding Intercarrier Compensation, which is the payment framework that governs how carriers compensate each other for the exchange of interstate traffic. The 2011 Order began a multi-year transition that moves the rate for terminating traffic to near zero by 2017. Frontier is permitted to recover a significant portion of those revenues through end user rates and other replacement support mechanisms. Additionally, the 2011 Order requires VoIP providers to pay interstate terminating interconnection charges and requires all carriers terminating traffic to provide appropriate call information, thus prohibiting so-called \u201cphantom traffic.\u201d The reform of the Universal Service Fund shifts the existing High-Cost portion of the fund from supporting voice services to supporting broadband deployment in high-cost areas. The 2011 Order preempts the states with regard to the regulation of intrastate terminating access rates. The 2011 Order has been challenged in court and the FCC was petitioned to reconsider various aspects of it. The only issue that remains active on appeal is the ability of competitive carriers to assess VoIP access charges.\n\ufeff\nThe FCC also has an ongoing proceeding considering whether to make changes to its regulatory regime governing special access services. When and how these proposed changes will be addressed is unknown and, accordingly, we cannot predict the impact of future changes on our results of operations.\n\ufeff\nCertain states also have their own open proceedings to address reform to intrastate access charges and other intercarrier compensation and state universal service funds. Although the FCC has pre-empted state jurisdiction on most access charges, many states could consider moving forward with their proceedings. We cannot predict when or how these matters will be decided or the effect on our subsidy or switched access revenues. However, future reductions in our subsidy or switched access revenues may directly affect our profitability and cash flows as those regulatory revenues do not have an equal level of associated variable expenses.\n\ufeff\nWe are reliant on support funds provided under federal and state laws.\n\ufeff\nA portion of Frontier\u2019s total revenues ($626 million, or 7%, in 2016 and $500 million, or 9%, in 2015) are derived from federal and state subsidies for rural and high-cost support, commonly referred to as USF. The FCC\u2019s 2011 Order changed how federal subsidies are calculated and disbursed, with these changes being phased-in beginning in July 2012. These changes transition the USF, which supports voice services in high-cost areas, to the CAF, which supports broadband deployment in high-cost areas.\n\ufeff\nFuture reductions in these subsidies, or in our ability to recover such fees, could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nFrontier and our industry will likely remain highly regulated, and we could incur substantial compliance costs that could constrain our ability to compete in our target markets.\n\ufeff\nAs an incumbent local exchange carrier, some of the services we offer are subject to significant regulation from federal, state and local authorities. This regulation could impact our ability to change our rates, especially on our basic voice services and our access rates, and could impose substantial compliance costs on us. Regulation could constrain our ability to compete and, in some jurisdictions, may restrict our ability to expand our service offerings. In addition, changes to the regulations that govern our business (including any implementation of the 2011 Order or the 2015 Order) may have an adverse effect on our business by reducing the allowable fees that we may charge, imposing additional compliance costs, reducing the amount of subsidies or otherwise changing the nature of our operations and the competition in our industry. At this time it is unknown how these regulations will affect Frontier\u2019s operations or ability to compete in the future. This and other FCC rulemakings and state regulatory proceedings, including those relating to intercarrier compensation, universal service and broadband services, could have a substantial adverse impact on our operations.\n\ufeff\nIn addition, on June 14, 2016, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit upheld the FCC\u2019s February 26, 2015 order that changed the regulatory classification of broadband service from an \u201cinformation service\u201d to a \u201ctelecommunications service\u201d. In the Order, the FCC adopted specific obligations for fixed-mobile providers of broadband Internet access services and specifically prohibited the following: blocking access to legal content, applications, services, or non-harmful devices; impairing or degrading lawful Internet traffic on the basis of content, applications, services, or non-harmful devices; favoring some lawful Internet traffic over other lawful Internet traffic in exchange for consideration; and otherwise unreasonably harming consumers or edge providers, and announced additional transparency requirements intended to provide consumers more information about a providers network management practices, performance, speed and data caps.\n\ufeff\nOur Internet access offerings could become subject to additional laws and regulations as they are adopted or applied to the Internet. As the significance of the Internet expands, federal, state and local governments may pass laws and adopt rules and regulations, or apply existing laws and regulations to the Internet (including Internet access services), and related matters are under consideration in both federal and state legislative and regulatory bodies. We cannot predict whether the outcome of pending challenges to the FCC\u2019s order or future proceedings will prove beneficial or detrimental to our competitive position.\n\ufeff\nRisks Related to Technology\n\ufeff\nWe may be unable to meet the technological needs or expectations of our customers, and may lose customers as a result.\n\ufeff\nThe telecommunications industry is subject to significant changes in technology, and replacing or upgrading our infrastructure to keep pace with such technological changes could result in significant capital expenditures. If we do not replace or upgrade technology and equipment as necessary, we may be unable to compete effectively because we will not be able to meet the needs or expectations of our customers.\n\ufeff\nIn addition, enhancements to product offerings and the management of broadband speed and capacity issues may influence our customers to consider other service providers, such as cable operators or wireless providers. We may be unable to attract new or retain existing customers from cable companies due to their deployment of enhanced broadband and VoIP technology. In addition, new capacity services for wireless broadband technologies may permit our competitors to offer broadband data services to our customers throughout most or all of our service areas. Any resulting inability to attract new or retain existing customers could adversely impact our business and results of operations in a material manner.\n\ufeff\nOur services could be adversely affected and we may be subject to increased costs and claims in connection with Internet and systems security and malicious practices.\n\ufeff\nWe use encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties to provide secure transmission of confidential information, including our business data and customer information. We also rely on employees in our network operations centers, data centers, call centers and retail stores to follow our procedures when handling such information. Any unauthorized access, computer viruses, accidental or intentional release of confidential information or other disruptions could result in increased costs, customer dissatisfaction leading to loss of customers and revenues, and fines and other liabilities.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nIn addition, Frontier or Frontier\u2019s customers using our network to access the Internet may become victim to malicious and abusive Internet activities, including unsolicited mass advertising (\u201cspam\u201d), peer-to-peer file sharing, distribution of viruses, worms and other destructive or disruptive software. These activities could adversely affect our network, result in excessive call volume at our call centers and damage our or our customers\u2019 equipment and data.\n\ufeff\nFrontier maintains security measures, disaster recovery plans and business continuity plans for its business. However, Frontier\u2019s information technology networks and infrastructure may nonetheless be vulnerable to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to attack by hackers or breaches, employee error or malfeasance, power outages, computer viruses, telecommunication or utility failures, systems failures, natural disasters or other catastrophic events. Any such events could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or penalties, disruption in operations, misappropriation of sensitive data, damage to Frontier\u2019s reputation and costly response measures, which could adversely affect Frontier\u2019s business. There can be no assurance that such disruptions or misappropriations and the resulting repercussions will not be material to our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES", "PERMNO": 23887, "SIC": 4813, "TIC": "FTRCQ"}
