{"cik": "278166", "company": "CAVCO INDUSTRIES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-06-21", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur business involves a number of risks and uncertainties. You should carefully consider the following risks, together with the information provided elsewhere in this Annual Report. The items described below are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks that are currently unknown to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial may also impair our business or adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe operate in an industry that is currently experiencing a prolonged and significant downturn\nSince mid-1999, the manufactured housing industry has experienced a prolonged and significant downturn. This downturn has resulted in part from the fact that, beginning in 1999, consumer lenders in the sector began to tighten underwriting standards and curtail credit availability in response to higher than anticipated rates of loan defaults and significant losses upon the repossession and resale of the manufactured homes securing defaulted loans. From 2004 to 2007, the industry\u2019s downturn was exacerbated by the aggressive financing methods available to customers of developers and marketers of site-built homes, which had the effect of diverting potential manufactured housing buyers to more expensive site-built homes. Since 2008, the global credit crisis and general deterioration of economic conditions have extended the depressed market conditions in which our industry operates. These factors have resulted in reduced wholesale shipments and excess manufacturing and retail locations.\nAs a result of the foregoing factors, and based on industry data as of the end of 2015, the number of active industry manufacturing facilities was 121, a decrease of 202 plants since 1999, representing a 63% reduction. The availability of consumer financing for the purchase of manufactured homes continues to be constrained. If current industry conditions continue or get materially worse, we may be required to take steps in an attempt to mitigate the effect of unfavorable industry conditions, such as the closure of facilities or consolidation of existing operations. These steps could impair our ability to conduct our business in a manner consistent with past practice and could make it more difficult for us to expand our operations if and when industry conditions improve. Furthermore, some of these steps could lead to fixed asset, goodwill or other impairment charges.\nWe may not be able to successfully integrate past acquisitions, including the recent acquisitions of Fairmont Homes and Chariot Eagle, or any future acquisition to attain the anticipated benefits. Past acquisitions may adversely impact the Company\u2019s liquidity\nWe completed the acquisition of certain manufactured housing assets and liabilities of Fleetwood in fiscal year 2010 and of Palm Harbor in fiscal year 2012. Also in fiscal year 2012, we purchased all of the outstanding shares of CountryPlace and Standard Casualty.\nOn March 30, 2015, we completed the purchase of the business and operating assets of Chariot Eagle, Inc., a Florida based manufacturer of park model RVs and manufactured homes. On May 1, 2015, Cavco acquired certain assets and liabilities of Fairmont Homes. Fairmont Homes is a builder of manufactured and modular homes and park model RVs with manufacturing plants in Indiana and Minnesota.\nWe may consider other strategic acquisitions if such opportunities arise. The Fleetwood, Palm Harbor, Chariot Eagle and Fairmont Homes transactions, and other acquisitions that we may consider in the future, involve a number of risks, including the diversion of our management\u2019s attention from our existing business for those transactions that we complete, or possible adverse effects on our operating results during the integration process and on our liquidity. In addition, we may not be able to successfully or profitably integrate, operate, maintain and manage the operations or employees of Fairmont Homes and Chariot Eagle or potential future acquisitions. We also may not be able to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies, which may lead to financial losses.\nOur involvement in vertically integrated lines of business, including manufactured housing consumer finance, commercial finance and insurance, exposes the Company to certain risks\nCountryPlace offers conforming mortgages, non-conforming mortgages, and chattel loans to purchasers of factory-built homes sold by Company-owned retail sales centers and independent retailers, builders, communities and developers. CountryPlace is an approved seller/servicer with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, is approved by HUD to originate FHA-insured mortgages under its Direct Endorsement program, and is approved to issue Ginnie Mae mortgage-backed securities. Most loans originated through CountryPlace are sold to investors. CountryPlace also provides various loan servicing functions for non-affiliated entities under contract.\nIf CountryPlace\u2019s customers are unable to repay their loans, CountryPlace may be adversely affected. CountryPlace makes loans to borrowers that it believes are creditworthy based on its underwriting guidelines. However, the ability of these customers to repay their loans may be affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to: national, regional and local economic conditions; changes or continued weakness in specific industry segments; natural hazard risks affecting the region in which the borrower resides; and employment, financial or life circumstances.\nIf customers do not repay their loans, CountryPlace may repossess or foreclose on the secured property in order to liquidate its loan collateral and minimize losses. The homes and land securing the loans are subject to fluctuating market values, and proceeds realized from liquidating repossessed or foreclosed property are highly susceptible to adverse movements in collateral values. Home price depreciation and elevated levels of unemployment may result in additional defaults and exacerbate actual loss severities upon collateral liquidation beyond those normally experienced by CountryPlace.\nSome of the loans CountryPlace has originated or may originate in the future may not have a liquid market, or the market may contract rapidly and the loans may become illiquid. Although CountryPlace offers loan products and prices its loans at levels that it believes are marketable at the time of credit application approval, market conditions for mortgage-related loans may deteriorate rapidly and significantly. CountryPlace\u2019s ability to respond to changing market conditions is bound by credit approval and funding commitments it makes in advance of loan completion. In this environment, it is difficult to predict the types of loan products and characteristics that may be susceptible to future market curtailments and tailor our loan offerings accordingly. As a result, no assurances can be given that the market value of our loans will not decline in the future, or that a market will continue to exist for loan products.\nCountryPlace sells loans through GSE-related programs and whole-loan purchasers. In connection with these activities, CountryPlace provides to the GSEs and whole-loan purchasers representations and warranties related to the loans sold. These representations and warranties generally relate to the ownership of the loans, the validity of the liens securing the loans, the loans' compliance with the criteria for inclusion in the sale transactions, including compliance with underwriting standards or loan criteria established by buyers and CountryPlace\u2019s ability to deliver documentation in compliance with applicable laws. Generally, representations and warranties may be enforced at any time over the life of the loan. Upon a breach of a representation, CountryPlace may be required to repurchase the loan or to indemnify a party for incurred losses. Repurchase demands and claims for indemnification payments are reviewed on a loan-by-loan basis to validate if there has been a breach requiring repurchase or indemnification. CountryPlace manages the risk of repurchase through underwriting and quality assurance practices and by servicing the mortgage loans to investor standards. CountryPlace maintains a reserve for these contingent repurchase and indemnification obligations.\nStandard Casualty and Standard Insurance Agency specialize in the manufactured housing industry, primarily serving the Texas, Arizona, New Mexico and Georgia markets. In Texas, the policies are written through one affiliated managing general agent, which produces all premiums, except surety, through local agents, most of which are manufactured home retailers. All insurance policies outside the state of Texas are written on a direct basis through local agents. Property and casualty insurance companies are subject to certain risk-based capital requirements as specified by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. Under those requirements, the amount of capital and surplus maintained by a property and casualty insurance company is determined based on its various risk factors.\nCertain of Standard Casualty\u2019s premiums and benefits are assumed from and ceded to other insurance companies under various reinsurance agreements. The ceded reinsurance agreements provide Standard Casualty with increased capacity to write larger risks. Standard Casualty remains obligated for amounts ceded in the event that the reinsurers do not meet their obligations. Substantially all of Standard Casualty\u2019s assumed reinsurance is with one entity. Further, Standard Casualty\u2019s policies in force may be subject to numerous risks including geographic concentration, adverse selection, home deterioration, unusual weather events, and regulation. Although claim amounts are recoverable by Standard Casualty through reinsurance for catastrophic losses up to policy maximums, significant losses may be realized and our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nTightened credit standards, curtailed lending activity by home-only lenders and increased government lending regulations have contributed to a constrained consumer financing market\nConsumers who buy our manufactured homes have historically secured retail financing from third-party lenders. Home-only financing is at times more difficult to obtain than financing for site-built homes. The availability, terms and costs of retail financing depend on the lending practices of financial institutions, governmental policies and economic and other conditions, all of which are beyond our control.\nSince 1999, home-only lenders have tightened the credit underwriting standards for loans to purchase manufactured homes, which has reduced lending volumes and negatively impacted our revenue. Most of the national lenders who have historically provided home-only loans have exited the manufactured housing sector of the home loan industry. In 2002, Conseco, historically one of the largest originators of home-only loans in the manufactured housing industry, filed for bankruptcy protection and ceased its lending activities. In 2004, JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A., the lender with the largest loan origination volume in the home-only financing market at that time, announced it was ceasing its manufactured housing lending activities. In 2008, Origen Financial, Inc. announced that it was suspending originations of manufactured home loans as a result of unfavorable conditions in the secondary market for its loans. Another major lender, 21st Mortgage Corporation, citing unreliable and inadequate sources of funding, announced in 2009 that it was significantly curtailing its retail lending program. Remaining retail lenders have tightened their loan underwriting standards. In 2014, U.S. Bank announced that they would exit the indirect manufactured housing lending business, requiring consumers to apply through their normal mortgage lending programs. Retail sales of manufactured housing could be adversely affected if remaining retail lenders curtail industry lending activities or exit the industry altogether.\nChanges in laws or other events that adversely affect liquidity in the secondary mortgage market could hurt our business. The GSEs and the FHA play significant roles in insuring or purchasing home mortgages and creating or insuring investment securities that are either sold to investors or held in their portfolios. These organizations provide significant liquidity to the secondary market. Any new federal laws or regulations that restrict or curtail their activities, or any other events or conditions that alter the roles of these organizations in the housing finance market could affect the ability of our customers to obtain mortgage loans or could increase mortgage interest rates, fees, and credit standards, which could reduce demand for our homes and/or the loans that we originate and adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act was passed into law. The Dodd-Frank Act is a sweeping piece of legislation, and the financial services industry continues to assess its implications and implement necessary changes in procedures and business practices. The Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB to regulate consumer financial products and services. Although Congress detailed some significant changes, and many new rules have been implemented, the full impact remains unknown and may not be fully known for years as the development of additional rules continue, and Congress considers amending part of the Act. Enforcement actions are in the early stages and the effects of possible litigation related to the regulations remains unknown.\nIn 2014, certain CFPB mortgage finance rules required under the Dodd-Frank Act became effective. The rules apply to consumer credit transactions secured by a dwelling, which include real property mortgages and chattel loans (financed without land) secured by manufactured homes. The rules defined standards for origination of \"Qualified Mortgages,\" established specific requirements for lenders to prove borrowers' ability to repay loans and outlined the conditions under which Qualified Mortgages are subject to safe harbor limitations on liability to borrowers. The rules also established interest rates and other cost parameters for determining which Qualified Mortgages fall under safe harbor protection. Among other issues, Qualified Mortgages with interest rates and other costs outside the limits are deemed \"rebuttable\" by borrowers and expose the lender and its assignees (including investors in loans, pools of loans, and instruments secured by loans or loan pools) to possible litigation and penalties.\nWhile many manufactured homes are currently financed with agency-conforming mortgages in which the ability to repay is verified, and interest rates and other costs are within the safe harbor limits established under the CFPB mortgage finance rules, certain loans to finance the purchase of manufactured homes, especially chattel loans and non-conforming land-home loans, may fall outside the safe harbor limits. The rules have caused some lenders to curtail underwriting such loans, and some investors are reluctant to own or participate in owning such loans because of the uncertainty of potential litigation and other costs. If so, some prospective buyers of manufactured homes may be unable to secure the financing necessary to complete purchases. In addition, compliance with the law and ongoing rule implementation has caused lenders to incur additional costs to implement new processes, procedures, controls and infrastructure required to comply with the regulations. Compliance may constrain lenders' ability to profitably price certain loans. Failure to comply with these regulations, changes in these or other regulations, or the imposition of additional regulations, could affect our earnings, limit our access to capital and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nThe CFPB rules amending the TILA and RESPA expand the types of mortgage loans that are subject to the protections of the HOEPA, revise and expand the tests for coverage under HOEPA, and impose additional restrictions on mortgages that are covered by HOEPA. As a result, certain manufactured home loans are now subject to HOEPA limits on interest rates and fees. Loans with rates or fees in excess of the limits are deemed High Cost Mortgages and provide additional protections for borrowers, including with respect to determining the value of the home. Most loans for the purchase of manufactured homes have been written at rates and fees that would not appear to be considered High Cost Mortgages under the new rule. Although some lenders may continue to offer loans that are now deemed High Cost Mortgages, the rate and fee limits appear to have deterred some lenders from offering loans to certain borrowers or may cause them to be reluctant to enter into loans subject to the provisions of HOEPA. As a result, some prospective buyers of manufactured homes may be unable to secure financing necessary to complete manufactured home purchases.\nThe availability of wholesale financing for industry retailers is limited due to a reduced number of floor plan lenders and reduced lending limits\nManufactured housing retailers generally finance their inventory purchases with wholesale floor plan financing provided by lending institutions. The availability of wholesale financing is significantly affected by the number of floor plan lenders and their lending limits. Since 1999, a substantial number of wholesale lenders have exited the industry or curtailed their floor plan operations. Conseco, historically the largest floor plan lender, previously providing about 25% of the industry's wholesale financing, discontinued approving and funding new floor plan loan requests in 2002 and later filed for bankruptcy protection. With Conseco's exit, Deutsche Financial Services was the largest remaining floor plan lender, providing approximately 20% of the industry's wholesale financing. Deutsche Financial Services discontinued approving and funding new floor plan loan requests in November 2002 and proceeded to liquidate its existing floor plan receivables. Textron Financial Corporation and GE Commercial Distribution Finance subsequently exited the business. As a result, the Company\u2019s independent retailers have relied primarily on 21st Mortgage Corporation and smaller national and regional lending institutions that have specialized in providing wholesale floor plan financing to manufactured housing retailers. Floor plan financing providers could further reduce their levels of floor plan lending. Reduced availability of floor plan lending negatively affects the inventory levels of our independent retailers, the number of retail sales center locations and related wholesale demand, and adversely affects the availability of and access to capital on an ongoing basis.\nOur participation in certain financing programs for the purchase of our products by industry distributors and consumers may expose us to additional risk of credit loss, which could adversely impact the Company\u2019s liquidity and results of operations\nWe are exposed to risks associated with the creditworthiness of certain independent retailers, builders, developers, community owners, inventory financing partners and home buyers, many of whom may be adversely affected by the volatile conditions in the economy and financial markets. These conditions could result in financial instability or other adverse effects. The consequences of such adverse effects could include delinquencies by customers who purchase our product under special financing initiatives, and deterioration of collateral values. In addition, we may incur losses if our collateral cannot be recovered or liquidated at prices sufficient to recover recorded commercial loan notes receivable balances. The realization of any of these factors may adversely affect our cash flow, profitability and financial condition.\nOur results of operations could be adversely affected by significant warranty and construction defect claims on factory-built housing\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we are subject to home warranty and construction defect claims. We record a reserve for estimated future warranty costs relating to homes sold, based upon our assessment of historical experience factors. Construction defect claims may arise during a significant period of time after product completion. Although we maintain general liability insurance and reserves for such claims, based on our assessments, which to date have been adequate, there can be no assurance that warranty and construction defect claims will remain at current levels or that such reserves will continue to be adequate. A large number of warranty and construction defect claims exceeding our current levels could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe have contingent repurchase obligations related to wholesale financing provided to industry retailers\nIn accordance with customary business practice in the manufactured housing industry, we have entered into repurchase agreements with various financial institutions and other credit sources who provide floor plan financing to industry retailers, which provide that we will be obligated, under certain circumstances, to repurchase homes sold to retailers in the event of a default by a retailer in its obligation to such credit sources. Under these agreements, we have agreed to repurchase homes at declining prices over the term of the agreement (which in most cases is 18 to 36 months). The maximum amount of our contingent obligations under such repurchase agreements was approximately $46.6 million as of April 2, 2016, without reduction for the resale value of the homes. We may be required to honor contingent repurchase obligations in the future and may incur additional expense as a consequence of these repurchase agreements.\nOur operating results could be affected by market forces and declining housing demand\nAs a participant in the homebuilding industry, we are subject to market forces beyond our control. These market forces include employment levels, employment growth, interest rates, consumer confidence, land availability and development costs, apartment and rental housing vacancy levels, inflation, deflation and the health of the general economy. Unfavorable changes in any of the above factors or other issues could have an adverse effect on our revenue and earnings.\nWe have incurred net losses in certain prior periods and there can be no assurance that we will generate income in the future\nSince becoming a stand-alone public company, we have generated net income each complete fiscal year, except for fiscal year 2010, in which we incurred net losses attributable in substantial part to the downturn affecting the manufactured housing industry, which is discussed in detail above. The likelihood that we will generate net income in the future must be considered in light of the difficulties facing the manufactured housing industry as a whole, economic conditions, the competitive environment in which we operate and the other risks and uncertainties discussed in this section of the Annual Report. There can be no assurance that we will generate net income in the future.\nA write-off of all or part of our goodwill could adversely affect our operating results and net worth\nAs of April 2, 2016, 13% of our total assets consisted of goodwill, all of which is attributable to our factory-built housing operations. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (\"ASC 350\"), we test goodwill annually for impairment by reporting unit by first making a qualitative assessment and, if necessary, performing the two-step test and recording an impairment charge if the implied fair value of a reporting unit, including goodwill, is less than its carrying value. If goodwill has become impaired, we charge the impairment as an expense in the period in which the impairment occurred. See Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies\" and Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our goodwill could be impaired if developments affecting our manufacturing operations or the markets in which we produce manufactured homes lead us to conclude that the cash flows we expect to derive from our manufacturing operations will be substantially reduced. A write off of all or part of our goodwill could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe cyclical and seasonal nature of the manufactured housing industry causes our revenues and operating results to fluctuate, and we expect this cyclicality and seasonality to continue in the future\nThe manufactured housing industry is highly cyclical and seasonal and is influenced by many national and regional economic and demographic factors, including the availability of consumer financing for home buyers, the availability of wholesale financing for retailers, seasonality of demand, consumer confidence, interest rates, demographic and employment trends, income levels, housing demand, general economic conditions, including inflation and recessions, and the availability of suitable home sites.\nAs a result of the foregoing economic, demographic and other factors, our revenues and operating results fluctuate, and we expect them to continue to fluctuate in the future. Moreover, we have experienced and could again experience operating losses during cyclical downturns in the manufactured housing market.\nOur liquidity and ability to raise capital may be limited\nWe may need to obtain debt or additional equity financing in the future. The type, timing and terms of the financing selected by us will depend on, among other things, our cash needs, the availability of other financing sources and prevailing conditions in the financial markets. There can be no assurance that any of these sources will be available to us at any time or that they will be available on satisfactory terms.\nThe manufactured housing industry is highly competitive, and increased competition may result in lower revenue\nThe manufactured housing industry is highly competitive. Competition at both the manufacturing and retail levels is based upon several factors, including price, product features, reputation for service and quality, merchandising, terms of retailer promotional programs and the terms of retail customer financing. Numerous companies produce manufactured homes in our markets. In addition, our homes compete with repossessed homes that are offered for sale in our markets. Certain of our manufacturing competitors also have their own retail distribution systems and consumer finance and insurance operations. In addition, there are many independent manufactured housing retail locations in most areas where we have retail operations. We believe that where wholesale floor plan financing is available, it is relatively easy for new retailers to enter into our markets as competitors. In addition, our products compete with other forms of low- to moderate-cost housing, including new and existing site-built homes, apartments, townhouses and condominiums. If we are unable to compete effectively in this environment, our factory-built housing revenue could be reduced.\nIf we are unable to establish or maintain relationships with independent distributors who sell our homes, our revenue could decline\nDuring fiscal year 2016, approximately 81% of our wholesale sales of manufactured homes were to independent distributors. As is common in the industry, independent distributors may also sell homes produced by competing manufacturers. We may not be able to establish relationships with new independent distributors or maintain good relationships with independent distributors that sell our homes. Even if we do establish and maintain relationships with independent distributors, these distributors are not obligated to sell our homes exclusively and may choose to sell our competitors' homes instead. The independent distributors with whom we have relationships can cancel these relationships on short notice. In addition, these distributors may not remain financially solvent, as they are subject to industry, economic, demographic and seasonal trends similar to those faced by us. If we do not establish and maintain relationships with solvent independent distributors in one or more of our markets, revenue in those markets could decline.\nOur business and operations are concentrated in certain geographic regions, which could be impacted by market declines\nOur operations are concentrated in certain states, most notably Texas, California, Florida, Arizona, Oregon and Kentucky. Due to the concentrated nature of our operations, there could be instances where these regions are negatively impacted by economic, natural or population changes that could, in turn, negatively impact the results of the business, more than other companies that are more geographically dispersed.\nThe Company operates 19 homebuilding facilities located in the Pacific, Mountain, Midwest, South Central and South Atlantic regions. We have a significant presence in Texas with factories in the cities of Austin, Ft. Worth, Seguin and Waco. Further, of our 45 company-owned sales centers, 32 are located in Texas.\nLoan contracts secured by collateral that is geographically concentrated could experience higher rates of delinquencies, default and foreclosure losses than loan contracts secured by collateral that is more geographically dispersed. CountryPlace has loan contracts secured by factory-built homes located in 29 states, including Texas, Florida, New Mexico, Arizona and Alabama.\nStandard Casualty and Standard Insurance Agency specialize in the manufactured housing industry, primarily serving the Texas, Arizona, New Mexico and Georgia markets.\nA decline in the economic conditions in Texas, California, Florida, Arizona Oregon and/or Kentucky could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur results of operations can be adversely affected by labor shortages and the pricing and availability of raw materials\nThe homebuilding industry has from time to time experienced labor shortages and other labor related issues. A number of factors may adversely affect the labor force available to us and our subcontractors in one or more of our markets including high employment levels, construction market conditions and government regulation, which include laws and regulations related to workers\u2019 health and safety, wage and hour practices and immigration. An overall labor shortage or a lack of skilled or unskilled labor could cause significant increases in costs or delays in construction of homes, which could have a material adverse effect upon our revenue and results of operations.\nOur results of operations can be affected by the pricing and availability of raw materials. Although we attempt to increase the sales prices of our homes in response to higher materials costs, such increases may lag behind the escalation of materials costs. Sudden increases in price and lack of availability of raw materials can be caused by natural disaster or other market forces, as has occurred in recent years. Although we have not experienced any production halts, severe or prolonged shortages of some of our most important building materials, which include wood and wood products, gypsum wallboard, steel, insulation, and other petroleum-based products, have occurred. There can be no assurance that sufficient supplies of these and other raw materials will continue to be available to us.\nIf the manufactured housing industry is not able to secure favorable local zoning ordinances, our revenue could decline and our business could be adversely affected\nManufactured housing communities and individual home placements are subject to local zoning ordinances and other local regulations relating to utility service and construction of roadways. In the past, property owners often have resisted the adoption of zoning ordinances permitting the location of manufactured homes in residential areas, which we believe has restricted the growth of the industry. Manufactured homes may not achieve widespread acceptance and localities may not adopt zoning ordinances permitting the development of manufactured home communities. If the manufactured housing industry is unable to secure favorable local zoning ordinances, our revenue could decline and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nThe loss of any of our executive officers could reduce our ability to execute our business strategy and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations\nWe are dependent to a significant extent upon the efforts of our executive officers. The loss of the services of one or more of our executive officers could impair our ability to execute our business strategy and have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition and results of operations. We currently have no key person life or other insurance for our executive officers.\nCertain provisions of our organizational documents could delay or make more difficult a change in control of our Company\nCertain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws could delay or make more difficult transactions involving a change of control of our Company, and may have the effect of entrenching our current management or possibly depressing the market price of our common stock. For example, our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws authorize blank series preferred stock, establish a staggered board of directors and impose certain procedural and other requirements for stockholder proposals. Furthermore, the fact that income taxes could be imposed as a result of ownership changes occurring in conjunction with a distribution may have the effect of delaying or making more difficult certain transactions involving a change of control of our Company.\nVolatility of stock price\nThe price of our common stock may fluctuate widely, depending upon a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include: the perceived prospects of our business and the manufactured housing industry as a whole; differences between our actual financial and operating results and those expected by investors and analysts; changes in analysts' recommendations or projections; changes affecting the availability of financing in the wholesale and consumer lending markets; actions or announcements by competitors; changes in the regulatory environment in which we operate; significant sales of shares by a principal stockholder; actions taken by stockholders that may be contrary to Board of Director recommendations; and changes in general economic or market conditions. In addition, stock markets generally experience significant price and volume volatility from time to time which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock for reasons unrelated to our performance.\nDeterioration in economic conditions and turmoil in financial markets could reduce our earnings and financial condition\nDeterioration in regional or global economic conditions and turmoil in financial markets could have a negative impact on our business. Among other things, unfavorable changes in employment levels, job growth, consumer confidence and income, inflation, deflation, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates may further reduce demand for our products, which could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Unprecedented contraction in the credit markets and the financial services industry have occurred in recent years, characterized by the bankruptcy, failure or consolidation of various financial institutions and extraordinary intervention from the federal government. These factors could have an adverse effect on the availability of financing to our customers, causing our revenues to decline.\nThe cost of operations could be adversely impacted by increased costs of healthcare benefits provided to employees\nIn 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the \"Health Reform Law\"), was passed into law. As enacted, the Health Reform Law reforms, among other things, certain aspects of health insurance. The Health Reform Law could increase our healthcare costs, adversely impacting the Company\u2019s earnings.\nA prolonged delay by Congress and the President to approve budgets or continuing appropriation resolutions to facilitate the operations of the federal government could delay the completion of home sales and/or cause cancellations, and thereby negatively impact our deliveries and revenues\nCongress and the President may not timely approve budgets or appropriation legislation to facilitate the operations of the federal government. As a result, many federal agencies have historically and may again cease or curtail some activities. The affected activities include Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") verification of loan applicants\u2019 tax return information and approvals by the FHA and other government agencies to fund or insure mortgage loans under programs that these agencies operate. As a number of our home buyers use these programs to obtain financing to purchase our homes, and many lenders, including CountryPlace, require ongoing coordination with these and other governmental entities to originate home loans, a prolonged delay in the performance of their activities could prevent prospective qualified buyers of our homes from obtaining the loans they need to complete such purchases, which could lead to delays or cancellations of home sales. These and other affected governmental bodies could cause interruptions in various aspects of our business and investments. Depending on the length of disruption, such factors could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nInformation technology failures or data security breaches could harm our business\nWe use information technology and other computer resources to carry out important operational activities and to maintain our business records. Our computer systems, including our back-up systems, are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches (through cyber-attacks from computer hackers and sophisticated organizations), catastrophic events such as fires, tornadoes and hurricanes and human error. Given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of information technology disruptions, if our computer systems and our backup systems are damaged, breached, or cease to function properly, we could potentially be subject to production downtimes, operational delays, the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information (including information about our home buyers and business partners), destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, other manipulation or improper use of our systems and networks or financial losses from remedial actions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, competitive position, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation affecting the production and sale of manufactured housing, which could adversely affect our profitability.\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations affecting the production and sale of manufactured housing. Please refer to the section above under the heading \"Government Regulation\" for a description of many of these laws and regulations. Our failure to comply with such laws and regulations could expose us to a wide variety of sanctions, including closing one or more manufacturing facilities. Regulatory matters affecting our operations are under regular review by governmental bodies and we cannot predict what effect, if any, new laws and regulations would have on us or the manufactured housing industry. Failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations or the passage in the future of new and more stringent laws, may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis Annual Report includes \"forward-looking statements,\" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In general, all statements included or incorporated in this Annual Report that are not historical in nature are forward-looking. These may include statements about our plans, strategies and prospects under the headings \"Business,\" and \"Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\" Forward-looking statements are often characterized by the use of words such as \"believes,\" \"estimates,\" \"expects,\" \"projects,\" \"may,\" \"will,\" \"intends,\" \"plans,\" or \"anticipates,\" or by discussions of strategy, plans or intentions. Forward-looking statements are typically included, for example, in discussions regarding the manufactured housing and site-built housing industries; our financial performance and operating results; and the expected effect of certain risks and uncertainties on our business, financial condition and results of operations, economic conditions and consumer confidence, our operational and legal risks, how we may be affected by governmental regulations and legal proceedings, the expected effect of certain risks and uncertainties on our business, the availability of favorable consumer and wholesale manufactured home financing, market interest rates and our investments, and the ultimate outcome of our commitments and contingencies.\nAll forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control. As a result, our actual results or performance may differ materially from anticipated results or performance. Also, forward-looking statements are based upon management's estimates of fair values and of future costs, using currently available information. Therefore, actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in those statements. Factors that could cause such differences to occur include, but are not limited to, those discussed under Item 1A, \"Risk Factors,\" and elsewhere in this Annual Report. We expressly disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
