{"cik": "704051", "company": "LEGG MASON, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-05-29", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nOur business, and the asset management industry in general, is subject to numerous risks, uncertainties and other factors that could negatively affect our business or results of operations. These risks, uncertainties and other factors, including the ones discussed below and those discussed elsewhere herein and in our other filings with the SEC, could cause actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we or any of our employees may make.\nRisks Related to the Proposed Merger\nRegulatory Approvals May Not be Received, May Take Longer Than Expected or May Impose Conditions That Are Not Presently Anticipated or Cannot be Met.\nBefore the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, may be completed, various approvals must be obtained from regulatory authorities. These regulatory authorities may impose conditions on the granting of such approvals. Such conditions or changes and the process of obtaining regulatory approvals could have the effect of delaying completion of the Merger or of imposing additional costs or limitations on the combined company following the Merger. The regulatory approvals may not be received at all, may not be received in a timely fashion, or may contain conditions on the completion of the mergers that are not anticipated or cannot be met. If the consummation of the Merger is delayed, including by a delay in receipt of necessary regulatory approvals, the business, financial condition and results of operations of each company may also be materially and adversely affected. See the section entitled \u201cThe Merger-Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger\u201d in our definitive proxy statement filed with the SEC on March 27, 2020 (\u201cProxy Statement\u201d).\nFailure of the Merger to be Completed, the Termination of the Merger Agreement or a Significant Delay in the Consummation of the Merger could Negatively Impact Us.\nThe Merger Agreement is subject to a number of conditions which must be fulfilled in order to complete the Merger. Please see the section entitled \u201cThe Agreement and Plan of Merger-Conditions to the Merger\u201d in the Proxy Statement. These conditions to the consummation of the Merger may not be fulfilled and, accordingly, the Merger may not be completed or significantly delayed. In addition, if the Merger is not completed by February 17, 2021, either Franklin Templeton or we may choose to terminate the Merger Agreement at any time after that date if the failure to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement is not primarily caused by any failure to fulfil any obligation the Merger Agreement by the party electing to terminate the Merger Agreement. Furthermore, the consummation of the merger may be significantly delayed due to various factors, including potential litigation related to the Merger.\nIf the Merger is not consummated or significantly delayed, our ongoing business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected and the market price of our common stock may decline significantly, particularly to the extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that the Merger will be consummated. If the consummation of the Merger is delayed, including by the receipt of a competing acquisition proposal, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nIn addition, we have incurred and will incur substantial expenses in connection with the negotiation and completion of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. If the Merger is not completed or significantly delayed, we would have to recognize these expenses without realizing the expected benefits of the Merger. Any of the foregoing, or other risks arising in connection with the failure of or delay in consummating the Merger, including the diversion of management attention from pursuing other opportunities and the constraints in the Merger Agreement on our ability to make significant changes to our ongoing business during the pendency of the Merger, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, our business may have been adversely impacted by the failure to pursue other beneficial opportunities due to the focus of management on the Merger, without realizing any of the anticipated benefits of completing the Merger, and the market price of our common stock might decline to the extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that the Merger will be completed. If the Merger Agreement is terminated and a party\u2019s board of directors seeks another merger or business combination, our stockholders cannot be certain that we will be able to find a party willing to engage in a transaction on more attractive terms than the Merger.\nWe Will be Subject to Business Uncertainties and Contractual Restrictions While the Merger is Pending.\nUncertainty about the effect of the Merger on employees, customers, suppliers and vendors may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. These uncertainties may impair our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel and customers pending the consummation of the Merger, as such personnel and customers may experience uncertainty about their future roles and relationships following the consummation of the Merger. Additionally, these uncertainties could cause our customers, suppliers, vendors and others with whom we deal to seek to change, or fail to extend, existing business relationships with us. In addition, competitors may target our existing customers by highlighting potential uncertainties and integration difficulties that may result from the Merger.\nThe pursuit of the Merger and the preparation for the integration may place a burden on our management and internal resources. Any significant diversion of management attention away from ongoing business concerns and any difficulties encountered in the transition and integration process could have a material adverse effect on each company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, the Merger Agreement restricts us from taking certain actions without Franklin Templeton\u2019s consent while the Merger is pending. If the Merger is not completed, these restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Please see the section entitled \u201cThe Agreement and Plan of Merger-Covenants Regarding Conduct of Business by the Company and its Subsidiaries Prior to the Merger\u201d in the Proxy Statement for a description of the restrictive covenants applicable to us and Franklin Templeton.\nLitigation Against Us or Franklin Templeton, or the Members of Our or Franklin Templeton Board of Directors, Could Prevent or Delay the Completion of the Merger.\nWhile we and Franklin Templeton believe that any claims that may be asserted by purported stockholder plaintiffs related to the Merger would be without merit, the results of any such potential legal proceedings are difficult to predict and could delay or prevent the Merger from being competed in a timely manner. Moreover, any litigation could be time consuming and expensive, could divert our and Franklin Templeton\u2019s management\u2019s attention away from their regular business and, any lawsuit adversely resolved against us, Franklin Templeton or members of our or Franklin Templeton board of directors, could have a material adverse effect on each party\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOne of the conditions to the consummation of the merger is the absence of any statute, rule, regulation, executive order, decree, ruling, temporary restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction or other order issued by a court or other government entity of competent jurisdiction having the effect of making the Merger illegal or otherwise prohibiting consummation of the Merger. Consequently, if a settlement or other resolution is not reached in any lawsuit that is filed or any regulatory proceeding and a claimant secures injunctive or other relief or a regulatory authority issues an order or other directive having the effect of making the Merger illegal or otherwise prohibiting consummation of the Merger, then such injunctive or other relief may prevent the Merger from becoming effective in a timely manner or at all.\nRisks Related to our Asset Management Business\nPoor Investment Performance Could Lead to a Loss of Assets Under Management and a Decline in Revenues\nWe believe that investment performance is one of the most important factors for the maintenance and growth of our AUM. Poor investment performance, either on an absolute or relative basis, could impair our revenues and growth because:\n\u2022\nexisting clients might withdraw funds in favor of better performing products, which would result in lower investment advisory and other fees;\n\u2022\nour ability to attract funds from existing and new clients might diminish; and\n\u2022\nnegative absolute investment performance will directly reduce our managed assets and revenues.\nIf our revenues decline without a commensurate reduction in our expenses, our net income will be reduced. From time to time, several of our asset managers have generated poor investment performance, on a relative basis or an absolute basis, in certain products or accounts that they managed, which contributed to a significant reduction in their AUM and revenues and a reduction in performance fees, and some of our asset managers currently face these issues. We face periodic performance issues with certain of our products, and there is typically a lag before improvements in investment performance\nproduce a positive effect on asset flows. In addition, the asset management industry has experienced a continued weakening in the correlation between strong investment performance and increased asset flows. There can be no assurances as to when, or if, investment performance issues will cease to negatively influence our AUM and revenues.\nOur Business and Operations are Subject to Adverse Effects from the Outbreak and Spread of Contagious Diseases Such as COVID-19, and We Expect Such Adverse Effects to Continue.\nThe outbreak and spread of contagious diseases such as COVID-19, a highly transmissible and pathogenic disease, has resulted and will likely continue to result in a widespread national and global public health crisis, which has had, and we expect will continue to have, an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Infectious illness outbreaks or other adverse public health developments in countries where we operate, as well as any local, state and/or national government restrictive measures implemented to control such outbreaks, could adversely affect the economies of many nations or the entire global economy, the financial condition of individual issuers or companies and capital markets, in ways that cannot necessarily be foreseen, and such impacts could be significant and long term. In addition, these events and their aftermaths may cause investor fear and panic, which could further adversely affect in unforeseeable ways the operations and performance of the companies, sectors, nations, regions in which we invest and financial markets in general. The COVID-19 pandemic has already adversely affected and will likely continue to adversely affect global economies and markets, and has resulted in a global economic downturn and disruptions in commerce that will continue to evolve, including with respect to financial and other economic activities, services, travel and supply chains. Global and national health concerns, and uncertainty regarding the impact of COVID-19, could lead to further and/or increased volatility in global capital and credit markets, adversely affect our key executives and other personnel, clients, investors, providers, suppliers, lessees, and other third parties, and negatively impact our AUM, revenues, income, business and operations.\nLike many other global investment management organizations, our business and the businesses of our asset management affiliates, have been and will likely continue to be negatively impacted by the current COVID-19 pandemic and ensuing economic downturn in global financial markets. The global spread of COVID-19, and the various governmental actions and economic effects resulting from the pandemic, have had, and are expected to continue to have, negative impacts on our business and operations, including decreased asset values, reduced demand for our products and services, concerns for and restrictions on our personnel (including health concerns, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and restrictions on travel), and increased cyber security risks. The economic downturn related to COVID-19 has caused and is expected to continue to cause, decreases and fluctuations in our AUM, revenues and income, increased liquidity risks and redemptions in our funds and other products (which could result in difficulties obtaining cash to settle redemptions), poor investment performance of our products and corporate investments, increased focus on expense management, capital resources and related planning, and could cause reputational harm, legal claims, and other factors that may arise or develop.\nIn order to remain competitive, we must continue to perform our asset management and related business responsibilities for our clients and investors properly and effectively throughout the course of the COVID-19 pandemic and the following recovery, which, among other matters, is dependent on the health and safety of our personnel and their ability to work remotely successfully. While we have implemented our business continuity plans globally to manage our business during this pandemic, including broad work-from-home capabilities for our personnel, there is no assurance that our efforts and planning will be sufficient to protect the health and safety of our personnel and/or maintain the success of our business. Further, we depend on a number of third-party providers to support our operations, and any failure of our third-party providers to fulfill their obligations could adversely impact our business. Moreover, we now have an increased dependency on remote equipment and connectivity infrastructure to access critical business systems that may be subject to failure, disruption or unavailability that could negatively impact our business operations. Additionally, multiple regions in which we operate have implemented movement restrictions, which impact our personnel and third-party vendors and service providers and may affect our ability to satisfy or respond timely to potential technology issues or needs impacting our business and operations. If our cyber security diligence and efforts to offset the increased risks associated with greater reliance on mobile, collaborative and remote technologies during this health crisis are not effective or successful, we may be at increased risk for cyber security or data privacy incidents.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, and it is not possible to predict the extent to which the coronavirus, or any inability of the global economy to successfully recover from it, will adversely impact our business, liquidity, capital resources, and financial results and operations, which impacts will depend on numerous developing factors that are highly uncertain and rapidly changing. The impacts and risks described herein relating to COVID-19 augment the discussion of overlapping risks in our risk factors below, which may be heightened by COVID-19.\nIncreased Geopolitical Unrest and Other Events Outside Of Our Control Could Adversely Affect the Global Economy or Specific International, Regional and Domestic Markets, Which May Cause Our AUM, Revenue and Earnings to Decline.\nGeopolitical risks, including those arising from trade tension, European fragmentation, unrest in the Middle East, post-Brexit negotiations that may pose challenges to our European operations and result in additional costs for our European operations that may impede our growth or impact our financial performance, and terrorist activity, as well as acts of civil or international hostility, are increasing. Similarly, other events outside of our control, including natural disasters, pandemics or health crises (such as COVID-19)), may arise from time to time. Any such events, and responses thereto, may cause significant volatility and declines in the global markets, disruptions to commerce (including to economic activity, travel and supply chains), loss of life and property damage, and may adversely affect the global economy or capital markets, as well as the Company\u2019s products, clients, vendors and employees, which may cause our AUM, revenue and earnings to decline.\nAssets Under Management May Be Withdrawn, Which May Reduce Our Revenues and Net Income\nOur investment advisory and administrative contracts are generally terminable at will or upon relatively short notice, and investors in the mutual funds that we manage may redeem their investments in the funds at any time without prior notice. Institutional and individual clients can terminate their relationships with us, reduce the aggregate amount of AUM, or shift their funds to other types of accounts with different rate structures for any number of reasons, including investment performance, changes in prevailing interest rates, changes in investment preferences of clients, changes in our reputation in the marketplace, changes in management or control of clients or third-party distributors with whom we have relationships, loss of key investment management or other personnel and financial market performance. In addition, there has been a trend of investors shifting to alternative, passive, and smart beta strategies. As a result, some actively managed core equities and fixed income portfolios are declining as a share of global AUM. In addition, in a declining securities market, the pace of mutual fund redemptions and withdrawal of assets from other accounts could accelerate. Poor investment performance generally or relative to other investment management firms tends to result in decreased purchases of fund shares, increased redemptions of fund shares, and the loss of institutional or individual accounts.\nWe have experienced net outflows of equity AUM for the last 15 fiscal years due in part to investment performance issues. During fiscal years 2020 and 2019, we had $6.4 billion and $8.0 billion of net client outflows, respectively, primarily in equity assets in fiscal year 2020 and primarily in equity and fixed income in fiscal year 2019.\nIf We Are Unable to Maintain Our Fee Levels or If Our Asset Mix Changes, our Revenues and Margins Could Be Reduced\nOur profit margins and net income are dependent in significant part on our ability to maintain current fee levels for the products and services that our asset managers offer. There has been a trend toward lower fees in many segments of the asset management industry and there is fee pressure in many portions of the active equity and fixed income industry, driven in part by inflows into low-fee passive asset management products and we face continued market pressure with respect to fee levels for many products. In addition, in the ordinary course of our business, we may reduce or waive investment management fees, or limit total expenses, on certain products or services for particular time periods to manage fund expenses, or for other reasons, and to help retain or increase managed assets. No assurances can be given that we will be able to maintain our current fee structure. Competition could lead to our asset managers reducing the fees that they charge their clients for products and services. See \u201cCompetition in the Asset Management Industry Could Reduce our Revenues and Net Income.\u201d In addition, our asset managers may be required to reduce their fee levels, or restructure the fees they charge, because of, among other things, regulatory initiatives or proceedings that are either industry-wide or specifically targeted, or court decisions. A reduction in the fees that our asset managers charge for their products and services will reduce our revenues and could reduce our net income. These factors also could inhibit our ability to increase fees for certain products.\nOur AUM can generate very different revenues per dollar of managed assets based on factors such as the type of asset managed (alternative assets and equity assets generally produce greater revenues than fixed income assets), the type of client (institutional clients generally pay lower fees than other clients), the type of asset management product or service provided and the fee schedule of the asset manager providing the service. A shift in the mix of our AUM from higher revenue-generating assets to lower revenue-generating assets may result in a decrease in our revenues even if our aggregate\nlevel of AUM remains unchanged or increases. A decrease in our revenues, without a commensurate reduction in expenses, will reduce our net income.\nOur Mutual Fund Management Contracts May Not Be Renewed, Which May Reduce our Revenues and Net Income\nA significant portion of our revenue comes from managing U.S. mutual funds. We generally manage these funds pursuant to management contracts with the funds that must be renewed and approved by the funds' boards of directors annually. A majority of the directors of each mutual fund are independent from us. Although the funds' boards of directors have historically approved each of our management contracts, there can be no assurance that the board of directors of each fund that we manage will continue to approve the funds\u2019 management contracts each year or will not condition its approval on the terms of the management contract being revised in a way that is adverse to us. If a mutual fund management contract is not renewed or is revised in a way that is adverse to us, it could result in a reduction in our revenues and, if our revenues decline without a commensurate reduction in our expenses, our net income will be reduced.\nUnavailability of Appropriate Investment Opportunities Could Hamper our Investment Performance or Growth\nAn important component of investment performance is the availability of appropriate investment opportunities for new client funds. If any of our asset managers are not able to find sufficient investments for new client assets in a timely manner, the asset manager's investment performance could be adversely affected. Alternatively, if one of our asset managers does not have sufficient investment opportunities for new funds, it may elect to limit its growth by reducing the rate at which it receives new funds. Depending on, among other factors, prevailing market conditions, the asset manager's investment style, regulatory and other limits and the market sectors and types of opportunities in which the asset manager typically invests (such as less capitalized companies and other more thinly traded securities in which relatively smaller investments are typically made), the risks of not having sufficient investment opportunities may increase when an asset manager increases its AUM, particularly when the increase occurs very quickly. If our asset managers are not able to identify sufficient investment opportunities for new client funds, their investment performance or ability to grow may be reduced.\nChanges in Securities Markets and Prices May Affect our Revenues and Net Income\nA large portion of our revenue is derived from investment advisory contracts with clients. Under these contracts, the investment advisory fees we receive are typically based on the market value of AUM. Accordingly, a decline in the prices of securities generally may cause our revenues and income to decline by:\n\u2022\ncausing the value of our AUM to decrease, which would result in lower investment advisory and other fees;\n\u2022\ncausing our clients to withdraw funds in favor of investments they perceive offer greater opportunity or lower risk, which would also result in lower investment advisory and other fees; or\n\u2022\ndecreasing the performance fees earned by our asset managers.\nThere are often substantial fluctuations in price levels in the securities markets. These fluctuations can occur on a daily basis and over longer periods as a result of a variety of factors, including national and international economic and political events, broad trends in business and finance, and interest rate movements. Reduced securities market prices generally may result in reduced revenues from lower levels of AUM and loss or reduction in advisory, incentive and performance fees. Periods of reduced market prices may adversely affect our profitability because fixed costs remain relatively unchanged. Because we operate in one industry, the business cycles of our asset managers may occur contemporaneously. Consequently, the effect of an economic downturn may have a magnified negative effect on our business.\nIn addition, as of March 31, 2020, a substantial portion of our invested assets consisted of securities and other seed capital investments. A decline in the value of alternatives, equity or fixed income securities could lower the value of these investments and result in declines in our non-operating income and net income. Increases or decreases in the value of these investments could increase the volatility of our earnings.\nChanges in Interest Rates Could Have Adverse Effects on our Assets Under Management\nIncreases in interest rates may adversely affect the net asset values of our AUM. In addition, in a rising interest rate environment, institutional investors may shift liquidity assets that we manage in pooled investment vehicles to direct investments in the types of assets in which the pooled vehicles invest in order to realize higher yields than those available in money market and other products or strategies holding lower-yielding instruments. Furthermore, increases in interest rates may result in reduced prices in equity markets. Conversely, decreases in interest rates could lead to outflows in fixed income or liquidity assets that we manage as investors seek higher yields. Any of these effects could lower our AUM and revenues and, if our revenues decline without a commensurate reduction in our expenses, our net income will be reduced.\nThe low interest rate environment experienced in prior years adversely affected the yields of money market funds, which are based on the income from the underlying securities less the operating costs of the funds. When short-term interest rates are at or near zero, the operating expenses of money market funds may become greater than the income from the underlying securities, which reduces the yield of the money market funds to very low or negative levels. In addition, bank deposits may become more attractive to investors and money market funds could experience redemptions, which could decrease our revenues and net income. During fiscal year 2014 through fiscal year 2017, we voluntarily waived certain fees or assumed expenses of money market funds for competitive reasons, such as to maintain competitive yields, which reduced our advisory fee income and net income. The actual amount of fees waived was dependent on a number of variables including, among others, changes in the net assets held by our money market funds, changes in market yields, changes in the expense levels of the funds, and our willingness to voluntarily continue such fee waivers. We experienced a higher interest rate environment in fiscal years 2019 and 2020 and fee waivers for competitive reasons did not continue into those years. The current lower interest rate environment resulting from the effects of COVID 19 may result in a return to fee waivers.\nCompetition in the Asset Management Industry Could Reduce our Revenues and Net Income\nThe asset management industry in which we are engaged is extremely competitive and we face substantial competition in all aspects of our business. We compete based on a number of factors, including: investment performance, the level of fees charged, the quality and diversity of services and products provided, name recognition and reputation, and the ability to develop new investment strategies and products to meet the changing needs of investors. The introduction of new technologies, as well as regulatory changes, have altered the competitive landscape for asset managers, which may lead to fee compression or require us to spend more to modify or adapt our product offerings to attract and retain customers and remain competitive with products and services offered by other financial institutions, technology companies, trading, advisory or asset management firms. Our competition includes numerous international and domestic asset management firms and broker-dealers, mutual fund complexes, hedge funds, commercial banks, insurance companies, other investment companies and other financial institutions. Many of these organizations offer products and services that are similar to, or compete with, those offered by our asset managers and have substantially more personnel and greater financial resources than we do. Some of these competitors have proprietary products and distribution channels that make it more difficult for us to compete with them. In addition, many of our competitors have long-standing and established relationships with distributors and clients. From time to time, our asset managers also compete with each other for clients and assets under management. Our ability to compete may be adversely affected if, among other things, our asset managers lose key employees or, as has been the case for certain of the products managed by our asset managers, under-perform in comparison to relevant performance benchmarks or peer groups.\nThe asset management industry has experienced from time to time the entry of many new firms, as well as significant consolidation as numerous asset management firms have either been acquired by other financial services firms or ceased operations. In many cases, this has resulted in firms with greater financial resources than we have. In addition, a number of heavily capitalized companies, including commercial banks and foreign entities have made investments in and acquired asset management firms. Access to mutual fund distribution channels has also become increasingly competitive. All of these factors could make it more difficult for us to compete, and no assurance can be given that we will be successful in competing and growing our AUM and business. If clients and potential clients decide to use the services of competitors, it could reduce our revenues and growth rate, and if our revenues decrease without a commensurate reduction in our expenses, our net income will be reduced. In this regard, there are a number of asset classes and product types that are not well covered by our current products and services. When these asset classes or products are in favor with investors, we will miss the opportunity to gain the assets under management that are being invested in these assets and face the risk of our managed assets being withdrawn in favor of competitors who provide services covering these classes or products. For\nexample, there is a trend in the asset management business in favor of passive products such as index and certain types of ETFs, which favors our competitors who provide those products over active managers like our asset managers. Investors are increasingly attracted to lower fee passive products, which have gained and may continue to gain share at the expense of active products like the ones managed by our affiliates, and we continue to face market pressures regarding fee levels in certain products. In addition, our asset managers are not typically the lowest cost provider of asset management services. To the extent that we compete on the basis of price in any of our businesses, we may not be able to maintain our current fee structure in that business, which could adversely affect our revenues and net income. In the retail separately managed account program business, there has been a trend toward more open programs that involve more asset managers who provide only investment models which the financial institution sponsor's employees use to allocate assets. A number of the programs for which we provide services have followed this trend, and additional programs could do so in the future. This trend could result in AUM retention issues due to additional competition within the programs, particularly for products with performance issues, and reduced management fees, which are typical results of providing investment models rather than advisory services.\nOur business is asset management. As a result, we may be more affected by trends and issues affecting the asset management industry, such as industry-wide regulatory issues and inquiries, publicity about, and public perceptions of the industry and asset management industry market cycles, than other financial services companies that have more diversified businesses.\nFailure to Properly Address the Increased Transformative Pressures Affecting the Asset Management Industry Could Negatively Impact our Business\nThe asset management industry is facing transformative pressures and trends from a variety of different sources including:\n\u2022\nIncreased fee pressure;\n\u2022\nIncreased demand from clients and distributors for client engagement and value-added services;\n\u2022\nDivergent central bank monetary policies between the U.S Federal Reserve and the central banks of other developed economies;\n\u2022\nA continued shift away from actively managed core equities and fixed income strategies and towards alternative, passive, and smart beta strategies;\n\u2022\nA trend towards institutions developing fewer relationships and partners and reducing the number of investment managers they work with;\n\u2022\nIncreased regulatory activity and scrutiny of many aspects of the asset management industry, including transparency/unbundling of fees, inducements, conflicts of interest, capital, liquidity, solvency, leverage, operational risk management, controls and compensation;\n\u2022\nAddressing the key emerging markets in the world, such as China and India, which often have populations with different needs, preferences and horizons than the more developed U.S. and European markets; and\n\u2022\nAdvances in technology and increasing client interest in interacting digitally with their investment portfolios.\nAs a result of the trends and pressures discussed above, the asset management industry is facing an increased level of disruption. If we are unable to adapt our strategy and business to adequately address these trends and pressures listed above, we may be unable to satisfactorily meet client needs, our competitive position may weaken, and our business results and operations may be adversely affected.\nWe May Support Government and Retail Money Market Funds to Maintain Their Stable Net Asset Values, or Other Products We Manage, Which Could Affect our Revenues or Operating Results\nApproximately 6% of our AUM as of March 31, 2020, consisted of assets in government or retail money market funds. Money market funds seek to preserve a stable net asset value. While the SEC has implemented rules requiring any institutional prime money market fund and any institutional municipal (or tax-exempt) money market fund that is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 to utilize market-based valuations to calculate a floating NAV, government and retail money market funds can continue using current pricing and accounting methods to seek to maintain a stable NAV. Market conditions could lead to severe liquidity or security pricing issues, which could impact the NAV of money market funds. If the NAV of a money market fund managed by our asset managers were to fall below its stable net asset value, we would likely experience significant redemptions in AUM and reputational harm, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues or net income.\nIf a government or retail money market fund's stable NAV comes under pressure, we may elect, as we have done in the past, to provide credit, liquidity, or other support to the fund. We may also elect to provide similar or other support, including by providing liquidity to a fund, to other products we manage for any number of reasons. If we elect to provide support, we could incur losses from the support we provide and incur additional costs, including financing costs, in connection with the support. These losses and additional costs could be material and could adversely affect our earnings.\nFailure to Comply With Contractual Requirements or Guidelines Could Result in Liability and Loss of Assets Under Management, Both of Which Could Cause our Net Income to Decline\nThe asset management contracts under which we manage client assets, including contracts with investment funds, often specify guidelines or contractual requirements that we are obligated to observe in providing asset management services. A failure to comply with these guidelines or requirements could result in damage to our reputation, liability to the client or the client reducing its assets under our management, any of which could cause our revenues and net income to decline. This risk is increased by the trend toward customized, specialized mandates seen by many of our asset managers, which tends to result in more complex mandates that are more difficult to administer.\nThe Soundness of Other Financial Institutions Could Adversely Affect our Business\nVolatility in the markets has highlighted the interconnection of the global markets and demonstrated how the deteriorating financial condition of one institution may materially and adversely impact the performance of other institutions. We, and the funds and accounts that we manage, have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial industry. We, and the funds and accounts we manage, may be exposed to credit, operational or other risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or client, or in the event of other unrelated systemic failures in the markets.\nPerformance-Based Fee Arrangements May Increase the Volatility of our Revenues\nA portion of our total revenues is derived from performance fees. Our asset managers earn performance fees under certain client agreements if the investment performance in the portfolio meets or exceeds a specified benchmark. If the investment performance does not meet or exceed the investment return benchmark for a particular period, the asset manager will not generate a performance fee for that period and, if the benchmark is based on cumulative returns, the asset manager's ability to earn performance fees in future periods may be impaired. As of March 31, 2020, approximately 11% of our long-term AUM was in accounts or products that are eligible to earn performance fees. Performance fees earned on historic AUM in place as of the closing of the acquisition of Clarion Partners on April 13, 2016 are fully passed through to the Clarion Partners management team, per the terms of the acquisition agreement. We expect the pass through to phase out approximately five years post-closing. Excluding AUM eligible to earn performance fees passed through as compensation, approximately 7% of our long-term AUM was in accounts that were eligible to earn performance fees at some point during fiscal year 2020. We earned $99.0 million, $84.9 million and $227.8 million in performance fees during fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Of the $99.0 million in performance fees earned during fiscal year 2020, $42.0 million was passed through to the Clarion Partners management team. An increase or decrease in performance fees, or in performance-based fee arrangements with our clients, could create greater fluctuations in our revenues.\nWe Rely Significantly on Third Parties to Distribute Mutual Funds and Certain Other Products\nOur ability to market and distribute mutual funds and certain other investment products that we manage is significantly dependent on access to third-party financial intermediaries that distribute these products. These distributors are generally not contractually required to distribute our products, and typically offer their clients various investment products and services, including proprietary products and services, in addition to and in competition with our products and services. Relying on third-party distributors also exposes us to the risk of increasing costs of distribution, as we compensate them for selling our products and services in amounts that are agreed between them and us but which, in many cases, are largely determined by the distributor. There has been a continuing trend of increasing fees paid to certain distributors in the asset management business, and certain of our distribution costs have increased as a result. While the third-party distributors are compensated for distributing our products and services, there can be no assurances that we will be successful in distributing our products and services through them. In addition, mergers and other corporate transactions among distributors may affect our distribution relationships. If we are unable to distribute our products and services successfully,\nit will adversely affect our revenues and net income, and any increase in distribution-related expenses could adversely affect our net income.\nOur Funds-of-Hedge Funds Business Entails a Number of Additional Risks\nEnTrust Global operates a portion of its business in the international funds-of-hedge funds business, which is subject to a number of regulatory authorities and requirements in different jurisdictions. The funds-of-hedge funds business typically involves clients being charged fees on two levels - at the funds-of-funds level and at the underlying funds level. These fees may include management fees and performance fees. There can be no assurance that EnTrust Global will not be forced to change its fee structures by competitive or other pressures or that EnTrust Global's fee structures will not hamper its growth. The funds-of-hedge funds industry has been under significant pressure in recent years and has seen significant outflows. There can be no assurance that this pressure will not continue. In addition, EnTrust Global may generate significant performance fees from time to time, which could increase the volatility of our revenues. See \u201cPerformance-Based Fee Arrangements May Increase the Volatility of our Revenues.\u201d\nRisks Related to our Company\nOur Leverage May Affect our Business and May Restrict our Operating Results\nAt March 31, 2020, on a consolidated basis, we had approximately $2.0 billion in total indebtedness, and total stockholders' equity of $3.8 billion, and our goodwill and other intangible assets were $1.8 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively. We also have an additional $500.0 million of borrowing capacity available under our revolving credit facility. As a result of this substantial indebtedness, we are currently required to use a portion of our cash flow to service interest on our debt, which will limit the cash flow available for other business opportunities. In addition, these servicing obligations will increase in the future as the principal payments on this debt become due or if we incur additional indebtedness.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of principal, to pay interest, or to refinance our indebtedness and to satisfy our other debt obligations will depend upon our future operating performance, which may be affected by general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, business and other factors beyond our control and by a variety of factors specific to our business.\nThe level of our indebtedness could:\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to obtain additional debt financing in the future or to borrow under our existing credit facilities (our principal bank debt facility requires that (i) our ratio of net debt (total debt less the amount of unrestricted cash in excess of the greater of subsidiary cash or $300 million, the lesser of 50% of the aggregate amount of our seed capital investments or $125 million, and an amount equal to 50% of our hybrid capital securities) to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined therein) not exceed 3 to 1 , and (ii) our ratio of Consolidated EBITDA to total cash interest payments on certain Indebtedness (as defined therein) exceeds 4.0 to 1);\n\u2022\nlimit cash flow available for general corporate purposes due to the ongoing cash flow requirements for debt service;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility, including our ability to react to competitive and other changes in the industry and economic conditions; and\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt.\nAs of March 31, 2020, under the terms of our bank credit agreement our ratio of net debt to Consolidated EBITDA was 1.9 to 1 and our ratio of Consolidated EBITDA to interest expense was 6.1 to 1, and, therefore, we were in compliance with our bank financial covenants. If our net income significantly declines for any reason, it may be difficult to remain in compliance with these covenants. Similarly, to the extent that we spend our available cash for purposes other than repaying debt or acquiring businesses that increase our EBITDA, we will increase our net debt to Consolidated EBITDA ratio. Although there are actions that we may take if our financial covenant compliance becomes an issue, there can be no assurance that we will remain in compliance with its bank debt covenants.\nOur access to credit on reasonable terms is also partially dependent on our credit ratings. If our credit ratings are downgraded, it will likely become more difficult and costly for us to access the credit markets or otherwise incur new debt.\nUpon the occurrence of various events, such as a change of control, some or all of our outstanding debt obligations may come due prior to their maturity dates and may require payments in excess of their outstanding amounts, which in certain circumstances may be significant.\nIf our Reputation is Harmed, We Could Suffer Losses in our Business, Revenues and Net Income\nOur business depends on earning and maintaining the trust and confidence of clients and other market participants, and the resulting good reputation is critical to our business. Our reputation is vulnerable to many threats that can be difficult or impossible to control, and costly or impossible to remediate. Regulatory inquiries, employee misconduct and rumors, among other things, can substantially damage our reputation, even if they are baseless or satisfactorily addressed. Regulatory sanctions or adverse litigation results can also cause substantial damage to our reputation. Any damage to our reputation could impede our ability to attract and retain clients and key personnel, and lead to a reduction in the amount of our AUM, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and net income.\nFailure to Properly Address Conflicts of Interest Could Harm our Reputation, Business and Results of Operations\nAs we have expanded the scope of our businesses and our client base, we must continue to address conflicts between our interests and those of our clients. In addition, the SEC and other regulators have increased their scrutiny of potential conflicts of interest. We have procedures and controls that are reasonably designed to address these issues. However, appropriately dealing with conflicts of interest is complex and difficult and if we fail, or appear to fail, to deal appropriately with conflicts of interest, we could face reputational damage, litigation or regulatory proceedings or penalties, any of which may adversely affect our revenues or net income.\nLoss of Key Personnel Could Harm our Business\nWe are dependent on the continued services of our key asset management personnel and our management team. The loss of any of such personnel without adequate replacement could have a material adverse effect on us. Moreover, since certain of our asset managers operate with lean management teams and contribute significantly to our revenues and net income, the loss of even a small number of key personnel at these businesses could have a disproportionate impact on our overall business. Additionally, we need qualified managers and skilled employees with asset management experience in order to operate our business successfully. The market for experienced asset management professionals is extremely competitive and is increasingly characterized by the movement of employees among different firms. Due to the competitive market for asset management professionals and the success of some of our employees, our costs to attract and retain key employees are significant and will likely increase over time. From time to time, we may work with key employees to revise revenue sharing arrangements and other employment-related terms to reflect current circumstances, including in situations where a revenue sharing arrangement may result in insufficient revenues being retained by the subsidiary. In addition, since the investment track record of many of our products and services is often attributed to a small number of individual employees, and sometimes one person, the departure of one or more of these employees could cause the business to lose client accounts or managed assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified individuals or our costs to do so increase significantly, our operations and financial results would be materially adversely affected.\nOur Business is Subject to Numerous Operational Risks\nWe face numerous operational risks related to our business on a day-to-day basis. Among other things, we must be able to consistently and reliably obtain securities pricing information, process trading activity, process client and investor transactions and provide reports and other customer service to our clients, investors and distributors. Failure to keep current and accurate books and records can render us subject to disciplinary action by governmental and self-regulatory authorities, as well as to claims by our clients. A portion of our software is licensed from and supported by outside vendors upon whom we rely to prevent operating system failure. A suspension or termination of these licenses or the related support, upgrades and maintenance could cause system delays or interruption. If any of our financial, portfolio accounting or other data processing systems, or the systems of third parties on whom we rely, do not operate properly or are disabled or if there are other shortcomings or failures in our internal processes, people or systems, or those of third parties on whom we rely, we could suffer an impairment to our liquidity, a financial loss, a disruption of our businesses, liability to clients, regulatory problems or damage to our reputation. These systems may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events\nthat are wholly or partially beyond our control, including a disruption of electrical or communications services or our inability to occupy one or more offices. In addition, our operations are dependent upon information from, and communications with, third parties, and operational problems at third parties may adversely affect our ability to carry on our business.\nWe depend on our headquarters, the offices of our subsidiaries, our operations centers and third-party providers for the continued operation of our business. The failure to maintain an infrastructure commensurate with the size and scope of our business, a disaster or a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our asset managers, or an event disrupting the ability of our employees to perform their job functions, including terrorist attacks, pandemic, health crisis (such COVID-19) or a disruption involving electrical communications, transportation or other services used by us or third parties with whom we conduct business, directly affecting our headquarters, the offices of our subsidiaries, our operations centers or the travel of our sales, client service and other personnel, may have a material adverse impact on our ability to continue to operate our business without interruption or impede the growth of our business. Although we have disaster recovery and business continuity programs in place, there can be no assurance that these will be sufficient to mitigate the harm that may result from such a disaster or disruption. If we fail to keep business continuity plans up-to-date or if such plans, including secure back-up facilities and systems, are improperly implemented or deployed during a disruption, our ability to operate could be adversely impacted or our ability to comply with regulatory obligations leading to reputational harm, regulatory fines and sanctions. In addition, insurance and other safeguards might only partially reimburse us for our losses.\nFailure to implement effective information and cybersecurity policies, procedures and capabilities could disrupt operations and cause financial losses\nOur operations rely on the effectiveness of our information and cybersecurity policies, procedures and capabilities to provide secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems, networks and mobile devices and on the computer systems, networks and mobile devices of third parties on which we rely. Although we take protective measures and endeavor to modify them as circumstances warrant, our computer systems, software, networks and mobile devices, and those of third parties on whom we rely, may be vulnerable to cyber-attacks, sabotage, unauthorized access, computer viruses, worms or other malicious code, phishing scams and other events that have a security impact. In addition, our interconnectivity with third-party vendors, advisors, central agents, exchanges, clearing houses and other financial institutions may be adversely affected if any of them are subject to a successful cyber-attack or other information security event. While we collaborate with clients, vendors and other third parties to develop secure transmission capabilities and protect against cyber-attacks, we cannot ensure that we or any third parties has all appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of such information. In addition, our increased use of mobile and cloud technologies could heighten these and other operational risks and any failure by mobile technology and cloud service providers to adequately safeguard their systems and prevent cyber-attacks, could disrupt our operations and result in misappropriation, corruption or loss of personal, confidential or proprietary information.\nAn externally caused information security incident, such as a hacker attack, virus or worm, or an internally caused issue, such as failure to control access to sensitive systems, could materially interrupt business operations or cause disclosure or modification of sensitive or confidential client or competitive information and could result in material financial loss, loss of competitive position, regulatory actions, breach of client contracts, reputational harm or legal liability.\nThere have been a number of highly publicized cases involving financial services and consumer-based companies reporting the unauthorized disclosure of client or customer information, as well as cyber-attacks involving the dissemination, theft and destruction of corporate information or other assets, as a result of failure to follow procedures by employees or contractors or as a result of actions by third parties, including actions by terrorist organizations and hostile foreign governments. Cyber-security incidents and cyber-attacks have been occurring globally at a more frequent and severe level. We have been the target of attempted cyber-attacks and must monitor and develop our systems to protect our technology infrastructure and data from misappropriation or corruption, as the failure to do so could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business. Although we take protective measures and endeavors to strengthen our computer systems, software, technology assets and networks to prevent and address potential cyber-attacks, there can be no assurance that any of these measures prove effective.\nAny information security incident or cyber-attack against us or third parties with whom we are connected, including any interception, mishandling or misuse of personal, confidential or proprietary information, could result in material financial\nloss, loss of competitive position, regulatory fines and/or sanctions, breach of client contracts, reputational harm or legal liability, which, in turn, may cause our revenue and earnings to decline.\nFailure to Establish Adequate Controls and Risk Management Policies, or the Circumvention of Controls And Policies Could Have an Adverse Effect on our Reputation and Financial Position.\nWe have a multiple risk management process and continue to enhance various controls, procedures, policies and systems to monitor and manage risks to our business; however, we cannot be assured that such controls, procedures, policies and systems will successfully identify and manage internal and external risks to our business. We are subject to the risk that our employees, contractors or other third parties may deliberately seek to circumvent established controls to commit fraud (including through cyber-breaches) or act in ways that are inconsistent with our controls, policies and procedures. Persistent or repeated attempts involving conflicts of interests, circumvention of policies and controls or fraud could have a materially adverse impact on our reputation and could lead to costly regulatory inquiries.\nWe May Incur Right of Use Asset Impairment Charges Related to Leased Facilities\nWe continue to be exposed to the risk of incurring charges related to subleases or vacant space for several of our leased offices. As of March 31, 2020, our right-of-use (\u201cROU\u201d) assets with commitments from third parties under non-cancellable subleases were approximately $72 million. As of March 31, 2020, our total ROU assets for office space that we vacated and are seeking to sublease were approximately $2 million, after impairment charges of approximately $4 million recognized in fiscal year 2020. Under generally accepted accounting principles, when the carrying value of a ROU asset is deemed to not be fully recoverable (i.e. at the time a sublease is entered into or space is deemed abandoned), we must incur a charge equal to the present value of the amounts by which the fixed rental commitments under the lease exceed the amounts expected to be received under a sublease, if any. As a result, in a period of declining commercial lease markets, we are exposed to the risk of incurring charges relating to any premises we are seeking to sublease resulting from longer periods to identify sub-tenants and reduced market rent rates leading to new sub-tenants paying less in rent than we are paying under our lease. Also, if a sub-tenant defaults on its sublease, we would likely incur a charge for the rent that we will incur during the period that we expect would be required to sublease the premises and any reduction in rent that current market rent rates lead us to expect a new sub-tenant will pay. There can be no assurance that we will not recognize additional lease-related impairment charges, which may be material to our results of operations.\nPotential Impairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets Could Increase our Expenses and Reduce our Assets\nDetermining goodwill and intangible assets, and evaluating them for impairment, requires significant management estimates and judgment, including estimating value and assessing life in connection with the allocation of purchase price in the acquisition creating them. Our goodwill and intangible assets may become impaired as a result of any number of factors, including losses of investment management contracts or declines in the value of managed assets. Any impairment of goodwill or intangibles could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. For example, during the quarter ended December 31, 2018, we incurred $365.2 million of aggregate impairment charges. These impairment charges were comprised of $274.6 million and $18.2 million associated with our combined EnTrust Global indefinite-life fund management contracts asset and trade name asset, respectively, and $65.0 million, $6.4 million, and $1.0 million, associated with our RARE Infrastructure indefinite-life fund management contracts asset, amortizable fund management contracts asset, and trade name asset, respectively. Subsequent to December 31, 2018, no additional intangible asset impairment charges have been recognized. As of October 31, 2019, the date of our most recent annual impairment testing, the implied fair value of our Global Asset Management reporting unit exceeded its carry value of $1.9 billion by 22%. Further, it was determined that the EnTrust Global indefinite-life fund management contracts and trade name assets each experienced a triggering event during the quarter ended March 31, 2020. Accordingly, the impairment tests for these assets were updated as of March 31, 2020 and the resulting fair values exceeded their respective carrying values of $126.8 million and $10.3 million by 1% and 3%, respectively. Changes in the assumptions underlying projected cash flows from the assets or reporting unit, resulting from market conditions, reduced AUM or other factors, could result in an impairment of any of these assets.\nThere can be no assurances that continued market uncertainty or asset outflows, or other factors, will not produce additional impairments. See \"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies - Intangible Assets and Goodwill\" and \"Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\"\nOur Deferred Tax Assets May Not Be Fully Realizable\nAs of March 31, 2020, we had approximately $627 million in U.S. federal deferred tax assets, which represent tax benefits that we expect to realize in future periods. Under accounting rules, we are required to recognize a charge to earnings to reduce our deferred tax assets if it is determined that any future tax benefits are not likely to be realized before they expire. Deferred tax assets generated in U.S. jurisdictions resulting from net operating losses generally expire 20 years after they are generated. Those resulting from foreign tax credits generally expire 10 years after they are generated. In order to realize these future tax benefits, we estimate that we must generate approximately $3 billion in future U.S. earnings, of which $349 million must be foreign sourced earnings, before the benefits expire. There can be no assurances that we will achieve this level of earnings before some portion of these tax benefits expires. In addition, our belief that we will likely be able to realize these future tax benefits is based in part upon our estimates of the timing of other differences in revenue and expense recognition between tax returns and financial statements, certain planning strategies and our understanding of the application of tax regulations and ability to implement certain tax planning strategies, which may be revised to incorporate future changes in tax or accounting regulations. In addition, the value of our deferred tax assets is based on enacted corporate tax rates for future periods. Legislative changes related to these rates would require a measurement of our deferred tax assets in the period of enactment.\nOur estimates and assumptions do not contemplate certain possible future changes in the ownership of our common stock, which, under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (the \u201cCode\u201d), could limit our utilization of net operating loss and foreign tax credit benefits. Under the relevant Code provisions, an \u201cownership change\u201d occurs if there is a cumulative net increase in the aggregate ownership of our common stock by \u201c5% shareholders\u201d (as defined in the Code) of more than 50 percent of the total outstanding shares of our common stock during a rolling three-year period. An ownership change would prospectively establish an annual limitation on the amount of pre-change net operating loss and foreign tax credit carryforwards we could utilize to reduce our tax liability. The amount of the limitation would generally equal the amount of our market capitalization immediately prior to the ownership change multiplied by the long-term tax-exempt interest rate in effect at that time. Such an ownership change would impact the timing or amount of net operating loss or foreign tax credit benefits we ultimately realize before they expire. If we are required to recognize a charge to earnings to reduce our deferred tax assets, the charge may be material to our earnings or financial condition.\nWe Are Exposed to a Number of Risks Arising From our International Operations\nOur asset managers operate in a number of jurisdictions outside of the United States on behalf of international clients. We have offices in numerous countries and many cross border and local proprietary funds that are domiciled outside the United States. Our international operations require us to comply with the legal requirements of various foreign jurisdictions, expose us to the political consequences of operating in foreign jurisdictions and subject us to expropriation risks, expatriation controls and potential adverse tax consequences which, among other things, make it more difficult to repatriate to the United States the cash that we generate outside the U.S. At March 31, 2020, our total liquid assets, which include cash, cash equivalents and certain current investment securities, were $1.1 billion. These liquid assets included approximately $334 million of cash and investments held by our foreign subsidiaries, some of which, if repatriated, may be subject to material tax effects.\nIn addition, we are exposed to certain risks related to the different currencies in which we transact and the home jurisdictions of certain securities in which our AUM is invested. Uncertainties regarding developments in those jurisdictions can produce volatility in global financial markets and adversely impact our results of operations. This may impact the levels and composition of our AUM and also negatively impact investor sentiment, which could result in reduced or negative flows. In addition, because the U.K. Pound Sterling and the Euro are the currency used in certain aspects of our business, any weakening of the U.K. Pound Sterling or Euro relative to the U.S. Dollar could negatively impact our reported financial results.\nDespite controls and other actions reasonably designed to mitigate these risks, our international operations expose us to risks arising from our potential responsibility for actions of third party agents and other representatives of our business operating outside our primary jurisdictions of operation. Our foreign business operations are also subject to the following risks:\n\u2022\ndifficulty in managing, operating and marketing our international operations;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates which may result in substantial negative effects on AUM and revenues in our U.S. dollar-based financial statements; and\n\u2022\nsignificant adverse changes in foreign political, economic, legal and regulatory environments.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nRegulatory Matters May Negatively Affect our Business and Results of Operations\nOur business is subject to regulation by various regulatory authorities around the world that are charged with protecting the interests of our clients. We could be subject to civil liability, criminal liability, or sanction, including revocation of our subsidiaries' registrations as investment advisers, revocation of the licenses of our employees, censures, fines, or temporary suspension or permanent bar from conducting business, if we violate such laws or regulations. Any such liability or sanction could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, reputation, and business prospects. In addition, the regulatory environment in which we operate frequently changes and has seen significant increased regulation in recent years. Our profitability could be materially and adversely affected by modification of the rules and regulations that impact the business and financial communities in general, including changes to the laws governing taxation, antitrust regulation and electronic commerce. In particular, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant additional costs as a result of regulatory changes affecting U.S. mutual funds, changes to European mutual fund regulation and recent changes to data privacy regulation in the U.K. and the EU which came into effect in May 2018.\nWe may be adversely affected as a result of new or revised legislation or regulations or by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations. The challenges associated with consistently interpreting regulations issued in multiple countries may add to such risks. The U.S. federal government and governments in non-U.S. jurisdictions in which we operate have made, and have proposed further, significant changes to the regulatory structure of the financial services industry, and we expect to spend time and resources to comply with these regulatory changes. For a summary of the laws, regulations and regulators to which we are subject, see \u201cItem 1 - Business - Regulation.\u201d\nInstances of criminal activity and fraud by participants in the asset management industry, disclosures of trading and other abuses by participants in the financial services industry and significant governmental intervention and investment in the financial markets and financial firms have led the U.S. government and regulators to increase the rules and regulations governing, and oversight of, the U.S. financial system. This activity has resulted in changes to the laws and regulations governing the asset management industry and more aggressive enforcement of the existing laws and regulations. The ongoing revisions to the laws and regulations governing our business are an ongoing process. The cumulative effect of these actions may result in increased expenses, or lower management or other fees, and therefore adversely affect the revenues or profitability of our business.\nOur Business Involves Risks of Being Engaged in Litigation, Regulatory Proceedings and Tax Disputes, Which May Result in Liability That Could Increase our Expenses and Reduce our Net Income\nMany aspects of our business involve substantial risks of liability. In the normal course of business, our asset managers are from time to time named as defendants or co-defendants in lawsuits, or are involved in disputes that involve the threat of lawsuits, seeking substantial damages. We are also involved from time to time in governmental and self- regulatory organization investigations and proceedings. No assurances can be given as to how any regulatory matter, might be resolved or the effect it may have on us or our business. In addition, we are involved in a tax dispute in Brazil arising from matters relating to the tax deductibility of goodwill amortization with respect to the Brazilian business of our subsidiary, Western Asset Management. The assessments that were subject to the dispute for the years 2006 and 2007 were withdrawn after we received a favorable ruling in administrative court. The assessments for the years 2008 through 2010 were recently upheld by the judgment of the same level administrative court (but by a different panel) that overruled the assessments for the previous period. We are in the process of appealing this result. The net amount of tax, interest and penalty at issue in the years subject to our appeal is over $11 million (56 million BRL). Additionally, new assessments were issued for the\nyears 2011 through 2014 and the net amount at issue in those years is over $18 million (97 million BRL). It may take another three to five years or longer to achieve final resolution of this matter as it potentially could go through multiple levels of appeal. During that time, the current $29 million (153 million BRL) amount in dispute could increase due to additional interest accruals. While there can be no assurance of the timing or outcome of this dispute, or that we will receive additional favorable judgments in connection with this matter, we and our local advisors continue to believe that our tax position is correct, and it is more likely than not that we will not be required to pay the taxes in question or any related interest and penalties\nIn addition, the investment funds that our asset managers manage are subject to actual and threatened lawsuits and governmental and self-regulatory organization investigations and proceedings, any of which could harm the investment returns or reputation of the applicable fund or result in our asset managers being liable to the funds for any resulting damages. There has been an increased incidence of litigation and regulatory investigations in the asset management industry in recent years, including customer claims as well as class action suits seeking substantial damages. Any litigation can increase our expenses and reduce our net income.\nInsurance May Not Be Available on a Cost-Effective Basis to Protect us From Liability\nWe face the inherent risk of liability related to litigation from clients, third-party vendors or others and actions taken by regulatory agencies. To help protect against these potential liabilities, we purchase insurance in amounts, and against risks, that we consider appropriate, where such insurance is available at prices we deem acceptable. There can be no assurance, however, that a claim or claims will be covered by insurance or, if covered, will not exceed the limits of available insurance coverage, that any insurer will remain solvent and will meet its obligations to provide us with coverage or that insurance coverage will continue to be available with sufficient limits at a reasonable cost. Insurance costs are impacted by market conditions and the risk profile of the insured and may increase significantly over relatively short periods. In addition, certain insurance coverage may not be available or may only be available at prohibitive costs. Renewals of insurance policies may expose us to additional costs through higher premiums or the assumption of higher deductibles or co-insurance liability.", "PERMNO": 65330, "SIC": 6282, "TIC": "LM"}
