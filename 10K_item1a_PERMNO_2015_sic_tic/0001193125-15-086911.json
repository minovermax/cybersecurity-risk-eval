{"cik": "855612", "company": "ZIX CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-11", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following is a cautionary discussion of risks, uncertainties and assumptions that we believe are significant to our business, financial condition and financial results. In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following are some of the important factors that, individually or in the aggregate, we believe could make our results differ materially from those described in any forward-looking statements. It is impossible to predict or identify all such factors and, as a result, you should not consider the following factors to be a complete discussion of risks, uncertainties and assumptions.\nOur business depends upon customers using email to exchange confidential information, and a significant shift of those messages to other communication channels could impair our growth prospects and negatively affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nOur customers deploy and use our products and services to easily, securely and confidentially send and receive email messages. Our business and revenue substantially depend on our current and potential customers using email to exchange sensitive information electronically. New technologies, products, or business models that could support secure communications could be disruptive to our business. If prospective or current customers were to send and receive sensitive information using technology or communication channels other than email, our growth prospects and our business, financial condition and financial results could be materially adversely affected.\nOur business relies on securing new customer subscriptions and subscription renewals from existing customers.\nA large portion of our revenue is derived from customer subscriptions, and in many cases existing customers have no contractual obligations to purchase beyond the initial subscription or contract period. We may not maintain historical subscription rates, and we may be unable to accurately predict our customer renewal rates. Our customers\u2019 renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including the level of their satisfaction with our products and technical support services, customer budgets and the pricing of our products compared with those offered by our competitors. If new subscriptions or subscription renewals decline, our revenue or revenue growth may decline, and our business may suffer.\nPublic key cryptography technology used in our businesses is subject to technology integrity risks that could reduce demand for our products and services and could negatively affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nOur business employs public key cryptography technology and other encryption technologies to encrypt and decrypt messages. The security afforded by encryption depends on the integrity of the private key, which is predicated on the assumption that it is very difficult to mathematically derive the private key from the related public key. Successful decryption of intercepted encrypted email, or public reports of successful decryption, whether or not true, could reduce demand for our products and services. If new methods or technologies, such as quantum computing, make it easier to derive the private key from the related public key, the security of encryption services using public key cryptography technology could be impaired and our products and services could become\nunmarketable. That could require us to make significant changes to our services, which could increase our costs, damage our reputation, or otherwise harm our business. Any of these events could reduce our revenues, increase our expenses and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nThe growth of our business may require significant investment in systems and infrastructure and these investments may achieve delayed, or lower than expected benefits, which could impair our profitability and negatively affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nAs our operations grow in size and scope, we continually need to improve and upgrade our technology offerings, systems and infrastructure to offer an increasing number of customers enhanced products, services, features and functionality, while maintaining the reliability and integrity of our systems and infrastructure and pursuing reduced costs per transaction. Expanding our technology offerings, systems and infrastructure may require us to commit substantial financial, operational and technical resources, with no assurance that the volume of our business will increase, which could reduce our net income, deplete our cash, and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nWe face strong competition, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nThe markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid change and converging technologies and are very competitive. With rising demand for private and secure email communications, there is strong competition for email encryption products and services. Our Email Encryption and data loss prevention business competes with products and services offered by companies such as Microsoft, Barracuda Networks, Inc., McAfee, Inc., Proofpoint, and Sophos Inc. Our ZixOne business completes with products and services offered by companies such as AirWatch/VMWare, Citrix (with XenMobile), Good Technology, IBM/Fiberlink (with MaaS360), Microsoft (with ActiveSync), and MobileIron. Strong competition requires us to develop new technology solutions and service offerings to expand the functionality and value that we offer to our customers. Some of our competitors bundle their competing products and services with products and services that we do not offer, which could make our offering less attractive by comparison. As a result of the bundling by these competitors, it can be difficult for our customers to compare the cost of our offerings with competing offerings. In some instances, competing products and services may seem to be offered by our competitors at little to no additional cost to the customer. In addition, our competitors may develop products and services that are perceived by customers as equivalent to, or having advantages over, our products and services. Competitors could capture a significant share in our markets, causing our sales and revenue to decline or grow more slowly. Barriers to entry are relatively low, and new ventures are often formed that create products competitive with our products. Competitive pressures could lead to price discounting or to increases in expenses such as advertising and marketing costs. Increased competition could also decrease demand for our products and services. Competition could reduce our revenues and net income and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nIndustry consolidation may lead to increased competition and may harm our operating results.\nThere has been a trend toward industry consolidation in our industry for several years. We expect this trend to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving industry and as companies are acquired or are unable to continue operations. For example, some of our current and potential competitors have made acquisitions, or announced new strategic alliances. Companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors, thereby reducing their business with us. We believe that industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete as sole-source vendors for customers. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and financial results.\nSome competitors have advantages that may allow them to compete more effectively than us, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nSome of our competitors have longer operating histories, more extensive operations, greater name recognition, larger technical staffs, bigger product development and acquisition budgets, established relationships with more distributors and hardware vendors, and greater financial and marketing resources than we do. These advantages might enable them (independently or through alliances) to develop and expand functionality of products and services faster than we can, to spend more money to market and distribute products and services than we can, or to offer their products and services at prices lower than ours. These advantages could reduce our revenues and net income and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nWe increasingly rely on third party distributors to help us market our products and services, and our failure to succeed in those relationships could negatively affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nWe distribute an increasing percentage of our products and services by entering into alliances with third parties who can offer our products and services along with their own or our competitors\u2019 products and services. Increased reliance on third parties to market and distribute our products and services exposes us to a variety of risks. For example, we have limited control over the sales cycles of third party distributors, which could increase the length of our sales cycle, cause our revenue to fluctuate unpredictably and make it difficult to accurately forecast our revenue. In addition, we may not succeed in developing or maintaining marketing alliances. Companies with which we have marketing alliances may in the future discontinue their relationships with us, form marketing alliances with our competitors, or develop and market their own products and services that compete with ours. If a significant distributor were to discontinue its relationship with us, we could experience an interruption in the distribution of our products and services and our revenues could decline. Our failure to develop, maintain and expand strategic distribution relationships could reduce our revenues and net income and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nOur business depends on market acceptance of our products and services, and our failure to achieve and maintain influential customers could negatively affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nIn order to continue to operate profitably and grow, we must achieve and maintain broad market acceptance of our products and services at a price that provides us with an acceptable rate of return relative to our costs. We have been successful in selling our Email Encryption products and services to high-profile customers in the healthcare, financial services and government segments of the market. The acceptance and use of our products and services by those significant customers facilitates our sales to potential customers, and an expanding base of users in the Zix Directory aids in our market penetration and expansion. The loss of an influential customer of our existing products and services, or the failure to achieve sufficient market adoption of new products including ZixDLP and ZixOne, could impair our ability to expand the market penetration of our products and services, or cause us to reduce or increase prices, which could reduce our revenues and net income and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nUnfavorable economic environments could negatively affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nChallenging economic conditions worldwide have from time to time contributed, and may continue to contribute, to slowdowns in technology and networking industries at large, as well as in the specific markets in which we operate. If economic growth in those markets is slow, or credit is unavailable at a reasonable cost, current and potential customers may delay or reduce technology purchases, including the deployment or expansion of our products and services. This could result in reduced sales of our products and services, longer sales cycles, slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition. In addition, adverse economic conditions could negatively affect the cash flow of our customers and distributors, which might result in failures or delays in payments to us. This could increase our credit risk exposure and delay our recognition of revenue. Specific economic trends, such as declines in the demand for cloud computing services and computing devices, or softness in corporate information technology spending, could have a more direct impact on our business. If these conditions persist, spread or deteriorate further, our business, financial condition and financial results could be materially adversely affected.\nOur failure to keep pace with rapid technology changes could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and financial results.\nThe markets for our products and services are characterized by rapid technological developments and frequent changes in customer requirements. We must continually improve the performance, features and reliability of our products and services, particularly in response to competitive offerings, to keep pace with these developments. We must ensure that our products and services address evolving operating environments, devices, industry trends, certifications and standards. For example, we have been required to expand our offerings for virtual computer environments and mobile environments to support a broader range of mobile devices. We also may need to develop products that are compatible with new operating systems while remaining compatible with existing, popular operating systems. Our business could be harmed by our competitors announcing or introducing new products and services that could be perceived by customers as superior to ours. We spend considerable resources on technology research and development, but our research and development resources are more limited than many of our competitors. Our failure to introduce new or enhanced products on a timely basis, to keep pace with rapid industry, technological or market changes or to gain customer acceptance for our new and existing products and services, such as mobile device data protection, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and financial results.\nIf our products do not work properly, our business, financial condition and financial results could be negatively affected and we could experience negative publicity, declining sales and legal liability.\nWe produce complex products that incorporate leading-edge technology, including both hardware and software, that must operate in a wide variety of technology environments. Software may contain defects or \u201cbugs\u201d that can interfere with expected operations. There can be no assurance that our testing programs will be adequate to detect all defects prior to the product being introduced, which might decrease customer satisfaction with our products and services. The product reengineering cost to remedy a product defect could be material to our operating results. Our inability to cure a product defect could result in the temporary or permanent withdrawal of a product or service, negative publicity, damage to our reputation, failure to achieve market acceptance, lost revenue and increased expense, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and financial results.\nThe infrastructure supporting our business may suffer capacity constraints and business interruptions that could cause us to lose customers, increase our operating costs and could negatively affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nOur business depends on our providing our customers reliable, real-time access to our data centers and networks. Customers will not tolerate a service hampered by slow delivery times, unreliable service levels, service outages, or insufficient capacity. System capacity limits or constraints arising from unexpected increases in our volume of business or network traffic could cause interruptions, outages or delays in our services, or deterioration in their performance, or could impair our ability to process transactions. We may not be able to accurately project the rate of increase in usage of our systems or to timely increase capacity to accommodate increased traffic on our systems. System delays or interruptions may prevent us from efficiently providing services to our customers or other third parties, which could result in our losing customers and revenues, or incurring liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and financial results.\nOur business depends substantially on our data center facilities, and their unreliability or unavailability for a significant period could cause us to lose customers and could negatively affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nMuch of the computer and communications hardware upon which our businesses depend is located in our data center facilities in Dallas and Austin, Texas and in the United Kingdom. Our data centers might be damaged or interrupted by fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, break-ins, cyber-attacks, earthquakes, terrorist\nattacks, hostilities or war or other events. Computer viruses, equipment failure, denial of service attacks, and similar disruptions affecting the internet or our systems might cause service interruptions, delays and loss of critical data, and could prevent us from providing our services. Problems affecting our data center operations or the networks on which we rely could result in loss of revenues, increased expenses, failure to achieve market acceptance, diversion of resources, injury to our reputation, liability and increased costs. We do not carry sufficient insurance to compensate us for all losses that may occur as a result of any of these events. The occurrence of any of these events could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nOutages or problems with systems and infrastructure supplied by third parties could negatively affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nOur business relies on third-party suppliers of the telecommunications infrastructure. We use various communications service suppliers and the global internet to provide network access between our data centers, our customers and end-users of our services. If those suppliers do not enable us to provide our customers with reliable, real-time access to our systems, we may be unable to gain or retain customers. These suppliers periodically experience outages or other operational problems as a result of internal system failures or external third party actions. Though our products generally tolerate isolated supplier failures, multiple supplier outages or problems could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nThe security of our networks and data centers is critical to our business and an actual or perceived breach of security through a cyber-attack or otherwise could cause us to lose customers and could negatively affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nWe are dependent on our networks and data centers to provide our products and services. Due to the nature of the products and services we provide and the sensitive nature of the information we collect, process, store, use and transmit, we may face cyber-attacks that attempt to penetrate our networks and data centers. Our business depends on customers having and maintaining confidence that we provide effective network and security protection. To reduce the risk of a successful cyber-attack, we have implemented significant physical and logical security measures to detect, identify and mitigate threats as well as to monitor for and respond to potential breaches and incidents. Despite these security measures, our networks and data centers may remain vulnerable to cyber-attack. If a cyber-attack or other breach of security occurs, or is perceived to have occurred, in our internal systems or at our data centers and networks, it could cause negative publicity, interruption of our services, damage to our reputation, unauthorized disclosure of our customers\u2019 confidential or proprietary information (including personally identifiable information), disclosure of our intellectual property, disclosure, modification or removal of our confidential or sensitive information, loss of customers, lost revenue and increased expense (including potentially indemnification or warranty costs), any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and financial results.\nOur usage of personal information, and inadvertent exposure of confidential or personal information, could cause us to violate data privacy laws or lose customers and could negatively affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nWe transmit large amounts of encrypted personally identifiable information about individuals, such as personal healthcare or financial information. Our processing and storage of these types of data incident to transmission is subject to confidentiality agreements with our clients and handling of this data is increasingly subject to regulation around the world. These regulations may result in conflicting requirements and may change over time. Changes in requirements under these regulations may be inconsistent with our existing data management practices. If so, we could be required to fundamentally change our business activities and practices or modify our software, which could have an adverse effect on our business. Any inability to adequately address privacy concerns, even if unfounded, or to comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws, regulations and policies, could result in additional cost an liability to us, damage our reputation, inhibit sales and harm our business. Furthermore, any unauthorized disclosure of personal or other confidential information (including due to a cyber-attack) or other failure by us to comply with data privacy requirements could subject us to significant penalties, damages, remediation and other expenses, and damage to our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and financial results\nProblems with enforcing our intellectual property rights or using third party intellectual property could negatively affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nWe rely on a combination of contractual rights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents and copyrights to establish and protect intellectual property rights and other proprietary rights in our products and services. These intellectual property rights or other proprietary rights might be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. The steps we have taken to protect our proprietary information may not prevent its misuse, theft or misappropriation. Competitors may independently develop technologies or products that are substantially equivalent or superior to our products or that inappropriately incorporate our intellectual property rights or other proprietary technology into their products. Competitors may hire our former employees who may misappropriate our intellectual property rights or other proprietary technology. Some jurisdictions may not provide adequate legal protection of our intellectual property rights or other proprietary technology.\nWe may have to defend our rights in intellectual property that we use in our services, and we could be found to infringe the intellectual property rights of others, which could be disruptive and expensive to our business.\nWe may have to defend against claims that we or our customers are infringing the rights of third parties in patents, copyrights, trademarks and other intellectual property. If we acquire technology to include in our products from third parties, our exposure to infringement actions may increase because we must rely upon these third parties to verify the origin and ownership of such technology. Intellectual property litigation and controversies are disruptive and expensive. Even unmeritorious claims brought against us or our customers may harm our reputation and customer relationships, may cause us to incur significant legal and other fees to defend, and may have to be settled for significant amounts. Infringement claims could require us to develop non-infringing services or enter into expensive royalty or licensing arrangements. Our business, financial condition and financial results could be materially adversely affected if we are not able to develop non-infringing technology or license technology on commercially reasonable terms.\nWe may face risks from using \u201copen source\u201d software that could negatively affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nLike many other software companies, we use \u201copen source\u201d software in order to take advantage of common industry building blocks and to add functionality to our products quickly and inexpensively. Open source software license terms could adversely affect our intellectual property rights in our products that include open source software. Depending upon how the open source software is deployed, we could be required to offer products that use the open source software for no cost, or make available the source code for modifications or derivative works. Any of these obligations could have an adverse impact on our intellectual property rights and revenue from products incorporating the open source software. Using open source code could also cause us to inadvertently infringe third-party intellectual property rights or require us to publicly disclose proprietary information. We have processes and controls in place that are designed to address these risks and concerns, but we cannot be sure that all open source software is submitted for approval prior to use in our products nor that our process or controls will be sufficient to mitigate all risk in this regard.\nWe may fail to recruit and retain key personnel, which could impair our ability to meet key objectives.\nOur success depends on our ability to attract and retain highly-skilled technical, managerial, sales, and marketing personnel. Changes in key personnel may be disruptive to our business. It could be difficult, time consuming and expensive to replace key personnel. Integrating new key personnel may be difficult and costly. Volatility, lack of positive performance in our stock price or changes to our overall compensation program including our stock incentive program may adversely affect our ability to retain key employees, many of whom are compensated, in part, based on the performance of our stock price. The loss of services of any of our key personnel, the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring required personnel could make it difficult to meet key objectives. Any of these impairments related to our key personnel could negatively affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nGovernmental restrictions on the sale of our products and services in non-U.S. markets could negatively affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nExports of software solutions and services using encryption technology such as ours are generally restricted by the U.S. government. Although we have obtained U.S. government approval to export our service to almost all countries, the list of countries to which we (and our distributors) cannot export our products and services could be expanded in the future. In addition, some countries impose restrictions on the importation and use of encryption solutions and services such as ours. The cost of compliance with U.S. and other export laws, or our failure to obtain governmental approvals to offer our products and services in non-U.S. markets, could affect our ability to sell our products and services and could impair our international expansion. We face a variety of other legal and compliance risks. If we or our distributors fail to comply with applicable law and regulations, we may become subject to penalties, fines or restrictions that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and financial results.\nExercises of options for our common stock would dilute the ownership interests of existing shareholders and could negatively affect the value of our securities.\nWe have a significant number of outstanding options held by our employees. The exercise of options, and the resulting issuance of additional shares of our common stock, would substantially dilute the ownership interests and voting rights of our current shareholders. Issuance or sales of those additional shares could cause our securities to decline in value.", "PERMNO": 75853, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "ZIXI"}
