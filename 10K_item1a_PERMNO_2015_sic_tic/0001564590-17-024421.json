Risk Factors\nRisk Factors\nCommodity Price Levels May Affect Demand for Our Products, Which Has and Could Continue to Materially and Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations and Liquidity\nDemand for many of our products and the profitability of our operations depend primarily on the level of worldwide oil and gas exploration activity. Prevailing oil and gas prices, with an emphasis on crude oil prices, and market expectations regarding potential changes in such prices significantly affect the level of worldwide oil and gas exploration activity. During periods of\nimproved energy commodity prices, the capital spending budgets of oil and natural gas operators tend to expand, which results in increased demand for our products. Conversely, in periods when these energy commodity prices deteriorate, capital spending budgets of oil and natural gas operators tend to contract and the demand for our products generally weakens. Historically, the markets for oil and gas have been volatile and are subject to wide fluctuation in response to changes in the supply of and demand for oil and gas, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control. These factors include the level of consumer demand, supplies of oil and natural gas, regional and international economic conditions, weather conditions, domestic and foreign governmental regulations (including those related to climate change), price and availability of alternative fuels, political conditions, instability and hostilities in the Middle East and other significant oil-producing regions, increases and decreases in the supply of oil and gas, the effect of worldwide energy conservation measures and the ability of OPEC to set and maintain production levels and prices of foreign imports.\nUncertainty in the European markets and slowing economic growth in growing economies like those in China and India could lead to a decline in demand for crude oil and natural gas. Slowdowns in economic activity would likely reduce worldwide demand for energy and result in an extended period of lower crude oil and natural gas prices. Any material changes in oil and gas prices or other market trends that adversely impact seismic exploration activity would likely affect the demand for our products and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and liquidity.\nGenerally, as exists at present, imbalances in the supply and demand for oil and gas will ordinarily affect oil and gas prices and, in such circumstances, our company will be adversely affected as now with world supplies exceeding demand.\nOur New Products Require a Substantial Investment by Us in Research and Development Expense and May Not Achieve Market Acceptance\nOur outlook and assumptions are based on various macro-economic factors and internal assessments, and actual market conditions could vary materially from those assumed. In recent years, we have incurred significant expenditures to fund our research and development efforts, and we intend to continue those expenditures in the future. However, research and development is by its nature speculative, and we cannot assure you that these expenditures will result in the development of new products or services or that any new products and services we have developed recently or may develop in the future will be commercially marketable or profitable to us. In particular, we have incurred substantial expenditures to develop our land and marine wireless nodal seismic data acquisition systems, as well as other seismic products for PRM applications. In addition, we try to use some of our capabilities to supply products to new markets. We cannot assure you that we will realize our expectations regarding acceptance of and revenue generated by our new products and services in existing or new markets.\nThe Short Term Nature of Our Order Backlog and Delayed or Canceled Customer Orders May Cause Us to Experience Fluctuations in Quarterly Results of Operations\nHistorically, the rate of new orders for our products has varied substantially from quarter to quarter. Moreover, we typically operate, and expect to continue operating, on the basis of orders in-hand for our products before we commence substantial manufacturing \u201cruns.\u201d The short-term nature of our order backlog for most products generally does not allow us to predict with any accuracy demand for our products more than approximately three months in advance. Thus, our ability to replenish orders and the completion of orders, particularly large orders for deep water PRM projects, can significantly impact our operating results and cash flow for any quarter, and results of operations for any one quarter may not be indicative of results of operations for future quarters.\nAdditionally, customers can delay or even cancel orders and rental contracts before delivery. For larger orders, we attempt to negotiate for a non-refundable deposit or cancellation penalties depending on our relationship with the customer. However, such deposits or penalties, even when obtained, may not fully compensate us for our inventory investment and forgone profits if the order is ultimately cancelled.\nThese periodic fluctuations in our operating results and the impact of any order delays/cancellations could adversely affect our stock price.\nOur Credit Risk Could Increase and We May Incur Bad Debt Write-Offs if Our Customers Continue to Face Difficult Economic Circumstances\nWe believe that our allowance for bad debts is adequate in light of known circumstances. However, we cannot assure you that additional amounts attributable to uncollectible accounts and notes receivable and bad debt write-offs will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations. Many of our seismic customers are not well capitalized and as a result cannot always pay our invoices when due. We have in the past incurred write-offs in our accounts and notes receivable due to customer credit problems. We have found it necessary from time to time to extend trade credit, including promissory notes, to long-term customers and others where some risks of non-payment exist. With the recent decline in oil prices and a decline in seismic activities around the world, some of our seismic customers may experience significant liquidity difficulties, which increase those credit risks. An increase in the level of bad debts and any deterioration in our credit risk could adversely affect the price of our stock. In addition,\nwe rent equipment to our customers which utilize such equipment in various countries around the world. If our rental customers experience financial difficulties, it could be difficult or impossible to retrieve our rental equipment from foreign countries.\nOur Industry is Characterized by Rapid Technological Development and Product Obsolescence, Which May Affect Our Ability to Provide Product Enhancements or New Products on a Timely and Cost Effective Basis\nOur instruments and equipment are constantly undergoing rapid technological improvement. Our future success depends on our ability to continue to:\n\u2022\nimprove our existing product lines,\n\u2022\naddress the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers,\n\u2022\nmaintain a reputation for technological leadership,\n\u2022\nmaintain market acceptance of our products,\n\u2022\nanticipate changes in technology and industry standards,\n\u2022\nrespond to technological developments on a timely basis and\n\u2022\ndevelop new markets for our products and capabilities.\nCurrent competitors or new market entrants may develop new technologies, products or standards that could render our products obsolete. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in developing and marketing, on a timely and cost effective basis, product enhancements or new products that respond to technological developments, that are accepted in the marketplace or that comply with new industry standards. Additionally, in anticipation of customer product orders, from time to time we acquire substantial quantities of inventories, which if not sold or integrated into products within a reasonable period of time, could become obsolete. In such case, we would be required to impair the value of such inventories on our balance sheet.\nWe Operate in Highly Competitive Markets and Our Competitors May Be Able to Provide Newer or Better Products Than We Are Able to Provide\nThe markets for most of our products are highly competitive. Many of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater marketing, financial and technical resources than we do. Some competitors currently offer a broader range of instruments and equipment for sale than we do and may offer financing arrangements to customers on terms that we may not be able to match. In addition, new competitors may enter the market and competition could intensify. As to our non-seismic imaging solutions, we compete with other printing solutions, including inkjet and laser printing technologies, many of which are provided by large companies with significant resources.\nWe cannot assure you that revenue from our products will continue at current volumes or prices if current competitors or new market entrants introduce new products with better features, performance, price or other characteristics than our products. Competitive pressures or other factors may also result in significant price competition that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe Limited Market for Our Seismic Products Can Affect Our Revenue in the Seismic Business Segment\nIn our seismic business segment, we generally market our traditional and wireless products to seismic service contractors. We estimate that, based on published industry sources, fewer than 50 seismic contracting companies are currently operating in countries other than those operating in the Russian Federation and the former Soviet Union, India, the People\u2019s Republic of China and certain Eastern European countries, where seismic data acquisition activity is difficult to verify. We estimate that fewer than 20 seismic contractors are engaged in marine seismic exploration. Due to these market factors, a relatively small number of customers, some of whom are experiencing financial difficulties, account for most of our revenue. From time to time, these seismic contractors have sought to vertically integrate and acquire our competitors, which has influenced their supplier decisions before and after such transactions. In addition, consolidation among our customers may further concentrate our business to a limited number of customers and expose us to increased risks related to dependence on a small number of customers. The loss of a small number of these customers could materially and adversely impact revenue from of our seismic products. We market our seabed PRM systems products to large oil and gas companies. Since this product\u2019s introduction in 2002, we have received system orders from three offshore oil and gas operators: BP, Shell and Statoil, which have accounted for a significant portion of our revenue in fiscal year 2014 and prior fiscal years. We did not deliver nor have we received orders for any PRM systems since 2014.\nWe Cannot Be Certain of the Effectiveness of Patent Protection on Our Products\nWe hold and from time to time apply for certain patents relating to some of our seismic products. We cannot assure you that our patents will prove enforceable or free of challenge, that any patents will be issued for which we have applied or that competitors will not develop functionally similar technology outside the protection of any patents we have or may obtain.\nOur Foreign Subsidiaries and Foreign Marketing Efforts Are Subject to Additional Political, Economic, Legal and Other Uncertainties Not Generally Associated with Domestic Operations\nBased on customer billing data, revenue to customers outside the United States accounted for approximately 35% of our revenue during fiscal year 2017; however, we believe the percentage of revenue outside the United States is likely higher since many of our products are first delivered to a domestic location and ultimately shipped to a foreign location. We again expect revenue outside of the United States to represent a substantial portion of our revenue for fiscal year 2018 and subsequent years.\nForeign revenue is subject to special risks inherent in doing business outside of the United States, including the risk of war, terrorist activities, civil disturbances, embargo and government activities, shifting foreign attitudes about conducting business activities with the United States, restrictions of the movement and exchange of funds, inhibitions of our ability to collect accounts receivable, international sanctions, expropriation and nationalization of our assets or those of our customers, currency fluctuations, devaluations and conversion restrictions, confiscatory taxation or other adverse tax policies and governmental actions that may result in the deprivation of our contractual rights, all of which may disrupt markets or our operations.\nA portion of our manufacturing is conducted through our subsidiary Geospace Technologies Eurasia, which is based in the Russian Federation. Our business could be directly affected by political and economic conditions in the Russian Federation, including the current geopolitical instability involving the Russian Federation, Ukraine and Syria. United States sanctions against Russia have been expanded to preclude export of seismic equipment anywhere in the world that involve persons designated under the sanctions and to include projects in which persons subject to the sanctions have a 33% ownership interest. Together, these changes make it more difficult for us to support projects that have the potential to produce oil involving Russian energy companies. Furthermore, if an exporter is unable to determine whether its seismic equipment will be used in such projects, the export is prohibited. In fiscal year 2017, we imported $1.4 million of products from Geospace Technologies Eurasia for resale elsewhere in the world. If imports of these products from the Russian Federation are restricted by government regulation, we may be forced to find other sources for these products at potentially higher costs. Boycotts, protests, unfavorable regulations, additional governmental sanctions and other actions in the region could also adversely affect our ability to operate profitably. Delays in obtaining governmental approvals can affect our ability to timely deliver our products pursuant to contractual obligations, which could result in us being liable to our customers for damages. The risk of doing business in the Russian Federation and other economically or politically volatile areas could adversely affect our operations and earnings.\nForeign revenue is also generally subject to the risk of compliance with additional laws, including tariff regulations and import and export restrictions. International revenue transactions for our products containing hydrophones require prior U.S. government approval in the form of an export license, which may be withheld by the U.S. government based upon factors which we cannot predict.\nWe may experience difficulties in connection with future foreign revenue. Additionally, due to foreign laws and restrictions, should we experience substantial growth in certain foreign markets, for example in the Russian Federation, we may not be able to transfer cash balances to the United States to assist with debt servicing or other obligations.\nOur Global Operations Expose Us to Risks Associated with Conducting Business Internationally, Including Failure to Comply with U.S. Laws Which Apply to International Operations, Such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and U.S. Export Control Laws, as well as the Laws of Other Countries\nWe have offices in Colombia, Canada, China, the Russian Federation and the United Kingdom, in addition to our offices in the United States. In addition to the risks noted above that are inherent in conducting business internationally, we are also liable for compliance with international and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations. These laws and regulations include data privacy requirements, labor relations laws, tax laws, anti-competition regulations, import and trade restrictions, export control laws, U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws in other countries which also prohibit certain payments to governmental officials or certain payments or remunerations to customers. Many of our products are subject to U.S. export law restrictions that limit the destinations and types of customers to which our products may be sold, or require an export license in connection with revenue transactions outside the United States. Given the high level of complexity of these laws, there is a risk that some provisions may be inadvertently breached, for example through the negligent or the unauthorized intentional behavior of individual employees, our failure to comply with certain formal documentation requirements or otherwise. Additionally, we may be held liable for actions taken by our local dealers and partners. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, and prohibitions on the conduct of our business. Any such violations could include prohibitions on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries and could materially damage our reputation, our brands, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business and our operating results.\nOur Strategy of Leasing Seismic Products Exposes Us to Additional Risks Relating to Equipment Recovery, Lease Renewals, Technological Obsolescence and Impairment of Assets\nOur rental fleet of seismic equipment represents a significant portion of our assets and accounts for a growing portion of our revenue. Equipment leased by our customers is frequently located in foreign countries where retrieval of the equipment after the termination of the lease is difficult or impossible if the customer does not return the equipment. The costs associated with retrieving this equipment or the loss of equipment that is not retrieved could be significant and could adversely affect our operations and earnings.\nThe advancement of seismic technology having a significant competitive advantage over the equipment in our rental fleet could have an adverse effect on our ability to profitably lease and/or sell this equipment. Significant improvements in technology may also require us to record asset impairment charges to write-down the value of our rental fleet investment and to invest significant sums to upgrade or replace our rental fleet with newer equipment demanded by our customers. In addition, rental contracts may not be renewed for equipment in our rental fleet, whether or not it has become obsolete. Significant technology improvements by our competitors could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and earnings.\nOur equipment leasing business has high fixed costs, which primarily consist of depreciation expenses. In periods of declining rental revenue, these fixed costs generally do not decline. As a result, any significant decline in rental revenue caused by reduced demand could adversely affect our results of operations.\nCybersecurity Breaches and Other Disruptions of Our Information Technology Network and Systems Could Adversely Affect Our Business\nWe rely on information technology networks and systems, some of which are owned and operated by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information. In particular, we depend on our information technology infrastructure for a variety of functions, including worldwide financial reporting, inventory management, procurement, invoicing and email communications. Any of these systems may be susceptible to outages due to fire, floods, power loss, telecommunications failures, terrorist attacks and similar events. Despite the implementation of network security measures, our systems and those of third parties on which we rely may also be vulnerable to computer viruses, break-ins, malware and similar disruptions. Malware, if surreptitiously installed on our systems and not timely detected and removed, could collect and disclose sensitive information relating to our customers, employees or others, exposing us to legal liability and causing us to suffer reputational damage. It could also lead to disruptions in critical systems or the corruption or destruction of critical data. If we are unable to prevent such outages and breaches, these events could damage our reputation and lead to financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability.\nBecause We Have No Plans to Pay Any Dividends for the Foreseeable Future, Investors Must Look Solely to Stock Appreciation for a Return on Their Investment in Us\nWe have not paid cash dividends on our common stock since our incorporation and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain any future earnings to support our operations and growth. Any payment of cash dividends in the future will be dependent on the amount of funds legally available, our financial condition, capital requirements, loan covenants and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment.\nUnfavorable Currency Exchange Rate Fluctuations Could Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations\nSubstantially all of our third-party revenue from the United States is invoiced in U.S. dollars, though from time to time we may invoice revenue transactions in foreign currencies including intercompany sales. As a result, we may be subject to foreign currency fluctuations on our revenue. The reporting currency for our financial statements is the U.S. dollar. However, the assets, liabilities, revenue and costs of our Russian, Canadian and United Kingdom subsidiaries and our Chinese and Colombian branch offices are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. To prepare our consolidated financial statements, we must translate those assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses into U.S. dollars at then-applicable exchange rates. Consequently, increases and decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar versus these other currencies will affect the amount of these items in our consolidated financial statements, even if their value has not changed in their original currency. These translations could result in significant changes to our results of operations from period to period. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017, approximately 22.2% of our consolidated revenue related to the operations of our foreign subsidiaries and branches.\nWe Have a Relatively Small Public Float, and Our Stock Price May be Volatile\nAt September 30, 2017, we have approximately 13.0 million shares outstanding held by non-affiliates. This small float results in a relatively limited market for our common stock. Our daily trading volume for the year ended September 30, 2017\naveraged approximately 52,000 shares. Our small float and daily trading volumes have in the past caused, and may in the future result in, significant volatility in our stock price.\nWe Rely on Key Suppliers for Certain Components Used in Our Products\nWe no longer manufacture thermal film and now purchase all of our thermal film from a European manufacturer. Except for the film sold to us by this manufacturer, we know of no other source for thermal film that performs as well in our imaging equipment. If the European manufacturer were to discontinue producing thermal film, were to become unwilling to contract with us on competitive terms or were unable to supply thermal film in sufficient quantities to meet our requirements, our ability to compete in the direct thermal imaging marketplace could be impaired, which could adversely affect our financial performance.\nCertain models of our marine wireless products require a timing device we purchase from a United States manufacturer. We currently do not possess the ability to manufacture this component and have no other source for this device. If this manufacturer were to discontinue its production of this timing device, were to become unwilling to contract with us on competitive terms or were unable to supply the component in sufficient quantities to meet our requirements, our ability to compete in the marine wireless marketplace could be impaired, which could adversely affect our financial performance.\nOur Success Depends Upon a Limited Number of Key Personnel\nOur success depends on attracting and retaining highly skilled professionals. A number of our employees are highly skilled engineers and other professionals. In addition, our success depends to a significant extent upon the abilities and efforts of the members of our senior management team. If we fail to continue to attract and retain such professionals, our ability to compete in the industry could be adversely affected.\nA Continued General Downturn in the Economy in Future Periods May Adversely Affect Our Business\nUncertainty in the European markets and slowing growth in China and India and any other economic slowdown in future periods, could adversely affect our business in ways that we cannot predict. During times of economic slowdown, our customers may reduce their capital expenditures and defer or cancel pending projects and product orders. Such developments occur even among customers that are not experiencing financial difficulties. Any economic downturn may adversely affect the demand for oil and gas generally or cause volatility in oil and gas commodity prices and, therefore, adversely affect the demand for delivery of our products to the oil and gas industry. It could also adversely affect the demand for consumer and industrial products, which could in turn adversely affect our non-seismic business segment. To the extent these factors adversely affect other seismic companies in the industry, there could be an oversupply of products and services and downward pressure on pricing for seismic products and services, which could adversely affect us. Additionally, bankruptcies or financial difficulties among our customers could reduce our cash flows and adversely impact our liquidity and profitability. See \u201cThe Limited Market for Our Seismic Products Can Affect Our Revenue in the Seismic Business Segment,\u201d above.\nWe Have a Minimal Disaster Recovery Program at Our Houston Facilities\nDue to its proximity to the Texas Gulf Coast, our facilities in Houston, Texas are annually subject to the threat of hurricanes, and the aftermath that follows. Hurricanes may cause, among other types of damage, the loss of electrical power for extended periods of time. If we lost electrical power at our Pinemont facility, or if a fire or other natural disaster occurred, we would be unable to continue our manufacturing operations during the power outage because we do not own a generator or any other back-up power source large enough to provide for our manufacturing power consumption needs. Additionally, we do not have an alternative manufacturing or operating location in the United States. Therefore, a significant disruption in our manufacturing operations could materially and adversely affect our business operations during an extended period of a power outage, fire or other natural disaster. We have a back-up generator to provide power for our information technology operations. We store our back-up data offsite and we replicate our mission critical data to an alternative cloud-based data center on a real-time basis. In the event of a major service interruption in our data center, we believe we would be able to activate our mission critical applications within less than 24 hours.\nOur Credit Agreement Imposes Restrictions on Our Business\nWe and several of our subsidiaries are parties to a credit agreement with a bank. Amounts available for borrowing under the credit agreement are determined by a borrowing base, which is determined based upon the book value of certain of our assets. The credit agreement limits the incurrence of additional indebtedness, requires the maintenance of a single financial ratio that compares certain of our and our U.S. subsidiaries\u2019 assets to certain of our liabilities, restricts our and our U.S. subsidiaries\u2019 ability to pay cash dividends and contains other covenants customary in agreements of this type. Our ability to comply with these restrictions may be affected by events beyond our control, including, but not limited to, prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions and continuing declines in our product revenue. The breach of any of these covenants or restrictions, as well as any failure to make a\npayment of interest or principal when due, could result in a default under the credit agreement. Such a default would permit our lender to declare any amounts borrowed from it to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest, and the ability to borrow under the credit agreement could be terminated. If we are unable to repay any debts owed to our lender, the lender could proceed against the collateral securing that debt. While we intend to seek alternative sources of cash in such a situation, there is no guarantee that any alternative cash source would be available or would be available on terms favorable to us.\nReliance on Third Party Subcontractors Could Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations and Reputation\nWe may rely on subcontractors to complete certain projects. The quality and timing of production and services by our subcontractors is not totally under our control. Reliance on subcontractors gives us less control over a project and exposes us to significant risks, including late delivery, substandard quality and high costs. The failure of our subcontractors to deliver quality products or services in a timely manner could adversely affect our profitability and reputation.\nThe High Fixed Costs of Our Operations Could Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations\nWe have a high fixed cost structure primarily consisting of (i) depreciation expenses associated with our rental equipment and (ii) fixed manufacturing costs including salaries and benefits, taxes, insurance, maintenance, depreciation and other fixed manufacturing costs. In regards to our rental equipment, large declines in the demand for rental equipment could result in substantial operating losses due to the on-going nature of rental equipment depreciation expense. Concerning our product manufacturing costs, in periods of low product demand our fixed costs generally do not decline or may decline only in modest increments. Therefore lower demand for our rental equipment and manufactured products could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur Long-Lived Assets May be Subject to Impairment\nWe periodically assess our long-lived assets for impairment. Significant sustained future decreases in oil and natural gas prices may require us to write down the value of these assets if future cash flows anticipated to be generated from the related assets fall below the asset\u2019s net book value. If we are forced to write down the value of our long-lived assets, these noncash asset impairments could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur Use of Percentage-of-Completion Method of Accounting Could Result in Volatility in Our Results of Operations\nWe recognize revenue and profits on certain PRM systems using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. Although we currently have no orders in hand that will require us to utilize the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, we anticipate that such contracts will again occur in the future although we can give no assurances in this regard. This accounting method requires us to estimate contract costs and the profitability of our long-term contracts. While such estimates may be reasonably reliable when made, these estimates can change as a result of uncertainties associated with these types of contracts. Accordingly, we review the contract price and cost estimates periodically as our manufacturing efforts progress, and the cumulative impact of any periodic revisions to the contract price or cost estimates will be reflected in the period in which these changes become known, including, to the extent required, the recognition of losses at the time such losses are known and estimable, and such losses could be material. In addition, change orders can increase (sometimes substantially) the future scope and cost of a job. Therefore, change order awards (although frequently beneficial in the long-term) can have the short-term effect of reducing the contract\u2019s percentage-of-completion and, thus, the revenue and profits that otherwise would be recognized to date.\nWe have concluded that certain of our previously issued financial statements should not be relied upon and are restating certain of our previously issued financial statement, which may lead to, among other things, loss of investor confidence, negative impact on our stock price and certain other risks.\nAs discussed in the Explanatory Note to this Annual Report on Form 10-K and Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d, including Notes 21and 22 of the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, on November 16, 2017 our Audit Committee concluded that our audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and the unaudited consolidated financial statements for quarters ended December 31, 2016, March 31, 2017 and June 30, 2017 should no longer be relied upon because of an accounting error. The determination that the applicable financial statements should no longer be relied upon and that certain financial statements would be restated was made following the identification of financial statement misstatements relating to classification of inventories as noncurrent assets. We have determined that a portion of our inventories at September 30, 2016 and 2015 should have been classified as non-current assets, as all inventories were not reasonably expected to be realized in cash, sold or consumed during our next operating cycle, and have corrected this error with restated consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2016 and 2015 and as of December 31, 2016, March 31, 2017 and June 30, 2017 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Although the restatement does not affect previously reported total assets, total liabilities, revenues, net loss, loss per share, or cash flows, the restatement makes us subject to additional risks and uncertainties, including unanticipated costs for accounting and legal fees. Such events may also cause a diversion of our management\u2019s time and attention away from key projects. The restatement, or additional restatements in the future, may lead to a loss of investor confidence and declines in the trading price of our securities.\nWe have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, and this or other material weaknesses, or inadequate remediation measures, could impair our ability to report accurate financial information in a timely manner, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act). As disclosed in Item 9A. \u201cControls and Procedures\u201d, our management identified a material weakness relating to the error in our classification of current assets with respect to inventories. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company\u2019s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As a result of this material weakness, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2017, based on the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013). If our remedial measures are insufficient to address the material weakness, or if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control are discovered or occur in the future, our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and may not be available in a timely manner and we could be required to restate our financial statements which could lead to substantial additional costs for accounting and legal fees.\nShould We Fail to Maintain an Effective System of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, We May Not Be Able to Accurately Report Our Financial Results and Prevent Material Fraud, Which Could Adversely Affect the Value of Our Common Stock\nEffective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent and detect material fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent or detect material fraud, our operating results could be misstated. There can be no assurances that we will be able to prevent control deficiencies from occurring and which could cause us to incur unforeseen costs, negatively impact our results of operations, cause the market price of our common stock to decline, or have other potential adverse consequences.", "PERMNO": 85567, "SIC": 3829, "TIC": "GEOS"}
