Additional risks or uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently believe are immaterial, may also impair our business operations.\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Industry\nWe participate in a highly competitive market and increased competition may adversely affect our business.\nWe operate in a market that is highly competitive. We compete on several fronts, both domestically and internationally, including competing with other companies that provide similar offerings to pharmaceutical, biotechnology and consumer health companies based in North America, Latin America, Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. We also may compete with the internal operations of those pharmaceutical, biotechnology and consumer health manufacturers that choose to source these offerings internally, where possible.\nWe face material competition in each of our markets. Competition is driven by proprietary technologies and know-how, capabilities, consistency of operational performance, quality, price, value and speed. Some competitors may have greater financial, research and development, operational and marketing resources than we do. Competition may also increase as additional companies enter our markets or use their existing resources to compete directly with ours. Expanded competition from companies in low-cost jurisdictions, such as India and China, may in the future adversely affect our results of operations or limit our growth. Greater financial, research and development, operational and marketing resources may allow our competitors to respond more quickly with new, alternative or emerging technologies. Changes in the nature or extent of our customer requirements may render our offerings obsolete or non-competitive and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe demand for our offerings depends in part on our customers\u2019 research and development and the clinical and market success of their products. Our business, financial condition and results of operations may be harmed if our customers spend less on, or are less successful in, these activities.\nOur customers are engaged in research, development, production and marketing of pharmaceutical, biotechnology and consumer health products. The amount of customer spending on research, development, production and marketing, as well as the outcomes of such research, development, and marketing activities, have a large impact on our sales and profitability, particularly the amount our customers choose to spend on our offerings. Our customers determine the amounts that they will spend based upon, among other things, available resources and their need to develop new products, which, in turn, is dependent upon a number of factors, including their competitors\u2019 research, development and production initiatives, and the anticipated market uptake, clinical and reimbursement scenarios for specific products and therapeutic areas. In addition, consolidation in the industries in which our customers operate may have an impact on such spending as customers integrate acquired operations, including research and development departments and their budgets. Our customers finance their research and development spending from private and public sources. A reduction in spending by our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If our customers are not successful in attaining or retaining product sales due to market conditions, reimbursement issues or other factors, our results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nWe are subject to product and other liability risks that could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.\nWe are subject to potentially significant product liability and other liability risks that are inherent in the design, development, manufacture and marketing of our offerings. We may be named as a defendant in product liability lawsuits, which may allege that our offerings have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition or injury to consumers. Such lawsuits could be costly to defend and could result in reduced sales, significant liabilities and diversion of management\u2019s time, attention and resources. Even claims without merit could subject us to adverse publicity and require us to incur significant legal fees.\nFurthermore, product liability claims and lawsuits, regardless of their ultimate outcome, could have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial condition and reputation and on our ability to attract and retain customers. We have historically sought to manage this risk through the combination of product liability insurance and contractual indemnities and liability limitations in our agreements with customers and vendors. The availability of product liability insurance for companies in the pharmaceutical industry is generally more limited than insurance available to companies in other industries. Insurance carriers providing product liability insurance to those in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries generally limit the amount of available policy limits, require larger self-insured retentions and exclude coverage for certain products and claims.\nWe maintain product liability insurance with annual aggregate limits in excess of $25 million. There can be no assurance that a successful product liability claim or other liability claim would be adequately covered by our applicable insurance policies or by any applicable contractual indemnity or liability limitations.\nFailure to comply with existing and future regulatory requirements could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe healthcare industry is highly regulated. We are subject to various local, state, federal, foreign and transnational laws and regulations, which include the operating and security standards of the DEA, the FDA, various state boards of pharmacy, state health departments, the DHHS, the EU member states and other comparable agencies and, in the future, any changes to such laws and regulations could adversely affect us. In particular, we are subject to laws and regulations concerning good manufacturing practices and drug safety. Our subsidiaries may be required to register for permits and/or licenses with, and may be required to comply with the laws and regulations of the DEA, the FDA, the DHHS, foreign agencies including the EMA, and other various state boards of pharmacy, state health departments and/or comparable state agencies as well as certain accrediting bodies depending upon the type of operations and location of product distribution, manufacturing and sale.\nThe manufacture, distribution and marketing of our offerings for use in our customers\u2019 products are subject to extensive ongoing regulation by the FDA, the DEA, the EMA, and other equivalent local, state, federal and foreign regulatory authorities. Failure by us or by our customers to comply with the requirements of these regulatory authorities could result in warning letters, product recalls or seizures, monetary sanctions, injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution, restrictions on our operations, civil or criminal sanctions, or withdrawal of existing or denial of pending approvals, including those relating to products or facilities. In addition, such a failure could expose us to contractual or product liability claims as well as contractual claims from our customers, including claims for reimbursement for lost or damaged active pharmaceutical ingredients, which cost could be significant.\nIn addition, any new offering or product classified as a pharmaceutical product must undergo lengthy and rigorous clinical testing and other extensive, costly and time-consuming procedures mandated by the FDA, the EMA and other equivalent local, state, federal and foreign regulatory authorities. We or our customers may elect to delay or cancel anticipated regulatory submissions for current or proposed new products for any number of reasons.\nAlthough we believe that we comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that a regulatory agency or tribunal would not reach a different conclusion concerning the compliance of our operations with applicable laws and regulations. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or renew existing permits, licenses or any other regulatory approvals or obtain, without significant delay, future permits, licenses or other approvals needed for the operation of our businesses. Any noncompliance by us with applicable laws and regulations or the failure to maintain, renew or obtain necessary permits and licenses could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nFailure to provide quality offerings to our customers could have an adverse effect on our business and subject us to regulatory actions and costly litigation.\nOur results depend on our ability to execute and improve when necessary our quality management strategy and systems, and effectively train and maintain our employee base with respect to quality management. Quality management plays an essential role in determining and meeting customer requirements, preventing defects and improving our offerings. While we have a network of quality systems throughout our business units and facilities that relate to the design, formulation, development, manufacturing, packaging, sterilization, handling, distribution and labeling of our customers\u2019 products which use our offerings, quality and safety issues may occur with respect to any of our offerings. A quality or safety issue could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and may subject us to regulatory actions, including product recalls, product seizures, injunctions to halt manufacture or distribution, restrictions on our operations, or civil sanctions, including monetary sanctions and criminal actions. In addition, such an issue could subject us to costly litigation, including claims from our customers for reimbursement for the cost of lost or damaged active pharmaceutical ingredients, the cost of which could be significant.\nThe services and offerings we provide are highly exacting and complex, and if we encounter problems providing the services or support required, our business could suffer.\nThe offerings we provide are highly exacting and complex, particularly in our Medication Delivery Solutions segment, due in part to strict regulatory requirements. From time to time, problems may arise in connection with facility operations or during preparation or provision of an offering, in both cases for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, equipment\nmalfunction, sterility variances or failures, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, problems with raw materials, environmental factors and damage to, or loss of, manufacturing operations due to fire, flood or similar causes. Such problems could affect production of a particular batch or series of batches, requiring the destruction of product, or could halt facility production altogether. This could, among other things, lead to increased costs, lost revenue, damage to customer relations, reimbursement to customers for lost active pharmaceutical ingredients, time and expense spent investigating the cause and, depending on the cause, similar losses with respect to other batches or products. Production problems in our drug and biologic manufacturing operations could be particularly significant because the cost of raw materials is often higher than in our other businesses. If problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market, recall and product liability costs may also be incurred. In addition, such risks may be greater at facilities that are new or going through significant expansion or renovation.\nOur global operations are subject to a number of economic, political and regulatory risks.\nWe conduct our operations in various regions of the world, including North America, South America, Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. Global economic and regulatory developments affect businesses such as ours in many ways. Our operations are subject to the effects of global competition, including potential competition from manufacturers in low-cost jurisdictions such as India and China. Local jurisdiction risks include regulatory risks arising from local laws. Our global operations are also affected by local economic environments, including inflation and recession. Political changes, some of which may be disruptive, can interfere with our supply chain and customers and some or all of our activities in a particular location. While some of these risks can be hedged using derivatives or other financial instruments and some are insurable, such attempts to mitigate these risks are costly and not always successful. Also, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can adversely affect our consolidated financial results.\nIf we do not enhance our existing or introduce new technology or service offerings in a timely manner, our offerings may become obsolete over time, customers may not buy our offerings and our revenue and profitability may decline.\nThe healthcare industry is characterized by rapid technological change. Demand for our offerings may change in ways we may not anticipate because of such evolving industry standards as well as a result of evolving customer needs that are increasingly sophisticated and varied and the introduction by others of new offerings and technologies that provide alternatives to our offerings. Several of our higher margin offerings are based on proprietary technologies. The patents for these technologies will ultimately expire, and these offerings may become subject to competition. Without the timely introduction of enhanced or new offerings, our offerings may become obsolete over time, in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer. For example, if we are unable to respond to changes in the nature or extent of the technological or other needs of our pharmaceutical customers through enhancing our offerings, our competition may develop offering portfolios that are more competitive than ours and we could find it more difficult to renew or expand existing agreements or obtain new agreements. Innovations directed at continuing to offer enhanced or new offerings generally will require a substantial investment before we can determine their commercial viability, and we may not have the financial resources necessary to fund these innovations.\nThe success of enhanced or new offerings will depend on several factors, including our ability to:\n\u2022\nproperly anticipate and satisfy customer needs, including increasing demand for lower cost products;\n\u2022\nenhance, innovate, develop and manufacture new offerings in an economical and timely manner;\n\u2022\ndifferentiate our offerings from competitors\u2019 offerings;\n\u2022\nachieve positive clinical outcomes for our customers\u2019 new products;\n\u2022\nmeet safety requirements and other regulatory requirements of governmental agencies;\n\u2022\nobtain valid and enforceable intellectual property rights; and\n\u2022\navoid infringing the proprietary rights of third parties.\nEven if we succeed in creating enhanced or new offerings from these innovations, they may still fail to result in commercially successful offerings or may not produce revenue in excess of the costs of development, and they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences or the introduction by our competitors of offerings embodying new technologies or features. Finally, innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace because of, among other things, entrenched patterns of clinical practice, the need for regulatory clearance and uncertainty over market access or government or third-party reimbursement.\nWe and our customers depend on patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and other forms of intellectual property protections, but, these protections may not be adequate.\nWe rely on a combination of know-how, trade secrets, patents, copyrights and trademarks and other intellectual property laws, nondisclosure and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect a number of our offerings and intangible assets. These proprietary rights are important to our ongoing operations. There can be no assurance that these protections will prove meaningful against competitive offerings or otherwise be commercially valuable or that we will be successful in obtaining additional intellectual property or enforcing our intellectual property rights against unauthorized users. Our exclusive rights under certain of our offerings are protected by patents, some of which will expire in the near term. When patents covering an offering expire, loss of exclusivity may occur and this may force us to compete with third parties, thereby affecting our revenue and profitability. We do not currently expect any material loss of revenue to occur as a result of the expiration of any Catalent patent.\nOur proprietary rights may be invalidated, circumvented or challenged. We have in the past been subject to patent oppositions before the European Patent Office and we may in the future be subject to patent oppositions in Europe or other jurisdictions in which we hold patent rights. In addition, in the future, we may need to take legal actions to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. The outcome of any such legal action may be unfavorable to us.\nThese legal actions regardless of outcome might result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention. Although we use reasonable efforts to protect our proprietary and confidential information, there can be no assurance that our confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements will not be breached, our trade secrets will not otherwise become known by competitors or that we will have adequate remedies in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of proprietary information. Even if the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property is upheld, a court might construe our intellectual property not to cover the alleged infringement. In addition, intellectual property enforcement may be unavailable in some foreign countries. There can be no assurance that our competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology or that third parties will not design around our patent claims to produce competitive offerings. The use of our technology or similar technology by others could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage we have developed, cause us to lose sales or otherwise harm our business.\nWe have applied in the United States and certain foreign countries for registration of a number of trademarks, service marks and patents, some of which have been registered or issued, and also claim common law rights in various trademarks and service marks. In the past, third parties have opposed our applications to register intellectual property and there can be no assurance that they will not do so in the future. It is possible that in some cases we may be unable to obtain the registrations for trademarks, service marks and patents for which we have applied and a failure to obtain trademark and patent registrations in the United States or other countries could limit our ability to protect our trademarks and proprietary technologies and impede our marketing efforts in those jurisdictions.\nOur use of certain intellectual property rights is also subject to license agreements with third parties for certain patents, software and information technology systems and proprietary technologies. If these license agreements were terminated for any reason, it could result in the loss of our rights to this intellectual property, our operations may be materially adversely affected and we may be unable to commercialize certain offerings.\nIn addition, many of our branded pharmaceutical customers rely on patents to protect their products from generic competition. Because incentives exist in some countries, including the United States, for generic pharmaceutical companies to challenge these patents, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are under the ongoing threat of a challenge to their patents. If our customers\u2019 patents were successfully challenged and as a result subjected to generic competition, the market for our customers\u2019 products could be significantly adversely affected, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur future results of operations are subject to fluctuations in the costs, availability, and suitability of the components of the products we manufacture, including active pharmaceutical ingredients, excipients, purchased components, and raw materials.\nWe depend on various active pharmaceutical ingredients, components, compounds, raw materials, and energy supplied primarily by others for our offerings. This includes, but is not limited to, gelatin, starch, iota carrageenan, petroleum-based products and resin. Also, our customers frequently provide their active pharmaceutical or biologic ingredient for formulation or incorporation in the finished product. It is possible that any of our customer supplier relationships could be interrupted due to\nnatural disasters, international supply disruptions caused by pandemics, geopolitical issues and other events, or could be terminated in the future.\nFor example, gelatin is a key component in our Oral Technologies segment. Gelatin is available from only a limited number of sources. In addition, much of the gelatin we use is bovine-derived. Past concerns of contamination from BSE have narrowed the number of possible sources of particular types of gelatin. If there were a future disruption in the supply of gelatin from any one or more key suppliers, we may not be able to obtain an adequate alternative supply from our other suppliers. If future restrictions were to emerge on the use of bovine-derived gelatin due to concerns of contamination from BSE, any such restriction could hinder our ability to timely supply our customers with products and the use of alternative non-bovine-derived gelatin could be subject to lengthy formulation, testing and regulatory approval.\nAny sustained interruption in our receipt of adequate supplies could have an adverse effect on us. In addition, while we have processes intended to reduce volatility in component and material pricing, we may not be able to successfully manage price fluctuations and future price fluctuations or shortages may have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nChanges in market access or healthcare reimbursement for our customers\u2019 products in the United States or internationally could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe healthcare industry has changed significantly over time, and we expect the industry to continue to evolve. Some of these changes, such as ongoing healthcare reform, adverse changes in governmental or private funding of healthcare products and services, legislation or regulations governing patient access to care and privacy, or the delivery, pricing or reimbursement approval of pharmaceuticals and healthcare services or mandated benefits, may cause healthcare industry participants to change the amount of our offerings they purchase or the price they are willing to pay for our offerings. Changes in the healthcare industry\u2019s pricing, selling, inventory, distribution or supply policies or practices could also significantly reduce our revenue and results of operations. In particular, volatility in individual product demand may result from changes in public or private payer reimbursement or coverage.\nFluctuations in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar and other foreign currencies could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance and results of operations.\nAs a company with many international operations, certain revenues, costs, assets and liabilities, including a portion of our senior secured credit facilities, are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, changes in the exchange rates of these currencies or any other applicable currency to the U.S. dollar will affect our revenues, earnings and cash flows and could result in unrealized and realized exchange losses despite any efforts we may undertake to manage or mitigate our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations.\nTax legislation initiatives or challenges to our tax positions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are a large multinational corporation with operations in the United States and international jurisdictions, including North America, South America, Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. As such, we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the United States federal, state and local governments and of many international jurisdictions. From time to time, various legislative initiatives may be proposed that could adversely affect our tax positions. There can be no assurance that our effective tax rate or tax payments will not be adversely affected by these initiatives. In addition, United States federal, state and local, as well as international tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. There can be no assurance that our tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nWe have net operating loss carryforwards available to reduce future taxable income. Utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to a substantial limitation under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), and comparable provisions of state, local and foreign tax laws due to changes in ownership of our company that may occur in the future. Under Section 382 of the Code and comparable provisions of state, local and foreign tax laws, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d generally defined as a greater than 50% change by value in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation\u2019s ability to carryforward its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards to reduce its post-change income may be limited. We may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of future changes in our stock ownership. As a result, if we generate taxable income in future years, our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carryforwards to reduce U.S. federal and state taxable income may be subject to limitations, which could result in increased future tax liability to us.\nWe may be required to re-establish a full valuation allowance against our U.S. deferred tax assets in the future.\nWe have deferred tax assets for net operating loss carryforwards and other temporary differences. We currently do not maintain a valuation allowance for a portion of our U.S. net deferred tax assets. We may experience, in the future, a decline in U.S. federal taxable income, resulting from a decline in profitability of our U.S. operations, an increased level of debt in the U.S. or other factors. In assessing our ability to realize our U.S. deferred tax assets, we may conclude that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of our U.S. deferred tax assets will not be realized. As a result, we may be required to record a full valuation allowance against our U.S. deferred tax assets, which could adversely impact our effective income tax rate.\nWe are dependent on key personnel.\nWe depend on senior executive officers and other key personnel, including our technical personnel, to operate and grow our business and to develop new enhancements, offerings and technologies. The loss of any of these officers or other key personnel combined with a failure to attract and retain suitably skilled technical personnel could adversely affect our operations.\nIn addition to our executive officers, we rely on approximately 150 senior employees to lead and direct the Company. Our senior leadership team (\u201cSLT\u201d) is comprised of our executive officers and other vice presidents and directors who hold critical positions and possess specialized talents and capabilities that give us a competitive advantage in the market. The members of the SLT hold positions such as general manager of manufacturing, general manager of analytical and development laboratories, vice president/general manager of business unit commercial development, director of operations, and vice president of quality and regulatory activities.\nWith respect to our technical talent, we have approximately 900 scientists and technicians whose areas of expertise and specialization cover subjects such as advanced delivery, drug and biologics formulation and manufacturing. Many of our sites and laboratories are located in competitive labor markets like Morrisville, North Carolina; Brussels, Belgium; Woodstock, Illinois; Madison, Wisconsin; and Schorndorf, Germany. Global and regional competitors and, in some cases, customers and suppliers, compete for the same skills and talent as we do.\nRisks generally associated with information and communications systems could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe rely on information systems in our business to obtain, rapidly process, analyze and manage data to:\n\u2022\nfacilitate the manufacture and distribution of thousands of inventory items to and from our facilities;\n\u2022\nreceive, process and ship orders on a timely basis;\n\u2022\nmanage the accurate billing and collections for thousands of customers;\n\u2022\nmanage the accurate accounting and payment for thousands of vendors; and\n\u2022\nschedule and operate our global network of development, manufacturing and packaging facilities.\nOur results of operations could be adversely affected if these systems are interrupted, damaged by unforeseen events or fail for any extended period of time, including due to the actions of third parties.\nWe may in the future engage in acquisitions and other transactions that may complement or expand our business or divest of non-strategic businesses or assets. We may not be able to complete such transactions, and such transactions, if executed, pose significant risks and could have a negative effect on our operations.\nOur future success may be dependent on opportunities to buy other businesses or technologies and possibly enter into joint ventures that could complement, enhance or expand our current business or offerings and services or that might otherwise offer us growth opportunities. We may face competition from other companies in pursuing acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry. Our ability to acquire targets may also be limited by applicable antitrust laws and other regulations in the United States and other foreign jurisdictions in which we do business. To the extent that we are successful in making acquisitions, we may have to expend substantial amounts of cash, incur debt and assume loss-making divisions. We may not be able to complete such transactions, for reasons including, but not limited to, a failure to secure financing. Any transactions that we are able to identify and complete may involve a number of risks, including the diversion of management\u2019s attention to integrate the acquired businesses or joint ventures, the possible adverse effects on our operating results during the integration process, the potential loss of customers or employees in connection with the acquisition, delays or reduction in realizing expected synergies, unexpected liabilities relating to a joint venture of acquired business and our potential inability to achieve our intended objectives for the transaction. In addition, we may be unable to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies, and this may lead to operational inefficiencies.\nTo the extent that we are not successful in completing divestitures, as such may be determined by future strategic plans and business performance, we may have to expend substantial amounts of cash, incur debt and continue to absorb loss-making or under-performing divisions. Any divestitures that we are unable to complete may involve a number of risks, including diversion of management\u2019s attention, a negative impact on our customer relationships, costs associated with retaining the targeted divestiture, closing and disposing of the affected business or transferring business to other facilities.\nOur offerings and our customers\u2019 products may infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties.\nFrom time to time, third parties have asserted intellectual property infringement claims against us and our customers and there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against either us or our customers in the future. While we believe that our offerings do not infringe in any material respect upon proprietary rights of other parties and/or that meritorious defenses would exist with respect to any assertions to the contrary, there can be no assurance that we would not be found to infringe on the proprietary rights of others. Patent applications in the United States and some foreign countries are generally not publicly disclosed until the patent is issued or published, and we may not be aware of currently filed patent applications that relate to our offerings or processes. If patents later issue on these applications, we may be found liable for subsequent infringement. There has been substantial litigation in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries with respect to the manufacture, use and sale of products that are the subject of conflicting patent rights.\nAny claims that our offerings or processes infringe these rights (including claims arising through our contractual indemnification of our customers), regardless of their merit or resolution, could be costly and may divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel. We may not prevail in such proceedings given the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in intellectual property litigation. If such proceedings result in an adverse outcome, we could, among other things, be required to:\n\u2022\npay substantial damages (potentially treble damages in the United States);\n\u2022\ncease the manufacture, use or sale of the infringing offerings or processes;\n\u2022\ndiscontinue the use of the infringing technology;\n\u2022\nexpend significant resources to develop non-infringing technology;\n\u2022\nlicense technology from the third party claiming infringement, which license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or may not be available at all; and\n\u2022\nlose the opportunity to license our technology to others or to collect royalty payments based upon successful protection and assertion of our intellectual property against others.\nIn addition, our customers\u2019 products may be subject to claims of intellectual property infringement and such claims could materially affect our business if their products cease to be manufactured or they have to discontinue the use of the infringing technology.\nAny of the foregoing could affect our ability to compete or have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, which could increase our costs and restrict our operations in the future.\nOur operations are subject to a variety of environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those of the EPA and the U.S. Occupational Safety & Health Administration and equivalent local, state, and foreign regulatory agencies in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. These laws and regulations govern, among other things, air emissions, wastewater discharges, the use, handling and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, soil and groundwater contamination and employee health and safety. Any failure by us to comply with environmental, health and safety requirements could result in the limitation or suspension of production or subject us to monetary fines or civil or criminal sanctions, or other future liabilities in excess of our reserves. We are also subject to laws and regulations governing the destruction and disposal of raw materials and non-compliant products, the handling of regulated material that are included in our offerings, and the disposal of our offerings at the end of their useful life. In addition, compliance with environmental, health and safety requirements could restrict our ability to expand our facilities or require us to acquire costly pollution control equipment, incur other significant expenses or modify our manufacturing processes. Our manufacturing facilities may use, in varying degrees, hazardous substances in their processes. These substances include, among others, chlorinated solvents, and in the past chlorinated solvents were used at one or more of our facilities, including a number we no longer own or operate. As at our current facilities, contamination at such formerly owned or operated properties can result and has resulted in liability to us. In the event of the discovery of new or previously unknown contamination either at our facilities or at third-party locations, including facilities we formerly owned or operated, the issuance of additional requirements with respect to existing contamination, or the imposition of other cleanup obligations for which we are responsible, we may be required to take additional, unplanned remedial measures for which no reserves have been recorded. We are conducting monitoring and cleanup of contamination at certain facilities currently or formerly owned or operated by us. We have established accounting reserves for certain contamination liabilities but cannot assure you that such liabilities will not exceed our reserves.\nWe are subject to labor and employment laws and regulations, which could increase our costs and restrict our operations in the future.\nWe employ approximately 8,700 employees worldwide, including approximately 3,600 employees in North America, 3,500 in Europe, 900 in South America and 700 in the Asia/Pacific region. Certain employees at one of our North American facilities are represented by a labor organization, and national works councils and/or labor organizations are active at all of our European facilities consistent with labor environments/laws in European countries. Similar relationships with labor organizations or national works councils exist in our plants in Argentina, Brazil and Australia. Our management believes that our employee relations are satisfactory. However, further organizing activities or collective bargaining may increase our employment-related costs and we may be subject to work stoppages and other labor disruptions. Moreover, as employers are subject to various employment-related claims, such as individual and class actions relating to alleged employment discrimination, wage-hour and labor standards issues, such actions, if brought against us and successful in whole or in part, may affect our ability to compete or have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCertain of our pension plans are underfunded, and additional cash contributions we may make will reduce the cash available for our business, such as the payment of our interest expense.\nCertain of our current and former employees in the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, France, Japan and Australia are participants in defined benefit pension plans that we sponsor. As of June 30, 2015, the underfunded amount of our pension plans on a worldwide basis was approximately $101.7 million, primarily related to our fiscal 2012 plans in the United Kingdom and Germany. In addition, we have an estimated obligation of approximately $39.5 million, as of June 30, 2015, related to our withdrawal from a multiemployer pension plan in which we participated, resulting in a total underfunded amount related to our pension plans of $141.2 million as of June 30, 2015. In general, the amount of future contributions to the underfunded plans will depend upon asset returns and a number of other factors and, as a result, the amount we may be required to contribute to such plans in the future may vary. Such cash contributions to the plans will reduce the cash available for our business to pursue strategic growth initiatives or the payment of interest expense on the notes or our other indebtedness.\nRisks Relating to Our Indebtedness\nOur substantial leverage could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or in our industry, expose us to interest-rate risk to the extent of our variable rate debt and prevent us from meeting our obligations under our indebtedness.\nWe are highly leveraged. As of June 30, 2015, we had $1,826.8 million (dollar equivalent) of senior indebtedness; an additional $188.3 million of un-utilized capacity and $11.7 million of outstanding letters of credit under our revolving credit facility.\nOur high degree of leverage could have important consequences for us, including:\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to adverse economic, industry or competitive developments;\n\u2022\nexposing us to the risk of increased interest rates because certain of our borrowings, including borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities, are at variable rates of interest;\n\u2022\nexposing us to the risk of fluctuations in exchange rates because certain of our borrowings, including certain of our senior secured term loan facilities, are denominated in euros;\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness, and any failure to comply with the obligations of any of our debt instruments, including restrictive covenants and borrowing conditions, could result in an event of default under the agreements governing such indebtedness;\n\u2022\nrestricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, product development, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes; and\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who are less highly leveraged and who, therefore, may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our leverage prevents us from exploiting.\nOur total interest expense, net was $105.0 million, $163.1 million and $203.2 million for fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. After taking into consideration our ratio of fixed-to-floating rate debt, a 100 basis point increase in such rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately $0.6 million.\nDespite our high indebtedness level, we and our subsidiaries will still be able to incur significant additional amounts of debt, which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. Although the agreements governing our indebtedness contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions and, under certain circumstances, the amount of indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial.\nOur debt agreements contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business.\nThe agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness contain various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. These covenants limit the ability of our subsidiary, Catalent Pharma Solutions, Inc., and its restricted subsidiaries to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness and issue certain preferred stock;\n\u2022\npay certain dividends on, repurchase or make distributions in respect of capital stock or make other restricted payments;\n\u2022\nplace limitations on distributions from restricted subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nissue or sell capital stock of restricted subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nguarantee certain indebtedness;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments;\n\u2022\nsell or exchange assets;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\ncreate certain liens; and\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of their assets and the assets of their subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.\nA breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under one or more of these agreements, including as a result of cross default provisions, and, in the case of our revolving credit facility, permit the lenders to cease making loans to us.\nWe may utilize derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to market risks from changes in interest rates on our variable-rate indebtedness and we will be exposed to risks related to counterparty credit worthiness or non-performance of these instruments.\nWe may enter into pay-fixed interest-rate swaps to limit our exposure to changes in variable interest rates. Such instruments may result in economic losses should exchange rates decline to a point lower than our fixed-rate commitments. We will be exposed to credit-related losses that could adversely affect our results of operations in the event of fluctuations in the fair value of the interest-rate swaps due to a change in the credit worthiness or non-performance by the counterparties to the interest-rate swaps.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nOur stock price may change significantly, and you may not be able to resell shares of our common stock at or above the price you paid or at all, and you could lose all or part of your investment as a result.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been, and continues to be volatile. Since shares of our common stock were offered for sale in our initial public offering on July 31, 2014 through June 30, 2015, our common stock price ranged from $19.85 to $32.11. The trading price of our common stock may be adversely affected due to a number of factors such as those listed in \u201cRisks Related to Our Business and Our Industry\u201d and the following:\n\u2022\nresults of operations that vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors;\n\u2022\nresults of operations that vary from those of our competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in expectations as to our future financial performance, including financial estimates and investment recommendations by securities analysts and investors;\n\u2022\ndeclines in the market prices of stocks generally, or those of pharmaceutical or other healthcare companies;\n\u2022\nstrategic actions by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, new products, acquisitions, joint marketing relationships, joint ventures, other strategic relationships or capital commitments;\n\u2022\nchanges in general economic or market conditions or trends in our industry or markets;\n\u2022\nchanges in business or regulatory conditions;\n\u2022\nfuture sales of our common stock or other securities;\n\u2022\ninvestor perceptions or the investment opportunity associated with our common stock relative to other investment alternatives;\n\u2022\nthe public response to press releases or other public announcements by us or third parties, including our filings with the SEC;\n\u2022\nannouncements relating to litigation;\n\u2022\nguidance, if any, that we provide to the public, any changes in this guidance or our failure to meet this guidance;\n\u2022\nthe development and sustainability of an active trading market for our stock;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting principles; and\n\u2022\nother events or factors, including those resulting from natural disasters, war, acts of terrorism or responses to these events.\nBroad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. In addition, price volatility may be greater if the public float and trading volume of our common stock is low, and the amount of public float on any given day can vary depending on whether our stockholders choose to hold for the long term.\nIn the past, following periods of market volatility, stockholders have instituted securities class action litigation. If we were involved in securities litigation, it could have a substantial cost and divert resources and the attention of executive management from our business regardless of the outcome of such litigation.\nBecause we have no plans to pay cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future, you may not receive any return on investment unless you sell your common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it.\nWe currently intend to retain future earnings, if any, for future operations, expansion and debt repayment and have no current plans to pay any cash dividend for the foreseeable future. The declaration, amount and payment of any future dividend on shares of our common stock will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors. Our board of directors may take into account general and economic conditions, our financial condition and results of operations, our available cash and current and anticipated cash needs, possible future favorable deployment of our cash, our future capital requirements, contractual, legal, tax and regulatory restrictions and implications on the payment of dividends by us to our stockholders or by our subsidiaries to us and such other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant. In addition, our ability to pay dividends is limited by covenants of our outstanding indebtedness and may be limited by covenants of any future indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur. As a result, you may not receive any return on an investment in our common stock unless you sell our common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it.\nIf securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they downgrade our stock or our sector, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock relies in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business. We do not control these analysts. Furthermore, if one or more of the analysts who do cover us downgrade our stock or our industry, or change their views regarding the stock of any of our competitors or other healthcare sector companies, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the price of our stock could decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of the Company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the market, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nFuture sales, or the perception of future sales of common stock, by us or our existing stockholders could cause the market price for our common stock to decline.\nThe sale of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could harm the prevailing market price of shares of our common stock. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate.\nAs of September 1, 2015, 151,304 shares of our common stock, representing less than 1% of our total outstanding shares of common stock, are \u201crestricted securities\u201d within the meaning of Rule 144 of the Securities Act (\u201cRule 144\u201d) and subject to certain restrictions on resale. Restricted securities may be sold in the public market only if they are registered under the Securities Act or are sold pursuant to an exemption from registration such as Rule 144.\nIn addition, 1,242,291 shares of common stock will be eligible for sale upon exercise of vested options. A total of 6.7 million shares of common stock was reserved for issuance under the 2014 Omnibus Incentive Plan, of which 4,335,548 shares of common stock remain available for future issuance at September 1, 2015. These shares can be sold in the public market upon issuance, subject to restrictions under the securities laws applicable to resales by affiliates.\nPursuant to a registration rights agreement, certain holders of restricted shares, subject to certain conditions, may require us to register or otherwise facilitate the sale under the Securities Act of their shares of common stock. Any exercise of their registration rights, or any sale by one or more of them of a substantial number of shares, could cause the then-prevailing market price of our common stock to decline. The shares subject to the registration rights agreement represent approximately 23.6% of our outstanding common stock.\nThe market price of shares of our common stock could drop significantly if the holders of these shares sell them or are perceived by the market as intending to sell them. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to raise additional funds through future offerings of shares of our common stock that we wish to issue or other securities. In the future, we may also issue our securities in connection with investments or acquisitions. The amount of shares of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of then-outstanding shares of our common stock. Any issuance of additional securities in connection with investments or acquisitions may result in dilution to you.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents could delay or prevent a change of control.\nCertain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may have an anti-takeover effect and may delay, defer or prevent a merger, acquisition, tender offer, takeover attempt or other change of control transaction that a stockholder might consider in its best interest, including those attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares held by our stockholders.\nThese provisions provide for, among other things:\n\u2022a classified board of directors with staggered three-year terms;\n\u2022the ability of our board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock;\n\u2022\nadvance notice for nominations of directors by stockholders and for stockholders to include matters to be considered at our annual meetings;\n\u2022\ncertain limitations on convening special stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\nthe removal of directors only for cause and only upon the affirmative vote of holders of at least 66 2/3% of the shares of common stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors; and\n\u2022\nthat certain provisions may be amended only by the affirmative vote of at least 66 2/3% of the shares of common stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors.\nThese anti-takeover provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if the third-party\u2019s offer may be considered beneficial by many of our stockholders. As a result, our stockholders may be limited in their ability to obtain a premium for their shares.\nAffiliates of Blackstone have substantial influence over us, and their interests may conflict with ours or yours in the future.\nAffiliates of Blackstone beneficially own approximately 21% of our common stock. As a result, investment funds associated with or designated by affiliates of Blackstone have the ability to influence the election of the members of our board of directors and thereby affect our policies and operations, including the appointment of management, future issuances of our common stock or other securities, the payment of dividends, if any, on our common stock, the incurrence or modification of debt by us, amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and the entering into of extraordinary transactions, and their interests may not in all cases be aligned with your interests. In addition, Blackstone may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures and other transactions that, in its judgment, could enhance its investment, even though such transactions might involve risks to you.\nBlackstone is in the business of making investments in companies and may from time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. For example, Blackstone has made investments in Biomet, Inc., Emcure Pharmaceuticals Ltd., Apria Healthcare Group Inc., Nycomed Holding A/S, DJO Global LLC, Independent Clinical Services Ltd, Southern Cross Healthcare Group PLC, Stiefel Laboratories, Inc., Team Health Holdings, Inc. and Vanguard Health Systems, Inc.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that none of Blackstone, any of its affiliates or any director who is not employed by us (including any non-employee director who serves as one of our officers in both his director and officer capacities) or his or her affiliates has any duty to refrain from engaging, directly or indirectly, in the same business activities or similar business activities or lines of business in which we operate. Blackstone also may pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business, and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. So long as Blackstone continues to own a significant amount of our combined voting power, Blackstone will continue to be able to strongly influence our decisions, and, so long as Blackstone and its affiliates collectively own at least 5% of all outstanding shares of our stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, it will be able to appoint individuals to our board of directors under a stockholders agreement. The concentration of ownership could deprive you of an opportunity to receive a premium for your shares of common stock as part of a sale of the Company and ultimately might affect the market price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 14763, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "CTLT"}
