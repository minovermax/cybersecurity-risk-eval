RISK FACTORS\nWhen considering any investment in NJR's securities, investors should consider the following risk factors, as well as the information contained under the caption \u201cForward-Looking Statements,\u201d in analyzing the Company's present and future business performance. While this list is not exhaustive, NJR's management also places no priority or likelihood based on their descriptions or order of presentation. Unless indicated otherwise or the content requires otherwise, references below to \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d and \u201cour\u201d should be read to refer to NJR and its subsidiaries.\nInability of NJR and/or NJNG to access the financial markets and conditions in the credit markets could affect management's ability to execute their respective business plans.\nWe rely on access to both short-term and long-term credit markets as significant sources of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by our cash flow from operations. Any deterioration in our financial condition could hamper our ability to access the credit markets or otherwise obtain debt financing. Because certain state regulatory approvals may be necessary in order for NJNG to incur debt, NJNG may not be able to access credit markets on a timely basis.\nExternal events could also increase the cost of borrowing or adversely affect the ability to access the financial markets. Such external events could include the following:\n\u2022\neconomic weakness and or political instability in the U.S. or in the regions where we operate;\n\u2022\npolitical conditions, such as a shutdown of the U.S. federal government;\n\u2022\nfinancial difficulties of unrelated energy companies;\n\u2022\ncapital market conditions generally;\n\u2022\nmarket prices for natural gas;\n\u2022\nthe overall health of the natural gas utility industry; and\n\u2022\nfluctuations in interest rates, particularly with respect to NJNG's variable rate debt instruments.\nOur ability to secure short-term financing is subject to conditions in the credit markets. A prolonged constriction of credit availability could affect management's ability to execute our business plan. An inability to access capital may limit the ability to pursue improvements or acquisitions that we may otherwise rely on for both current operations and future growth.\nNJRES and NJNG execute derivative transactions with financial institutions as a part of their economic hedging strategy and could incur losses associated with the inability of a financial counterparty to meet or perform under its obligations as a result of adverse conditions in the credit markets or their ability to access capital or post collateral.\nNJR is a holding company and depends on its operating subsidiaries to meet its financial obligations.\nNJR is a holding company with no significant assets other than possible cash investments and the stock of its operating subsidiaries. We rely exclusively on dividends from our subsidiaries, on intercompany loans from our unregulated subsidiaries, and on the repayments of principal and interest from intercompany loans and reimbursement of expenses from our subsidiaries\nNew Jersey Resources Corporation\nPart I\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\nfor our cash flows. Our ability to pay dividends on our common stock and to pay principal and interest on our outstanding debt depends on the payment of dividends to us by our subsidiaries or the repayment of loans to us by our subsidiaries. The extent to which our subsidiaries do not pay dividends or repay funds to us may adversely affect our ability to pay dividends to holders of our common stock and principal and interest to holders of our debt.\nCredit rating downgrades could increase financing costs, limit access to the financial markets and negatively affect NJR and its subsidiaries.\nRating agencies Moody's and S&P currently rate NJNG's debt as investment grade. If such ratings are downgraded below investment grade, borrowing costs could increase, as will the costs of maintaining certain contractual relationships and obtaining future financing. Even if ratings are downgraded without falling below investment grade, NJR and NJNG could face increased borrowing costs under their current credit facilities. Our ability to borrow and costs of borrowing have a direct impact on our subsidiaries' ability to execute their operating strategies, particularly in the case of NJNG, which relies heavily upon capital expenditures financed by its credit facility.\nIf we suffer a reduction in our credit and borrowing capacity or in our ability to issue parental guarantees, the business prospects of NJRES, NJRCEV and Midstream, which rely on our creditworthiness, would be adversely affected. NJRES could possibly be required to comply with various margin or other credit enhancement obligations under its trading and marketing contracts, and it may be unable to continue to trade or be able to do so only on less favorable terms with certain counterparties. NJRCEV could be required to seek alternative financing for its projects, and may be unable to obtain such financing, or able to do so only on less favorable terms. In addition, NJNR Pipeline may not be able to finance its capital obligations to PennEast.\nAdditionally, lower credit ratings could adversely affect relationships with NJNG's state regulators, who may be unwilling to allow NJNG to pass along increased costs to its natural gas customers.\nFailure by NJR and/or NJNG to comply with debt covenants may impact our financial condition.\nOur long-term debt obligations contain financial covenants related to debt-to-capital ratios and, in the case of NJNG, an interest coverage ratio. These debt obligations also contain provisions that put limitations on our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to expand or pursue certain business activities. For example, certain of these agreements contain provisions that, among other things, put limitations on our ability to make loans or investments, make material changes to the nature of our businesses, merge, consolidate or engage in asset sales, grant liens or make negative pledges. Furthermore, the debt obligations contain covenants and other provisions requiring us to provide timely delivery of accurate financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. The failure to comply with any of these covenants could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of outstanding debt obligations and/or the inability to borrow under existing revolving credit facilities. We have relied, and continue to rely, upon short-term bank borrowings or commercial paper supported by our revolving credit facilities to finance the execution of a portion of our operating strategies. NJNG is dependent on these capital sources to purchase its natural gas supply and maintain its properties. The acceleration of our outstanding debt obligations and our inability to borrow under the existing revolving credit facilities would cause a material adverse change in NJR's and NJNG's financial condition.\nThe cost of providing pension and postemployment health care benefits to eligible former employees is subject to changes in pension fund values, interest rates and changing demographics and may have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nWe have two defined benefit pension plans and two OPEB plans for the benefit of eligible full-time employees and qualified retirees, which were closed to all employees hired on or after January 1, 2012. The cost of providing these benefits to eligible current and former employees is subject to changes in the market value of the pension and OPEB fund assets, changing discount rates and changing actuarial assumptions based upon demographics, including longer life expectancy of beneficiaries, an expected increase in the number of eligible former employees over the next five years, impacts from healthcare legislation and increases in health care costs.\nSignificant declines in equity markets and/or reductions in bond yields can have a material adverse effect on the funded status of our pension and OPEB plans. In these circumstances, we may be required to recognize increased pension and OPEB expenses and/or be required to make additional cash contributions into the plans.\nThe funded status of these plans, and the related cost reflected in our financial statements, are affected by various factors that are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. Under the Pension Protection Act of 2006, losses of asset values may necessitate increased funding of the plans in the future to meet minimum federal government requirements. A significant decrease\nNew Jersey Resources Corporation\nPart I\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\nin the asset values of these plans can result in funding obligations earlier than we had originally planned, which would have a negative impact on cash flows from operations, decrease our borrowing capacity and increase our interest expense.\nOur economic hedging activities that are designed to protect against commodity and financial market risks, including the use of derivative contracts in the normal course of NJRES' business, may cause fluctuations in reported financial results and financial losses that negatively impact results of operations and our stock price.\nWe use derivatives, including futures, forwards, options, swaps and foreign exchange contracts to manage commodity, financial market and foreign currency risks. The timing of the recognition of gains or losses associated with our economic hedges in accordance with GAAP does not always coincide with the gains or losses on the items being hedged. The difference in accounting can result in volatility in reported results, even though the expected profit margin is essentially unchanged from the dates the transactions were consummated.\nIn addition, NJRES could recognize financial losses on these contracts as a result of volatility in the market values of the underlying commodities or if a counterparty fails to perform under a contract. In the absence of actively quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources, the valuation of these financial instruments can involve management's judgment or use of estimates. As a result, changes in the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could adversely affect the value of the reported fair value of these contracts.\nA change in our effective tax rate as a result of a failure to qualify for ITCs and PTCs or being delayed in qualifying for ITCs due to delays or failures to complete planned solar energy projects and wind projects within the safe harbor period may have a material impact on our earnings.\nGAAP requires NJR to apply an effective tax rate to interim periods that is consistent with our estimated annual effective tax rate. As a result, quarterly, NJR projects the annual effective tax rate and then adjusts the tax expense recorded in that quarter to reflect the projected annual effective tax rate. The amount of the quarterly adjustment is based on information and assumptions, which are subject to change and which may have a material impact on quarterly and annual NFE. Factors we consider in estimating the probability of projects being completed during the fiscal year include, but are not limited to, Board of Directors approval, execution of various contracts, including power purchase agreements, construction logistics, permitting and interconnection completion. If NJR fails to qualify for ITCs or is delayed in qualifying for some ITCs during the fiscal year due to delays or failures to complete planned solar energy projects as scheduled, our quarterly and annual net income and NFE may be materially impacted.\nFor a wind facility to be considered a qualified facility for purposes of the PTCs, the construction of the facility must have begun prior to January 1, 2015 and placed in service before January 1, 2017. A taxpayer may establish that construction has begun by starting \u201cphysical work of a significant nature.\u201d Only physical work of a significant nature on tangible personal property used as an integral part of the activity performed by the facility is considered for purposes of determining when construction begins. Alternatively, a taxpayer may establish that construction has begun by paying or incurring five percent of eligible project costs (the \u201c5 percent safe harbor\u201d).\nNJNG's operations are subject to certain operating risks incidental to handling, storing, transporting and providing customers with natural gas.\nNJNG's operations are subject to all operating hazards and risks incidental to handling, storing, transporting and providing customers with natural gas. These risks include explosions, pollution, release of toxic substances, fires, storms and other adverse weather conditions and hazards, each of which could result in damage to or destruction of facilities or damage to persons and property. NJNG could suffer substantial losses should any of these events occur. Moreover, as a result, NJNG has been, and likely will be, a defendant in legal proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. Although NJNG maintains insurance coverage, insurance may not be sufficient to cover all material expenses related to these risks.\nMajor changes in the supply and price of natural gas may affect financial results.\nWhile NJNG expects to meet the demand for natural gas from its customers for the foreseeable future, factors impacting suppliers and other third parties, including increased competition, further deregulation, transportation costs, possible climate change legislation, transportation availability and drilling for new natural gas resources, may impact the supply and price of natural gas. NJNG actively hedges against the fluctuation in the price of natural gas by entering into forward and financial contracts with third parties. Should these third parties fail to perform and regulators not allow the pass-through of expended funds to customers, it may result in a loss that could have a material impact on our financial position, cash flows and statement of operations.\nNew Jersey Resources Corporation\nPart I\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\nNJNG and NJRES rely on storage, transportation assets and suppliers that they do not own or control to deliver natural gas.\nNJNG and NJRES depend on natural gas pipelines and other storage and transportation facilities owned and operated by third parties to deliver natural gas to wholesale markets and to provide retail energy services to customers. Their ability to provide natural gas for their present and projected sales will depend upon their suppliers' ability to obtain and deliver additional supplies of natural gas, as well as NJNG's ability to acquire supplies directly from new sources. Factors beyond the control of NJNG, its suppliers and the independent suppliers who have obligations to provide natural gas to certain NJNG customers, may affect NJNG's ability to deliver such supplies. These factors include other parties' control over the drilling of new wells and the facilities to transport natural gas to NJNG's citygate stations, competition for the acquisition of natural gas, priority allocations, impact of severe weather disruptions to natural gas supplies, the regulatory and pricing policies of federal and state regulatory agencies, as well as the availability of Canadian reserves for export to the United States. Energy deregulation legislation may increase competition among natural gas utilities and impact the quantities of natural gas requirements needed for sales service. NJRES also relies on a firm supply source to meet its energy management obligations to its customers. If supply, transportation or storage is disrupted, including for reasons of force majeure, the ability of NJNG and NJRES to sell and deliver their products and services may be hindered. As a result, they may be responsible for damages incurred by their customers, such as the additional cost of acquiring alternative supply at then-current market rates. Particularly for NJRES, these conditions could have a material impact on its cash flows and statement of operations.\nAdverse economic conditions, including inflation, increased natural gas costs, foreclosures and business failures, could adversely impact NJNG's customer collections and increase our level of indebtedness.\nInflation may cause increases in certain operating and capital costs. We continually review the adequacy of NJNG's base tariff rates in relation to the increasing cost of providing service and the inherent regulatory lag in adjusting those rates. The ability to control operating expenses is an important factor that will influence future results.\nRapid increases in the price of purchased gas may cause NJNG to experience a significant increase in short-term debt because it must pay suppliers for gas when it is purchased, which can be significantly in advance of when these costs may be recovered through the collection of monthly customer bills for gas delivered. Increases in purchased gas costs also slow collection efforts as customers are more likely to delay the payment of their gas bills, leading to higher-than-normal accounts receivable.\nChanges in weather conditions may affect earnings and cash flows.\nWeather conditions and other natural phenomena can have an adverse impact on our earnings and cash flows. Severe weather conditions can impact suppliers and the pipelines that deliver gas to NJNG's distribution system. Extended mild weather, during either the winter period or summer period, can have a significant impact on demand for and the cost of natural gas. While we believe the CIP mitigates the impact of weather variations on NJNG's gross margin, severe weather conditions may have an impact on the ability of suppliers and pipelines to deliver the natural gas to NJNG, which can negatively affect our earnings. The CIP does not mitigate the impact of severe weather conditions on our cash flows.\nFuture results at NJRES are subject to volatility in the natural gas market due to weather. Variations in weather may affect earnings and working capital needs throughout the year. During periods of milder temperatures, demand and volatility in the natural gas market may decrease, which can negatively impact NJRES' earnings and cash flows.\nChanges in customer growth may affect earnings and cash flows.\nNJNG's ability to increase its utility firm gross margin is dependent upon the new construction housing market, as well as the conversion of customers to natural gas from other fuel sources. During periods of extended economic downturns, prolonged weakness in housing markets or slowdowns in the conversion market, there could be an adverse impact on NJNG's utility firm gross margin, earnings and cash flows. Furthermore, while our estimate regarding customer growth is based in part upon information from third parties, the estimate has not been verified by any independent source and is subject to the aforementioned risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to materially deviate from the estimate.\nNJRES' earnings and cash flows are dependent upon optimization of its physical assets using financial transactions.\nNJRES' earnings and cash flows are based, in part, on its ability to optimize its portfolio of contractual-based natural gas storage and pipeline assets. The optimization strategy involves utilizing its physical assets to take advantage of differences in natural gas prices between geographic locations and/or time periods. Any change among various pricing points could affect these\nNew Jersey Resources Corporation\nPart I\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\ndifferentials. In addition, significant increases in the supply of natural gas in NJRES' market areas, for example that can occur as a result of increased production along the Marcellus Shale in the Appalachian basin, can reduce NJRES' ability to find opportunities going forward. Changes in pricing dynamics and supply could have an adverse impact on NJRES' optimization activities, earnings and cash flows. NJRES incurs fixed demand fees to acquire its contractual rights to storage and transportation assets. Should commodity prices at various locations or time periods change in such a way that NJRES is not able to recoup these costs from its customers, the cash flows and earnings at NJRES, and ultimately NJR, could be adversely impacted.\nNJRES is exposed to market risk and may incur losses in wholesale services.\nThe storage and transportation portfolios at NJRES consist of contracts to transport and store natural gas. The value of NJRES' portfolio could be negatively impacted if the value of these contracts change in a direction or manner that NJRES does not anticipate. In addition, upon expiration of these storage and transportation contracts, to the extent that they are renewed or replaced at less favorable terms, our results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted.\nInvesting through partnerships, joint ventures or in an MLP decreases our ability to manage risk.\nWe have utilized joint ventures through partnerships for certain midstream investments, including Steckman Ridge and PennEast, and we own a minority interest in DM, a MLP, through our investment in DM Common Units. Although we currently have no specific plans to do so, we may acquire interests in other joint ventures or partnerships in the future. In these joint ventures or partnerships, we may not have the right or power to direct the management and policies of the joint ventures or partnerships, and other participants or investors may take action contrary to our instructions or requests and against our policies and objectives. In addition, the other participants may become bankrupt or have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with those of NJR and our subsidiaries. Our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be harmed if a joint venture participant acts contrary to our interests.\nAdditionally, our investment in DM has risks that are unique to investments in MLPs. Holders of MLP common units have limited control and voting rights on matters affecting the MLP, and investments in MLPs may have limited liquidity. Additionally, if DM is treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes as a result of a change in current law or a change in DM's business, such treatment would result in a reduction in the after-tax return to us and may cause a reduction in the value of our investment in DM Common Units.\nWe may be unable to obtain governmental approvals, property rights and/or financing for the construction, development and operation of our proposed energy investments and projects in a timely manner or at all.\nConstruction, development and operation of energy investments, such as natural gas storage facilities, NJNG infrastructure improvements such as SRL and NJ RISE, pipeline transportation systems such as PennEast, solar energy projects and onshore wind projects, are subject to federal and state regulatory oversight and require certain property rights, such as easements and rights-of-way from public and private property owners, as well as regulatory approvals, including environmental and other permits and licenses for such facilities and systems. We or our joint venture partnerships may be unable to obtain, in a cost-efficient or timely manner, all such needed property rights, permits and licenses to successfully construct and develop our energy facilities and systems. Successful financing of our energy investments requires participation by willing financial institutions and lenders, as well as acquisition of capital at favorable interest rates. If we do not obtain the necessary regulatory approvals, property rights and financing, our equity investments could be impaired. Such impairment could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur investments in distributed power projects are subject to substantial risks.\nCommercial and residential solar energy projects and onshore wind projects, such as those in which we invest are dependent upon current regulatory and tax incentives and there is uncertainty about the extent to which such incentives will be available in the future. The potential return on investment of these solar projects is based substantially on our eligibility for ITCs and the future market for SRECs that are traded in a competitive marketplace in the State of New Jersey. As a result, these projects face the risk that the current regulatory regimes and tax laws may expire or be adversely modified during the life of the projects. Furthermore, a sustained decrease in the value of SRECs would negatively impact the return on investment of solar projects. Legislative changes or declines in the price of SRECs could also lead to an impairment of solar project assets.\nIn addition, there are risks associated with our ability to develop and manage such projects profitably, including logistical risks and potential delays related to construction, permitting, regulatory approvals (including any approvals by the BPU required pursuant to recently enacted solar energy legislation in the State of New Jersey) and electric grid interconnection, as well as the\nNew Jersey Resources Corporation\nPart I\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\noperational risk that the projects in service will not perform according to expectations due to equipment failure, suboptimal weather conditions or other factors beyond our control. All of the aforementioned risks could reduce the availability of viable solar energy projects for development. Furthermore, at the development or acquisition stage, our ability to predict actual performance results may be hindered and the projects may not perform as predicted.\nRisks related to the regulation of NJNG could affect the rates it is able to charge, its costs and its profitability.\nNJNG is subject to regulation by federal, state and local authorities. These authorities regulate many aspects of NJNG's distribution operations, including construction and maintenance of facilities, operations, safety, tariff rates that NJNG can charge customers, rates of return, the authorized cost of capital, recovery of pipeline replacement, environmental remediation costs and relationships with its affiliates. NJNG's ability to obtain rate increases, including base rate increases, extend its BGSS incentive and CIP programs and maintain its currently authorized rates of return may be impacted by events, including regulatory or legislative actions and the currently pending base rate case filed on November 13, 2015. There can be no assurance that NJNG will be able to obtain rate increases and continue its BGSS incentive, CIP and SAVEGREEN programs or continue the opportunity to earn its currently authorized rates of return.\nSignificant regulatory assets recorded by NJNG could be disallowed for recovery from customers in the future.\nNJNG records regulatory assets on its financial statements to reflect the ratemaking and regulatory decision-making authority of the BPU as allowed by current GAAP. The creation of a regulatory asset allows for the deferral of costs which, absent a mechanism to recover such costs from customers in rates approved by the BPU, would be charged to expense on its income statement in the period incurred. Primary regulatory assets that are subject to BPU approval include the recovery of BGSS and USF costs, remediation costs associated with its MGP sites, CIP, NJCEP, economic stimulus plans, deferred storm costs, certain deferred income tax and pension and other postemployment benefit plans. If there were to be a change in regulatory positions surrounding the collection of these deferred costs there could be a material impact on NJNG's financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may be adversely impacted by natural disasters, pandemic illness, terrorist activities and other extreme events to which we may not be able to promptly respond.\nLocal or national natural disasters, pandemic illness, terrorist activities and other extreme events are a threat to our assets and operations. Companies in our industry that are located in our service territory may face a heightened risk due to exposure to acts of terrorism that could target or impact our natural gas distribution, transmission and storage facilities and disrupt our operations and ability to meet customer requirements. In addition, the threat of terrorist activities could lead to increased economic instability and volatility in the price of natural gas that could affect our operations. Natural disasters or actual or threatened terrorist activities may also disrupt capital markets and our ability to raise capital, or impact our suppliers or our customers directly. A local disaster or pandemic illness could result in part of our workforce being unable to operate or maintain our infrastructure or perform other tasks necessary to conduct our business. In addition, these risks could result in loss of human life, significant damage to property, environmental damage, impairment of our operations and substantial loss to the Company. Our regulators may not allow us to recover from our customers part or all of the increased cost related to the foregoing events, which could negatively affect our earnings.\nWe maintain emergency planning and training programs to readily respond to events that could cause business interruption. However, a slow or inadequate response to events may have an adverse impact on operations and earnings. We may unable to obtain sufficient insurance to cover all risks associated with local and national disasters, pandemic illness, terrorist activities and other events, which could increase the risk that an event adversely affects our operations or financial results.\nCyber-attack or failure of information technology systems could adversely affect our business operation, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe continue to place greater reliance on technological tools that support our business operations and corporate functions, including tools that help us manage our natural gas distribution operations and infrastructure. The failure of, or security breaches related to, these technologies could materially adversely affect our business operations, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe rely on information technology to manage our natural gas distribution and other corporate operations, maintain customer, employee, Company and vendor data, prepare our financial statements and perform other critical business processes. This technology may fail due to cyber-attack, physical disruption, design and implementation defects or human error. Disruption or\nNew Jersey Resources Corporation\nPart I\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\nfailure of business operations and information technology systems could harm our facilities or otherwise adversely impact our ability to safely deliver natural gas to our customers, serve our customers effectively or manage our assets. Additionally, an attack on or failure of information technology systems could result in the unauthorized release of customer, employee or other confidential or sensitive data. Any of the foregoing events could adversely affect our business reputation, diminish customer confidence, disrupt operations, subject us to financial liability or increased regulation, increase our costs and expose us to material legal claims and liability.\nThere is no guarantee that redundancies we built into our networks and technology, or the procedures we implemented to protect against cyber-attack and other unauthorized access to secured data, are adequate to safeguard against all failures of technology or security breaches.\nFailure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified employee workforce could adversely affect operations.\nOur ability to implement our business strategy and serve our customers is dependent upon our continuing ability to attract and retain talented professionals and a technically skilled workforce, and being able to transfer the knowledge and expertise of our workforce to new employees as our aging employees retire. Failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees, including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees, or the future availability and cost of contract labor could adversely affect the ability to manage and operate our business. Furthermore, the majority of our natural gas distribution segment workforce is represented by the Union and is covered by a collective bargaining agreement that will expire in December 2018. Disputes with the Union over terms and conditions of the agreement could result in instability in our labor relationship and work stoppages that could impact the timely delivery of gas and other services from our utility, which could strain relationships with customers and state regulators and cause a loss of revenues that could adversely affect our results of operations. Our collective bargaining agreement may also increase the cost of employing our natural gas distribution segment workforce, affect our ability to continue offering market-based salaries and employee benefits, limit our flexibility in dealing with our workforce, and limit our ability to change work rules and practices and implement other efficiency-related improvements to successfully compete in today's challenging marketplace.\nWe are subject to governmental regulation. Compliance with current and future regulatory requirements and procurement of necessary approvals, permits and certificates may result in substantial costs to us.\nWe are subject to substantial regulation from federal, state and local regulatory authorities. We are required to comply with numerous laws and regulations and to obtain numerous authorizations, permits, approvals and certificates from governmental agencies. These agencies regulate various aspects of our business, including customer rates, services, construction and natural gas pipeline operations.\nThe FERC has regulatory authority over some of our operations, including sales of natural gas in the wholesale market and the purchase and sale of interstate pipeline and storage capacity. Any Congressional legislation or agency regulation that would alter these or other similar statutory and regulatory structures in a way to significantly raise costs that could not be recovered in rates from customers, that would reduce the availability of supply or capacity or that would reduce our competitiveness could negatively impact our earnings. In addition, changes in and compliance with laws such as the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty and Job Creation Act of 2011 could increase federal regulatory oversight and administrative costs that may not be recovered in rates from customers, which could have an adverse impact on our earnings.\nWe cannot predict the impact of any future revisions or changes in interpretations of existing regulations or the adoption of new laws and applicable regulations. Changes in regulations or the imposition of additional regulations could influence our operating environment and may result in substantial costs to us.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws may delay or prevent a transaction that stockholders would view as favorable.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as New Jersey law, contain provisions that could delay, defer or prevent an unsolicited change in control of NJR, which may negatively affect the market price of our common stock or the ability of stockholders to participate in a transaction in which they might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over the then current market price. These provisions may also prevent changes in management. In addition, our Board of Directors is authorized to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval on such terms as our Board of Directors may determine. Our common stockholders will be subject to, and may be negatively affected by, the rights of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future. In addition, we are subject to the New Jersey Shareholders' Protection Act, which could delay or prevent a change of control of NJR.\nNew Jersey Resources Corporation\nPart I\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\nWe are involved in legal or administrative proceedings before various courts and governmental bodies that could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe are involved in legal or administrative proceedings before various courts and governmental bodies with respect to general claims, rates, taxes, environmental issues, gas cost prudence reviews and other matters. Adverse decisions regarding these matters, to the extent they require us to make payments in excess of amounts provided for in our financial statements or covered by insurance, could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nOur costs of compliance with present and future environmental laws are significant and could adversely affect our cash flows and profitability.\nOur operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental statutes, rules and regulations relating to air quality, water quality, waste management, natural resources and site remediation. Compliance with these laws and regulations may require us to expend significant financial resources to, among other things, conduct site remediation and perform environmental monitoring. If we fail to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations, even if we are unable to do so due to factors beyond our control, we may be subject to civil liabilities or criminal penalties and may be required to incur significant expenditures to come into compliance. Additionally, any alleged violations of environmental laws and regulations may require us to expend significant resources in our defense against alleged violations.\nFurthermore, the U.S. Congress has for some time been considering various forms of climate change legislation. There is a possibility that, when and if enacted, the final form of such legislation could impact our costs and put upward pressure on wholesale natural gas prices. Higher cost levels could impact the competitive position of natural gas and negatively affect our growth opportunities, cash flows and earnings.", "PERMNO": 64450, "SIC": 4924, "TIC": "NJR"}
