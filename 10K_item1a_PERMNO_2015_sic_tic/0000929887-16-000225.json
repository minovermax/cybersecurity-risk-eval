Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and all other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In order to help assess the major risks in our business, we have identified many, but not all, of these risks, categorized as Risks Related to our Pending Merger, Risks Related to the Highly Regulated Industry in Which We Operate, Risks Related to our Business and Risks Related to the Control Over our Voting Stock. Due to the scope of our operations, a wide range of factors could materially affect future developments and performance.\nIf any of the following risks are realized, our business, financial condition, cash flows and/or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected, and as a result, the trading price of our Class A common stock could be materially and adversely impacted. These risk factors should be read in conjunction with other information set forth in this Annual Report, including Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, including the related Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRisks Related to our Pending Merger\nOur pending merger may not be consummated, which may adversely affect our business, and our business may suffer during the pendency of the merger as a result of uncertainty regarding consummation.\nAs described in Part II, Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Pending Merger, on February 7, 2016, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (as amended, the \u201cMerger Agreement\u201d) with AP VIII Queso Holdings, L.P. (\u201cQueso\u201d), an affiliate of Apollo Management VIII, L.P., which is a fund managed by an affiliate of Apollo Global Management, LLC, none of which is, or has ever been, affiliated with us. At the effective time of the merger, which, subject to the satisfaction of the closing conditions, is anticipated to be on or before February 1, 2017, the date on which the contract becomes terminable by either party, each share of our issued and outstanding Class A and Class B common stock will be converted pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement into the right to receive $10.00 per share in cash. On May 6, 2016, the Merger Agreement was approved by the holders of our outstanding Class A and Class B common stock, each voting separately as a class.\nApollo Education Group, Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | 26\nConsummation of the merger is subject to customary and other conditions, including:\n(i)\nthe absence of certain conditions or restrictions in the response of the U.S. Department of Education to the pre-acquisition review application filed by University of Phoenix; and\n(ii)\nthe receipt of consents or approvals from other federal, state and foreign educational governing bodies, including the Higher Learning Commission (\u201cHLC\u201d).\nHLC has informed us that it does not intend to review our change of control application until after the Department of Education responds to our pending pre-acquisition review filing and Queso submits to the Department any required additional information. The Department\u2019s review is pending and we cannot predict how the Department will respond to our filing.\nIn addition, consummation of the merger is subject to our satisfying certain minimum operating metrics, measured as of the first or second month end preceding the closing date, depending on the day of the month on which closing occurs, as follows:\n(i)\nOur aggregate cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities must not be less than the specified amount for the applicable month end;\n(ii)\nUniversity of Phoenix fiscal year-to-date new degreed enrollments as of the applicable month end must not have declined by more than 15% from forecasted levels (which are derived from the projections we prepared in December 2015 in connection with the merger, which we refer to as the December 2015 forecast);\n(iii)\nUniversity of Phoenix trailing twelve month net revenue as of the applicable month end shall not have declined by more than 10% from forecasted levels (which are derived from the December 2015 forecast); and\n(iv)\nOur consolidated trailing twelve month adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization as of the applicable month end shall not have declined by more than $75 million from forecasted levels (which are derived from the December 2015 forecast).\nWe satisfied each of these minimum operating metrics as of September 30, 2016, which is the relevant measurement date for a closing on or prior to November 9, 2016. We currently expect to satisfy these metrics if the closing occurs on or prior to February 1, 2017, which is the date on which the contract becomes terminable by either party if the closing conditions have not been met.\nThere is no assurance that the conditions to the consummation of the merger will be satisfied in a timely manner or at all.\nIf the merger is not consummated, our stock price could fall to the extent that the current trading price is supported by an assumption that the merger will be consummated. Furthermore, if the merger is not consummated, we may suffer other consequences that could adversely affect our business and financial condition, including the following:\n\u2022\nwe could be required to pay a termination fee of 2.75% of the aggregate per share merger consideration that would have been payable to the Company\u2019s shareholders upon closing of the merger (approximately $27.5 million) under certain specified circumstances, but not including a termination solely due to our failure to satisfy the minimum operating metrics described above, as provided in the Merger Agreement;\n\u2022\na fall in our stock price could result in additional goodwill impairment charges that could result in our U.S. Department of Education fiscal year 2017 financial responsibility composite score falling below 1.5, which could severely stress our liquidity due to various regulatory consequences and could materially and adversely impact our strategy, operations and future profitability, as discussed in more detail in the risk factor below, Risks Related to the Highly Regulated Industry in Which We Operate - A failure to demonstrate \u201cfinancial responsibility\u201d or \u201cadministrative capability\u201d may result in the loss of eligibility to participate in Title IV programs and limit our access to liquidity, which would materially and adversely affect our business;\n\u2022\nour ability to enroll and retain new students could be impaired because potential students may perceive the termination of the merger as a sign of financial distress or as otherwise raising questions about the future of University of Phoenix;\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to take advantage of alternative business opportunities that we may have been able to pursue absent entering into the Merger Agreement;\n\u2022\nwe may experience a decrease in employee morale and an increase in employee departures; and\n\u2022\nthe failure of the merger to be consummated may result in negative publicity and may embolden the critics of the proprietary higher education sector generally and University of Phoenix specifically.\nApollo Education Group, Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | 27\nAlso, the pendency of the merger could adversely impact our business and financial condition, including as a result of the following:\n\u2022\nthe restrictions imposed in the Merger Agreement on our business and operations may prevent us from pursuing certain opportunities without approval of Queso;\n\u2022\nthe challenging political and regulatory environment we face may intensify in response to the proposed merger;\n\u2022\nwe may experience challenges in retaining and motivating current employees, and attracting and recruiting prospective employees;\n\u2022\nour relationships with current students and employers could be adversely affected due to concern about our future;\n\u2022\ndue to activities related to the merger, the attention of our employees and management may be diverted from other opportunities that may have been beneficial to us; and\n\u2022\nwe may incur material expenses and liabilities in connection with the various legal proceedings related to the merger that have been instituted against us, our directors and others.\nIn addition, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant costs, expenses and fees for professional services, other transaction costs and employee retention costs in connection with the merger, and these fees and costs are payable by us regardless of whether the merger is consummated.\nFor additional information related to the merger and the Merger Agreement, please refer to the following:\n\u2022\nCurrent Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 8, 2016;\n\u2022\nDefinitive Proxy Statement filed with the Commission on March 23, 2016;\n\u2022\nSupplement to the Definitive Proxy Statement filed with the Commission on May 2, 2016;\n\u2022\nAmendments to the Merger Agreement attached to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Commission on May 2, 2016; and\n\u2022\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the Commission on July 8, 2016.\nRisks Related to the Highly Regulated Industry in Which We Operate\nIf we fail to comply with the extensive regulatory requirements for our business, we could face significant monetary liabilities, fines and penalties, including loss of access to U.S. federal student loans and grants for our students.\nOur domestic operations, including University of Phoenix, are subject to extensive U.S. federal and state regulation applicable to providers of postsecondary education. The principal federal regulatory regime is established under the Higher Education Act of 1965, as it is amended and reauthorized from time to time, and the regulations promulgated under the Act by the U.S. Department of Education. Among other matters, these regulations govern the participation by University of Phoenix in federal student financial aid programs under Title IV of the Higher Education Act (\u201cTitle IV\u201d), which is the principal source of funding for students at the University. The majority of our fiscal year 2016 consolidated net revenue was derived from receipt of Title IV program funds disbursed to our students.\nThe Higher Education Act, as reauthorized, mandates specific regulatory responsibilities for each of the following components of the higher education regulatory triad: (1) the federal government through the U.S. Department of Education; (2) independent accrediting agencies recognized by the Department of Education; and (3) state higher education regulatory bodies.\nThe applicable regulatory requirements cover nearly all phases of our U.S. operations, including educational program offerings, branching and classroom locations, instructional and administrative staff, administrative procedures, marketing and recruiting, financial operations, payment of refunds to students who withdraw, maintenance of restricted cash, acquisitions or openings of new schools, commencement of new or cessation of existing educational programs and changes in our corporate structure and ownership.\nThe applicable regulations, standards and policies of the various regulatory agencies frequently change and often are subject to interpretative uncertainty, particularly where they are crafted for traditional, academic term-based schools rather than our non-term academic delivery model. Changes in, or new interpretations of, applicable laws, regulations, standards or policies could have a material adverse effect on our accreditation, authorization to operate in various states, permissible activities, receipt of funds under Title IV programs, costs of doing business and our ability to implement beneficial changes in our academic or business model. We cannot predict how the requirements administered by these agencies will be applied or interpreted in the future, or whether our schools will be able to comply with any future changes in these requirements.\nApollo Education Group, Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | 28\nIf we are found to have violated any applicable regulations, standards or policies, we may be subject to the following sanctions imposed by any one or more of the relevant regulatory agencies:\n\u2022\nMonetary fines or penalties;\n\u2022\nLimitation or termination of our operations or ability to grant degrees, diplomas and certificates;\n\u2022\nRestriction or revocation of our accreditation, licensure or other operating authority;\n\u2022\nLimitation, suspension or termination of our eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, military benefit programs or state financial aid programs;\n\u2022\nImposition by the U.S. Department of Education of heightened cash monitoring which could include a delay in the disbursement of Title IV program funds or transfer from the Department\u2019s advance system of receiving Title IV program funds to its reimbursement system, under which a school must disburse its own funds to students and document the students\u2019 eligibility for Title IV program funds before receiving such funds from the Department;\n\u2022\nRepayment of funds received under Title IV programs or state financial aid programs;\n\u2022\nRequirement to post a letter of credit with the U.S. Department of Education;\n\u2022\nOther civil or criminal penalties; and/or\n\u2022\nOther forms of censure.\nIn addition, in some circumstances of noncompliance or alleged noncompliance, we may be subject to qui tam lawsuits under the Federal False Claims Act or various, similar state false claim statutes. In these actions, private plaintiffs seek to enforce remedies under the Act on behalf of the federal government and, if successful, are entitled to recover their costs and to receive a portion of any amounts recovered by the federal government in the lawsuit. These lawsuits can be prosecuted by a private plaintiff, even if the Department does not agree with plaintiff\u2019s theory of liability. In 2009, we settled a qui tam lawsuit relating to alleged payment of incentive compensation to our enrollment counselors for a total payment of $80.5 million, and we currently are subject to qui tam lawsuits, one of which alleges payment of improper incentive compensation in subsequent periods. For more information about the pending qui tam case, refer to Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies, in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nThe proprietary higher education industry is experiencing broad-based, intensifying scrutiny in the form of coordinated investigations and enforcement actions animated at least in part by influential members of Congress and the Obama Administration who seek to terminate the eligibility of for-profit institutions to participate in Title IV or other government financial aid programs. In October 2014, the Department of Education formed an inter-agency task force involving multiple federal agencies and departments including the Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. Departments of Justice, Treasury and Veterans Affairs, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and numerous state attorneys general, to coordinate activities and share information to protect students from unfair, deceptive and abusive policies and practices by proprietary higher education institutions. We believe that the recent investigations of University of Phoenix commenced by the Federal Trade Commission and the California Attorney General are related to this coordinated scrutiny of the industry and that this coordinated scrutiny could lead to the initiation of additional inquiries or claims against us either by participants in the inter-agency task force or other regulatory authorities, any of which could adversely affect our business and reputation. We expect that this challenging political and regulatory environment will continue for the foreseeable future, and may intensify.\nAny of the penalties, funding delays, injunctions, restrictions, lawsuits or other forms of censure described above, and the associated reputational impact from ongoing investigations, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. In recent years, two major proprietary education institutions, together serving over 110,000 students, have ceased operations and filed for bankruptcy protection due to delays in or denial by the Department of Education of Title IV funding for students and requirements to post letters of credit, based in part on the existence of multiple investigations by various regulatory authorities. In neither case were the principal investigations completed nor were substantial enforcement actions commenced and prosecuted to conclusion. Accordingly, proprietary institutions are at risk of harmful delays or denial of Title IV funding for students due to investigations and other preliminary allegations, even if such investigations or allegations may ultimately be found to lack merit. If we lose our Title IV program eligibility, our business would not be sustainable. If our participation is materially conditioned or subject to material delays, we could experience a dramatic decline in revenue and we would be unable to continue our business as it currently is conducted.\nThe outcome of the November 2016 U.S. election could lead to a change in or elimination of our eligibility to participate in Title IV student financial aid programs, which could render our business unsustainable.\nThe outcome of the November 2016 elections in the U.S. could increase the risk of new legislation and changes in, or new interpretations of, existing laws, regulations, standards or policies, that would limit, perhaps materially, the eligibility of proprietary schools, such as University of Phoenix, to participate in Title IV student financial aid programs. Many such proposals have already been made by influential members of the Democratic Caucus in Congress. Furthermore, the passage of\nApollo Education Group, Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | 29\nlegislation implementing in whole or in part the Democratic Party Platform proposal to provide tuition free undergraduate education in the U.S. could significantly impact or render impractical our current domestic higher education business conducted by University of Phoenix.\nIf we fail to maintain our institutional accreditation, we would lose our ability to participate in Title IV programs, which would materially and adversely affect our business.\nIn July 2013, the accreditation of University of Phoenix was reaffirmed by the Higher Learning Commission (\u201cHLC\u201d), the University\u2019s principal accreditor, through the 2022-2023 academic year. At the same time, HLC placed the University on Notice status for a two-year period due to concerns regarding governance, student assessment and faculty scholarship/research for doctoral programs. Notice status is a sanction that means that HLC has determined that an institution is on a course of action that, if continued, could lead the institution to be out of compliance with one or more of the HLC Criteria for Accreditation or Core Components.\nThe University submitted a Notice Report to HLC in November 2014 providing evidence that the University has ameliorated the conditions that led to the Notice status and continues to meet relevant accreditation requirements. The HLC Board of Trustees subsequently removed the University from Notice status, effective June 25, 2015.\nWe believe that the imposition of the sanction of notice adversely impacted the reputation of University of Phoenix and may have contributed to the University\u2019s continuing decline in enrollment. In addition, the changes made by University of Phoenix to its corporate governance and administrative structure to address the concerns of HLC regarding independence have increased our operating costs and decreased our managerial flexibility to address the rapidly evolving and challenging postsecondary education market.\nThe University remains assigned by HLC to the Standard Pathway reaffirmation process, pursuant to which the University will host a comprehensive evaluation visit in 2017 and will undergo its next reaffirmation process in 2022-2023.\nContinued institutional accreditation is critical to University of Phoenix\u2019s business and necessary for the University to continue participating in the Title IV programs. If the University should lose its institutional accreditation, our business would be substantially impaired and we would not be able to continue our business as it is presently conducted.\nThe U.S. Department of Education gainful employment regulations may limit the programs we can offer students and increase our cost of operations.\nUnder the Higher Education Act, as reauthorized, proprietary schools are generally eligible to participate in Title IV programs only in respect of educational programs that lead to \u201cgainful employment in a recognized occupation.\u201d In connection with this requirement, proprietary postsecondary institutions are required to provide information to prospective students about each eligible program, including the relevant recognized occupations, cost, completion rate, job placement rate, and median loan debt of program completers. These reporting requirements increase our costs of operations and could adversely impact student enrollment, persistence and retention if our reported program information compares unfavorably with other reporting educational institutions.\nIn October 2014, the U.S. Department of Education published final regulations, effective July 1, 2015, on the metrics for determining whether an academic program prepares students for gainful employment in a recognized occupation. Under the final regulations, which apply on a program-by-program basis, students enrolled in a program will be eligible for Title IV student financial aid only if that program satisfies at least one of two tests relating to student debt service-to-earnings ratios. The two tests specify minimum student loan debt service-to-earnings ratios calculated on the basis of the average earnings of program graduates: one test measures student loan debt service as a percentage of total earnings, and the other test measures student loan debt service as a percentage of deemed discretionary earnings. If a program fails to meet both of the minimum ratios for one year, the institution will be required to provide a warning notice to prospective and enrolled students advising that the program may lose Title IV eligibility based on the final student loan debt service-to-earnings ratios for the next year. Programs that fail to meet both of the minimum ratios for two out of three years will immediately cease to be Title IV eligible for a period of at least three years.\nThe Department has indicated that it plans to issue the official 2014 gainful employment debt service-to-earnings ratios by January 2017, and we anticipate the 2015 ratios will be issued in early fiscal year 2018. We believe it is likely that some of University of Phoenix\u2019s programs will be impacted by the gainful employment regulations. Beginning in September 2015 and continuing through early fiscal year 2017, the University ceased enrolling or plans to cease enrolling new students in programs it believes may be impacted in connection with its initiatives to transform itself into a more focused, higher retaining and less complex institution. As of August 31, 2016, students in such programs represented approximately 15% of the University\u2019s Degreed Enrollment. Students who are currently enrolled in such programs, and who do not elect to enroll in a different University of Phoenix program, are being taught-out in due course.\nApollo Education Group, Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | 30\nChanges in student borrowing needs and practices, student loan interest rates, labor markets and other factors outside of our control could adversely impact compliance with these regulations for some of our programs in the future. The Department has not yet announced the future, annual protocol for calculating and disseminating the debt service-to-earnings ratios. We will not know of a program\u2019s failure to meet the minimum ratios until well after the measuring period, and therefore students enrolled in such a program could lose their access to federal financial aid before completing the program. Accordingly, we will not have the opportunity to make program changes for any programs that did not meet either of the minimum ratios for 2014. If those programs also do not meet either of the minimum ratios for 2015, they will lose eligibility to participate in Title IV financial aid programs at the time the official 2015 ratios are published, which we anticipate will occur in early fiscal year 2018.\nUnder these regulations, the continuing eligibility of our educational programs for Title IV funding is at risk due to factors beyond our control, such as changes in the actual or deemed income level of our graduates, changes in student borrowing levels, increases in interest rates, changes in the federal poverty income level relevant for calculating discretionary income, changes in the percentage of our former students who are current in repayment of their student loans, and other factors. The exposure to these external factors reduces our ability to confidently offer or continue certain types of programs for which there is market demand, and therefore adversely impacts our ability to maintain or grow our business.\nIn addition, if we are required to include a warning notice for any of our programs based on the debt service-to-earnings ratios, enrollment in those programs may decline materially, particularly in light of the recent widely-publicized difficulties experienced by students who were enrolled in schools that have closed. Accordingly, the inclusion of these required warnings could make continuation of the affected programs impractical, even if students in the programs are still eligible to participate in Title IV programs.\nIf any of our programs require a warning notice or cease to be eligible for Title IV student financial aid, we may incur substantial cost and expense, and lost revenue, in providing appropriate assistance to the affected students to complete their academic programs or transition to other programs inside or outside of our universities.\nThe Department of Education has proposed regulations setting forth new standards and procedures related to borrower defenses to repayment of Title IV loan obligations, the Department\u2019s right of recovery against institutions following a successful borrower defense, and institutional financial responsibility. If the regulations are adopted as proposed, our business would be subject to significant and unpredictable risks, including the requirement to post substantial letters of credit due to unproven allegations or pending investigations, whether or not meritorious.\nIn June 2016, the Department issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to establish a new federal standard and a process for determining whether a borrower has a defense to repayment on federal student loans based on an act or omission of a school. The proposed regulations would provide repayment relief to borrowers in respect of student loans first disbursed on or after July 1, 2017 where:\n\u2022\na school breaches contractual promises to a student;\n\u2022\ncertain judgments based on any state or federal law are entered against a school related to the loan or the educational services after a contested proceeding; or\n\u2022\nthe school makes substantial misrepresentations about the nature of its educational programs, financial charges or employability of graduates, or insubstantial misrepresentations where other factors are present, such as pressure to enroll quickly or taking advantage of students\u2019 distress or lack of knowledge or sophistication.\nAs proposed, there would be no limitation on claims to discharge future amounts owed by the borrower and a six-year limitation (from the date of the breach) on claims to discharge amounts already paid by the borrower. The proposed regulations also would allow the Department to identify and grant relief to groups of students where there are common facts, including students who have not requested relief.\nThe proposed borrower defense definitions would not apply for loans first disbursed prior to July 1, 2017, and these loans will remain subject to the current borrower defense definitions; however, under the proposed rules, these loans will follow the same claims process, individual and group, and time limitations.\nAs proposed, the Department would be entitled to seek reimbursement from the school in most cases in respect of loans discharged under the new procedure.\nApollo Education Group, Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | 31\nIn addition, the proposed regulations specify early warning triggers regarding financial distress that would automatically require a school to post a letter of credit in the amount of at least 10% of the school\u2019s annual Title IV disbursements upon the occurrence of specified events including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe commencement of a major lawsuit by a state or federal government entity, such as a state Attorney General, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau or the Federal Trade Commission;\n\u2022\nthe filing of a substantial number of borrower defense claims;\n\u2022\ndefault by the school on its debt obligations;\n\u2022\nfailure of the school to satisfy the 90/10 Rule;\n\u2022\nprograms failing to meet gainful employment regulations;\n\u2022\naccrediting agency actions, including the requirement to submit teach-out plans or being placed on an accreditation status that could result in the school losing its accreditation; and/or\n\u2022\nany event or condition the Department determines is likely to have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition or results of operations of the institution.\nEach separate triggering event would result in a separate letter of credit requirement of at least 10% of annual Title IV disbursements. If a school experiences any of these triggers, the school would be required to warn prospective and current students that it has been required to provide enhanced financial protection to the Department.\nFurther, the proposed regulations would also institute a loan repayment rate for proprietary institutions and would require disclosure of such rate to prospective and enrolled students if such rate falls below specified levels.\nThe proposed regulations, if adopted, could result in significant potential risks for our business, since the precise standards for student loan discharge may be unclear or subject to interpretation in a manner that is adverse to us and not fully known or predictable in advance, and certain of the potential adverse consequences could arise from the mere commencement of enforcement actions by state or federal government entities, or the filing of student claims for debt relief, even if these actions and claims ultimately are found to lack merit. Furthermore, the potential significant discretion vested in the Department to administer the regulations, including fact-finding, and the subjective judgments regarding the triggers for debt relief or the letter of credit requirements may result in unexpected outcomes that materially and adversely affect our business. In order to reduce the risk associated with these proposed regulations, if adopted, we may need to modify our administrative and other student-facing practices and procedures in a manner that materially increases our costs and reduces our administrative effectiveness, and our flexibility in responding to state or federal and certain private lawsuits may be materially reduced because of the possible significant ancillary consequences of an adverse judgment or finding.\nRecently, two major proprietary higher education institutions were forced to cease operations and seek bankruptcy protection due to delays in Title IV disbursements and requirements to post letters of credit imposed by the Department based in part on the existence of pending state and federal investigations and the Department\u2019s judgment regarding various subjective matters such as the institution\u2019s culture. These regulations, if adopted as proposed, would enhance the power of the Department to take summary action that could harm University of Phoenix and Apollo Education Group, perhaps materially, before we could effectively exercise our due process rights, even if the action is based on pending investigations or legal proceedings that ultimately are determined to lack merit.\nThe effective date of the proposed regulations, if adopted, cannot be determined at this time, but the proposed regulations could be effective as early as July 1, 2017. More information can be found at http://www2.ed.gov/policy/highered/reg/hearulemaking/2016/index.html.\nAction by the U.S. Congress to revise the laws governing federal student financial aid programs or reduce funding for these programs, including changes applicable only to proprietary educational institutions, could reduce our enrollment and increase our costs of operation.\nThe U.S. Congress must periodically reauthorize the Higher Education Act and annually determine the funding level for each Title IV program. The most recent reauthorization of the Higher Education Act expired September 30, 2013, but Title IV student financial aid programs remain authorized and functioning. Congress continues to engage in discussion and activity regarding Higher Education Act reauthorization, but the timing and terms of any eventual reauthorization cannot be predicted.\nThe federal Pell Grant program is one of the largest non-defense discretionary spending programs in the federal budget. Because of this, it is a target for reduction as Congress addresses the competing demands for funding and the chronic and significant U.S. budget deficit. Furthermore, a recent study by the U.S. Federal Reserve System demonstrated a direct relationship between student financial aid increases, including Pell Grant increases, and tuition increases, which could impact future Pell Grant amounts. A reduction in the maximum annual Pell Grant amount or changes in eligibility could negatively impact enrollment and could result in increased student borrowing, which would make it more difficult for us to comply with other important regulatory requirements, such as maintaining student loan cohort default rates, which are discussed below.\nApollo Education Group, Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | 32\nIn addition to Congress\u2019s focus on the federal government\u2019s funding challenges, in recent years, there has been substantial and continuing increased focus by various members of the U.S. Congress and federal agencies, including the Department of Education, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Federal Trade Commission, on the role that proprietary educational institutions play in higher education. We expect this focus to continue and, as discussed above under The outcome of the November 2016 U.S. election could lead to a change in or elimination of our eligibility to participate in Title IV student financial aid programs, which could render our business unsustainable, the outcome of the November 2016 U.S. elections could materially impact the manner in which Congress addresses these matters. In recent years, Congressional hearings and roundtable discussions have been held regarding various aspects of the education industry, and reports have been issued that are highly critical of proprietary institutions and include a number of recommendations to be considered by Congress in connection with the upcoming reauthorization of the Higher Education Act as discussed above. A group of influential U.S. senators has strongly and repeatedly encouraged the Departments of Education, Defense and Veterans Affairs to take action to limit or terminate the participation of proprietary educational institutions, including University of Phoenix, in existing tuition assistance programs.\nBecause the majority of our revenue is derived from Title IV programs, any action by Congress that reduces Title IV program funding, or alters the eligibility of our institutions or students to participate in Title IV programs could have a material adverse effect on our enrollment and financial condition. Action by Congress or federal agencies could also require us to modify our practices in ways that increase our operating costs.\nIn addition to possible reductions in Title IV program funding, certain military benefit programs may be reduced as military branches address decreased funding. Reductions and/or changes in military benefit programs could result in increased student borrowing, decreased enrollment and adverse impacts on our 90/10 Rule percentage, as discussed below.\nIf Congress reduced the eligibility or amount of available Title IV program funding, we would attempt to arrange for alternative sources of financial aid for our students, which may include lending funds directly to our students. However, private sources would not be able to provide as much funding to our students or on terms comparable to Title IV programs and such programs are under intense scrutiny from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and other regulatory agencies. In addition, private funding sources could require us to guarantee all or part of this assistance and we might incur other additional costs. For these reasons, private, alternative sources of student financial aid would only partly offset, if at all, the impact on our business of reduced Title IV program eligibility or funding, and would not be a practical alternative in the case of a significant reduction in Title IV program eligibility or funding.\nUniversity of Phoenix\u2019s certification to participate in Title IV programs expired in December 2012 and continues on a month-to-month basis. If University of Phoenix is not recertified to participate in Title IV programs by the U.S. Department of Education, University of Phoenix would not be eligible to participate in Title IV programs and we could not conduct our business as it is currently conducted.\nUniversity of Phoenix is certified by the U.S. Department of Education to participate in Title IV programs. The University was recertified in November 2009 and its current certification expired in December 2012. University of Phoenix has submitted necessary documentation for recertification and its eligibility continues on a month-to-month basis until the Department issues its decision on the application. We believe that the University\u2019s application will be renewed in due course. However, we cannot predict whether or to what extent the continued challenging political and regulatory climate, our pending merger, and other recent developments in general relating to the proprietary education sector and our business may have on the timing or outcome of the recertification process.\nIn February 2016, the Department notified the University that for the duration of the month-to-month continuation of the University\u2019s Program Participation Agreement, University of Phoenix must obtain from the Department prior approval of substantial changes, including (i) the establishment of additional locations, (ii) any increase in the level of academic offering beyond those listed in the Institution\u2019s Eligibility and Certification Approval Report and (iii) the addition of any educational program (including degree, nondegree, or short-term training programs). Some of these substantial changes include changes that previously could be implemented by the University upon notice to the Department and without prior approval.\nContinued Title IV program eligibility is critical to the operation of our business. If University of Phoenix becomes ineligible to participate in Title IV programs, or participation is materially limited, our business would be unsustainable.\nApollo Education Group, Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | 33\nA failure to demonstrate \u201cfinancial responsibility\u201d or \u201cadministrative capability\u201d may result in the loss of eligibility to participate in Title IV programs and limit our access to liquidity, which would materially and adversely affect our business.\nTo participate in Title IV programs, the U.S. Department of Education regulations specify that an eligible institution of higher education must satisfy specific measures of financial responsibility prescribed by the Department, or post a letter of credit in favor of the Department and accept other conditions on its participation in Title IV programs. Pursuant to the Title IV program regulations, each eligible institution must satisfy a measure of financial responsibility that is based on a weighted average of the following three annual ratios which assess the financial condition of the institution:\n\u2022\nPrimary Reserve Ratio - measure of an institution\u2019s financial viability and liquidity;\n\u2022\nEquity Ratio - measure of an institution\u2019s capital resources and its ability to borrow; and\n\u2022\nNet Income Ratio - measure of an institution\u2019s profitability.\nThese ratios provide three individual scores which are converted into a single composite score. The maximum composite score is 3.0. If an institution\u2019s composite score is at least 1.5, it is considered financially responsible. If an institution\u2019s composite score is less than 1.5 but is 1.0 or higher, it is still considered financially responsible, and the institution may continue to participate as a financially responsible institution for up to three years under the Department\u2019s \u201czone\u201d alternative. Under the zone alternative, the Department may subject the institution to various operating or other requirements, which may include:\n(i)\nBeing transferred from the \u201cadvance\u201d method of payment of Title IV program funds to the heightened cash monitoring payment method under which the institution is required to make Title IV disbursements to eligible students and parents before it requests or receives funds from the Department for the amount of those disbursements, or being transferred to the more onerous reimbursement payment method under which an institution must submit to the Department documentation demonstrating the eligibility for each Title IV disbursement and wait for the Department\u2019s approval before drawing down Title IV funds;\n(ii)\nThe imposition of additional reporting requirements regarding certain oversight and financial events;\n(iii)\nBeing required to submit to the Department its annual financial statements and Title IV compliance audits earlier than would otherwise be required;\n(iv)\nBeing required to submit information about current operations and future plans; and\n(v)\nThe imposition of additional obligations imposed by the Department.\nIf an institution does not achieve a composite score of at least 1.0, it is subject to additional requirements in order to continue its participation in the Title IV programs, including:\n(i)\nSubmitting to the Department a letter of credit in an amount equal to at least ten percent, and at the Department\u2019s discretion up to 50%, of the Title IV funds received by the institution during its most recently completed fiscal year;\n(ii)\nComplying with the \u201czone\u201d alternative requirements described above;\n(iii)\nBeing placed on provisional certification status, under which the institution must receive Department approval before implementing new locations or educational programs and comply with other restrictions, including reduced due process rights in subsequent proceedings before the Department;\n(iv)\nDemonstrating that it is current on its outstanding debt obligations, as defined by the Department; and\n(v)\nComplying with other requirements imposed by the Department.\nIn addition, under new regulations that took effect on July 1, 2016, institutions placed on either the heightened cash monitoring payment method or the reimbursement payment method must pay Title IV credit balances to students and parents before requesting Title IV funds from the Department and may not hold Title IV credit balances on behalf of students or parents, even if such balances are expected to be applied to future tuition payments.\nThe composite scores for Apollo Education Group and University of Phoenix, which are calculated as of the end of our fiscal year, were as follows for the indicated periods:\nThe decline in our fiscal year 2016 consolidated composite score was principally attributable to our decline in profitability, which included $73.4 million of goodwill impairment charges. Refer to Note 8, Goodwill and Intangibles, in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nApollo Education Group, Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | 34\nWe believe that we may be able to take certain corrective measures to maintain composite scores of 1.5 or greater, if we determine that there is increased risk that our composite scores will fall below that level, depending on the circumstances causing the expected decline. However, such measures, if available, may require material modifications to our business and strategy that would adversely impact our future revenue and profitability and/or may involve the issuance of equity or equity-linked securities under challenging circumstances that could result in material dilution to our existing shareholders.\nIf our composite score falls below 1.5, our liquidity could be subject to severe stress due to the following factors:\n\u2022\nAlthough not required solely due to participation in the zone alternative discussed above, we could be required by the Department of Education to submit a letter of credit in an amount of 10% or more of our annual Title IV receipts as a result of factors related to the cause of our composite score decline, which letter of credit likely would need to be cash collateralized.\n\u2022\nIf the Department places University of Phoenix on the heightened cash monitoring payment method, we would need to deploy additional working capital to conduct our business due to the delay in receipt of Title IV funding. If University of Phoenix is placed on the reimbursement payment method, our working capital needs would increase significantly, the precise amount of which increase cannot be predicted because it would depend on the average length of time required by the Department to evaluate and approve our requests for reimbursement and the amount of any required letter of credit. In addition, under the new regulations that became effective July 1, 2016 regarding students\u2019 Title IV fund credit balances, we would be required to significantly alter the manner in which we process and disburse Title IV funds, which would increase our operating costs and could have unexpected and material negative impacts on our operations.\nThe combined effect of the above factors could cause our business to no longer be sustainable without a significant infusion of equity or other funding. Under current market conditions, there is no assurance that other funding sources would be available in sufficient amounts on terms acceptable to us or at all, and any available equity funding would necessarily involve substantial dilution to our current shareholders.\nIn addition to the composite score requirements, the Department regulations specify extensive criteria an institution must satisfy to establish that it has the requisite administrative capability to participate in Title IV programs. The failure of an institution to satisfy any of the criteria used to assess administrative capability may cause the Department to determine that the institution lacks administrative capability and, therefore, subject the institution to additional scrutiny or deny eligibility for Title IV programs. These criteria require, among other things, that the institution:\n\u2022\nComply with all applicable Title IV program regulations;\n\u2022\nHave capable and sufficient personnel to administer the Title IV programs;\n\u2022\nHave acceptable methods of defining and measuring the satisfactory academic progress of its students;\n\u2022\nNot have student loan cohort default rates above specified levels;\n\u2022\nHave procedures in place for safeguarding federal funds;\n\u2022\nNot be, and not have any principal or affiliate who is, debarred or suspended from federal contracting or engaging in activity that is cause for debarment or suspension;\n\u2022\nProvide financial aid counseling to its students;\n\u2022\nRefer to the Office of Inspector General any credible information indicating that any applicant, student, employee or agent of the institution has been engaged in any fraud or other illegal conduct involving Title IV programs;\n\u2022\nSubmit in a timely manner all reports and financial statements required by the regulations; and\n\u2022\nNot otherwise appear to lack administrative capability.\nIf we, or our schools eligible to participate in Title IV programs fail to maintain administrative capability or financial responsibility, as defined by the Department, our schools could lose their eligibility to participate in Title IV programs or have that eligibility adversely conditioned, which could significantly reduce the enrollments and revenues of our schools eligible to participate in Title IV programs and materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nOur schools and programs would lose their eligibility to participate in federal student financial aid programs if the percentage of revenue derived from those programs is too high, in which event we could not conduct our business as it is currently conducted.\nUniversity of Phoenix, and all other proprietary institutions of higher education, are subject to the so-called \u201c90/10 Rule\u201d under the Higher Education Act, as reauthorized. Under this rule, a proprietary institution will be ineligible to participate in Title IV programs for at least two fiscal years if for any two consecutive fiscal years it derives more than 90% of its cash basis revenue, as defined in the rule, from Title IV programs. If an institution is determined to be ineligible, any disbursements of Title IV program funds made after the end of the second fiscal year in the measuring period must be repaid to the U.S. Department of Education. An institution that derives more than 90% of its cash basis revenue from Title IV programs for any single fiscal year\nApollo Education Group, Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | 35\nwill be automatically placed on provisional certification for two fiscal years and will be subject to possible additional sanctions determined to be appropriate under the circumstances by the Department. While the Department has broad discretion to impose additional sanctions on such an institution, there is only limited precedent available to predict what those sanctions might be, particularly in the current regulatory environment. For example, the Department could impose conditions in the provisional certification such as:\n\u2022\nRestrictions on the total amount of Title IV program funds that may be disbursed to students;\n\u2022\nRestrictions on programmatic and geographic expansion;\n\u2022\nRequirements to obtain and post letters of credit;\n\u2022\nAdditional reporting requirements such as interim financial reporting; or\n\u2022\nAny other conditions deemed appropriate by the Department.\nThe 90/10 Rule percentages for University of Phoenix were as follows for the indicated periods:\nSee the discussion of the 90/10 Rule in Part I, Item 1, Business - Regulatory Environment, above.\nAny necessary efforts to reduce the 90/10 Rule percentage for University of Phoenix, especially if the percentage exceeds 90% for a fiscal year, may involve taking measures which reduce our revenue, increase our operating expenses, or both, in each case perhaps significantly. In addition, we may be required to make structural changes to our business in the future in order to remain in compliance, which changes may materially alter the manner in which we conduct our business and materially and adversely impact our business and financial condition. Furthermore, these required changes could make it more difficult to comply with other important regulatory requirements, such as the student loan cohort default rate regulations, which are discussed below.\nIn recent years, Congress has increased its focus on military benefit programs used for education at proprietary institutions. These military benefit programs are not part of Title IV, and therefore funding under these programs is not included in the 90% portion of the 90/10 Rule. Various bills have been introduced in Congress that would revise the 90/10 Rule to count Department of Defense tuition assistance and Department of Veterans Affairs Post-9/11 GI Bill veterans educational benefits toward the 90% limit, and to reduce the threshold to 85%. We cannot predict the likelihood that Congress will amend the 90/10 Rule in either manner. If all military benefit program funding was included in the 90% portion of the rule calculation, University of Phoenix\u2019s fiscal year 2016 90/10 Rule percentage would have been higher.\nAn increase in student loan default rates could result in the loss of eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, which would materially and adversely affect our business.\nTo remain eligible to participate in Title IV programs, an educational institution\u2019s student loan cohort default rates must remain below certain specified levels. Each cohort is the group of students who first enter into student loan repayment during a federal fiscal year (ending September 30) for a three-year measuring period.\nAn educational institution loses eligibility to participate in Title IV programs if its cohort default rate equals or exceeds 40% for any given year or 30% for three consecutive years. If an institution\u2019s cohort default rate equals or exceeds 30% for any given year, it must establish a default prevention task force and develop a default prevention plan with measurable objectives for improving the cohort default rate.\nBased on information published by the Department, the cohort default rates for University of Phoenix and for all proprietary postsecondary institutions for the applicable federal fiscal years were as follows:\nSee the discussion of cohort default rates in Part I, Item 1, Business - Regulatory Environment, above.\nIf our student loan default rates approach the applicable limits in the future, we may be required to increase efforts and resources dedicated to improving these default rates. This is challenging because most borrowers who are in default or at risk of default are no longer students, and we may have only limited contact with them. Furthermore, continued increased attention has been given by members of Congress and others on default aversion activities of proprietary education institutions. If such\nApollo Education Group, Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | 36\nattention leads to congressional or regulatory action restricting the types of default aversion assistance that educational institutions are permitted to provide, the default rates of our former students may be negatively impacted. Such attention could also lead to Congressional proposals to increase the measuring period, which could negatively impact our default rates. Accordingly, there is no assurance that we would be able to effectively improve our default rates or improve them in a timely manner to meet the requirements for continued participation in Title IV programs if we experience a substantial increase in our student loan default rates.\nIf we fail to maintain any of our state authorizations, we would lose our ability to operate in that state and to participate in Title IV programs there.\nInstitutions that participate in Title IV programs must be authorized to operate by the appropriate postsecondary regulatory authority in each state where the institution has a physical presence. Prior to July 1, 2011, such authorization was not specifically required for the institution\u2019s students to become eligible for Title IV programs. Under the program integrity rules adopted by the Department effective July 1, 2011, institutions are required to obtain specific regulatory approval to operate in such states. University of Phoenix is specifically authorized to operate in all of the domestic jurisdictions in which it operates. Some states assert authority to regulate all degree-granting institutions if their educational programs are available to their residents, whether or not the institutions maintain a physical presence within those states. University of Phoenix has obtained licensure in states which require such licensure and where students are enrolled.\nA separate negotiated rulemaking process was convened by the Department in November 2013 on a variety of topics. Included among the topics was the proposed establishment of requirements for state authorization of distance education programs in order to demonstrate eligibility for Title IV eligibility. A negotiated rulemaking committee was established and met in early 2014. The committee failed to reach consensus. In July 2016, the Department issued draft regulations to establish new federal requirements for such eligibility.\nThe proposed regulations would establish new requirements to maintain state authorization for Title IV eligibility for distance education programs. Major provisions include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nRequiring an institution offering distance education to have requisite state authority to offer such programs to state residents if required by the state;\n\u2022\nDefining and recognizing acceptable state authorization reciprocity agreements;\n\u2022\nRequiring institutions to document individualized state processes for resolving student complaints; and\n\u2022\nRequiring an institution to provide extensive public and individualized disclosures to enrolled and prospective students regarding its programs offered solely through distance education, including information concerning adverse actions filed against the school by state entities or accrediting bodies.\nAs proposed, the regulations could be interpreted to allow individual states to impose new and diverse requirements on institutions and thereby reduce the regulatory and operational efficiency that our schools use in operating under the current State Authorization Reciprocity Agreement (\u201cSARA\u201d), which currently allows our Title IV eligible programs to operate in those states that have adopted SARA with only home state regulatory approval. States that have adopted SARA now constitute the majority of domestic jurisdictions.\nAlso as proposed, the regulations could be interpreted to require extensive new public disclosures based upon certain actions by accreditors and state entities, including state Attorneys General. Under some interpretations, the regulations could require disclosure to current and prospective students upon the mere filing of an adverse action and long after the initial action was resolved, even if resolved in favor of the institution.\nThe proposed regulations, if adopted, could result in significant potential risks for our business, since the precise regulatory scope and definitions for individualized state requirements and disclosures may be unclear or subject to interpretation in a manner that is adverse to us and not fully known or predictable in advance, and certain of the potential adverse consequences could arise from the mere commencement of adverse actions by government entities or accrediting bodies, even if these actions and claims ultimately are found to lack merit. Furthermore, the potential significant discretion vested in the Department to interpret and administer the regulations may result in unexpected outcomes that materially and adversely affect our business. In order to reduce the risk associated with these proposed regulations, if adopted, we may need to modify our administrative and other student-facing practices and procedures in a manner that materially increases our costs and reduces our administrative effectiveness.\nThe effective date of the proposed regulations, if adopted, cannot be determined at this time, but the proposed regulations could be effective as early as July 1, 2017.\nApollo Education Group, Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | 37\nIf our institutional accrediting body loses recognition by the U.S. Department of Education, we could lose our ability to participate in Title IV programs, which would materially and adversely affect our business.\nUniversity of Phoenix is institutionally accredited by the Higher Learning Commission (\u201cHLC\u201d), one of the six regional accrediting agencies recognized by the U.S. Department of Education. Accreditation by an accrediting agency recognized by the Department is required in order for an institution to become and remain eligible to participate in Title IV student financial aid programs.\nIf the Department ceased to recognize HLC for any reason, University of Phoenix would not be eligible to participate in Title IV programs beginning 18 months after the date such recognition ceased unless HLC was again recognized or our institutions were accredited by another accrediting body recognized by the Department. In June 2013, the National Advisory Committee on Institutional Quality and Integrity, a Committee that advises the Secretary of Education on matters related to postsecondary accreditation and eligibility, recommended to the Secretary that HLC have continuing recognition as an eligible accreditor with certain conditions and required reports.\nIf HLC ceased to be recognized by the Department and our affected schools failed to timely obtain replacement accreditation, our schools would cease to be eligible to participate in Title IV programs and our business would no longer be sustainable in its current form.\nNon-U.S. Operations\nChanges by a regulator in the interpretation of applicable course requirements could materially impact our Open Colleges business in Australia.\nIn mid-October 2016, Apollo Global\u2019s two primary registered training organizations in Australia, Open Colleges Pty Ltd., and Integrated Care & Management Training, Pty Ltd., each received a notice of noncompliance and intention to make a decision to impose sanctions from the Australian Skills Quality Authority (\u201cASQA\u201d), the national regulator of vocational education programs. The notice, which followed a recent compliance audit, identified several alleged compliance deficiencies and stated that ASQA intended to make a decision on whether to impose sanctions on the institutions which could include cancellation of registration or imposition of lesser sanctions. One of the findings involves a change in the interpretation of applicable course requirements and will require changes in our procedures for student workplace skills assessments used in connection with courses that represent a substantial portion of the Open Colleges institutions\u2019 enrollment.\nImplementing an updated workplace skills assessment model in order to address ASQA\u2019s concerns will require operational changes for these institutions and increase operating costs, perhaps substantially. Furthermore, any resulting increases in tuition prices due to these changes could make our vocational training programs less competitive relative to available alternatives, especially traditional on-ground programs in large metropolitan areas.\nContinued ASQA registration is critical to the continued operation of the Open Colleges and Integrated Care & Management Training businesses in Australia. If ASQA terminates the registration of these institutions or materially limits their participation, it could materially and adversely impact their and our business and operations.\nWe have until November 7, 2016 to respond to this notice of noncompliance. We cannot currently predict the timing or ultimate outcome of this matter.\nOur non-U.S. operations are subject to risks not inherent in our U.S. operations, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe operate educational institutions in the United Kingdom, Australia, Germany, Mexico, South Africa, Brazil, Chile and elsewhere, and in India we offer educational programs through a joint venture. Our operations in each of the relevant foreign jurisdictions are subject to regulatory requirements relating to education providers, as well as foreign businesses. Many foreign countries have not fully embraced the proprietary education model, and in other countries, proprietary education remains controversial. As a result, our foreign operations are subject to the political risk that existing regulations will be interpreted unfavorably or new regulations will be adopted that have a significant negative impact on our business model or render it impractical. In addition, our non-U.S. operations are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act which require extensive compliance vigilance on our part and, in some cases, puts our foreign operations at a competitive disadvantage with local companies. If one or more of our foreign operations ceases to be economically practical, we may be forced to discontinue such operations or seek a buyer, either of which might result in a substantial loss of value to Apollo Education Group.\nApollo Education Group, Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | 38\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe face intense and increasing competition in the postsecondary education market from both public and private educational institutions, which has adversely affected our business.\nPostsecondary education in our existing and new market areas is highly competitive and is becoming increasingly so as the industry is undergoing profound change at an unprecedented rate. We compete primarily with traditional public and private degree-granting regionally accredited colleges and universities, other proprietary degree-granting regionally accredited schools and alternatives to higher education. In addition, we face increasing competition from various emerging non-traditional, credit-bearing and noncredit-bearing education programs, offered by both proprietary and not-for-profit providers. Some of our competitors have greater financial and nonfinancial resources than we have and are able to offer programs similar to ours at a lower tuition level for a variety of reasons, including the availability of direct and indirect government subsidies, government and foundation grants, large endowments, tax-deductible contributions and other financial resources not available to proprietary institutions, or by providing fewer student services or larger class sizes. For example, a typical community college is subsidized by local or state government and, as a result, tuition rates for associate\u2019s degree programs are much lower at community colleges than at University of Phoenix. Furthermore, various members of Congress have advocated for free or debt free post-secondary education at public universities, and the affordability of such education has been the subject of intense focus among candidates during the campaign leading up to the November 2016 elections in the U.S.\nAlso, like University of Phoenix, other proprietary educational institutions have begun to deploy pricing incentives to impact demand. We believe that price competition through targeted programs involving student scholarships and otherwise will continue throughout the industry. We have implemented scholarships and discounts which reduce the amount of tuition we receive, and further downward pressure on our tuition rates may cause us to implement further pricing incentives, which will adversely affect our revenue.\nIn addition, one of our primary competitive advantages in the U.S. has been materially diminished as a significant and increasing number of traditional four-year and community colleges, which are subject to fewer regulatory constraints, offer an increasing array of distance learning and other online education programs, including programs that are offered wholly online and geared towards the needs of working adults. This trend has been accelerated by private companies that provide and/or manage online learning platforms for traditional four-year colleges and community colleges. As the proportion of traditional colleges and universities providing alternative learning modalities increases, we will face increased competition from these institutions, including those with highly regarded reputations, the degrees from which are perceived as more valuable in the workplace. Already, this type of competition is significant and has contributed to the substantial decline in University of Phoenix enrollment that began in late 2010.\nThis intense competition makes it more challenging for us to enroll students who are likely to succeed in our educational programs, and has contributed to the substantial decline in University of Phoenix enrollment that began in late 2010 and put downward pressure on our tuition rates. We must adapt our business to meet these competitive challenges. The current initiative to transform University of Phoenix, as discussed below, is intended to address these competitive challenges.\nWe have launched a set of initiatives to transform University of Phoenix into a more focused institution; these initiatives will further reduce the University\u2019s enrollment in the short-term and may not be successful in improving enrollment and retention in the longer term.\nWe are working to transform University of Phoenix into a more focused, higher retaining and less complex institution in order to improve student outcomes and stabilize enrollment. In furtherance of this, the University is implementing several important initiatives, as described in Part I, Item 1, Business - University of Phoenix. These initiatives require significant time, energy and resources, and involve many significant interrelated and simultaneous changes in the University\u2019s processes and programs. We believe that some of the initiatives to transform University of Phoenix have accelerated the near term rate of decline in the University\u2019s enrollment and revenue, which has increased the amount of necessary cost reductions. We have significantly reduced our operating costs over recent periods and further significant reductions are increasingly challenging. There is no assurance that we will be able to reduce costs to align with University of Phoenix\u2019s reduced enrollment and revenue, especially if the University\u2019s near term enrollment declines more than anticipated. Although we seek to effect these cost reductions in a manner that does not adversely impact the quality of our services to students, given the magnitude of these changes, they could result in near term disruption to our business which may further decrease our enrollment and revenues. Additionally, our fiscal year 2017 Department of Education financial responsibility composite score will be adversely impacted if we are not successful in reducing costs sufficiently during fiscal year 2017, whether due to our inability to effectuate planned cost reductions, greater than anticipated declines in our enrollment and revenue or other factors.\nApollo Education Group, Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | 39\nOur financial performance depends on our ability to develop favorable awareness among, and enroll and retain students; adverse publicity has negatively impacted demand for our programs.\nBuilding favorable awareness of our schools and the programs we offer is critical to our ability to attract prospective students. We expend significant resources on marketing. To the extent that our schools are unable to successfully market and advertise their educational programs, our schools\u2019 ability to attract and enroll prospective students in such programs will be adversely affected. It is also critical to our success that we convert these prospective students to enrolled students in a cost-effective manner and that these enrolled students remain active in our programs.\nDuring fiscal year 2016, University of Phoenix eliminated its use of third-party operated websites for marketing purposes in order to better manage the University\u2019s marketing message, improve its ability to identify those students more likely to persist in its educational programs, and reduce cost. We believe that this change negatively impacted New Degreed Enrollment in fiscal year 2016.\nThe proprietary postsecondary education sector is under intense regulatory and other scrutiny which has led to media attention that has portrayed the sector in an unflattering light. This negative media attention has caused and may continue to cause some prospective students to choose educational alternatives outside of the proprietary sector or proprietary alternatives other than University of Phoenix, either of which could continue to negatively impact our new enrollments.\nSome of the additional factors that could prevent us from successfully enrolling and retaining students in our programs include:\n\u2022\nIncreased competition from schools offering distance learning and other online educational programs;\n\u2022\nA decrease in the perceived or actual economic benefits that students derive from our programs or education in general;\n\u2022\nA decrease in or perceived low student pass rates for professional licenses and other examinations necessary for students to work in their chosen field;\n\u2022\nRegulatory investigations or enforcement proceedings that may damage our or the industry\u2019s reputation;\n\u2022\nIncreased regulation of online education, including in states in which we do not have a physical presence;\n\u2022\nLitigation that may damage our reputation;\n\u2022\nInability to continue to recruit, train and retain quality faculty;\n\u2022\nStudent or employer dissatisfaction with the quality of our services and programs;\n\u2022\nTuition rate reductions by competitors that we are unwilling or unable to match;\n\u2022\nA decline in the acceptance of online education;\n\u2022\nUnavailability of ground locations where students want to attend; and\n\u2022\nDisruptions to our information technology systems.\nIf one or more of these factors reduces demand for our programs, our enrollment could be further negatively affected or our costs associated with each new enrollment could increase, or both, either of which could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition.\nOur financial performance depends, in part, on our ability to keep pace with changing education market needs; if we fail to keep pace or fail in implementing or adapting to new educational offerings and technologies, our business may be adversely affected.\nThe nature of the skills required by employers can evolve rapidly in today\u2019s changing economic and technological environment. Accordingly, it is important for our schools\u2019 educational programs to evolve in response to economic and technological changes. The expansion of existing programs and the development of new programs, including the changes discussed above to transform University of Phoenix, may not be accepted by current or prospective students or the employers of our graduates. Even if our schools are able to develop acceptable new programs, our schools may not be able to begin offering those new programs as quickly as required by prospective employers or as quickly as our competitors offer similar programs. In addition, we may be unable to obtain specialized accreditations or licensures that may make certain programs desirable to students. To offer a new academic program, we may be required to obtain federal, state and accrediting agency approvals, which may be conditioned or delayed in a manner that could significantly affect our growth plans. In addition, to be eligible for Title IV programs, a new academic program may need to be certified by the U.S. Department of Education. If we are unable to adequately respond to changes in market requirements due to regulatory or financial constraints, unusually rapid technological changes, or other factors, our ability to attract and retain students could be impaired, the rates at which our graduates obtain jobs involving their fields of study could suffer, and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nEstablishing new academic programs or modifying existing programs requires us to make investments, incur marketing expenses and reallocate other resources. We may have limited experience with the courses in new areas and may need to\nApollo Education Group, Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | 40\nmodify our systems and strategy or enter into arrangements with other educational institutions to provide new programs effectively and profitably. If we are unable to offer new programs in a cost-effective manner, or are otherwise unable to manage effectively the operations of newly established academic programs, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIf we do not maintain existing, and develop additional, relationships with employers, our business may be impaired.\nWe currently have relationships with large employers to provide their employees with the opportunity to obtain degrees and professional development certificates through us while continuing their employment. These relationships are an important part of our strategy as they provide us with potential working adults for particular programs and also serve to increase our reputation among high-profile employers. In addition, degree-granting programs in which employers directly pay tuition have a beneficial impact on our 90/10 Rule percentage calculation by reducing the proportion of our cash basis revenues attributable to Title IV program funds. If we are unable to develop new relationships or further develop our existing relationships, if our existing relationships deteriorate or end, or if we are unable to offer programs that teach skills demanded by employers, our efforts to seek these sources of potential working adults may be impaired, and this could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition and our compliance with applicable regulations.\nOur acquisitions may not be successful and may result in additional debt or dilution to our shareholders, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe have acquired and may in the future acquire additional proprietary educational institutions that complement our strategic direction. Any acquisition involves significant risks and uncertainties, including:\n\u2022\nInability to successfully integrate the acquired operations, including the information technology systems, into our institutions and maintain uniform standards, controls, policies and procedures;\n\u2022\nInability to successfully operate and grow the acquired businesses;\n\u2022\nDistraction of management\u2019s attention from normal business operations;\n\u2022\nChallenges retaining the key employees of the acquired operation;\n\u2022\nOperating, market or other challenges causing operating results to be less than projected;\n\u2022\nExpenses associated with the acquisition;\n\u2022\nNoncontrolling shareholder options that could require us to purchase shares in certain of our businesses that we do not wholly-own;\n\u2022\nChallenges relating to conforming non-compliant financial reporting procedures to those required of a subsidiary of a U.S. reporting company, including procedures required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; and\n\u2022\nUnidentified issues not discovered in our due diligence process, including commitments and/or contingencies.\nAcquisitions are inherently risky. We have experienced many challenges in connection with our previous acquisitions and cannot be certain that any future acquisitions will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our business and financial condition. We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities, acquire institutions on favorable terms, or successfully integrate or profitably operate acquired institutions. Future transactions may involve use of our cash resources, issuance of equity or debt securities, incurrence of other forms of debt or a significant increase in our financial leverage, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition, especially if the cash flows associated with any acquisition are not sufficient to cover the additional debt service and could negatively impact our compliance with the U.S. Department of Education composite score measure of financial responsibility. If we issue equity securities as consideration in an acquisition, current shareholders\u2019 percentage ownership and earnings per share may be diluted. In addition, our acquisition of an educational institution could be considered a change in ownership and control of the acquired institution under applicable regulatory standards. For such an acquisition in the U.S., we may need approval from the U.S. Department of Education and applicable state agencies and accrediting agencies and possibly other regulatory bodies. Our inability to obtain such approvals with respect to a completed acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nApollo Education Group, Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | 41\nOur expansion into new markets outside the U.S. subjects us to risks inherent in international operations.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we have acquired, and may continue to acquire schools and universities outside the U.S., and otherwise intend to grow our international operations. We will face risks that are inherent in international operations, including:\n\u2022\nComplexity of operations across borders;\n\u2022\nCompliance with foreign regulatory environments, including laws and regulations hindering proprietary education enterprises;\n\u2022\nChanges in existing laws to prohibit or restrict proprietary education, whether arising from public discontent or otherwise;\n\u2022\nCurrency exchange rate fluctuations and/or price controls or restrictions on exchange of foreign currencies;\n\u2022\nMonetary policy risks, such as inflation, hyperinflation and deflation;\n\u2022\nPotential political and economic instability in the countries in which we operate;\n\u2022\nExpropriation of assets by local governments;\n\u2022\nMultiple and possibly overlapping and conflicting tax laws;\n\u2022\nCompliance with anti-corruption regulations such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010;\n\u2022\nPotential unionization of employees under local labor laws and local labor laws that make it more expensive and complex to negotiate with, retain or terminate employees;\n\u2022\nGreater difficulty in utilizing and enforcing any acquired intellectual property and contract rights;\n\u2022\nInvestment and execution missteps due to a failure to understand the local culture and market;\n\u2022\nLimitations on the repatriation of funds; and\n\u2022\nIncreased risk of acts of terrorism and war, epidemics and natural disasters.\nAny one or more of these risks could negatively impact our non-U.S. operations and materially and adversely impact our business and financial condition.\nOur current credit facility expires in April 2017. If we cannot arrange a replacement facility prior to that time, or at all, our available liquidity will be reduced which could limit our business operations.\nOur existing syndicated $625 million unsecured revolving credit facility (the \u201cRevolving Credit Facility\u201d) expires in April 2017. Due to the current challenging business and regulatory climate for the proprietary education sector and the continued decline in our operating performance, we expect that any subsequent credit facility, if one can be arranged, will be substantially smaller and more expensive than our current facility. We believe that a number of lenders, including members of our Revolving Credit Facility syndicate, have made a decision to exit the proprietary education sector. Accordingly, there is no assurance that we will be able to timely arrange a replacement credit facility on terms acceptable to us or at all, and much will depend on near-term developments in our business and the proprietary education sector generally.\nAs of August 31, 2016, we had $30 million of outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and approximately $29 million of outstanding letters of credit. Also as of that date, we had $681 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, and marketable securities. If we cannot replace the Revolving Credit Facility, our available liquidity will be reduced, and we may be required to post cash deposits to replace any outstanding letters of credit. In addition, the lack of a credit facility of an adequate size would limit our flexibility to operate our business, perhaps materially, which could adversely impact our future financial condition and operating results.\nBrexit and related negative developments in the European Union could adversely impact our business and financial results.\nThe June 2016 referendum in the United Kingdom (\u201cU.K.\u201d) approving the exit of the U.K. from the European Union (\u201cE.U.\u201d)(widely referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d) could cause disruptions to and create uncertainty surrounding our business, including affecting our relationships with our existing and future students and employees, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial results and operations. The Referendum is non-binding; however, if passed into law, negotiations would commence to determine the future terms of the U.K.\u2019s relationship with the E.U., including the terms of trade between the U.K. and the E.U. The effects of Brexit will depend on any agreements the U.K. makes to retain access to E.U. markets either during a transitional period or more permanently. These measures could impact the markets we serve and the tax jurisdictions in which we operate, and may cause us to lose students and employees. In addition, Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and education-related regulations as the U.K. determines which E.U. laws to replace or replicate.\nThe announcement of Brexit caused significant volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rate fluctuations that resulted in the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the British pound. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies may adversely affect our results of operations, because we translate revenue and expense denominated in foreign currencies into U.S. dollars for our consolidated financial statements.\nApollo Education Group, Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | 42\nSystem disruptions to our computer networks or phone systems could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe performance and reliability of our computer network and phone systems infrastructure at our schools, including our online programs, is critical to our operations, reputation and ability to attract and retain students. From time to time we experience intermittent outages of the information technology systems used by our students and by our employees, including system-wide outages. Any computer system error or failure, regardless of cause, could result in a substantial outage that materially disrupts our online and ground operations. Not all of our critical systems are protected by a validated formal disaster recovery plan and redundant disaster recovery infrastructure at a geographically remote data center. We are continuing execution of our plan to implement disaster recovery infrastructure for our remaining critical systems to allow timely recovery from catastrophic failure. For those systems not yet protected, a catastrophic failure or unavailability for any reason of our principal data center may require us to replicate the function of this data center at our existing remote data facility or elsewhere, and could result in the loss of data. An event such as this may require service restoration activities that could take up to several weeks to complete.\nWe have upgraded or are in the process of upgrading a substantial portion of our key IT systems, including our online student classroom, student relationship and communications management platform, and corporate applications, and retiring the related legacy systems. Although these new systems are expected to improve the productivity, scalability, reliability and sustainability of our IT infrastructure, the transition from the legacy systems entails risk of unanticipated disruption or failure to fully replicate all necessary data processing and reporting functions, including in our core business functions.\nAny disruption in our IT systems, including any disruptions and system malfunctions that may arise from our substantial IT systems upgrade initiative currently underway or outsourcing initiatives, could significantly impact our operations, reduce student and prospective student confidence in our educational institutions, adversely affect our compliance with applicable regulations and accrediting body standards and have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. Although we maintain insurance in respect of some types of these disruptions, there is no assurance that available insurance proceeds would be adequate to compensate us for damages sustained due to these disruptions.\nSecurity threats to our computer systems, including breach of the personal information that we collect, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe face an ever increasing number of threats to our computer systems, including unauthorized activity and access, malicious penetration, system viruses, malicious code and organized cyber-attacks, which could breach our security and disrupt our systems. These risks increase when we are making changes to our IT systems, such as our substantial IT systems upgrade initiative currently underway and our frequent updates to enable instructional innovation and address new student populations. Our size makes us a prominent target for hacking and other cyber-attacks within the education industry. From time to time we experience security events and incidents, and these reflect an increasing level of malicious sophistication, organization and innovation. We have devoted and will continue to devote significant resources to the security of our computer systems, but they may still be vulnerable to these threats. A user who circumvents security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions or malfunctions in operations, perhaps over an extended period of time prior to detection. As a result, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to protect against the threat of or alleviate problems caused by these system disruptions and security breaches. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. Although we maintain insurance in respect of these types of events, there is no assurance that available insurance proceeds would be adequate to compensate us for damages sustained due to these events.\nIn addition, possession and use of personal information in our operations subjects us to risks and costs that could harm our business. Our educational institutions collect, use and retain large amounts of personal information regarding our students and their families, including social security numbers, tax return information and personal and family financial data. We also collect and maintain personal information of our employees in the ordinary course of our business. Some of this personal information is held and managed by certain of our vendors. Although we use security and business controls to limit access and use of personal information, a third-party may be able to circumvent those security and business controls, which could result in a breach of student or employee privacy. In addition, errors in the storage, use or transmission of personal information could result in a breach of student or employee privacy, and the increased availability and use of mobile data devices by our employees and students increases the risk of unintentional disclosure of personal information. Possession and use of personal information in our operations also subjects us to legislative and regulatory burdens that could require notification of data breaches and restrict our use of personal information. We cannot ensure that a breach, loss or theft of personal information will not occur. A breach, theft or loss of personal information regarding our students and their families or our employees that is held by us or our vendors could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and results of operations and result in liability under state and federal privacy statutes and legal actions by state attorneys, general and private litigants, and any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nApollo Education Group, Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | 43\nIf we cannot attract qualified new personnel or retain our existing senior management team, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur future performance depends on the continued services and continuing contributions of our senior management to execute on our business plan and to identify and pursue new opportunities. Our future success also depends in large part on our continued ability to attract and retain qualified personnel. The loss of the services of our senior management for any reason could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe have experienced a number of changes in senior management in recent years. A lack of management continuity could result in operational and administrative inefficiencies, make achievement of our strategic and management objectives more challenging and may make recruiting for future management positions more difficult. If we are unable to effectively manage our business through these management transitions, our business and results of operation could be adversely affected.\nTo effectively educate our students, we must continue to attract and retain qualified faculty members.\nOur educational institutions employ approximately 19,000 faculty members, of which the substantial majority are adjunct, part-time faculty. In order to effectively educate our students, we must recruit and train a large number of faculty on an ongoing basis and keep our faculty engaged and focused on the mission of delivering quality education. If we cannot attract and retain sufficient qualified faculty members, or we fail to adequately train new faculty members, or our relations with faculty members deteriorate and lead to work stoppages or other disruptions, our ability to serve our students would be impaired and we may be required to reduce the scope or number of the classes available to our students, any of which could have a material adverse impact our business.\nIf we are unable to successfully conclude pending litigation and governmental inquiries, our business and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe, certain of our subsidiaries, and certain of our current and former directors and executive officers have been named as defendants in various lawsuits and we have received various governmental inquiries. Refer to Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies, and Note 17, Regulatory Matters, in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for further discussion of pending litigation and other proceedings. In addition, changes in our business and pending actions by regulators and accreditors may increase the risk of claims.\nWe cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these matters and expect to incur significant defense costs and other expenses in connection with them. Such costs and expenses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and the market price of our common stock. We may be required to pay substantial damages or settlement costs in excess of our insurance coverage related to these matters, or may be required to pay substantial fines or penalties, any of which could have a further material adverse effect on our financial condition. An adverse outcome in any of these matters could also materially and adversely affect our licenses, accreditations and eligibility to participate in Title IV programs.\nWe rely on proprietary rights and intellectual property that may not be adequately protected under current laws, and we encounter disputes from time to time relating to our use of intellectual property.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to protect our proprietary rights and intellectual property. We rely on a combination of copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, domain names and contractual agreements to protect our proprietary rights. For example, we rely on trademark protection in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions to protect our rights to various marks as well as distinctive logos and other marks associated with our services. We also rely on agreements under which we obtain intellectual property to own or license rights to use intellectual property developed by faculty members, content experts and other third-parties. We cannot assure that these measures are adequate, that we have secured, or will be able to secure, appropriate permissions or protections for all of the intellectual property rights we use or claim rights to in the U.S. or various foreign jurisdictions, or that third parties will not terminate our license rights or infringe upon or otherwise violate our intellectual property rights or the intellectual property rights of others. Despite our efforts to protect these rights, unauthorized third parties may attempt to use, duplicate or copy the proprietary aspects of our student recruitment and educational delivery methods and systems, curricula, online resource material or other content. Our management\u2019s attention may be diverted by these attempts and we may need to use funds in litigation to protect our proprietary rights against any infringement or violation, which could have a material adverse affect on our business and financial condition.\nWe may become party to disputes from time to time over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property, and we may not prevail in these disputes. For example, third parties may allege that we have infringed upon or not obtained sufficient rights in the technologies used in our educational delivery systems, the content of our courses or other training materials or in our ownership or uses of other intellectual property claimed by that third-party. Some third-party intellectual property rights may prove to be extremely broad, and it may not be possible for us to conduct our operations in such a way as to avoid violating those intellectual property rights. Any such intellectual property claim could subject us to costly litigation and impose a significant strain on our financial resources and management personnel regardless of whether such claim has merit. Our various liability insurance coverages, if any, may not cover potential claims of this type adequately or at all, and we may be required to alter the design and operation of our systems or the content of our courses or pay monetary damages or license fees to third parties, which could have a material adverse affect on our business and financial condition.\nApollo Education Group, Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | 44\nWe may incur liability for the unauthorized duplication, distribution or other use of materials posted online.\nIn some instances, our employees, including faculty members, or our students may post various articles or other third-party content online in class discussion boards or in other venues including Facebook, PhoenixConnect, University of Phoenix\u2019s proprietary academic social media network, and other social networks. The laws governing the fair use of these third-party materials are imprecise and adjudicated on a case-by-case basis, which makes it challenging to adopt and implement appropriately balanced institutional policies governing these practices. As a result, we could incur liability to third parties for the unauthorized duplication, distribution or other use of this material. Any such claims could subject us to costly litigation and impose a significant strain on our financial resources and management personnel regardless of whether the claims have merit. Our various liability insurance coverages, if any, may not cover potential claims of this type adequately or at all, and we may be required to alter or cease our uses of such material, which may include changing or removing content from our courses, or pay monetary damages, which could have a material adverse affect on our business and financial condition.\nWe may have unanticipated tax liabilities that could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to multiple types of taxes in the U.S., United Kingdom and various other foreign jurisdictions. The determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax accruals involves various judgments, and therefore the ultimate tax determination is subject to uncertainty. In addition, changes in tax laws, regulations, or rules may adversely affect our future reported financial results, may impact the way in which we conduct our business, or may increase the risk of audit by the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) or other tax authorities.\nDuring fiscal year 2015, the IRS completed its review of our U.S. federal income tax return for fiscal year 2014. Our federal income tax return for fiscal year 2013 is currently open for review by the IRS and we are also participating in the IRS\u2019s Compliance Assurance Process for fiscal years 2015, 2016 and 2017, which is a voluntary program in which taxpayers seek to resolve all or most issues with the IRS prior to or soon after filing their U.S. federal income tax returns. Additionally, we are subject to numerous ongoing audits by state, local and foreign tax authorities with various tax years as early as 2007 that remain subject to examination.\nAlthough we believe our tax accruals are reasonable, the final determination of tax returns under review or returns that may be reviewed in the future and any related litigation could result in tax liabilities that materially differ from our historical income tax provisions and accruals.\nIn addition, an increasing number of states and localities are adopting new laws or changing their interpretation of existing laws regarding the apportionment of service revenues for corporate income tax purposes in a manner that could result in a larger proportion of our income being taxed by the states into which we sell services. These legislative and administrative changes could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nRisks Related to the Control Over Our Voting Stock\nOur Class A common stock has no voting rights. The Apollo Class B Voting Stock Trust No. 1 holds approximately 51% of our voting stock and controls substantially all actions requiring the vote or consent of our shareholders, which may discourage or make impractical a takeover and may have an adverse effect on the trading price of our Class A common stock.\nApproximately 51% of our outstanding Class B voting shares, our only class of voting stock, is held by the Apollo Class B Voting Stock Trust No. 1 (the \u201cClass B Trust\u201d), an irrevocable trust of which the current trustees are Peter V. Sperling, Chairman of our Board of Directors, Ms. Terri Bishop, the Vice Chair of our Board of Directors, and Ms. Darby Shupp, a member of our Board of Directors. Mr. Peter Sperling owns the remaining 49% of our outstanding Class B voting stock through a revocable grantor trust. Accordingly, the Class B Trust and Mr. Peter Sperling together control the election of all members of our Board of Directors and substantially all other actions requiring a vote of our shareholders, except in certain limited circumstances. Holders of our outstanding Class A common stock do not have the right to vote for the election of directors or for substantially any other action requiring a vote of shareholders. The trustees of the Class B Trust have the sole power to appoint successor and additional trustees.\nThe control of a majority of our voting stock by the Class B Trust makes it impossible for a third-party to acquire voting control of us without the approval of a majority of the trustees of the Class B Trust. There is no assurance that the Apollo Education Group Class B shareholders, or the trustees of the Class B Trust, will exercise their control of Apollo Education Group in the same manner that a majority of the outstanding Class A shareholders would if they were entitled to vote on actions currently reserved exclusively for our Class B shareholders.\nApollo Education Group, Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | 45\nWe are a \u201cControlled Company\u201d under the Nasdaq Listing Rules and therefore are exempt from certain corporate governance requirements, which could reduce the influence of independent directors on our management and strategic direction.\nWe are a \u201cControlled Company\u201d as defined in Rule 5615(c)(1) of the Nasdaq Listing Rules, because more than 50% of the voting power of our outstanding stock is controlled by the Class B Trust. As a consequence, we are exempt from certain requirements of Nasdaq Listing Rule 5605, including that:\n\u2022\nOur Board be composed of a majority of Independent Directors (as defined in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5605(a)(2));\n\u2022\nThe compensation of our officers be determined by a majority of the independent directors or a compensation committee composed solely of independent directors; and\n\u2022\nNominations to the Board of Directors be made by a majority of the independent directors or a nominations committee composed solely of independent directors.\nHowever, Nasdaq Listing Rule 5605(b)(2) does require that our independent directors have regularly scheduled meetings at which only independent directors are present (\u201cexecutive sessions\u201d). In addition, Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m) requires that a compensation committee of outside directors (within the meaning of Section 162(m)) approve performance-based compensation awards to executive officers in order for us to claim deductions for the compensation expense attributable to such awards. Notwithstanding the foregoing exemptions, we do have a majority of independent directors on our Board of Directors and we do have an Audit Committee, a Compensation Committee and a Nominating and Governance Committee composed entirely of independent directors.\nThe charters for the Compensation Committee, Audit Committee and Nominating and Governance Committee have been adopted by the Board of Directors and are available on our website, www.apollo.edu. These charters provide, among other items, that each member must be independent as such term is defined by the rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC and the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nIf in the future our Board of Directors elects to rely on the exemptions permitted by the Nasdaq Listing Rules and reduce the number or proportion of independent directors on our Board and its key committees, the influence of independent directors on our management and strategy would be reduced and the influence of the holders of our Class B voting common stock on our management and strategy would increase.\nTransactions involving a change of control of our company may impair our eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, our accreditation and our state licenses in a manner that materially and adversely affects our business.\nA change of ownership or control of Apollo Education Group could require recertification by the U.S. Department of Education, the reevaluation of accreditation by HLC and the consent or reauthorization by state and foreign licensing agencies. If we experience a change of ownership or control, then University of Phoenix and certain of our other subsidiaries may cease to be eligible to participate in Title IV programs until recertified by the Department. The continuing participation of University of Phoenix in Title IV programs is critical to our business.\nIn addition, University of Phoenix is required to report any material change in stock ownership to its principal institutional accrediting body, HLC, and must obtain approval prior to undergoing any transaction that affects, or may affect, its corporate control or governance. In the event of any such change, HLC may undertake an evaluation of the effect of the change on the continuing operations of University of Phoenix for purposes of determining if continued accreditation is appropriate, which evaluation may include a comprehensive review. If accreditation by HLC is suspended or withdrawn, University of Phoenix would not be eligible to participate in Title IV programs until the accreditation is reinstated by the Commission or is obtained from another appropriate accrediting body.\nIn addition, some states in which University of Phoenix is licensed require approval (in some cases, advance approval) of changes in ownership or control in order to remain authorized to operate in those states, and participation in grant programs in some states may be interrupted or otherwise affected by a change in ownership or control.\nIn connection with our pending merger transaction, we have obtained or are seeking the necessary regulatory approvals.\nAs discussed above, approximately 51% of our outstanding Class B voting stock, our only class of voting stock, is held by the Class B Trust, and Mr. Peter Sperling beneficially owns the remaining 49% of such shares. If our pending merger transaction is not consummated, a future change in trustees of the Class B Trust, whether resulting from resignation, death, disability or otherwise, may be considered to be a change of control by the Department of Education, HLC or other regulatory authorities, depending on the circumstances.\nWe cannot prevent a change of ownership or control that would arise from a transfer of voting stock by the Class B Trust or Mr. Peter Sperling, including a transfer that may occur or be deemed to occur upon the resignation, death or incompetency of one or more of the trustees of the Class B Trust.\nApollo Education Group, Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | 46", "PERMNO": 81138, "SIC": 8200, "TIC": "APOL"}
