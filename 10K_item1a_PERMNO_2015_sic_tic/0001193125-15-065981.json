RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information included in this Report, in considering our business and prospects. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations. The occurrence of any of the following risks could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe have a history of operating losses and may not achieve profitability again.\nWe incurred operating losses in each annual fiscal year since our inception, except for 2011. For 2014 and 2013, we reported a net loss of $50.1 million and $18.0 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2014, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $293.7 million. We do not expect to be profitable for fiscal 2015 and our ability to be profitable in the future will likely depend on our ability to continue to increase our revenues, which is subject to a number of factors including our ability to continue to successfully penetrate the Clinical market, our ability to successfully market the GeneXpert system and develop and market additional GeneXpert tests, our ability to sell directly to the smaller hospital (hospitals with less than 150 beds) and independent reference laboratory markets, our ability to secure regulatory approval of additional GeneXpert tests, our ability to gain FDA regulatory and international regulatory clearance for our new products, our ability to continue to grow sales of GeneXpert tests, our ability to compete effectively against current and future competitors, the increasing number of competitors in our market that could reduce the average selling price of our products, the development of our HBDC sales program, the amount of products sold through the HBDC program and the extent of global funding for such program, our ability to penetrate new geographic markets, global economic and political conditions and our ability to increase manufacturing throughput. Our ability to be profitable also depends on our expense levels and product gross margin, which are also influenced by a number of factors, including: the mix of revenues from Clinical reagent sales and GeneXpert system sales as opposed to GeneXpert Infinity system sales and sales under our HBDC program, both of which have lower gross margins; the resources we devote to developing and supporting our products; increases in manufacturing costs associated with our operations; our ability to improve manufacturing efficiencies, our ability to manage our inventory levels; third-party freight costs; the resources we devote to our research and development of and compliance with regulatory processes for potential products; license fees or royalties we may be required to pay; the potential need to acquire licenses to new technology or to use our technology in new markets, which could require us to pay unanticipated license fees and royalties in connection with these licenses; and the prices at which we are able to sell our GeneXpert systems and tests. Our manufacturing expansion efforts may prove more expensive than we currently anticipate, and we may not succeed in increasing our revenues to offset higher expenses These expenses or a reduction in the prices at which we are able to sell our products, among other things, may cause our net income and working capital to decrease. If we fail to grow our revenue, manage our expenses and improve our gross margin, we may never achieve profitability again. If we fail to do so, the market price of our common stock will likely decline.\nOur operating results may fluctuate significantly, our customers\u2019 future purchases are difficult to predict and any failure to meet financial expectations may result in a decline in our stock price.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate in the future as a result of many factors, such as those described elsewhere in this section, many of which are beyond our control. Because our revenue and operating results are difficult to predict, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations are not a good indicator of our future performance. Our operating results may be affected by the inability of some of our customers to consummate anticipated purchases of our products, whether due to adverse economic conditions, changes in internal priorities or, in the case of governmental customers, problems with the appropriations process, concerns over future United States federal government budgetary negotiations, variability and timing of orders and delays in our customer billing and collection processes related to our ongoing implementation of an enterprise resource planning system. Additionally, we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, meaningful variability in connection with our commercial system placements and system placements and reagent pull-through in our HBDC program. This variability may cause our revenues and operating results to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter. Additionally, because of the limited visibility into the actual timing of future system placements, our operating results are difficult to forecast from quarter to quarter. Additionally, we expect moderate fluctuations from quarter to quarter in gross margin depending on product, geography and channel mix, as well as the revenue contribution from our HBDC program, which has lower margin than our other products. If revenue declines in a quarter, whether due to a delay in recognizing expected revenue, adverse economic conditions and unexpected costs or otherwise, our results of operations will be harmed because many of our expenses are relatively fixed. In particular, research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses are not significantly affected by variations in revenue. However, if we have an unexpected increase in costs and expenses in a quarter, our quarterly operating results will be affected. For example, for the year ended December 31, 2013, we incurred certain costs and inventory reserve provisions related to our manufacturing scale up and restructuring activities. Additionally, in July 2014, we began to self-insure for a portion of employee health insurance coverage and we estimate the liabilities associated with the risks retained by us, in part, by considering actuarial assumptions which, by their nature, are subject to a high degree of variability. If the number or severity of claims for which we are self-insured increases, or if we are required to accrue or pay additional amounts because the claims prove to be more severe than our original assessments, our operating results may be affected. If our quarterly operating results fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price could drop suddenly and significantly.\nIf we are unable to manufacture our products in sufficient quantities and in a timely manner, our operating results will be harmed, our ability to generate revenues could be diminished, and our gross margin may be negatively impacted.\nOur revenues and other operating results will depend in large part on our ability to manufacture and assemble our products in sufficient quantities and in a timely manner. In the past, we have experienced lower than expected revenue due to intermittent interruptions in our supply chain, which also negatively impacted the efficiency of our manufacturing operations and our resulting gross margin. Any future interruptions we experience in the manufacturing or shipping of our products could delay our ability to recognize revenues in a particular quarter and could also adversely affect our relationships with our customers and erode customer confidence in our product availability. Manufacturing problems can and do arise, and as demand for our products increases, any such problems could have an increasingly significant impact on our operating results. In the past, we have experienced problems and delays in production that have impacted our product yield and the efficiency of our manufacturing operations and caused delays in our ability to ship finished products, and we may experience such delays in the future. We may not be able to react quickly enough to ship products and recognize anticipated revenues for a given period if we experience significant delays in the manufacturing process. In addition, we must maintain sufficient production capacity in order to minimize such delays, which carries fixed costs that we may not be able to offset if orders slow, which would adversely affect our operating margins. If we are unable to manufacture our products consistently, in sufficient quantities, and on a timely basis, our revenues from product sales, gross margins and our other operating results will be materially and adversely affected.\nWe have a limited number of suppliers for critical product components, and if such suppliers fail to deliver key product components in a timely manner, our manufacturing ability would be impaired and our product sales could suffer.\nWe depend on a limited number of suppliers that supply some of the components used in the manufacture of our systems and our disposable reaction tubes and cartridges. Strategic purchases of components are necessary for our business. If we need alternative sources for key component parts for any reason, these component parts may not be immediately available to us. If alternative suppliers are not immediately available, we will have to identify and qualify alternative suppliers, and production of these components may be delayed. We may not be able to find an adequate alternative supplier in a reasonable time period or on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. Shipments of affected products have been limited or delayed as a result of such problems in the past, and similar problems could occur in the future. For example, in the past, we have experienced intermittent interruptions in the supply of Xpert cartridge parts, which negatively impacted our product sales. In addition, some companies continue to experience financial difficulties, partially resulting from continued economic uncertainty. We cannot be assured that our suppliers will not be adversely affected by this uncertainty or that they will be able to continue to provide us with the components we need. Our inability to obtain our key source supplies for the manufacture of our products may require us to delay shipments of products, harm customer relationships or force us to curtail or cease operations.\nOur sales cycle can be lengthy, which can cause variability and unpredictability in our operating results.\nThe sales cycles for our systems can be lengthy, particularly during uncertain economic and political conditions, which makes it more difficult for us to accurately forecast revenues in a given period, and may cause revenues and operating results to vary significantly from period to period. For example, sales of our products often involve purchasing decisions by large public and private institutions and any purchases can require many levels of pre-approval. Additionally, because we only recently began selling directly to independent reference laboratories, the sales cycle to independent reference laboratories may be unpredictable for a period of time. In addition, certain Non-Clinical sales may depend on these institutions receiving research grants from various federal agencies, which grants vary considerably from year to year, in both amount and timing, due to the political process. Additionally, participants in our HBDC program may be dependent on funding from governmental agencies and/or non-governmental organizations and, accordingly, such customers\u2019 purchase decisions may not be within their direct control and may be subject to lengthy administrative processes, the result of which is that the sales cycle in our HBDC program is lengthy and unpredictable. As a result, we may expend considerable resources on unsuccessful sales efforts or we may not be able to complete transactions on the schedule anticipated.\nIf we cannot successfully commercialize our products, our business could be harmed.\nIf our tests for use on our systems do not continue to gain market acceptance, we will be unable to generate significant sales, which will prevent us from achieving profitability. While we have received FDA clearance for a number of tests, these products may not experience increased sales. Many factors may affect the market acceptance and commercial success of our products, including:\n\u2022\nthe timely expansion of our menu of tests;\n\u2022\nour ability to fulfill orders;\n\u2022\nthe results of clinical trials needed to support any regulatory approvals of our tests;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain requisite FDA or other regulatory clearances or approvals for our tests under development on a timely basis;\n\u2022\nthe demand for the tests we introduce;\n\u2022\nthe timing of market entry for various tests for the GeneXpert systems;\n\u2022\nour ability to convince our potential customers of the advantages and economic value of our systems and tests over competing technologies and products;\n\u2022\nthe breadth of our test menu relative to competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges to policies, procedures or what are considered best practices in clinical diagnostics, including practices for detecting and preventing healthcare-associated infections;\n\u2022\nthe extent and success of our marketing and sales efforts;\n\u2022\nthe functionality of new products that address market requirements and customer demands;\n\u2022\nthe pricing of our products;\n\u2022\nthe level of reimbursement for our products by third-party payers; and\n\u2022\nthe publicity concerning our systems and tests.\nIn particular, we believe that the success of our business will depend in large part on our ability to continue to increase sales of our Xpert tests and our ability to introduce additional tests for the Clinical market. We believe that successfully expanding our business in the Clinical market is critical to our long-term goals and success. We have limited ability to forecast future demand for our products in this market. In addition, we have committed substantial funds to licenses that are required for us to compete in the Clinical market. If we cannot successfully penetrate the Clinical market to fully exploit these licenses, these investments may not yield significant returns, which could harm our business.\nThe regulatory processes applicable to our products and operations are expensive, time-consuming and uncertain, and may prevent us from obtaining required approvals for the commercialization of some of our products.\nIn the Clinical market, our products are regulated as medical device products by the FDA and comparable agencies of other countries. In particular, FDA regulations govern activities such as product development, product testing, product labeling, product storage, premarket clearance or approval, manufacturing, advertising, promotion, product sales, reporting of certain product failures and distribution. Some of our products, depending on their intended use, will require premarket approval (\u201cPMA\u201d) or 510(k) clearance from the FDA prior to marketing. The 510(k) clearance process usually takes approximately 90 days from submission but can take longer. The PMA process is much more costly, lengthy and uncertain, and generally takes from six months to one year or longer from submission, depending on whether an advisory panel meeting is necessary. Clinical studies are generally required to support both PMA and 510(k) submissions. Certain of our products for use on our GeneXpert and SmartCycler systems, when used for clinical purposes in the United States, may require PMA, and all such tests will most likely, at a minimum, require 510(k) clearance. We are planning clinical studies for other proposed products. Products intended for use in a non-waived physician office laboratory will require an additional submission known as a CLIA waiver. CLIA waiver applications typically take approximately 180 days for approval, and require additional studies. Clinical trials are expensive and time-consuming, as are human factors studies required for CLIA waiver. In addition, the commencement or completion of any clinical trials may be delayed or halted for any number of reasons, including product performance, changes in intended use, changes in medical practice and the opinion of evaluator Institutional Review Boards. Additionally, since 2009, the FDA has significantly increased the scrutiny applied to its oversight of companies subject to its regulations, including 510(k) submissions, by hiring new investigators and increasing inspections of manufacturing facilities. We continue to monitor the CDRH\u2019s implementation of its plan of action and analyze how its decisions will impact the approval or clearance of our products and our ability to improve our systems and tests. The CDRH also deferred action on several other initiatives, including the creation of a new class of devices that would be subject to heightened review processes, until the Institute of Medicine issues a related report on the 510(k) regulatory process, which was released in late July 2011. Many of the actions proposed by the CDRH could result in significant changes to the 510(k) process, which could complicate the product approval process, although we cannot predict the effect of such changes and cannot ascertain if such changes will have a substantive impact on the approval of our products. If we fail to adequately respond to the increased scrutiny and streamlined 510(k) submission process, our business may be adversely impacted. In 2014, the FDA issued several important guidance documents on assessing risks and benefits associated with use of 510(k) for PMA products, pre- and post-market balance, expedited PMA, and on oversight of laboratory developed tests. While the overall goal of these guidance documents was to streamline the regulatory process by applying a risk-based approach to the requirements for data collection in the pre- and post-market periods, it is uncertain how the guidance documents will actually be implemented. Likewise, the oversight of laboratory developed tests would require laboratories that compete with high risk (PMA) tests to go through FDA review. It is unclear if this guidance will be finalized. If it is, competition for PMA tests from laboratories would be reduced.\nFailure to comply with the applicable requirements can result in, among other things, warning letters, administrative or judicially imposed sanctions such as injunctions, civil penalties, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, refusal to grant premarket clearance or PMA for devices, withdrawal of marketing clearances or approvals, or criminal prosecution. With regard to future products for which we seek 510(k) clearance, PMA approval, or CLIA waiver from the FDA, any failure or material delay to obtain such clearance or approval could harm our business. If the FDA were to disagree with our regulatory assessment and conclude that approval or clearance is necessary to market the products, we could be forced to cease marketing the products and seek approval or clearance. In addition, it is possible that the current regulatory framework could change or additional regulations could arise at any stage during our product development or marketing, which may adversely affect our ability to obtain or maintain approval of our products and could harm our business.\nOur manufacturing facilities located in Sunnyvale and Lodi, California, Seattle, Washington and Stockholm, Sweden, where we assemble and produce the GeneXpert and SmartCycler systems, cartridges and other molecular diagnostic kits and reagents, are subject to periodic regulatory inspections by the FDA and other federal and state and foreign regulatory agencies. For example, these facilities are subject to Quality System Regulations (\u201cQSR\u201d) of the FDA and are subject to annual inspection and licensing by the States of California and Washington and European regulatory agencies. If we fail to maintain these facilities in accordance with the QSR requirements, international quality standards or other regulatory requirements, our manufacturing process could be suspended or terminated, which would prevent us from being able to provide products to our customers in a timely fashion and therefore harm our business.\nRecently enacted healthcare legislation reforming the U.S. healthcare system, as well as future reforms, may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn March 2010, the U.S. President signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the \u201cPPACA\u201d), which makes changes that are expected to significantly impact the pharmaceutical and medical device industries. One of the principal aims of the PPACA as currently enacted is to expand health insurance coverage to approximately 32 million Americans who were previously uninsured. The PPACA contains a number of\nprovisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund the coverage expansions among other things. This includes new fees or taxes on certain health-related industries, including medical device manufacturers. Beginning in 2013, medical device manufacturers were required to pay an excise tax (or sales tax) of 2.3% of certain U.S. medical device revenues. Though there are some exceptions to the excise tax, this excise tax does apply to all or most of our products sold within the United States.\nThe taxes imposed by the PPACA and the expansion in the government\u2019s role in the U.S. healthcare industry may result in decreased profits to us, lower reimbursement by payors for our products, and/or reduced medical procedure volumes, all of which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the PPACA was enacted. More recently, on August 2, 2011, the U.S. President signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, creates the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend proposals in spending reductions to Congress. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislation\u2019s automatic reduction to several government programs. This included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013, and will remain in effect through 2024 unless additional Congressional action is taken. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, , which as a result could mean that such providers have less available funds with which to purchase our products.\nWe expect that additional state and federal health care reform measures may be adopted in the future, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our industry generally and our ability to successfully commercialize our products. For example, the U.S. government has in the past considered, is currently considering and may in the future consider healthcare policies and proposals intended to curb rising healthcare costs, including those that could significantly affect both private and public reimbursement for healthcare services. Further, state and local governments, as well as a number of foreign governments, are also considering or have adopted similar types of policies. Future significant changes in the healthcare systems in the United States or elsewhere, and current uncertainty about whether and how changes may be implemented, could have a negative impact on the demand for our products. We are unable to predict whether other healthcare policies, including policies stemming from legislation or regulations affecting our business may be proposed or enacted in the future; what effect such policies would have on our business; or the effect ongoing uncertainty about these matters will have on the purchasing decisions of our customers.\nOur HBDC program exposes us to increased risks of variability and unpredictable operating results.\nOur HBDC program exposes us to risks that are additional and different from the risks associated with our commercial operations, including among other things:\n\u2022\nthe participants in our HBDC program are located in less developed countries, exposing us to customers in countries that may have less political, social or economic stability and less developed infrastructure and legal systems;\n\u2022\nthe sales cycle in our HBDC program is lengthy and unpredictable, as HBDC program participants are frequently dependent upon governmental agencies and/or non-governmental organizations with additional administrative processes, causing variability and unpredictability in our operating results and timing of cash collection;\n\u2022\nour HBDC business has lower gross margins and, therefore, growth in our HBDC business negatively impacts our gross margins as a whole; and\n\u2022\nour collaborative partners and other supporters, such as FIND, BMGF, USAID, UNITAID and the World Health Organization, may cease to devote financial resources to or otherwise cease to support our HBDC program.\nContinued unpredictable sales cycle and lower gross margins and/or an adverse development relating to one or more of these risks could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, our HBDC program facilitates the expansion of our commercial operations into additional geographic locations and, to the extent that our HBDC program is ineffective as a result of one or more of these risks, the international expansion of our commercial operations could suffer.\nWe rely on licenses of key technology from third parties and may require additional licenses for many of our new product candidates.\nWe rely on third-party licenses to be able to sell many of our products, and we could lose these third-party licenses for a number of reasons, including, for example, early terminations of such agreements due to breaches or alleged breaches by either party to the agreement. If we are unable to enter into a new agreement for licensed technologies, either on terms that are acceptable to us or at all, we may be unable to sell some of our products or access some geographic or industry markets. We also need to introduce new products and product features in order to market our products to a broader customer base and grow our revenues, and many new products and product features could require us to obtain additional licenses and pay additional license fees and royalties. Furthermore,\nfor some markets, we intend to manufacture reagents and tests for use on our systems. We believe that manufacturing reagents and developing tests for our systems is important to our business and growth prospects but may require additional licenses, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our ability to develop, manufacture and sell products, and our strategic plans and growth, could be impaired if we are unable to obtain these licenses or if these licenses are terminated or expire and cannot be renewed. We may not be able to obtain or renew licenses for a given product or product feature or for some reagents on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Furthermore, some of our competitors have rights to technologies and reagents that we do not have which may put us at a competitive disadvantage in certain circumstances and could adversely affect our performance.\nWe may face risks associated with acquisitions of companies, products and technologies and our business could be harmed if we are unable to address these risks.\nIn order to remain competitive, obtain key competencies, consolidate our supply chain or sales force, acquire complementary products or technologies, or for other reasons, we may seek to acquire additional businesses, products or technologies. Even if we identify an appropriate acquisition or are presented with appropriate opportunities to acquire or make other investments, we may not be successful in negotiating the terms of the acquisition, financing the acquisition, consummating the acquisition or effectively integrating the acquired business, product or technology into our existing business and operations. For example, in 2012, we acquired one of our plastic molders, in 2013, we acquired distributors in two of our international locations, and in 2014, we re-acquired certain product distribution rights and acquired customer relationship assets from a former distributor in the United States. We have limited experience in successfully acquiring and integrating businesses, products and technologies, and even if we are able to consummate an acquisition or other investment, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or investments, including our recent acquisitions. We may face risks, uncertainties and disruptions, including difficulties in the integration of the operations and services of these acquisitions or any other acquired company, integration of acquired technology with our products, diversion of our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, the potential loss of key employees or customers of the acquired businesses and impairment charges if future acquisitions are not as successful as we originally anticipate. If we fail to successfully integrate companies, assets, products or technologies that we acquire or if we fail to successfully exploit acquired product distribution rights and maintain acquired relationships with customers, our business could be harmed. Furthermore, we may have to incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any additional future acquisitions or investments or issue shares of common stock as consideration in the acquisition, the issuance of which could be dilutive to our existing shareholders. In addition, our operating results may suffer because of acquisition-related costs or amortization expenses or charges relating to acquired intangible assets. Furthermore, identifying, contemplating, negotiating or completing an acquisition and integrating an acquired business, product or technology could significantly divert management and employee time and resources.\nThe current uncertainty in global economic conditions makes it particularly difficult to predict product demand and other related matters and makes it more likely that our actual results could differ materially from expectations.\nOur operations and performance depend on global economic conditions, which have been adversely impacted by continued global economic uncertainty, political instability and military hostilities in multiple geographies, the recent rapid strengthening of the U.S. Dollar compared to foreign currencies and monetary and international financial uncertainties. These conditions have and may continue to make it difficult for our customers and potential customers to accurately forecast and plan future business activities, and have caused our customers and potential customers to slow or reduce spending, particularly for systems. Furthermore, during economic uncertainty, our customers have experienced and may continue to experience issues gaining timely access to sufficient credit, which could result in their unwillingness to purchase products or an impairment of their ability to make timely payments to us. If that were to continue to occur, we might experience decreased sales, be required to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts and our days sales outstanding would be negatively impacted. Even with improved global economic conditions, it may take time for our customers to establish new budgets and return to normal purchasing patterns. We cannot predict the reoccurrence of any economic slowdown or the sustainability of improved economic conditions, worldwide, in the United States or in our industry. These and other economic factors could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and on our financial condition and operating results.\nIf certain of our products fail to obtain an adequate level of reimbursement from third-party payers, our ability to sell products in the Clinical market would be harmed.\nOur ability to sell our products in the Clinical market will depend in part on the extent to which reimbursement for tests using our products will be available from government health administration authorities, private health coverage insurers, managed care organizations and other organizations. There are efforts by governmental and third-party payers to contain or reduce the costs of\nhealthcare through various means and the continuous growth of managed care, together with efforts to reform the healthcare delivery system in the United States and Europe, has increased pressure on healthcare providers and participants in the healthcare industry to reduce costs. Consolidation among healthcare providers and other participants in the healthcare industry has resulted in fewer, more powerful healthcare groups, whose purchasing power gives them cost containment leverage. Additionally, third-party payers are increasingly challenging the price of medical products and services. If purchasers or users of our products are not able to obtain adequate reimbursement for the cost of using our products, they may forego or reduce their use. Significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products and whether adequate third-party coverage will be available.\nThe life sciences industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, if our competitors and potential competitors develop superior products and technologies, our competitive position and results of operations would suffer.\nWe face intense competition from a number of companies that offer products in our target markets, some of which have substantially greater financial resources and larger, more established marketing, sales and service organizations than we do. These competitors include:\n\u2022\ncompanies developing and marketing sequence detection systems for industrial research products;\n\u2022\ndiagnostic and pharmaceutical companies;\n\u2022\ncompanies developing drug discovery technologies; and\n\u2022\ncompanies developing or offering biothreat detection technologies.\nSeveral companies provide systems and reagents for DNA amplification or detection. Life Technologies Corporation (acquired by Thermo Fisher Scientific) and Roche sell systems integrating DNA amplification and detection (sequence detection systems) to the commercial market. Roche, Abbott, Becton Dickinson, Qiagen, Hologic, Luminex, Meridian, bioMerieux, and Quidel sell sequence detection systems, some with separate robotic batch DNA purification systems and sell reagents to the Clinical market. Other companies such as Nanosphere Inc., Alere Inc., and GenMark Diagnostics, Inc. offer molecular tests. Additionally, we anticipate that in the future, additional competitors will emerge that offer a broad range of competing products.\nThe life sciences industry is characterized by rapid and continuous technological innovation. We may need to develop new technologies for our products to remain competitive. One or more of our current or future competitors could render our present or future products technologically obsolete or uneconomical by reducing the prices of their competing products. In addition, the introduction or announcement of new products by us or others could result in a delay of or decrease in sales of existing products, as we await regulatory approvals and as customers evaluate these new products. We may also encounter other problems in the process of delivering new products to the marketplace such as problems related to design, development or manufacturing of such products, and as a result we may be unsuccessful in selling such products. Our future success depends on our ability to compete effectively against current technologies, as well as to respond effectively to technological advances by developing and marketing products that are competitive in the continually changing technological landscape.\nIf our products do not perform as expected or the reliability of the technology on which our products are based is questioned, we could experience lost revenue, delayed or reduced market acceptance of our products, increased costs and damage to our reputation.\nOur success depends on the market\u2019s confidence that we can provide reliable, high-quality molecular test systems. We believe that customers in our target markets are likely to be particularly sensitive to product defects and errors. Our reputation and the public image of our products or technologies may be impaired if our products fail to perform as expected or our products are perceived as difficult to use. Despite testing, defects or errors could occur in our products or technologies. Furthermore, with respect to the USPS BDS program, our products are incorporated into larger systems that are built and delivered by others and we cannot control many aspects of the final system.\nIn the future, if our products experience a material defect or error, this could result in loss or delay of revenues, delayed market acceptance, damaged reputation, diversion of development resources, legal claims, increased insurance costs or increased service and warranty costs, any of which could harm our business. Such defects or errors could also prompt us to amend certain warning labels or narrow the scope of the use of our products, either of which could hinder our success in the market. Furthermore, any product failure in the overall USPS BDS program, even if it is unrelated to our products, could harm our business. Even after any underlying concerns or problems are resolved, any widespread concerns regarding our technology or any manufacturing defects or performance errors in our products could result in lost revenue, delayed market acceptance, damaged reputation, increased service and warranty costs and claims against us.\nIf product liability lawsuits are successfully brought against us, we may face reduced demand for our products and incur significant liabilities.\nWe face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims if our technologies or systems are alleged to have caused harm or do not perform in accordance with specifications, in part because our products are used for sensitive applications. We cannot be certain that we would be able to successfully defend any product liability lawsuit brought against us. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in:\n\u2022\ndecreased demand for our products;\n\u2022\ninjury to our reputation;\n\u2022\nincreased product liability insurance costs;\n\u2022\ncosts of related litigation; and\n\u2022\nsubstantial monetary awards to plaintiffs.\nAlthough we carry product liability insurance, if we become the subject of a successful product liability lawsuit, our insurance may not cover all substantial liabilities, which could harm our business.\nIf our direct selling efforts for our products fail, our business expansion plans could suffer and our ability to generate sales will be diminished.\nWe have a relatively small sales force compared to some of our competitors. Further, we recently consolidated our global commercial operations under a single executive to emphasize end-to-end accountability, eliminate duplication and clarify decision responsibilities, and reduce organizational complexity. Our former Executive Vice President, International Commercial Operations, who joined us in June 2014, transitioned into the new role of Executive Vice President, Worldwide Commercial Operations in October 2014, where he is responsible for his prior duties and for our North American commercial operations, including the planned expansion of our U.S. sales organization. Our former Executive Vice President, North American Commercial Operations transitioned out of Cepheid in October 2014.\nIf our distributor relationships are not successful, our ability to market and sell our products would be harmed and our financial performance will be adversely affected.\nWe depend on relationships with distributors for the marketing and sales of our products in the Clinical and Non-Clinical markets in various geographic regions, and we have a limited ability to influence their efforts. We expect to continue to rely substantially on our distributor relationships for sales into other markets or geographic regions, that are key to our long-term growth strategy. Relying on distributors for our sales and marketing could harm our business for various reasons, including:\n\u2022\nagreements with distributors may terminate prematurely due to disagreements or may result in litigation between the partners;\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to renew existing distributor agreements on acceptable terms;\n\u2022\nour distributors may not devote sufficient resources to the sale of our products;\n\u2022\nour distributors may be unsuccessful in marketing our products;\n\u2022\nour existing relationships with distributors may preclude us from entering into additional future arrangements with other distributors; and\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to negotiate future distributor agreements on acceptable terms.\nIf any of our distribution agreements are terminated or if we elect to distribute new products directly, we will have to invest in additional sales resources, including additional field sales personnel, which would increase future selling, general and administrative expenses. For example, in October 2014, we terminated our distribution agreement with the Laboratory Supply Company and transitioned the smaller hospital market from a distributor sales model to a direct sales model. As a result, we are investing in additional sales resources to sell directly to the smaller hospital market and are exposed to risks as a result of transitioning the smaller hospital market from a distributor sales model to a direct sales model, such as difficulties maintaining relationships with specific customers and hiring appropriately trained personnel, any of which could result in lower revenues than we previously received from our distributor in that market. If we elect to distribute new products directly in other markets or in new geographic regions, then we would be exposed to similar risks.\nIf we desire to enter into other distribution arrangements, we may not be able to enter into new distribution agreements on satisfactory terms, or at all. If we fail to enter into acceptable distribution agreements or fail to successfully market our products, our product sales may decrease.\nWe may be subject to third-party claims that require additional licenses for our products and we could face costly litigation, which could cause us to pay substantial damages and limit our ability to sell some or all of our products.\nOur industry is characterized by a large number of patents, claims of which appear to overlap in many cases. As a result, there is a significant amount of uncertainty regarding the extent of patent protection and infringement. Companies may have pending patent applications, which are typically confidential for the first eighteen months following filing that cover technologies we incorporate in our products. Accordingly, we may be subjected to substantial damages for past infringement or be required to modify our products or stop selling them if it is ultimately determined that our products infringe a third party\u2019s proprietary rights. Moreover, from time to time, we are subject to patent litigation and receive correspondence and other communications from companies that ask us to evaluate the need for a license of patents they hold, and indicating or suggesting that we need a license to their patents in order to offer our products and services or to conduct our business operations. For example, we are currently engaged in litigation as further described in Part I, Item 3 \u201cLegal Proceedings.\u201d At this point in time we believe that it is probable that the Roche arbitration proceeding disclosed in Part I, Item 3 \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d could result in a material loss. Accordingly, we recorded an estimated charge of $20 million as our best estimate of the potential loss as of December 31, 2014, which was included in our consolidated balance sheet. Given the inherent uncertainty of arbitration and the nature of the claims in this matter, it is possible that we may incur additional material losses but an estimate of such a charge cannot be made at this time. Additionally, in September 2012, we entered into an agreement with Abaxis pursuant to which, in exchange for a one-time payment by us to Abaxis of $17.3 million, all present and future litigation relating to the alleged infringement of certain Abaxis patents by us and our counterclaims against Abaxis were resolved. Even if we are successful in defending against any current or future patent claims, we would likely incur substantial costs in doing so. Any litigation related to existing claims and others that may arise in the future would likely consume our resources and could lead to significant damages, royalty payments or an injunction on the sale of certain products. Any additional licenses to patented technology could obligate us to pay substantial additional royalties, which could adversely impact our product costs and harm our business.\nIf we fail to maintain and protect our intellectual property rights, our competitors could use our technology to develop competing products and our business will suffer.\nOur competitive success will be affected in part by our continued ability to obtain and maintain patent protection for our inventions, technologies and discoveries, including our intellectual property that includes technologies that we license. Our ability to do so will depend on, among other things, complex legal and factual questions. We have patents related to some of our technology and have licensed some of our technology under patents of others. Our patents and licenses may not successfully preclude others from using our technology. Our pending patent applications may lack priority over applications submitted by third parties or may not result in the issuance of patents. Even if issued, our patents may not be sufficiently broad to provide protection against competitors with similar technologies and may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented.\nIn addition, there are numerous recent changes to the patent laws and proposed changes to the rules of the United States Patent and Trademark Office, which may have a significant impact on our ability to protect our technology and enforce our intellectual property rights. For example, in September 2011, the United States enacted sweeping changes to the United States patent system under the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, including changes that would transition the United States from a \u201cfirst-to-invent\u201d system to a \u201cfirst-to-file\u201d system and alter the processes for challenging issued patents. These changes could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents. In addition to patents, we rely on a combination of trade secrets, copyright and trademark laws, nondisclosure agreements, licenses and other contractual provisions and technical measures to maintain and develop our competitive position with respect to intellectual property. Nevertheless, these measures may not be adequate to safeguard the technology underlying our products. For example, employees, consultants and others who participate in the development of our products may breach their agreements with us regarding our intellectual property, and we may not have adequate remedies for the breach. We also may not be able to effectively protect our intellectual property rights in some foreign countries, as many countries do not offer the same level of legal protection for intellectual property as the United States. Furthermore, for a variety of reasons, we may decide not to file for patent, copyright or trademark protection outside of the United States. Our trade secrets could become known through other unforeseen means. Notwithstanding our efforts to protect our intellectual property, our competitors may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or products that are equal or superior to our technology. Our competitors may also develop similar products without infringing on any of our intellectual property rights or design around our proprietary technologies. Furthermore, any efforts to enforce our proprietary rights could result in disputes and legal proceedings that could be costly and divert attention from our business.\nThe United States Government has certain rights to use and disclose some of the intellectual property that we license and could exclusively license it to a third party if we fail to achieve practical application of the intellectual property.\nAspects of the technology licensed by us under agreements with third party licensors may be subject to certain government rights. Government rights in inventions conceived or reduced to practice under a government-funded program may include a non-exclusive, royalty-free worldwide license to practice or have practiced such inventions for any governmental purpose. In addition, the United States federal government has the right to require us or our licensors (as applicable) to grant licenses which would be exclusive under any of such inventions to a third party if they determine that: (1) adequate steps have not been taken to commercialize such inventions in a particular field of use; (2) such action is necessary to meet public health or safety needs; or (3) such action is necessary to meet requirements for public use under federal regulations. Further, the government rights include the right to use and disclose, without limitation, technical data relating to licensed technology that was developed in whole or in part at government expense. At least one of our technology license agreements contains a provision recognizing these government rights.\nWe may need to initiate lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents, which would be expensive and, if we lose, may cause us to lose some, if not all, of our intellectual property rights and thereby impair our ability to compete.\nWe rely on patents to protect a large part of our intellectual property. To protect or enforce our patent rights, we may initiate patent litigation against third parties, such as infringement suits or interference proceedings. These lawsuits could be expensive, take significant time and divert management\u2019s attention from other business concerns. They would also put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly, and our patent applications at risk of not issuing. We may also provoke these third parties to assert claims against us. Patent law relating to the scope of claims in the technology fields in which we operate is still evolving and, consequently, patent positions in our industry are generally uncertain. We cannot be assured that we would prevail in any of these suits or that the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, would be commercially valuable. During the course of these suits, there may be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions and other interim proceedings or developments in the litigation. Any public announcements related to such patent suits could cause our stock price to decline.\nOur international operations subject us to additional risks and costs.\nWe conduct operations on a global basis. These operations are subject to a number of difficulties and special costs, including:\n\u2022\ncompliance with multiple, conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations, including United States laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and local laws that prohibit bribes and certain payments to governmental officials such as the UK Bribery Act 2010, data privacy requirements, labor relations laws, tax laws, anti-competition regulations, import and trade restrictions, and export requirements;\n\u2022\nincreased regulatory risk, including additional regulatory requirements different or more stringent than those in the United States;\n\u2022\nlaws and business practices favoring local competitors;\n\u2022\nforeign exchange and currency risks;\n\u2022\nexposure to risks associated with sovereign debt uncertainties in Europe and other foreign countries;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in collecting accounts receivable or longer payment cycles;\n\u2022\nimport and export restrictions and tariffs;\n\u2022\ndifficulties staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u2022\ndifficulties and expense in enforcing intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nbusiness risks, including fluctuations in demand for our products and the cost and effort to conduct international operations and travel abroad to promote international distribution and overall global economic conditions;\n\u2022\nmultiple conflicting tax laws and regulations; and\n\u2022\npolitical and economic instability and outbreak of military hostilities.\nWe intend to expand our international sales and marketing activities, including through our direct sales operations and through relationships with additional international distribution partners. We may not be able to attract international distribution partners that will be able to market our products effectively or may have trouble entering geographic markets that are less receptive to sales from foreign entities.\nAdditionally, our continued expansion into less developed countries in connection with our HBDC program, which may have less political, social or economic stability and less developed infrastructure and legal systems, heightens the exposure of the risks set forth above. An adverse development relating to one or more of these risks, or any other risks associated with our operations in less developed countries, could adversely affect our ability to conduct and expand our business, which could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur international operations could also increase our exposure to international laws and regulations. If we cannot comply with foreign laws and regulations, which are often complex and subject to variation and unexpected changes, we could incur unexpected costs and potential litigation. For example, the governments of foreign countries might attempt to regulate our products and services or levy sales or other taxes relating to our activities. In addition, foreign countries may impose tariffs, duties, price controls or other restrictions on foreign currencies or trade barriers, any of which could make it more difficult for us to conduct our business.\nFurther, as we continue to expand our operations worldwide and potentially sell our products and services to governmental institutions, compliance with Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and local laws that also prohibit corrupt payments to governmental officials such as the UK Bribery Act 2010 will become more important and we will need to continue to enhance our internal controls to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations.\nA significant portion of our sales are denominated in foreign currencies and currency fluctuations and hedging expenses may cause our revenue and earnings to fluctuate and our foreign currency hedging program may not adequately offset foreign currency exposure.\nA significant percentage of our product sales are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the Euro. When the U.S. dollar strengthens against these foreign currencies, as it has recently, the relative value of sales made in the respective foreign currency decreases. Overall, we are a net receiver of foreign currencies and, therefore, benefit from a weaker U.S. dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger U.S. dollar relative to those foreign currencies in which we transact significant amounts of business.\nWe use foreign currency exchange forward contracts to hedge a portion of our forecasted revenue. We also hedge certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, which reduces but does not eliminate our exposure to currency fluctuations between the date a transaction is recorded and the date that cash is collected or paid. We cannot predict future fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rate. If the U.S. dollar appreciates significantly against certain currencies and our hedging program does not sufficiently offset the effects of such appreciation, our results of operations will be adversely affected and our stock price may decline.\nAdditionally, the expenses that we recognize in relation to our hedging activities can cause our earnings to fluctuate. The changes in interest rate spreads between the foreign currencies that we hedge and the U.S. dollar impact the level of hedging expenses that we recognize in a particular period.\nWe intend to expand our business into new geographic markets, and this expansion may be costly and may not be successful.\nWe plan to make substantial investments of both time and money as part of our continued and existing expansion into new geographic markets. When we expand into new geographic markets, we incur set up costs for new personnel, facilities, travel, inventory and related expenses in advance of securing new customer contracts. We may face challenges operating in new business climates with which we are unfamiliar, including facing difficulties in staffing and managing our new operations, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, exposure to additional regulatory requirements including additional regulatory filing and approval requirements for our products, changes in political and economic conditions, and exposure to additional and potentially adverse tax regimes. Our success in any new markets will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks. It is also possible that we will face increased competition in any new markets as other companies attempt to take advantage of the new market opportunities, and any such competitors could have substantially more resources than we do and may have better relationships and a greater understanding of the region. If we fail to manage the risks inherent in our geographic expansion, we could incur substantial capital and operating costs without any related increase in revenue, which would harm our operating results. Further, even if our geographic expansion is successful, failure to effectively manage our growth in a cost-effective manner could result in declines in customer satisfaction, increased costs or disruption of our operations.\nThe nature of some of our products may also subject us to export control regulation by the United States Department of State and the Department of Commerce. Violations of these regulations can result in monetary penalties and denial of export privileges.\nOur sales to customers outside the United States are subject to government export regulations that require us to obtain licenses to export such products. If the United States government was to amend its export control regulations, such amendments could create uncertainty in our industry, result in increased costs of compliance, and further restrict our ability to sell our products abroad. In particular, we are required to obtain a new license for each purchase order of our biothreat products that are exported outside the United States. Delays or denial of the grant of any required license, or changes to the regulations that make such delays or denials more likely or frequent, could make it difficult to make sales to foreign customers and could adversely affect our revenue. In addition, we could be subject to fines and penalties for violation of these export regulations if we were found in violation. Such violation could result in penalties, including prohibiting us from exporting our products to one or more countries, and could materially and adversely affect our business.\nIf we fail to retain key members of our staff, our ability to conduct and expand our business would be impaired.\nWe are highly dependent on the principal members of our management and scientific staff and on the development of adequate succession plans for such employees. If we lose the services of any of these persons and we are unable to find a suitable replacement in a timely manner, we may be challenged to effectively manage our business and execute our strategy, which could seriously harm our product development and commercialization efforts. In addition, we require skilled personnel in areas such as microbiology, clinical, sales, marketing and finance. We generally do not enter into employment agreements requiring these employees to continue in our employment for any period of time. Attracting, retaining, developing and training personnel, including management, with the requisite skills remains challenging, particularly in the Silicon Valley, where our main office is located. For example, in February 2015, our Chief Financial Officer since April 2008 left our company to pursue an opportunity with another company and we are currently conducting a formal search for a new permanent Chief Financial Officer. If at any point we are unable to hire, train, develop and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees to match our growth, our ability to conduct and expand our business could be seriously reduced.\nWe may face issues in connection with our implementation of an enterprise resource planning (or ERP) system.\nIn order to support our growth, we are currently in the process of implementing an enterprise resource planning, or ERP, system. This is a lengthy and expensive process. We have incurred and expect to continue to incur additional expenses in connection with our implementation of an ERP system. Our anticipated ERP system implementation may not result in improvements that outweigh its costs and may disrupt our operations. Many companies have experienced delays and difficulties with the implementation of new or changed ERP systems that have had a negative effect on their business. If we are unable to successfully plan, design or implement the new ERP system, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. There are many costs and risks associated with ERP system implementation, including:\n\u2022\ninability to fill customer orders accurately and on a timely basis, or at all;\n\u2022\ndelays in our billing and collection processes;\n\u2022\ninability to process payments to vendors accurately and in a timely manner;\n\u2022\ndisruption of our internal control structure;\n\u2022\ninability to fulfill our SEC or other governmental reporting requirements in a timely or accurate manner;\n\u2022\ninability to fulfill federal, state and local tax filing requirements in a timely or accurate manner;\n\u2022\nincreased demands on management and staff time to the detriment of other corporate initiatives; and\n\u2022\nsignificant capital and operating expenditures.\nIf we become subject to claims relating to improper handling, storage or disposal of hazardous materials, we could incur significant cost and time to comply.\nOur research and development processes involve the controlled storage, use and disposal of hazardous materials, including biological hazardous materials. We are subject to foreign, federal, state and local regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of materials and waste products. We may incur significant costs complying with both existing and future environmental laws and regulations. In particular, we are subject to regulation by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\u201cOSHA\u201d) and the Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d), and to regulation under the Toxic Substances Control Act and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act in the United States OSHA or the EPA may adopt regulations that may affect our research and development programs. We are unable to predict whether any agency will adopt any regulations that would have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nThe risk of accidental contamination or injury from hazardous materials cannot be eliminated completely. In the event of an accident, we could be held liable for any damages that result, and any liability could exceed the limits or fall outside the coverage of our workers\u2019 compensation insurance. We may not be able to maintain insurance on acceptable terms, if at all.\nIf a catastrophe strikes our manufacturing or warehousing facilities, we may be unable to manufacture or distribute our products for a substantial amount of time and we may experience inventory shortfalls, which would cause us to experience lost revenues.\nOur manufacturing facilities are located in Sunnyvale and Lodi, California, Seattle, Washington, and Stockholm, Sweden. Although we have business interruption insurance, our facilities and some pieces of manufacturing equipment are difficult to replace and could require substantial replacement lead-time. Various types of disasters, including earthquakes, fires, floods and acts of terrorism, may affect our manufacturing facilities. Earthquakes are of particular significance since our primary manufacturing facilities in California are located in an earthquake-prone area. In the event our existing manufacturing facilities or equipment are affected by man-made or natural disasters, we may be unable to manufacture products for sale or meet customer demands or sales projections. If our manufacturing operations were curtailed or ceased, it would seriously harm our business.\nWe might require additional capital to respond to business challenges or acquisitions, and such capital might not be available.\nThough we completed a sale of $345 million of convertible senior notes in February 2014, we may in the future need to obtain additional equity or debt financing to respond to business challenges or acquire complementary businesses and technologies. Any additional equity or debt financing, however, might not be available when needed or, if available, might not be available on terms satisfactory to us. In addition, to the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the issuance of these securities could result in dilution to our shareholders. In addition, these securities may be sold at a discount from the market price of our common stock and may include rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock. If additional equity or debt financing is needed and we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited.\nWe rely on relationships with collaborative partners and other third parties for development, supply and marketing of certain products and potential products, and such collaborative partners or other third parties could fail to perform sufficiently.\nWe believe that our success in penetrating our target markets depends in part on our ability to develop and maintain collaborative relationships with other companies. Relying on collaborative relationships is risky to our future success for our products because, among other things:\n\u2022\nour collaborative partners may not devote sufficient resources to the success of our collaborations;\n\u2022\nour collaborative partners may not obtain regulatory approvals necessary to continue the collaborations in a timely manner;\n\u2022\nour collaborative partners may be acquired by other companies and decide to terminate our collaborative partnership or become insolvent;\n\u2022\nour collaborative partners may develop technologies or components competitive with our products;\n\u2022\ncomponents developed by collaborators could fail to meet specifications, possibly causing us to lose potential projects and subjecting us to liability;\n\u2022\ndisagreements with collaborators could result in the termination of the relationship or litigation;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may not have sufficient capital resources;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may pursue tests or other products that will not generate significant volume for us, but may consume significant research and development and manufacturing resources; and\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to negotiate future collaborative arrangements, or renewals of existing collaborative agreements, on acceptable terms.\nBecause these and other factors may be beyond our control, the development or commercialization of our products involved in collaborative partnerships may be delayed or otherwise adversely affected.\nIf we or any of our collaborative partners terminate a collaborative arrangement, we may be required to devote additional resources to product development and commercialization or we may need to cancel some development programs, which could adversely affect our product pipeline and business.\nWe enter into collaborations with third parties that may not result in the development of commercially viable products or the generation of significant future revenues.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we enter into collaborative arrangements to develop new products or to pursue new markets. These collaborations may not result in the development of products that achieve commercial success, and these collaborations could be terminated prior to developing any products. In addition, our collaboration partners may not necessarily purchase the volume of products that we expect. Accordingly, we cannot be assured that any of our collaborations will result in the successful development of a commercially viable product or result in significant additional revenues in the future.\nThe \u201cconflict minerals\u201d rule of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, has caused us to incur additional expenses, could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our products, and could make us less competitive in our target markets.\nOn August 22, 2012, the SEC adopted a rule requiring disclosure by public companies of the origin, source and chain of custody of specified minerals, known as conflict minerals, that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured. The rule requires companies to obtain sourcing data from suppliers, engage in supply chain due diligence, and file annually with the SEC a specialized disclosure report on Form SD covering the prior calendar year. The rule could limit our ability to source at competitive prices and to secure sufficient quantities of certain minerals used in the manufacture of our products, specifically tantalum, tin, gold and tungsten, as the number of suppliers that provide conflict-free minerals may be limited. We may incur material costs associated with complying with the rule, such as costs related to the determination of the origin, source and chain of custody of the minerals used in our products, the adoption of conflict minerals-related governance policies, processes and controls, and possible changes to products or sources of supply as a result of such activities. Within our supply chain, we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the relevant minerals used in our products through the data collection and due diligence procedures that we implement, which may harm our reputation. Furthermore, we may encounter challenges in satisfying those customers that require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict free, and if we cannot satisfy these customers, they may choose a competitor\u2019s products. We continue to investigate the presence of conflict materials within our supply chain.\nWe maintain cash balances in our bank accounts that exceed the FDIC insurance limitation.\nWe maintain our cash assets at commercial banks in amounts in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limit of $250,000. In the event of the commercial banks failing, we may lose the amount of our deposits over any federally-insured amount, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial conditions and our results of operations.\nOur participation in the USPS BDS program may not result in predictable revenues in the future.\nOur participation in the USPS BDS program involves significant uncertainties related to governmental decision-making and timing of purchases and is highly sensitive to changes in national priorities and budgets. The USPS continued to report significant losses for the 2014 and 2013 fiscal years. Budgetary pressures may result in reduced allocations to projects such as the BDS program, sometimes without advance notice. We cannot be certain that actual funding and operating parameters, or product purchases, will occur at currently expected levels or in the currently expected timeframe.\nCompliance with laws and regulations governing public company corporate governance and reporting is complex and expensive.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations affecting our domestic and international operations in a number of areas. Many laws and regulations, notably those adopted in connection with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 by the SEC, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and The NASDAQ Stock Market, impose obligations on public companies, such as ours, which have increased the scope, complexity, and cost of corporate governance, reporting, and disclosure practices. Compliance with these laws, regulations and similar requirements can be onerous and inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, which has required and will continue to require substantial management time and oversight and requires us to incur significant additional accounting, legal and compliance costs. Any such costs, that may arise in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation could individually or in the aggregate make our products and services more expensive to our customers, delay the\nintroduction of new products in one or more regions or cause us to change or limit our business practices. We have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or our policies and procedures.\nAdditionally, changes to existing accounting rules and standards and the implementation of new accounting rules or standards, such as the new lease accounting or revenue recognition rules, may adversely impact our reported financial results and business, and may further require us to incur greater accounting fees.\nOur operating results could be materially affected by unanticipated changes in our tax provisions or exposure to additional income tax liabilities.\nOur determination of our tax liability (like any company\u2019s determination of its tax liability) is subject to review by applicable tax authorities. Any adverse outcome of such a review could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. In addition, the determination of our provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment including our determination of whether a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets is appropriate. We expect to maintain such valuation allowance as long as there is insufficient evidence that we will be able to realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets. We reassess the realizability of the deferred tax assets as facts and circumstances dictate. If after future assessments of the realizability of the deferred tax assets, we determine that a lesser or greater allowance is required, or that no such allowance is appropriate, we will record a corresponding change to the income tax expense and the valuation allowance in the period of such determination. The uncertainty surrounding the future realization of our net deferred tax assets could adversely impact our results of operations. Although we believe our estimates and judgments are reasonable, including those related to our valuation allowance, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made.\nChanges in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates, and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results or financial condition.\nGenerally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines, and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business, such as revenue recognition, asset impairment and fair value determinations, inventories, convertible debt, business combinations and intangible asset valuations, and litigation, are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates, and judgments. Changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates, or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition.\nWe have indebtedness in the form of convertible senior notes.\nIn February 2014, we completed an offering of $345 million of convertible senior notes due in 2021 (the \u201cNotes\u201d).\nAs a result of the issuance of the Notes, we incurred $345 million principal amount of indebtedness, the principal amount of which we may be required to pay at maturity in 2021, or upon the occurrence of a make-whole fundamental change (as defined in the applicable indenture). There can be no assurance that we will be able to repay this indebtedness when due, or that we will be able to refinance this indebtedness on acceptable terms or at all. In addition, this indebtedness could, among other things:\n\u2022\nmake it difficult for us to pay other obligations;\n\u2022\nmake it difficult to obtain favorable terms for any necessary future financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements or other purposes;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service the indebtedness, reducing the amount of cash flow available for other purposes; and\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business.\nConversion of the Notes may affect the price of our common stock.\nThe conversion of some or all of our Notes may dilute the ownership interest of existing shareholders to the extent we deliver shares of common stock upon conversion. Holders of the outstanding Notes will be able to convert them only upon the satisfaction of certain conditions prior to August 1, 2020. Upon conversion, holders of the Notes will receive cash, shares of common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, at our election. Any sales in the public market of shares of common stock issued upon conversion of such notes could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nWe have broad discretion in the use of the net proceeds from the issuance of our Notes and may not use them effectively.\nWe have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds that we received from the issuance of the Notes, including working capital, possible acquisitions, and other general corporate purposes, and we may spend or invest these proceeds in a way with which our investors disagree. The failure by our management to apply these funds effectively could adversely affect our business and financial condition. We may invest the net proceeds from our Notes in a manner that does not produce income or that loses value. These investments may not yield a favorable return to our investors, and may negatively impact the price of our securities.\nServicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial debt.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness, including the Notes, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt obligations and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate the necessary cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations.\nWe may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of the Notes or to repurchase the Notes upon a fundamental change, and our future debt may contain limitations on our ability to pay cash upon conversion or repurchase of the Notes.\nHolders of the Notes will have the right to require us to repurchase their Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. In addition, upon conversion of the Notes, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the Notes being converted. However, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of Notes surrendered therefor or Notes being converted. In addition, our ability to repurchase the Notes or to pay cash upon conversions of the Notes may be limited by law, by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our future indebtedness. Our failure to repurchase Notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the indenture governing the Notes or to pay any cash payable on future conversions of the Notes as required by the indenture governing the Notes would constitute a default under the indenture governing the Notes. A default under the indenture governing the Notes or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our future indebtedness. If the repayment of the future indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we might not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the Notes or make cash payments upon conversions thereof.\nThe Notes contain a conditional conversion feature, which, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nThe Notes contain a conditional conversion feature. If such feature is triggered, holders of Notes will be entitled to convert the Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their Notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their Notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the Notes as a current rather than non-current liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.\nOur stock price is highly volatile and investing in our stock involves a high degree of risk, which could result in substantial losses for investors.\nThe market price of our common stock, like the securities of many other medical product companies, fluctuates over a wide range, and will continue to be highly volatile in the future. During fiscal year 2014, the closing sale price of our common stock on The NASDAQ Global Select Market ranged from $37.64 to $55.41 per share. Because our stock price has been volatile, investing in our\ncommon stock is risky. Furthermore, volatility in the stock price of other companies has often led to securities class action litigation against those companies. Any future securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources, which could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover, which could reduce the market price of our common stock.\nOur board of directors or a committee thereof has the power, without shareholder approval, to designate the terms of one or more series of preferred stock and issue shares of preferred stock. The ability of our board of directors or a committee thereof to create and issue a new series of preferred stock and certain provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws, including, without limitation, a classified board, advance notice requirements for shareholder proposals and nominations, and no cumulative voting, could impede a merger, takeover or other business combination involving us or discourage a potential acquiror from making a tender offer for our common stock, which, under certain circumstances, could reduce the market price of our common stock.\nData breaches and cyber-attacks could compromise our intellectual property or other sensitive information and cause significant damage to our business and reputation.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we maintain sensitive data on our networks, including our intellectual property and proprietary or confidential information relating to our business and that of our customers and business partners. The secure maintenance of this information is critical to our business and reputation. We believe that companies have been increasingly subject to a wide variety of security incidents, cyber-attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access. These threats can come from a variety of sources, ranging in sophistication from an individual hacker to a state-sponsored attack. Cyber threats may be generic, or they may be custom-crafted against our information systems. Over the past year, cyber-attacks have become more prevalent and much harder to detect and defend against. Our network and storage applications may be subject to unauthorized access by hackers or breached due to operator error, malfeasance or other system disruptions. It is often difficult to anticipate or immediately detect such incidents and the damage caused by such incidents. These data breaches and any unauthorized access or disclosure of our information or intellectual property could compromise our intellectual property and expose other confidential information and sensitive business information. There can be no assurance that our systems and data protection efforts will prevent future business interruptions or loss of data. Cyber-attacks could also cause us to incur significant remediation costs, result in product development delays, disrupt key business operations and divert attention of management and key information technology resources. These incidents could also subject us to liability, expose us to significant expense and cause significant harm to our reputation and business.", "PERMNO": 88331, "SIC": 3826, "TIC": "CPHD"}
