{"cik": "704415", "company": "TIVITY HEALTH, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-02-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIn the execution of our business strategy, our operations and financial condition are subject to certain risks. A summary of certain material risks is provided below, and you should take such risks into account in evaluating any investment decision involving the Company. This section does not describe all risks applicable to us and is intended only as a summary of certain material factors that could impact our operations in the industry in which we operate. Other sections of this report contain additional information concerning these and other risks.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nA significant percentage of our revenues is derived from health plan customers.\nA significant percentage of our revenues is derived from health plan customers. The health plan industry may continue to consolidate, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain health plan customers, or continue to provide our products and services to such health plan customers on terms at least as favorable to us as currently provided, if they are acquired by other health plans that already participate in competing programs or are not interested in our programs. Increasing vertical integration efforts involving health plans and healthcare providers or entities that provide wellness services may increase these challenges. Our health plan customers that are part of larger healthcare enterprises may have greater bargaining power, which may lead to further pressure on the prices for our products and services. In addition, a reduction in the number of covered lives enrolled with our health plan customers or in the payments we receive could adversely affect our results of operations. Our health plan customers are subject to continuing competition and reduced reimbursement rates from governmental and private sources, which could lead current or prospective customers to seek reduced fees or choose to reduce or delay the purchase of our services. Finally, health plan customers could attempt to offer services themselves that compete directly with our offerings, stop providing our offerings to certain or all of their members, or offer fitness benefits in addition to SilverSneakers, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe currently derive a significant percentage of our revenues from three customers.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, Humana, United Healthcare, and BCBSA each comprised more than 10%, and together comprised approximately 45%, of our revenues from continuing operations. Our primary contract with Humana was renewed in 2018 and continues through December 31, 2022. The term of our contract with United Healthcare continues through December 31, 2020. Our primary contract with BCBSA continues through December 31, 2022. The loss or restructuring of a contract with Humana, United Healthcare, BCBSA, or any of our other significant customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. None of these contracts allows Humana, United Healthcare, or BCBSA to terminate for convenience prior to the expiration of the contract.\nIn 2018 and 2019, United Healthcare discontinued offering SilverSneakers to its individual Medicare Advantage beneficiaries in certain states and instead provided those beneficiaries a fitness benefit offered by its wholly-owned subsidiary Optum, while continuing to offer SilverSneakers to its group Medicare Advantage members in all 50 states. Revenue from United Healthcare is expected to be in a range of $60 million to $62 million in 2019, approximately one-third of which is expected to be earned from its individual Medicare Advantage business. We expect that beginning in 2020 United Healthcare will offer SilverSneakers to its group Medicare Advantage members only and will no longer offer SilverSneakers to its individual Medicare Advantage beneficiaries.\nOur inability to renew and/or maintain contracts with our customers and/or partner locations under existing terms or restructure these contracts under favorable terms could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIf our customers and/or partner locations choose not to renew their contracts with us, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Loss of a significant partner or customer or a reduction in a customer's enrolled lives could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, a restructuring of a contract with a customer and/or partner on terms that aren\u2019t favorable to us could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nReductions in Medicare Advantage health plan reimbursement rates may negatively impact our business and results of operations.\nA significant portion of our revenue is indirectly derived from the monthly premium payments paid by HHS to health plans, who are our customers, for services provided to Medicare Advantage beneficiaries. As a result, our results of operations are, in part, dependent on government funding levels for Medicare Advantage programs. Any changes that limit or reduce Medicare Advantage reimbursement levels, such as reductions in or limitations of reimbursement amounts or rates under these programs, reductions in funding of these programs, expansion of benefits without adequate funding, elimination of coverage for certain benefits, or elimination of coverage affecting the services that we provide, could have a material adverse effect on our customers, and as a result, on our business and results of operations.\nOur business strategy relating to the development and introduction of new products and services exposes us to risks such as limited customer and/or market acceptance and additional expenditures that may not result in additional net revenue.\nAn important component of our business strategy is to focus on new products and services that enable us to provide immediate value to our customers. Customer and/or market acceptance of these new products and services cannot be predicted with certainty, and if we fail to execute properly on this strategy or to adapt this strategy as market conditions evolve, our ability to grow revenue and our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to successfully implement our business strategy, our financial performance and our growth could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur future financial performance and success are dependent in large part upon our ability to implement our business strategy successfully. Implementation of our strategy will require effective management of our operational, financial and human resources and will place significant demands on those resources. See Item 1. \"Business - Business Strategy\" for more information regarding our business strategy. There are risks involved in pursuing our strategy, including the ability to hire or retain the personnel necessary to manage our strategy effectively.\nIn addition to the risks set forth above, implementation of our business strategy could be affected by a number of factors beyond our control, such as increased competition, legal developments, government regulation, general economic conditions, increased operating costs or expenses, and changes in industry trends. We may decide to alter or discontinue certain aspects of our business strategy at any time. If we are not able to implement our business strategy successfully, our long-term growth and profitability may be adversely affected. Even if we are able to implement some or all of the initiatives of our business strategy successfully, our operating results may not improve to the extent we anticipate, or at all.\nOur results of operations could be adversely affected by severe or unexpected weather, health epidemics or outbreaks of disease.\nAdverse weather conditions or other extreme changes in the weather may cause people to refrain, or prevent people, from visiting participating locations and using our services. Additionally, widespread health epidemics or outbreaks of disease, such as influenza, may cause members to avoid public gathering places and negatively impact their use of our services. As some of the fees that we charge our customers are based on member participation, a decrease in member participation could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe may experience difficulties associated with the implementation and/or integration of new businesses, services (including outsourced services), technologies, solutions, or products.\nWe may face difficulties, costs, and delays in effectively implementing and/or integrating acquired businesses, services (including outsourced services), technologies, solutions, or products into our business. Implementing internally-developed solutions and products, and/or integrating newly acquired businesses, services (including outsourced services), and technologies could be time-consuming and may strain our resources. Consequently, we may not be successful in implementing and/or integrating these new businesses, services, technologies, solutions, or products and may not achieve anticipated revenue and cost benefits.\nChanges in macroeconomic conditions may adversely affect our business.\nEconomic difficulties and other macroeconomic conditions could reduce the demand and/or the timing of purchases for certain of our services from customers and potential customers. In addition, changes in economic conditions could create liquidity and credit constraints. We cannot assure you that we would be able to secure additional financing if needed and, if such funds were available, that the terms and conditions would be acceptable to us.\nThe performance of our business and the level of our indebtedness could prevent us from meeting the obligations under our credit agreement or have an adverse effect on our future financial condition, our ability to raise additional capital, or our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry.\nOn April 21, 2017, we entered into a new Revolving Credit and Term Loan Agreement (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d) with a group of lenders. As of December 31, 2018, outstanding debt under the Credit Agreement was $30.5 million.\nOur ability to service our indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available in an amount sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness or to fund other liquidity needs.\nThe Credit Agreement contains various financial covenants and limits repurchases of our common stock and the amount of dividends that we can pay to holders of our common stock. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the Credit Agreement in which all amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement may become immediately due and payable and all commitments under the Credit Agreement to extend further credit may be terminated.\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our future financial condition or our ability to react to changes in the economy or industry by, among other things:\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to a downturn in general economic conditions, loss of revenue and/or profit margins in our business, or to increases in interest rates, particularly with respect to the portion of our outstanding debt that is subject to variable interest rates;\n\u2022\npotentially limiting our ability to obtain additional financing or to obtain such financing on favorable terms;\n\u2022\ncausing us to dedicate a portion of future cash flow from operations to service or pay down our debt, which reduces the cash available for other purposes, such as operations, capital expenditures, and future business opportunities; and\n\u2022\npossibly limiting our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who may be less leveraged.\nWe have a significant amount of goodwill and intangible assets, the value of which could become impaired.\nWe have recorded significant portions of the purchase price of certain acquisitions as goodwill and/or intangible assets. At December 31, 2018, we had approximately $334.7 million and $29.0 million of goodwill and intangible assets, respectively. We review goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization for impairment on an annual basis (during the fourth quarter) or more frequently whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. If we determine that the carrying values of our goodwill and/or intangible assets are impaired, we may incur a non-cash charge to earnings, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for the period in which the impairment occurs.\nA failure of our information systems could adversely affect our business.\nOur ability to deliver our services depends on effectively using information technology. We rely upon our information systems for operating and monitoring all major aspects of our business. These systems and, therefore, our operations could be damaged or interrupted by natural disasters, power loss, network failure, improper operation by our employees, data privacy or security breaches, computer viruses, computer hacking, network penetration or other illegal intrusions or other unexpected events. Any disruption in the operation of our information systems, regardless of the cause, could adversely impact our operations, which may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nA cybersecurity incident could result in the loss of confidential data, give rise to remediation and other expenses, expose us to liability under HIPAA, consumer protection laws, common law theories or other laws, subject us to litigation and federal and state governmental inquiries, damage our reputation, and otherwise be disruptive to our business.\nThe nature of our business involves the receipt, storage and use of personal data about the participants in our programs, including individually identifiable health information, as well as employees and customers. Additionally, we rely upon third parties that are not directly under our control to do so as well. The secure maintenance of this confidential information is critical to our business operations. To protect our information systems from attack, damage and unauthorized use, we have implemented multiple layers of security, including technical safeguards, processes, and our people. Our defenses are monitored and routinely tested internally and by external parties. Despite these efforts, threats from malicious persons and groups, new vulnerabilities, and advanced attacks against information systems create risk of cybersecurity incidents. We cannot provide assurance that we or our third-party vendors or other service providers will not be subject to cybersecurity incidents, which may result in unauthorized access by third parties, loss, misappropriation, disclosure or corruption of customer, employee or our information; member personal health information; or other data subject to privacy laws. Such cybersecurity incidents may lead to a disruption in our systems or business, costs to modify, enhance, or remediate our cybersecurity measures, liability under privacy, security and consumer protection laws or litigation under these or other laws, including common law theories, and subject us to enforcement actions, fines, regulatory proceedings or litigation against us, damage to our business reputation, a reduction in participation and sales of our products and services, and legal obligations to notify customers or other affected individuals about an incident, which could cause us to incur substantial costs and negative publicity, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and harm our business reputation.\nAs a result, cybersecurity and the continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes and practices remain a priority for us. We may be required to expend significant additional resources in our efforts to modify or enhance our protective measures against evolving threats or to investigate and remediate any cybersecurity vulnerabilities.\nOur business is subject to changing privacy and security laws, rules and regulations, including HIPAA, the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act and other state privacy regulations, for which failure to adhere could negatively impact our business.\nOur business is subject to various privacy and data security laws, regulations, and codes of conduct that apply to our various business units (e.g., Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards and Telephone Consumer Protection Act). These laws and regulations may be inconsistent across jurisdictions and are subject to evolving and differing (sometimes conflicting) interpretations. Government regulators, privacy advocates and class action attorneys are increasingly scrutinizing how companies collect, process, use, store, share and transmit personal data. This increased scrutiny may result in new interpretations of existing laws, thereby further impacting our business. For example, in June 2018, the State of California passed the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (\u201cCCPA\u201d), which takes effect January 1, 2020. The new law applies broadly to information that identifies or is associated with any California household or individual, and compliance with the new law requires that we implement several operational changes, including processes to respond to individuals\u2019 data access and deletion requests. Additionally, the Federal Trade Commission and many state attorneys general are interpreting federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards for the collection, use, dissemination and security of data. The obligations imposed by the CCPA and other similar laws that may be enacted at the federal and state level may require us to modify our business practices and policies and to incur substantial expenditures in order to comply.\nIn order to be successful, we must attract, engage, retain and integrate key employees and have adequate succession plans in place, and failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our ability to manage our business.\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract, engage, retain and integrate qualified executives and other key employees throughout all areas of our business. Identifying, developing internally or hiring externally, training and retaining highly-skilled managerial and other personnel are critical to our future, and competition for experienced employees can be intense. Failure to successfully hire executives and key employees or the loss of any executives and key employees could have a significant impact on our operations. The loss of services of any key personnel, the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future, or delays in hiring may harm our business and results of operations. Further, changes in our management team may be disruptive to our business, and any failure to successfully integrate key newly hired employees could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe face competition for staffing, which may increase our labor costs and reduce profitability.\nWe compete with other healthcare and services providers in recruiting qualified management, including executives with the required skills and experience to operate and grow our business, and staff personnel for the day-to-day operations of our business. These challenges may require us to enhance wages and benefits to recruit and retain qualified management and other professionals. Difficulties in attracting and retaining qualified management and other professionals, or in controlling labor costs, could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.\nWe are or may become a party to litigation that could potentially force us to pay significant damages and/or harm our reputation.\nWe are subject to certain legal proceedings, which potentially involve large claims and significant defense costs (see Item 3. \"Legal Proceedings\"). These legal proceedings and any other claims that we may face in the future, whether with or without merit, could result in costly litigation, and divert the time, attention, and resources of our management. Although we currently maintain various types of liability insurance, we cannot provide assurance that the coverage limits of such insurance policies will be adequate or that all such claims will be covered by insurance. Although we believe that we have conducted our operations in full compliance with applicable statutory and contractual requirements and that we have meritorious defenses to outstanding claims, it is possible that resolution of these legal matters could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, legal expenses associated with the defense of these matters may be material to our results of operations in a particular financial reporting period.\nDamage to our reputation could harm our business, including our competitive position and business prospects.\nOur ability to attract and retain customers, members and employees is impacted by our reputation. Harm to our reputation can arise from various sources, including employee misconduct, security breaches, unethical behavior, litigation or regulatory outcomes, which could, among other consequences, increase the size and number of litigation claims and damages asserted or subject us to enforcement actions, fines and penalties and cause us to incur related costs and expenses.\nWe could be adversely affected by violations of the FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws of other countries in which we provided services prior to the sale of our TPHS business.\nBecause of the international operations that we previously conducted as part of our TPHS business that we sold to Sharecare in July 2016, we could be adversely affected by violations of the FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws of other countries in which we provided services prior to the sale. The FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other third parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or gaining any business advantage. While our policies mandated compliance with these anti-bribery laws, we cannot provide assurance that our internal control policies and procedures always protected us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees, contractors or agents. Failure to comply with the FCPA and similar legislation prior to the sale of our TPHS business could result in the imposition of civil or criminal fines and penalties and could disrupt our business and adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nCompliance with existing or newly adopted federal and state laws and regulations or new or revised interpretations of such requirements could adversely affect our results of operations or may require us to spend substantial amounts, and the failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to penalties or negatively impact our ability to provide services.\nOur customers are subject to considerable state and federal government regulation, and a substantial majority of our business involves providing services to Medicare Advantage beneficiaries. As a result, we are subject directly to various federal laws and regulations, including the federal False Claims Act, billing and reimbursement requirements and other provisions related to fraud and abuse. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services is in the process of expanding its Recovery Audit Contractor program for Medicare Advantage, which may result in increased government enforcement. Further, our contracts with Medicare Advantage plans require us to comply with a number of regulatory provisions and permit these customers to perform compliance audits. Many of these regulations are vaguely written and subject to differing interpretations that may, in certain cases, result in unintended consequences that could impact our ability to effectively deliver services. Further, we are required to comply with most requirements of the HIPAA privacy and security laws and regulations and may be subject to criminal or civil penalties for violations of these regulations. Certain of our services, including health utilization management and certain claims payment functions, require licensure and may be regulated by government agencies. We are subject to a variety of legal requirements in order to obtain and maintain such licenses, but little guidance is available to determine the scope of some of these requirements.\nWe continually monitor the extent to which federal and state legislation and regulations govern our operations. New federal or state laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing requirements that affect our operations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. If we are found to have violated applicable laws, to have caused any of our customers to submit false claims or make false statements, or to have failed to comply with our contractual compliance obligations, we could be required to restructure our operations, be subject to contractual penalties, including termination of our customer agreements, and be subject to significant civil and criminal penalties.\nHealthcare reform efforts may result in a reduction to our revenues from government health programs and private insurance companies or otherwise directly or indirectly impact our business.\nThe healthcare industry is subject to various political, regulatory, scientific, and technological influences. Efforts at federal and state levels of government have resulted in laws and regulations intended to effect significant change within the healthcare system. The ACA, the most prominent of these efforts, affects coverage, delivery, and reimbursement of healthcare services. Among other effects, several of its provisions may increase the costs and/or reduce the revenues of our customers or prospective customers. For example, the ACA eliminates pre-existing condition exclusions by commercial health plans, bans annual benefit limits, and mandates minimum MLRs for health plans.\nHowever, there is substantial uncertainty regarding the net effect and future of the ACA. The presidential administration and Congress have made significant changes to the ACA, its implementation and its interpretation. The president signed an executive order that directs agencies to minimize \u201ceconomic and regulatory burdens\u201d of the ACA. Final rules issued in 2018 expand the availability of association health plans and allow the sale of short-term, limited-duration health plans, neither of which are required to cover all of the essential benefits mandated by the ACA. Further, effective January 2019, Congress eliminated the penalty associated with the ACA\u2019s individual mandate. As a result, a federal court in Texas ruled in December 2018 that, because the penalty associated with the individual mandate was eliminated, the entire ACA was unconstitutional. However, the law remains in effect pending appeal. It is possible that the reforms imposed by the ACA or uncertainty regarding significant changes or court challenges to the law will adversely affect the profitability of our customers and cause our customers or prospective customers to reduce or delay the purchase of our services or to demand reduced fees. Because of this uncertainty and many other variables, including the ACA\u2019s complexity and the difficulty of predicting the impact of changes on other healthcare industry participants and the ultimate outcome of court challenges, we are unable to predict all of the ways in which the ACA could impact the Company. Furthermore, we could also be impacted by future legislative and regulatory healthcare reform initiatives. For example, beginning in 2020, the Chronic Care Act will allow Medicare Advantage plans to cover supplemental benefits that are not primarily health-related, but that have the reasonable expectation of improving or maintaining health. Members of Congress have proposed measures that would expand government-sponsored coverage, including single-payor proposals.\nRisks Relating to the Proposed Acquisition of Nutrisystem\nAfter completion of the Merger, we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the Merger, which could adversely affect the value of our common stock.\nThe success of the Merger will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from combining the business of Nutrisystem with our business. Our ability to realize these anticipated benefits and cost savings is subject to certain risks including:\n\u2022\nour ability to combine successfully the business of Nutrisystem with our business, including with respect to systems and technology integration;\n\u2022\nwhether the combined businesses will perform as expected;\n\u2022\nthe possibility that we paid more for Nutrisystem than the value we will derive from the acquisition;\n\u2022\nthe reduction of our cash available for operations and other uses and the incurrence of indebtedness to finance the acquisition; and\n\u2022\nthe assumption of known and unknown liabilities of Nutrisystem.\nIf we are not able to successfully combine the business of Nutrisystem with our business within the anticipated time frame, or at all, the anticipated cost savings and other benefits of the Merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected, the combined businesses may not perform as expected and the value of our common stock may be adversely affected.\nWe and Nutrisystem have operated and, until completion of the Merger, will continue to operate, independently, and we cannot provide assurances that our and Nutrisystem\u2019s businesses can be integrated successfully. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of either company\u2019s, or both companies\u2019 ongoing businesses or in unexpected integration issues, higher than expected integration costs and an overall post-completion integration process that takes longer than originally anticipated. Specifically, issues that must be addressed in integrating the operations of Nutrisystem with our operations in order to realize the anticipated benefits of the Merger so the combined business performs as expected include, among other things:\n\u2022\nintegrating the companies\u2019 technologies, products and services;\n\u2022\nidentifying and eliminating redundant and underperforming operations and assets;\n\u2022\nharmonizing the companies\u2019 operating practices, employee development and compensation programs, internal controls and other policies, procedures and processes;\n\u2022\naddressing possible differences in business backgrounds, corporate cultures and management philosophies;\n\u2022\nconsolidating the companies\u2019 corporate, administrative and information technology infrastructure;\n\u2022\ncoordinating sales, distribution and marketing efforts;\n\u2022\nmaintaining existing agreements with customers and suppliers and avoiding delays in entering into new agreements with prospective customers and suppliers; and\n\u2022\ncoordinating geographically dispersed organizations.\nIn addition, at times, the attention of certain members of either company\u2019s, or both companies\u2019 management and resources may be focused on completion of the Merger and the integration of the business of the two companies and diverted from day-to-day business operations, which may disrupt either company\u2019s or both companies\u2019 ongoing business and the business of the combined company.\nWe and Nutrisystem may have difficulty attracting, motivating and retaining executives and other key employees in light of the Merger.\nUncertainty about the effect of the Merger on our and Nutrisystem\u2019s employees may have an adverse effect on us and Nutrisystem and consequently the combined business. This uncertainty may impair our and Nutrisystem\u2019s ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the Merger is completed and during the integration phase thereafter. Employee retention may be particularly challenging during the pendency of the Merger, as our and Nutrisystem\u2019s employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined business. Additionally, Nutrisystem\u2019s officers and employees may hold shares of Nutrisystem common stock or vested options to purchase shares of Nutrisystem common stock and, if the Merger is completed, may therefore be entitled to the Merger Consideration in respect of such shares of Nutrisystem common stock and cash consideration in respect of such stock options, the receipt of which could lead certain officers and employees to no longer pursue employment with the combined business. Additionally, pursuant to employment agreements and equity award agreements with Nutrisystem and letter agreements with us, certain key employees of Nutrisystem are entitled to receive severance payments and equity vesting acceleration benefits upon a termination of employment for \u201cgood reason\u201d following completion of the Merger. Severance payments and equity vesting acceleration benefits that could be attained in connection with a \u201cgood reason\u201d termination could lead those key employees to terminate employment with the combined business if there is a basis for them to claim that their employment was terminated for \u201cgood reason.\u201d Furthermore, if our or Nutrisystem\u2019s key employees depart, including because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration, financial security or a desire not to become employees of the combined business, we may have to incur significant costs in identifying, hiring and retaining replacements for departing employees, and our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the Merger may be adversely affected.\nThe Merger is subject to the receipt of approval from Nutrisystem stockholders as to the Merger Agreement. Failure to obtain this approval would prevent the closing of the Merger.\nBefore the Merger can be completed, Nutrisystem stockholders must adopt the Merger Agreement. We cannot provide assurance that this approval will be obtained. Failure to obtain the required approval may result in a material delay in, or the abandonment of, the Merger. Any delay in completing the Merger may materially adversely affect the timing and amount of cost savings and other benefits that are expected to be achieved from the Merger.\nOur and Nutrisystem\u2019s business relationships may be subject to disruption due to uncertainty associated with the Merger.\nParties with which we or Nutrisystem do business may experience uncertainty associated with the transaction, including with respect to current or future business relationships with us, Nutrisystem or the combined business. Our and Nutrisystem\u2019s business relationships may be subject to disruption as customers, suppliers and others may attempt to negotiate changes in existing business relationships or consider entering into business relationships with parties other than us, Nutrisystem or the combined business. These disruptions could have an adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects of the combined business, including an adverse effect on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the Merger. The adverse effect of such disruptions could be exacerbated by a delay in completion of the Merger or termination of the Merger Agreement.\nThe Merger Agreement subjects Nutrisystem and us to restrictions on our and their respective business activities prior to the Effective Time.\nThe Merger Agreement subjects Nutrisystem and us to restrictions on their and our respective business activities and obligates Nutrisystem and us to generally operate their and our businesses in the ordinary course, consistent with past practice, until the closing of the Merger. These restrictions could prevent Nutrisystem and us from pursuing attractive business opportunities that arise prior to the closing of the Merger and are outside the ordinary course of business.\nFailure to complete the Merger could negatively impact the stock price and the future business and financial results of Nutrisystem and us.\nIf the Merger is not completed, the ongoing businesses of Nutrisystem and us may be adversely affected and, without realizing any of the benefits of having completed the Merger, we and Nutrisystem would be subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nwe and Nutrisystem may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including negative impacts on our and their respective stock prices, and from our and their respective customers, suppliers, regulators and employees;\n\u2022\nwe and Nutrisystem will be required to pay certain costs relating to the Merger, whether or not the Merger is completed; and\n\u2022\nmatters relating to the Merger (including integration planning) will require substantial commitments of time and resources by our and Nutrisystem\u2019s management, which would otherwise have been devoted to day-to-day operations and other opportunities that may have been beneficial to either us or Nutrisystem as an independent company.\nWe cannot provide assurance that the risks described above will not materialize. If any of those risks materialize, they may adversely affect our and Nutrisystem\u2019s businesses, financial condition, financial results and stock prices.\nIn addition, we and Nutrisystem could be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the Merger or related to any enforcement proceeding commenced against us or Nutrisystem to perform our or their respective obligations under the Merger Agreement. If the Merger is not completed, these risks may materialize and may adversely affect our and Nutrisystem\u2019s business, financial condition, financial results and stock prices.\nThe closing of the Merger may trigger change in control or other provisions in certain agreements to which Nutrisystem is a party.\nThe closing of the Merger may trigger change in control or other provisions in certain agreements to which Nutrisystem is a party. If we and Nutrisystem are unable to negotiate waivers of those provisions, the counterparties may exercise their rights and remedies under the agreements, potentially terminating the agreements or seeking monetary damages. Even if we and Nutrisystem are able to negotiate waivers, the counterparties may seek to renegotiate the agreements on terms less favorable to Nutrisystem or the combined business.\nOur indebtedness following completion of the Merger will be substantially greater than our indebtedness on a stand-alone basis and greater than our and Nutrisystem\u2019s combined indebtedness existing prior to the transaction. This increased level of indebtedness could adversely affect us, including by decreasing our business flexibility, and will increase our borrowing costs.\nUpon completion of the Merger, we expect to have incurred acquisition-related debt financing of approximately $1.18 billion. Our substantially increased indebtedness and higher debt-to-equity ratio following completion of the Merger in comparison to our indebtedness on a recent historical basis will have the effect, among other things, of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions and will increase our borrowing costs. In addition, the amount of cash required to service our increased indebtedness levels and thus the demands on our cash resources may be greater than the percentages of cash flows required to service our or Nutrisystem\u2019s indebtedness individually prior to the transaction. The increased levels of indebtedness could also reduce funds available for our investments in our programs as well as acquisitions, capital expenditures, share repurchases and other activities and may create competitive disadvantages for us relative to other companies with lower debt levels.\nWe may not be able to service all of the combined company\u2019s indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which actions may not be successful. Our failure to meet our debt service obligations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on cash on hand and cash flows from operations to make scheduled debt payments. We expect to be able to meet the estimated cash interest payments on the combined company\u2019s debt following the Merger\nthrough the expected cash flows from operations of the combined company. However, our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations of the combined company and to make scheduled payments will depend on a range of economic, competitive and business factors, many of which are outside of our control. We cannot provide assurance that these sources will be adequate. If we are unable to service our indebtedness and fund our operations, we will be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, seek additional capital, sell assets or refinance our indebtedness. Any such action may not be successful and we may be unable to service our indebtedness and fund our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe agreements that are expected to govern the indebtedness incurred in connection with the Merger, including the credit agreements in connection with our expected term loan facilities and revolving credit facility, will contain various covenants that impose restrictions on us and certain of our subsidiaries that may affect our ability to operate our businesses.\nThe agreements that are expected to govern the indebtedness incurred in connection with the Merger, including the credit agreement in connection with our expected term loan facilities and revolving credit facility, are expected to contain various affirmative and negative covenants that, subject to certain exceptions, will impose restrictions and limitations on us and certain of our subsidiaries with respect to, among other things, indebtedness; liens; negative pledges; restricted payments (e.g., dividends, distributions, buybacks, redemptions, repurchases with respect to equity interests, and payments, redemptions, retirements, purchases, acquisitions, defeasance, exchange, conversion, cancellation or termination with respect to junior lien, subordinated or unsecured debt); restrictions on subsidiary distributions; loans, advances and guarantees, acquisitions and other investments; mergers and other fundamental changes; sales and other dispositions of assets (including equity interests in subsidiaries); sale/leaseback transactions; transactions with affiliates; conduct of business; amendments and waivers of organizational documents and material junior debt agreements; our permitted activities; and changes to fiscal year.\nIn addition, the credit agreement governing our expected term loan facilities and revolving credit facility is expected to require us to comply with a total net leverage ratio financial covenant. Our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to comply with this provision may be affected by events beyond our control. Failure to comply with the total net leverage ratio covenant or other provisions of the credit agreement could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could accelerate our repayment obligations and could result in a default and acceleration under other agreements containing cross-default provisions. Under these circumstances, we might not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of our obligations.\nWe will incur significant transaction and Merger-related costs in connection with the Merger.\nWe expect to incur a number of non-recurring costs associated with the Merger and combining the operations of the two companies. The substantial majority of non-recurring expenses resulting from the Merger will be comprised of transaction costs related to the Merger. We also will incur transaction fees and costs related to formulating and implementing integration plans, including facilities and systems consolidation costs and employment-related costs. We continue to assess the magnitude of these costs, and additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the Merger and the integration of the two companies\u2019 businesses. Although we expect that the elimination of duplicative costs, as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses, should allow us to offset incremental integration-related costs over time, this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term, or at all.\nThe market price of shares of our common stock may decline in the future as a result of the sale of shares of our common stock held by former Nutrisystem stockholders or our current stockholders.\nFollowing their receipt of shares of our common stock in the Merger, former Nutrisystem stockholders may seek to sell the shares of our common stock delivered to them. Other of our stockholders may also seek to sell shares of our common stock held by them following, or in anticipation of, the closing of the Merger. These sales (or the perception that these sales may occur), coupled with the increase in the outstanding number of shares of our common stock, may affect the market for, and the market price of, our common stock in an adverse manner.\nThe combined company will record goodwill and other intangible assets that could become impaired and result in material non-cash charges to the results of operations of the combined company in the future.\nThe Merger will be accounted for as an acquisition in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the assets and liabilities of Nutrisystem and its subsidiaries will be recorded, as of completion, at their respective fair values and added to ours. The assets to be recorded at fair value are expected to include goodwill and other intangible assets. Our reported financial condition and results of operations for periods after the closing of the Merger will reflect Nutrisystem balances and results after the closing of the Merger, but will not be restated retroactively to reflect the historical financial position or results of operations of Nutrisystem and its subsidiaries for periods prior to the Merger. We review goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization for impairment on an annual basis (during the fourth quarter) or more frequently whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.", "PERMNO": 76788, "SIC": 8090, "TIC": "TVTY"}
