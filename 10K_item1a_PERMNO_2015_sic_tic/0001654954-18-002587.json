{"cik": "875355", "company": "INSIGNIA SYSTEMS INC/MN", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-03-15", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nForward-Looking Statements\nStatements made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, in the Company\u2019s other SEC filings, in press releases and in oral statements to shareholders and securities analysts that are not statements of historical or current facts are \u201cforward-looking statements.\u201d Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual results or performance of the Company to be materially different from the results or performance expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. The words \u201canticipates,\u201d \u201cbelieves,\u201d \u201cexpects,\u201d \u201cseeks\u201d and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include statements expressing the intent, belief or current expectations of the Company and members of our management team regarding, for instance: (i) our belief that our cash balance and cash generated by operations will provide adequate liquidity and capital resources for at least the next twelve months; and (ii) that we expect fluctuations in accounts receivable and payable, accrued liabilities, and revenue deferrals. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date the statement was made. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from the forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on current information, which we have assessed and which by its nature is dynamic and subject to rapid and even abrupt changes.\nOur business faces significant risks, including the risks described below. If any of the events or circumstances described in the following risks occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer, and the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nOur Results Are Dependent on Our CPG Manufacturing Partners\u2019 Continued Use of Our POPS Program\nOur financial results are currently largely dependent on the success of our Insignia POPS point-of-purchase in-store marketing programs which are sold primarily to CPG manufacturers. POPS sales represented approximately 92% of our total net sales in both 2017 and 2016. We also continue to have a concentrated CPG customer base for our POPS product. Our top two CPG customers accounted for approximately 34% of our total net sales in 2017 and for approximately 41% of our total net sales in 2016.\nShould changes in economic conditions result in reductions in advertising and promotional expenditures by CPG manufacturers that lead to a slower rate of growth or a decrease in spending for the in-store advertising services we offer or should any one of the manufacturers who account for a significant amount of our POPS revenues terminate or reduce its participation in the POPS program, our business and results of operations would be adversely affected due to our heavy dependence on this program.\nThe Success of Our POPS Program and, Accordingly, Our Results Are Also Dependent on Our Ongoing Business Relationships with Retailers\nIn order to execute our POPS program, we are a party to contracts with retailers that provide us with access to place signs on shelves in their stores for our CPG manufacturing customers. We may also access a portion of our retailer relationships though third parties. During 2017, our top three retail relationships provided distribution for 34% of our total net sales and during 2016, our top three retailers provided distribution for 29% of our total net sales.\nOur retailer contracts generally have terms of one to three years and we are negotiating the renewal of these contracts on an ongoing basis. The future renewal of these contracts on profitable terms is not free from doubt. For instance, some of our retailer contracts require us to guarantee minimum payments and we may be unable to profitably offer a guarantee at the level required by a retailer during renewal negotiations. The failure to renew a significant retailer contract or a substantial number of other retailer contracts for that or other reasons, a decrease in the quality of our retail distribution network or if our retailers would fail to continue to maintain POPSigns in their stores would have an adverse effect on our POPS program and on our operations and financial condition.\nOur Results Are Dependent on the Success of Our Business Relationship with News America\nOur results depend, in part, on the success of our sales and marketing efforts as News America\u2019s exclusive agent for signs with price into the News America network of retailers and upon our ability to successfully sell programs into this network. Additionally, if disputes with News America arise in the future regarding the operational aspects of our agreement, it could have an adverse effect on the Company.\nWe Face Significant Competition\nWe face significant competition from News America, who also provides at-shelf advertising and promotional signage. Although the settlement with News America extends through February 2021, providing us additional opportunities to compete by offering signs with price in News America\u2019s network, as News America\u2019s exclusive agent, we will continue to compete for advertising dollars with News America\u2019s other at-shelf advertising and promotional signage offerings. News America has significantly greater financial resources that can be used to develop and market their products. Should our competition succeed in obtaining more of the at-shelf advertising business from our current customers, our revenues and related operations would be adversely affected.\nAdditionally, Insignia competes against other providers of advertising, marketing and merchandising products and services, and providers of point-of-purchase and other in-store programs, as well as other marketing products and services. Competition is based on, among other things, rates, availability of markets, quality of products and services provided and their effectiveness, store coverage and other factors. The increasing popularity of digital media among consumers is driving a corresponding shift in advertising from traditional in-store tactics to digital. The development of new devices and technologies, as well as higher consumer engagement with other forms of digital media such as online and mobile social networking, are increasing the number of media choices and formats available to audiences, resulting in audience fragmentation and increased competition for advertising. The range of advertising choices across digital products and platforms and the large inventory of available digital advertising space have historically resulted in significantly lower rates for digital advertising than for in-store advertising. As a result, increasing consumer reliance on mobile devices may add additional pricing pressure.\nOur Growth Is Dependent on Our Ability to Successfully Introduce New Product Offerings that Meet Customer Demands\nOur ability to retain, increase and engage our customers and to increase our revenues will depend partially on our ability to create successful new products. We may modify our existing products or develop and introduce new and unproven products, including acquired products. If new or enhanced products fail to engage consumers, we may fail to attract or retain customers or to generate sufficient revenues, margins, or other value to justify our investments and our business may be adversely affected. In the future, we may invest in new products and initiatives to generate revenue, but there is no guarantee these approaches will be successful. If we are not successful with these new approaches, we may not be able to maintain or grow our revenues or recover any associated product development costs, and our financial results could be adversely affected.\nWe May be Subject to Major Litigation\nWe were involved in major litigation with News America between 2003 and 2011. In 2011, the Company and News America entered into a settlement agreement to resolve the antitrust and false advertising lawsuit that had been outstanding for several years. Although the Company obtained a significant settlement in 2011, if future disputes with News America, or other companies arise, it could have an adverse effect on our Company.\nOur Customers and Retailers May Be Susceptible to Changes in Economic Conditions\nOur revenues are affected by our customers\u2019 marketing and advertising spending and our revenues and results of operations may be subject to fluctuations based upon general economic conditions. Another economic downturn may reduce demand for our products and services or depress pricing of those products and services and have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Retailers may be impacted by changes in consumer spending as well, which may adversely impact our ability to renew contracts with our existing retailers as well as contract with new retailers on terms that are acceptable to us. In addition, if we are unable to successfully anticipate changing economic conditions, we may be unable to effectively plan for and respond to those changes, and our business could be negatively affected.\nOur Ability to Attract and Retain Key Employees Will Be Critical to Our Success\nGiven the unique business we operate and the importance of customer relationships to our business, our future success is dependent, in large part, upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified managerial, operational and sales personnel. Competition for talented personnel is intense, and we cannot be certain that we can retain our managerial, operational and sales personnel or that we can attract, assimilate or retain such personnel in the future. Our inability to attract and retain such personnel could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur Results of Operations Have Been and May Be Subject to Significant Fluctuations\nOur quarterly and annual operating results have fluctuated in the past and may vary in the future due to a wide variety of factors including:\n\u25cf the addition or loss of contracts with retailers;\n\u25cf the addition or loss of customers or changes in timing and amount of our customers\u2019 spending with us;\n\u25cf the timing of seasonal events for customers;\n\u25cf the timing of new retail stores being added or removed;\n\u25cf costs of evaluating and developing new products;\n\u25cf the timing of additional selling, marketing and general and administrative expenses; and\n\u25cf competitive conditions in our industry.\nDue to these factors, our quarterly and annual net sales, expenses and results of operations could vary significantly in the future and this could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nInvestment in Our Stock Could Result in Fluctuating Returns\nDuring 2017, the sale prices of our common stock as reported by The Nasdaq Stock Market ranged from a low of $0.90 to a high of $2.59. We believe factors such as the fluctuations in our quarterly and annual operating results described above, the market\u2019s acceptance of our services and products, the performance of our business relative to market expectations, as well as limited daily trading volume of our stock and general volatility in the securities markets, could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially. In addition, the stock markets have experienced price and volume fluctuations, resulting in changes in the market prices of the stock of many companies, which may not have been directly related to the operating performance of those companies.\nThe Company May be Impacted if the Information Systems Are Attacked\nWe rely upon information technology systems and networks in connection with a variety of business activities, some of which are managed by third parties. Additionally, we collect and store data that is sensitive to Insignia and its employees, customers, retailer network and suppliers. The secure operation of these information technology systems and networks, and the processing and maintenance of this data, is critical to our business operations and strategy. Information technology security threats-from user error to attacks designed to gain unauthorized access to our systems, networks and data-are increasing in frequency and sophistication. Attacks may range from random attempts to coordinated and targeted attacks, including sophisticated computer crime and advanced persistent threats. These threats pose a risk to the security of our systems, networks and products and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of the data we process and maintain. Establishing systems and processes to address these threats and changes in legal requirements relating to data collection and storage may increase our costs. Should such an attack succeed, it could expose us and our employees, customers, retailer network and suppliers to misuse of information or systems, the compromising of confidential information, theft of assets, manipulation and destruction of data, defective products, production downtimes and operations disruptions, and breach of privacy, which may require notification under data privacy and other applicable laws. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, such breaches in security could result in litigation, regulatory action and potential liability and the costs and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures.\nOur IT Operating Infrastructure Project May Not Function as Anticipated\nThe Company is implementing a new IT operating infrastructure system which may not function as designed and tested. In addition, the costs of implementation may be greater than anticipated if the testing and launch do not meet our customers\u2019 and retailers\u2019 expectations. If the Company is unable to deliver advertising products to the customers\u2019 and retailers\u2019 expectations, our brand and reputation may be impacted.", "PERMNO": 76934, "SIC": 7310, "TIC": "ISIG"}
