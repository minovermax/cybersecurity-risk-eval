RISK FACTORS\nRisk Factors That May Affect Future Results - Together with the other information on the risks we face and our management of risk contained in this Annual Report or in our other SEC filings, the following presents significant risks which may affect us. Events or circumstances arising from one or more of these risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects and the value and price of our common stock could decline. The risks identified below are not intended to be a comprehensive list of all risks we face, and additional risks that we may currently view as not material may also impair our business operations and results.\nRisk Relating to Recent Economic Conditions and Government Response Efforts\nEconomic and market conditions continue to be challenging for our industry\nAfter suffering sharp declines in values during the 2008-2009 Recession, commercial and residential real estate prices have improved in most areas served by CBB. There are geographic regions that continue to have higher unemployment and more difficult economies where housing prices have not recovered from pre-recession levels, particularly in the Central Valley of California which is also an important geographic region for CBB. In areas that have not fully recovered, there continues to be delinquencies and foreclosure activities.\nWhile general economic conditions in the United States, including in the employment markets, appear to have improved, the overall rate of economic growth, compared to prior periods of economic growth, for most of the markets and industries served by CBB, continues to be modest, and this in turn has generally resulted in more limited business expansion, revenue expansion and employment growth for CBB\u2019s customers and geographic markets. In addition, there continue to be widespread concerns over the stability of the financial markets and the economy, which have notably limited the expansion of lending by financial institutions to their customers beyond what otherwise would be expected. In addition, the banking industry has been impacted by increased regulatory oversight, a continuing low interest rate environment, declines in selected overseas markets and various geopolitical issues and conflicts.\nThe resulting economic pressure on consumers and businesses, the absence of sustained historical rates of economic growth, and the periodic lack of confidence in financial markets, may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and stock price. A worsening of any of these conditions would likely exacerbate the adverse effects of these market conditions on us and others in the financial institutions industry. In particular, we may face the following risks in connection with these events, or any downward turn in the economy:\n\u2022\nThe process we use to estimate losses inherent in our credit exposure requires difficult, subjective and complex judgments, including forecasts of economic conditions and how these economic conditions might impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans. The level of uncertainty concerning economic conditions may adversely affect the accuracy of our estimates which may, in turn, impact the reliability of the process.\n\u2022\nThe Company\u2019s commercial, residential and consumer borrowers may be unable to make timely repayments of their loans, or the decrease in value of real estate collateral securing the payment of such loans could result in significant credit losses, increasing delinquencies, foreclosures and customer bankruptcies, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s operating results.\n\u2022\nA sustained environment of low interest rates would continue to cause lending margins to stay compressed, which in turn may limit our revenues and profitability.\n\u2022\nThe value of the portfolio of investment securities that we hold may be adversely affected by increasing interest rates and defaults by debtors.\n\u2022\nFurther disruptions in the capital markets or other events, including actions by rating agencies and deteriorating investor expectations, may result in changes in applicable rates of interest, difficulty in accessing capital or an inability to borrow on favorable terms or at all from other financial institutions.\n\u2022\nIncreased competition among financial services companies due to expected further consolidation in the industry may adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to market its products and services.\nIf economic conditions and the current outlook for interest rates do not continue to significantly improve, there can be no assurance that we will not experience an adverse effect, which may be material, on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nU.S. and international financial markets and economic conditions could adversely affect our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition\nAs described in \u201cBusiness - Economic Conditions, Government Policies, Legislation and Regulation\u201d, turmoil and downward economic trends have been particularly acute in the financial sector. Although the Company and the Bank exceed the minimum capital ratio requirements to be deemed well capitalized and have not suffered any significant liquidity issues as a result of these events, the cost and availability of funds may be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and the demand for our products and services may decline as our borrowers and customers continue to realize the impact of slower than customary economic growth, after-effects of the previous recession and ongoing underemployment of the workforce. In view of the concentration of our operations and the collateral securing our loan portfolio in Central and Southern California, we may be particularly susceptible to adverse economic conditions in the state of California, where our business is concentrated. In addition, adverse economic conditions may exacerbate our exposure to credit risk and adversely affect the ability of borrowers to perform, and thereby, adversely affect our liquidity, financial condition, results or operations and profitability.\nWe may be required to make additional provisions for credit losses and charge-off additional loans in the future, which could adversely affect our results of operations\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded a $5.6 million loan loss provision recapture, charge-offs of $1.0 million, and recoveries of $6.0 million. As of December 31, 2015, we had $2.7 billion in commercial real estate loans, $68.6 million in construction loans and $233.9 million in single-family residential mortgages. Although the U.S. economy appears to have emerged from a period of severe recession followed by slower than normal growth, business activity and real estate values continue to grow more slowly than in past economic recoveries, and may not recover fully or could again decline from current levels, and this in turn could affect the ability of our loan customers to service their debts, including those customers whose loans are secured by commercial or residential real estate. This, in turn, could result in loan charge-offs and provisions for credit losses in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, net income and capital. In addition, the Federal Reserve Board and other government officials have expressed concerns about banks\u2019 concentration in commercial real estate lending and the ability of commercial real estate borrowers to perform pursuant to the terms of their loans.\nVolatility in commodity prices may adversely affect our results of operations\nAs of December 31, 2015, approximately 7.6% of our total gross loan portfolio was comprised of dairy & livestock and agribusiness loans. Recent volatility in certain commodity prices, including milk prices, could adversely impact the ability of those to whom we have made dairy & livestock and agribusiness loans to perform under the terms of their borrowing arrangements with us.\nRisks Related to Our Market and Business\nOur allowance for loan losses may not be appropriate to cover actual losses\nA significant source of risk arises from the possibility that we could sustain losses because borrowers, guarantors, and related parties may fail to perform in accordance with the terms of their loans and leases. The underwriting and credit monitoring policies and procedures that we have adopted to address this risk may not\nprevent unexpected losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We maintain an allowance for loan losses to provide for loan and lease defaults and non-performance. The allowance is also appropriately increased for new loan growth. While we believe that our allowance for loan losses is appropriate to cover inherent losses, we cannot assure you that we will not increase the allowance for loan losses further or that regulators will not require us to increase this allowance.\nLiquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations and jeopardize our financial condition\nLiquidity is essential to our business. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of loans and other sources could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry in general. Factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity due to a market downturn or adverse regulatory action against us. Our ability to acquire deposits or borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us, such as a severe disruption of the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry as a whole. Many if not all of these same factors could also significantly raise the cost of deposits to our Company and/or to the banking industry in general. This in turn could negatively affect the amount of interest we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities, which could have an adverse impact on our interest rate spread and profitability.\nThe actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions could affect our ability to engage in routine funding transactions\nFinancial service institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. We have exposure to different industries and counterparties, and execute transactions with various counterparties in the financial industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual funds, and other institutional clients. Defaults by financial services institutions, even rumors or questions about one or more financial institutions or the financial services industry in general, could lead to market wide liquidity problems and further, could lead to losses or defaults by the Company or other institutions. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of the applicable counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may increase when the collateral held by us cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due to us. Any such losses could materially and adversely affect our consolidated financial statements.\nOur loan portfolio is predominantly secured by real estate and thus we have a higher degree of risk from a downturn in our real estate markets\nA renewed downturn in our real estate markets could hurt our business because many of our loans are secured by real estate. Real estate values and real estate markets are generally affected by changes in national, regional or local economic conditions, fluctuations in interest rates and the availability of loans to potential purchasers, changes in tax laws and other governmental statutes, regulations and policies, and acts of nature, such as earthquakes, prolonged drought and disasters particular to California. Substantially all of our real estate collateral is located in the state of California. If real estate values, including values of land held for development, should again start to decline, the value of real estate collateral securing our loans could be significantly reduced. Our ability to recover on defaulted loans by foreclosing and selling the real estate collateral would then be diminished and we would be more likely to suffer losses on defaulted loans. Commercial real estate loans typically involve large balances to single borrowers or a group of related borrowers. Since payments on these loans are often dependent on the successful operation or management of the properties, as well as the business and financial condition of the borrower(s), repayment of such loans may be subject to adverse conditions in the real estate market, adverse economic conditions or changes in applicable government regulations.\nAdditional risks associated with our real estate construction loan portfolio include failure of developers and/or contractors to complete construction on a timely basis or at all, market deterioration during construction, cost overruns and failure to sell or lease the security underlying the construction loans so as to generate the cash flow anticipated by our borrower.\nA decline in the economy may cause renewed declines in real estate values and increases in unemployment, which may result in higher than expected loan delinquencies or problem assets, a decline in demand for our products and services, or a lack of growth or decrease in deposits, which may cause us to incur losses, adversely affect our capital or hurt our business.\nOur commercial real estate loan portfolio exposes us to risks that may be greater than the risks related to our other loans\nFederal and state banking regulators are examining commercial real estate lending activity with heightened scrutiny and may require banks with higher levels of commercial real estate loans to implement more stringent underwriting, internal controls, risk management policies and portfolio stress testing, as well as possibly higher levels of allowances for losses and capital levels as a result of commercial real estate lending growth and exposures. Because a significant portion of our loan portfolio is comprised of commercial real estate loans, the banking regulators may require us to maintain higher levels of capital than we would otherwise be expected to maintain, which could limit our ability to leverage our capital and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe are exposed to risk of environmental liabilities with respect to properties to which we take title\nIn the course of our business, we may foreclose and take title to real estate, and could be subject to environmental liabilities with respect to these properties. While we will take steps to mitigate this risk, we may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination, or we may be required to investigate or clean-up hazardous or toxic substances, or chemical releases at one or more properties. The costs associated with investigation or remediation activities could be substantial. In addition, while there are certain statutory protections afforded lenders who take title to property through foreclosure on a loan, if we are the owner or former owner of a contaminated site, we may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property. If we become subject to significant environmental liabilities, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected.\nWe may experience goodwill impairment\nIf our estimates of segment fair value change due to changes in our businesses or other factors, we may determine that impairment charges on goodwill recorded as a result of acquisitions are necessary. Estimates of fair value are determined based on a complex model using cash flows, the fair value of our Company as determined by our stock price, and company comparisons. If management\u2019s estimates of future cash flows are inaccurate, fair value determined could be inaccurate and impairment may not be recognized in a timely manner. If the fair value of the Company declines, we may need to recognize goodwill impairment in the future which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and capital levels.\nOur business is subject to interest rate risk and variations in interest rates may negatively affect our financial performance\nA substantial portion of our income is derived from the differential or \u201cspread\u201d between the interest earned on loans, securities and other interest-earning assets, and the interest paid on deposits, borrowings and other interest-bearing liabilities. Because of the differences in the maturities and repricing characteristics of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, changes in interest rates do not produce equivalent changes in interest income earned on interest-earning assets and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities. At December 31, 2015 our balance sheet was matched with asset sensitive bias over a two-year horizon assuming no balance sheet growth, and as a result, our net interest margin tends to expand in a rising interest rate environment and decrease in a declining interest rate environment. Accordingly, fluctuations in interest rates could adversely affect our interest rate spread and, in turn, our profitability. In addition, loan origination volumes are affected by market interest rates. Rising interest rates, generally, are associated with a lower volume of loan originations\nwhile lower interest rates are usually associated with higher loan originations. Conversely, in rising interest rate environments, loan repayment rates may decline and in falling interest rate environments, loan repayment rates may increase. In addition, in a rising interest rate environment, we may need to accelerate the pace of rate increases on our deposit accounts as compared to the pace of future increases in short-term market rates. Accordingly, changes in levels of market interest rates could materially and adversely affect our net interest spread, asset quality, as well as loan origination and prepayment volume.\nWe are subject to extensive government regulation that could limit or restrict our activities, which, in turn, may hamper our ability to increase our assets and earnings\nOur operations are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local governmental authorities and we are subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing requirements and restrictions on part or all of our operations. Similarly, the lending, credit and deposit products we offer are subject to broad oversight and regulation. Because our business is highly regulated, the laws, rules, regulations and supervisory guidance and policies applicable to us are subject to regular modification and change. Perennially, various laws, rules and regulations are proposed, which, if adopted, could impact our operations by making compliance much more difficult or expensive, restricting our ability to originate or sell loans or further restricting the amount of interest or other charges or fees earned on loans or other products. Current and future legal and regulatory requirements, restrictions and regulations, including those imposed under Dodd-Frank, may adversely impact our profitability and may have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations, may require us to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make any changes required by the legislation and accompanying rules, and may make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified executive officers and employees. The implementation of certain final Dodd-Frank rules is delayed or phased in over several years; therefore, as yet we cannot definitively assess what may be the short or longer term specific or aggregate effect of the full implementation of Dodd-Frank on us.\nWe face a risk of noncompliance and enforcement action with the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations\nThe Bank Secrecy Act, the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program and file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports as appropriate. The federal Financial Crimes Enforcement Network is authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and has recently engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts with the individual federal banking regulators, as well as the U.S. Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration, and Internal Revenue Service. We are also subject to scrutiny of compliance with the rules enforced by the Office of Foreign Assets Control and compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. If our policies, procedures and systems are deemed deficient, we would be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions, which may include restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of our business plan. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for us. Any of these results could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nNew mortgage regulations may adversely impact our business\nRevisions made pursuant to Dodd-Frank to Regulation Z, which implements the Truth in Lending Act (TILA), effective in January 2014, apply to all consumer mortgages (except home equity lines of credit, timeshare plans, reverse mortgages, or temporary loans), and mandate specific underwriting criteria and \u201cability to repay\u201d requirements for home loans. This may impact our offering and underwriting of single family residential loans in our residential mortgage lending operation and could have a resulting unknown effect on potential delinquencies. In addition, the relatively uniform requirements may make it difficult for regional and community banks to compete against the larger national banks for single family residential loan originations.\nThe impact of new capital rules will impose enhanced capital adequacy requirements on us and may materially affect our operations\nWe will be subject to more stringent capital requirements. Pursuant to Dodd-Frank and to implement for U.S. banking institutions the principles of the international \u201cBasel III\u201d standards, the federal banking agencies have adopted a new set of rules on minimum leverage and risk-based capital that will apply to both insured banks and their holding companies. These regulations were issued in July 2013, and will be phased in, for the Bank and the Company, over a period of five years, beginning in 2015. The new capital rules, among other things:\n\u2022\nimpose more restrictive eligibility requirements for Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital;\n\u2022\nintroduce a new category of capital, called Common Equity Tier 1 capital, which must be at least 4.5 percent of risk-based assets, net of regulatory deductions, and a capital conservation buffer of an additional 2.5 percent of common equity to risk-weighted assets, raising the target minimum common equity ratio to 7 percent;\n\u2022\nincrease the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio to 8.5 percent inclusive of the capital conservation buffer;\n\u2022\nincrease the minimum total capital ratio to 10.5 percent inclusive of the capital conservation buffer; and\n\u2022\nintroduce a non-risk adjusted Tier 1 leverage ratio of 3 percent, based on a measure of total exposure rather than total assets, and new liquidity standards.\nThe full implementation of the new capital rule may adversely affect our ability to pay dividends, or require us to reduce business levels or raise capital, including in ways that may adversely affect our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe new Basel III-based capital standards could limit our ability to pay dividends or make stock repurchases and our ability to compensate our executives with discretionary bonuses. Under the new capital standards, if our Common Equity Tier 1 Capital does not include a newly required \u201ccapital conservation buffer,\u201d we will be prohibited from making distributions to our stockholders. The capital conservation buffer requirement, which is measured in addition to the minimum Common Equity Tier 1 capital of 4.5%, will be phased in over four years, starting at 0.625% for 2016, and rising to 2.5% for 2019 and subsequent years. Additionally, under the new capital standards, if our Common Equity Tier 1 Capital does not include the newly required \u201ccapital conservation buffer,\u201d we will also be prohibited from paying discretionary bonuses to our executive employees. This may affect our ability to attract or retain employees, or alter the nature of the compensation arrangements that we may enter into with them.\nFailure to manage our growth may adversely affect our performance\nOur financial performance and profitability depend on our ability to manage past and possible future growth. Future acquisitions and our continued growth may present operating, integration, regulatory, management and other issues that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe occurrence of fraudulent activity, breaches or failures of our information security controls or cybersecurity-related incidents could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations\nAs a financial institution, we are susceptible to fraudulent activity, information security breaches and cybersecurity-related incidents that may be committed against us or our clients, which may result in financial losses or increased costs to us or our clients, disclosure or misuse of our information or our client information, misappropriation of assets, privacy breaches against our clients, litigation, or damage to our reputation. Such fraudulent activity may take many forms, including check fraud, electronic fraud, wire fraud, on-line banking, phishing, social engineering and other dishonest acts. Information security breaches and cybersecurity-related\nincidents may include fraudulent or unauthorized access to systems used by us or our clients, denial or degradation of service attacks, and malware or other cyber-attacks. In recent periods, there continues to be a rise in electronic fraudulent activity, security breaches and cyber-attacks within the financial services industry, especially in the commercial banking sector due to cyber criminals targeting commercial bank accounts. Consistent with industry trends, we have also experienced an increase in attempted electronic fraudulent activity, security breaches and cybersecurity-related incidents in recent periods. Moreover, in recent periods, several large corporations, including financial institutions and retail companies, have suffered major data breaches, in some cases exposing not only confidential and proprietary corporate information, but also sensitive financial and other personal information of their customers and employees and subjecting them to potential fraudulent activity. Some of our clients may have been affected by these breaches, which increase their risks of identity theft, credit card fraud and other fraudulent activity that could involve their accounts with us.\nInformation pertaining to us and our clients is maintained, and transactions are executed, on the networks and systems of ours, our clients and certain of our third party providers, such as our online banking or core systems. The secure maintenance and transmission of confidential information, as well as execution of transactions over these systems, are essential to protect us and our clients against fraud and security breaches and to maintain our clients\u2019 confidence. Breaches of information security also may occur, and in infrequent, incidental, cases have occurred, through intentional or unintentional acts by those having access to our systems or our clients\u2019 or counterparties\u2019 confidential information, including employees. In addition, increases in criminal activity levels and sophistication, advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries, vulnerabilities in third-party technologies (including browsers and operating systems) or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of the technology, processes and controls that we use to prevent fraudulent transactions and to protect data about us, our clients and underlying transactions, as well as the technology used by our clients to access our systems. Although we have developed, and continue to invest in, systems and processes that are designed to detect and prevent security breaches and cyber-attacks and periodically test our security, our inability to anticipate, or failure to adequately mitigate, breaches of security could result in: losses to us or our clients; our loss of business and/or clients; damage to our reputation; the incurrence of additional expenses; disruption to our business; our inability to grow our online services or other businesses; additional regulatory scrutiny or penalties; or our exposure to civil litigation and possible financial liability - any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMore generally, publicized information concerning security and cyber-related problems could inhibit the use or growth of electronic or web-based applications or solutions as a means of conducting commercial transactions. Such publicity may also cause damage to our reputation as a financial institution. As a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur business is exposed to the risk of changes in technology\nThe rapid pace of technology changes and the impact of such changes on financial services generally and on our Company specifically could impact our cost structure and our competitive position with our customers. Salient although not exclusive examples of such developments are the rapid movement by customers and some competitor financial institutions to web-based services, mobile banking and cloud computing. Because of our relatively smaller size and limited resources, our Company has typically followed rather than lead such developments and the adoption of such applications by larger institutions and technology providers, and we are reliant on legacy systems and software that may not be as efficient or adaptable as those utilized by competitors. Our failure or inability to anticipate, plan for or implement technology change could adversely affect our competitive position, financial condition and profitability.\nOur controls and procedures could fail or be circumvented\nManagement regularly reviews and updates our internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is\nbased in part on certain assumptions and on the conduct of individuals, and can provide only reasonable, but not absolute, assurances of the effectiveness of these systems and controls, and that the objectives of these controls have been met. Any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures, and any failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFailure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures could adversely affect our ability to report our financial condition and results of operations accurately and on a timely basis\nA failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures could adversely affect our ability to report our financial results accurately and on a timely basis, which could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reporting or adversely affect our access to sources of liquidity. Furthermore, because of the inherent limitations of any system of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls and fraud, even effective internal controls may not prevent or detect all misstatements.\nIncome that we recognized and continue to recognize in connection with our 2009 FDIC-assisted San Joaquin Bank acquisition may be non-recurring or finite in duration\nThrough the acquisition of San Joaquin Bank, we acquired approximately $673.1 million of assets and assumed $660.9 million of liabilities. The San Joaquin Bank acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and we recorded an after-tax bargain purchase gain totaling $12.3 million as a result of the acquisition. This gain was included as a component of other operating income on our statement of earnings for 2009. The amount of the gain was equal to the amount by which the fair value of assets purchased exceeded the fair value of liabilities. The bargain purchase gain resulting from the acquisition was a one-time gain that is not expected to be repeated in future periods. The loss sharing agreement for commercial loans expired October 16, 2014. At December 31, 2015, the remaining discount associated with the SJB loans approximated $3.9 million.\nOur decisions regarding the fair value of assets acquired could be different than initially estimated, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and future prospects\nIn business combinations, we acquire significant portfolios of loans that are marked to their estimated fair value, there is no assurance that the acquired loans will not suffer deterioration in value. The fluctuations in national, regional and local economic conditions, including those related to local residential, commercial real estate and construction markets, may increase the level of charge-offs in the loan portfolio that we acquire and correspondingly reduce our net income. These fluctuations are not predictable, cannot be controlled and may have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial condition, even if other favorable events occur.\nWe face strong competition from financial services companies and other companies that offer banking services\nWe conduct most of our operations in the state of California. The banking and financial services businesses in the state of California are highly competitive and increased competition in our primary market area may adversely impact the level of our loans and deposits. Ultimately, we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors. These competitors include national banks, regional banks and other community banks. We also face competition from many other types of financial institutions, including savings and loan associations, finance companies, brokerage firms, insurance companies, credit unions, mortgage companies and other financial intermediaries. In particular, our competitors include major financial companies whose greater resources may afford them a marketplace advantage by enabling them to offer products at lower costs, maintain numerous locations, and mount extensive promotional and advertising campaigns. Areas of\ncompetition include interest rates for loans and deposits, efforts to obtain loan and deposit customers and a range in quality of products and services provided, including new technology driven products and services. If we are unable to attract and retain banking customers, we may be unable to continue our loan growth and level of deposits.\nWe rely on communications, information, operating and financial control systems technology from third-party service providers, and we may suffer an interruption in those systems\nWe rely heavily on third-party service providers for much of our communications, information, operating and financial control systems technology, including our internet banking services and data processing systems. Any failure or interruption of these services or systems or breaches in the security of these systems could result in failures or interruptions in our customer relationship management, the Bank\u2019s reputation, general ledger, deposit, servicing and/or loan origination systems. The occurrence of any failures or interruptions may require us to identify alternative sources of such services, which may result in increased costs or other consequences that in turn could have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe are dependent on key personnel and the loss of one or more of those key personnel may materially and adversely affect our prospects\nCompetition for qualified employees and personnel in the banking industry is intense and there are a limited number of qualified persons with knowledge of, and experience in, the California community banking industry. The process of recruiting personnel with the combination of skills and attributes required to carry out our strategies is often lengthy. In addition, legislation and regulations which impose restrictions on executive compensation may make it more difficult for us to retain and recruit key personnel. Our success depends to a significant degree upon our ability to attract and retain qualified management, loan origination, finance, administrative, risk management, marketing and technical personnel and upon the continued contributions of our management and personnel. In particular, our success has been and continues to be highly dependent upon the abilities of key executives, including our President and Chief Executive Officer, and certain other employees. In addition, our success has been and continues to be highly dependent upon the services of our directors, some of whom may be considering retirement, and we may not be able to identify and attract suitable candidates to replace such directors.\nManaging reputational risk is important to attracting and maintaining customers, investors and employees\nThreats to our reputation can come from many sources, including adverse sentiment about financial institutions generally, unethical practices, employee misconduct or fraud, failure to deliver minimum standards of service or quality, compliance deficiencies, government investigations, litigation, and questionable or fraudulent activities of our customers. We have policies and procedures in place to protect our reputation and promote ethical conduct, but these policies and procedures may not be fully effective. Negative publicity regarding our business, employees, or customers, with or without merit, may result in the loss of customers, investors and employees, costly litigation, a decline in revenues and increased governmental scrutiny and regulation.\nWe are subject to legal and litigation risk, including a consolidated class action lawsuit and a similar state law derivative action, and wage-hour employment litigation, which could adversely affect us\nBecause our Company is extensively regulated by a variety of federal and state agencies, and because we are subject to a wide range of business, consumer and employment laws and regulations at the federal, state and local levels, we are at risk of governmental investigations and lawsuits as well as claims and litigation from private parties. We are from time to time involved in disputes with and claims from investors, customers, government agencies, vendors, employees and other business parties, and such disputes and claims may result in litigation or settlements, any one of which or in the aggregate could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s\noperating flexibility, employee relations, financial condition or results of operations, as a result of the costs of any judgment, the terms of any settlement and/or the expenses incurred in defending the applicable claim.\nA federal securities class action lawsuit was filed against us and certain of our officers, a state law derivative action was filed in the name of the Company against our directors, and a purported class action lawsuit alleging federal and state wage-hour violations has been filed against CBB. See Item 3 - Legal Proceedings below.\nWe are unable, at this time, to estimate our potential liability in these matters, but we may be required to pay judgments, settlements or other penalties and incur other costs and expenses in connection with any one or more of these lawsuits, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, responding to requests for information in connection with discovery demanded by the plaintiffs in any of these lawsuits may be costly and divert internal resources away from managing our business. See Item 3 - Legal Proceedings below.\nFederal and state laws and regulations may restrict our ability to pay dividends\nThe ability of the Bank to pay dividends to the Company and of the Company to pay dividends to its shareholders is limited by applicable federal and California law and regulations. See \u201cBusiness - Regulation and Supervision\u201d and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Cash Flow.\u201d\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile or may decline\nThe trading price of our common stock may fluctuate widely as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside our control. In addition, the stock market is subject to fluctuations in its share prices and trading volumes that affect the market prices of the shares of many companies. These specific and broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Among the factors that could affect our stock price are:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results and financial condition;\n\u2022\nchanges in revenue or earnings estimates or publication of research reports and recommendations by financial analysts;\n\u2022\ncredit events or losses;\n\u2022\nfailure to meet analysts\u2019 revenue or earnings estimates;\n\u2022\nspeculation in the press or investment community;\n\u2022\nstrategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings;\n\u2022\nactions or trades by institutional shareholders or other large shareholders;\n\u2022\nour capital position;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the stock price and operating results of our competitors;\n\u2022\nactions by hedge funds, short term investors, activist shareholders or shareholder representative organizations;\n\u2022\ngeneral market conditions and, in particular, developments related to market conditions for the financial services industry;\n\u2022\nproposed or adopted regulatory changes or developments;\n\u2022\nanticipated or pending investigations, proceedings or litigation that involve or affect the Company and/or the Bank; or\n\u2022\ndomestic and international economic factors, whether related or unrelated to the Company\u2019s performance.\nThe stock market and, in particular, the market for financial institution stocks, has experienced significant volatility in recent years. The market price of our common stock and the trading volume in our common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur. The trading price of the shares of our common stock and the value of our other securities will depend on many factors, which may change from time to time, including, without limitation, our financial condition, performance, creditworthiness and prospects, future sales of our equity or equity related securities, and other factors identified above in \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statement\u201d. The capital and credit markets have been experiencing volatility and disruption for more than five years. In some cases, the markets have produced downward pressure on stock prices and credit availability for certain issuers without regard to those issuers\u2019 underlying financial strength. A significant decline in our stock price could result in substantial losses for individual shareholders and could lead to costly and disruptive securities litigation. Extensive sales by large shareholders could also exert sustained downward pressure on our stock price.\nAnti-takeover provisions and federal law may limit the ability of another party to acquire us, which could cause our stock price to decline\nVarious provisions of our articles of incorporation and by-laws and certain other actions we have taken could delay or prevent a third-party from acquiring us, even if doing so might be beneficial to our shareholders. The Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, and the Change in Bank Control Act of 1978, as amended, together with federal regulations, require that, depending on the particular circumstances, regulatory approval and/or appropriate regulatory filings may be required from either or all the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, the DBO prior to any person or entity acquiring \u201ccontrol\u201d (as defined in the applicable regulations) of a state non-member bank, such as the Bank. These provisions may prevent a merger or acquisition that would be attractive to shareholders and could limit the price investors would be willing to pay in the future for our common stock.\nChanges in stock market prices could reduce fee income from our brokerage, asset management and investment advisory businesses\nWe earn substantial wealth management fee income for managing assets for our clients and also providing brokerage and investment advisory services. Because investment management and advisory fees are often based on the value of assets under management, a fall in the market prices of those assets could reduce our fee income. Changes in stock market prices could affect the trading activity of investors, reducing commissions and other fees we earn from our brokerage business.\nCVB is a holding company and depends on the Bank for dividends, distributions and other payments\nCVB is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank. Our principal source of cash flow, including cash flow to pay dividends to our shareholders is dividends from the Bank. CVB\u2019s ability to pay dividends to our stockholders is substantially dependent upon the Bank\u2019s ability to pay dividends to CVB. Federal and state law imposes limits on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends and make other distributions and payments. If the Bank is unable to meet regulatory requirements to pay dividends or make other distributions to CVB, CVB will be unable to pay dividends to its shareholders.\nWe may face other risks\nFrom time to time, we detail other risks with respect to our business and/or financial results in our filings with the SEC.\nFor further discussion on additional areas of risk, see \u201cItem 7.
