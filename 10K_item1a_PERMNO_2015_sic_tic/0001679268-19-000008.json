{"cik": "1679268", "company": "MAMMOTH ENERGY SERVICES, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-18", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRisks Related to Our Business and the Industries We Serve\nOur customer base is concentrated and the loss of one or more of our significant customers, or their failure to pay the amounts they owe us, could cause our revenue to decline substantially.\nOur top five customers accounted for approximately 77% and 71%, respectively, of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. PREPA was our largest customer for the year ended December 31, 2018 accounting for approximately 60% of our revenue and our second largest customer for the year ended December 31, 2017 accounting for approximately 29% of our revenue. Gulfport was our second largest customer for the year ended December 31, 2018 accounting for approximately 8% of our revenue and our largest customer for the year ended December 31, 2017 accounting for approximately 30% of our revenue. It is likely that we will continue to derive a significant portion of our revenue from a relatively small number of customers in the future. If a major customer decided not to continue to use our services, our revenue would decline and our operating results and financial condition could be harmed. In addition, we are subject to credit risk due to the concentration of our customer base. In particular, as of December 31, 2018, PREPA owed us approximately $225 million for services performed on or before December 31, 2018. As of March 8, 2019, the amount owed to us by PREPA had increased to approximately $281 million. Any nonperformance by our counterparties, including their failure to pay the amounts they owe us on a timely basis or at all, either as a result of changes in financial and economic conditions or otherwise, could have an adverse impact on our operating results and could adversely affect our liquidity.\nCobra, one of our infrastructure services subsidiaries, has entered into service contracts with PREPA, which provide for aggregate payments to us of up to approximately $1.8 billion. PREPA is currently subject to pending bankruptcy proceedings. In the event that PREPA (i) does not have or does not obtain the funds necessary to satisfy its payment obligations to our subsidiary under the contracts, (ii) obtains the necessary funds but refuses to pay the amounts owed to us, (iii) terminates the contracts or curtails our services prior to the end of the contract terms or (iv) otherwise fails to pay amounts owed to us for services performed, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows would be materially and adversely affected.\nOn October 19, 2017, one of our subsidiaries, Cobra, and PREPA entered into an emergency master services agreement for repairs to PREPA\u2019s electrical grid as a result of Hurricane Maria. The one-year contract, as amended, provided for payments of up to $945 million. On May 26, 2018, Cobra and PREPA entered into a new one-year, $900 million master services agreement to provide additional repair services and begin the initial phase of reconstruction of the electrical power system on Puerto Rico. PREPA is currently subject to bankruptcy proceedings pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico. As a result, PREPA\u2019s ability to meet its payment obligations under the contracts is largely dependent upon funding from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, or other sources. PREPA\u2019s contracting practices in connection with restoration and repair of PREPA\u2019s electrical grid on Puerto Rico, and the terms of certain of those contracts, have been subject to critical comment and are the subject of review and hearings by U.S. federal and Puerto Rican governmental entities. In 2017, a contract for restoration and repair services entered into by PREPA with an unrelated third party was terminated by PREPA. As of December 31, 2018, PREPA owed us approximately $225 million for services performed on or before December 31, 2018. As of March 8, 2019, the amount owed to us by PREPA had increased to approximately $281 million. In the event that PREPA (i) does not have or does not obtain the funds necessary to satisfy its current obligations to Cobra under the contracts, (ii) obtains the necessary funds but refuses to pay the amounts owed to us, (iii) terminates the contracts or curtails our services prior to the end of the contract terms or (iv) otherwise fails to pay amounts owed to us for services performed, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows would be materially and adversely affected. In addition, government contracts are subject to various uncertainties, restrictions and regulations, including oversight audits by government representatives and profit and cost controls, which could result in withholding or delayed payments to us or efforts to recover payments already made.\nWe provide the majority of our infrastructure services to one customer, and the termination of this relationship could adversely affect our operations.\nWe provide infrastructure services that focus on the repair, maintenance and construction of transmission and distribution networks. Substantially all of our revenue from this business has been derived from two contracts with PREPA, each with a term of up to one year. The first contract was entered into in October 2017 and the $945 million of services contracted for under that agreement were performed by July 21, 2018. The term of the second contract expires on May 25, 2019. We are not involved in discussions to extend the term of the second contract with PREPA and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain one or more replacement contracts with PREPA or other customers sufficient to continue providing the level of services that we currently provide to PREPA. The termination of our relationship with PREPA could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe provide our hydraulic fracturing completion services to a limited number of customers, and the termination of one or more of these relationships could adversely affect our operations.\nWe provide completion services, which services include hydraulic fracturing. A portion of our revenue from this business is derived from Gulfport pursuant to a contract that expires in December 2021. We cannot assure you that we will be able to extend or renew our contract with Gulfport on favorable terms and conditions or at all. Likewise, we cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain replacement long-term contracts with other customers sufficient to continue providing the level of services that we currently provide to Gulfport. The termination of our relationship or nonrenewal of our contract with Gulfport, or one or more of our other customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe provide natural sand proppant to a limited number of customers, and the termination of one or more of these relationships could adversely affect our operations.\nWe provide natural sand proppant used for hydraulic fracturing. Historically, we have derived a large portion of our revenue from this business from Gulfport pursuant to a contract that expires in December 2021. The termination of our relationship or nonrenewal of our contract with Gulfport, or one or more of our other customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur failure to receive payment for contract change orders or adequately recover on claims brought by us against customers related to payment terms and costs could materially and adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have in the past brought, and may in the future bring, claims against our customers related to, among other things, the payment terms of our contracts and change orders relating to such contracts. These types of claims can occur due to, among other things, customer-caused delays or changes in project scope, both of which may result in additional costs. In some instances, these claims can be the subject of lengthy legal proceedings, and it is difficult to predict the timing and outcome of\nsuch proceedings. Our failure to promptly and adequately recover on these types of claims could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCompetition within the energy services industry may adversely affect our ability to market our services.\nThe energy services industry is highly competitive and fragmented and includes numerous small companies capable of competing effectively in our markets on a local basis, as well as large companies that possess substantially greater financial and other resources than we do. Our larger competitors\u2019 greater resources could allow those competitors to compete more effectively than we can. The amount of equipment available may exceed demand, which could result in active price competition. Many contracts are awarded on a bid basis, which may further increase competition based primarily on price. In addition, adverse market conditions lower demand for well servicing equipment, which results in excess equipment and lower utilization rates. If market conditions in our oil-oriented operating areas were to deteriorate or if adverse market conditions in our natural gas-oriented operating areas persist, utilization rates may decline.\nWe may not accurately estimate the costs associated with infrastructure services provided under fixed price contracts, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe derive a portion of our infrastructure services revenue from fixed-price master service and other service agreements. Under these contracts, we typically set the price of our services on a per unit or aggregate basis and assume the risk that costs associated with our performance may be greater than what we estimated. In addition to master service and other service agreements, we enter into contracts for specific projects or jobs that may require the installation or construction of an entire infrastructure system or specified units within an infrastructure system, which are priced on a per unit basis. Profitability will be reduced if actual costs to complete a project exceed our original estimates. Our profitability is dependent upon our ability to accurately estimate the costs associated with our services and our ability to execute in accordance with our plans. A variety of factors could negatively affect these costs, such as lower than anticipated productivity, conditions at work sites differing materially from those anticipated at the time we bid on the contract and higher than expected costs of materials and labor. These variations, along with other risks inherent in performing fixed price contracts, could cause actual project revenue and profits to differ from original estimates, which could result in lower margins than anticipated, or losses, which could reduce our profitability, cash flows and liquidity.\nWe may be unable to obtain sufficient bonding capacity to support certain service offerings, and the need for performance and surety bonds could reduce availability under our credit facility.\nSome of our infrastructure services contracts require performance and payment bonds. If we are not able to renew or obtain a sufficient level of bonding capacity in the future, we may be precluded from being able to bid for certain contracts or successfully contract with certain customers. In addition, even if we are able to successfully renew or obtain performance or payment bonds, we may be required to post letters of credit in connection with the bonds, which would reduce availability under our credit facility. Furthermore, under standard terms in the surety market, sureties issue bonds on a project-by-project basis and can decline to issue bonds at any time or require the posting of additional collateral as a condition to issuing or renewing any bonds. If we were to experience an interruption or reduction in the availability of bonding capacity as a result of these or any other reasons, we may be unable to compete for or work on projects that require bonding.\nThe nature of our infrastructure services business exposes us to potential liability for warranty claims and faulty engineering, which may reduce our profitability.\nUnder some of our infrastructure services contracts with customers, we provide a warranty for the services we provide, guaranteeing the work performed against defects in workmanship and material. As much of the work we perform is inspected by our customers for any defects in construction prior to acceptance of the project, we have not historically incurred warranty claims. Additionally, materials used in construction are often provided by the customer or are warranted against defects from the supplier. However, certain projects may have longer warranty periods and include facility performance warranties that may be broader than the warranties we generally provide. In these circumstances, if warranty claims occurred, it could require us to re-perform the services or to repair or replace the warranted item, at a cost to us, and could also result in other damages if we are not able to adequately satisfy our warranty obligations. In addition, we may be required under contractual arrangements with our customers to warrant any defects or failures in materials we provide that we purchase from third parties. While we generally require suppliers to provide us warranties that are consistent with those we provide to the customers, if any of these suppliers default on their warranty obligations to us, we may incur costs to repair or replace the defective materials for which we are not reimbursed. Costs incurred as a result of warranty claims could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur infrastructure services business involves professional judgments regarding the planning, design, development, construction, operations and management of electric power transmission and commercial construction. Because our projects are often technically complex, our failure to make judgments and recommendations in accordance with applicable professional standards, including engineering standards, could result in damages. While we do not generally accept liability for consequential damages, and although we have adopted a range of insurance, risk management and risk avoidance programs designed to reduce potential liabilities, a significantly adverse or catastrophic event at one of our project sites or completed projects resulting from the services we have performed could result in significant warranty, professional liability, or other claims against us as well as reputational harm, especially if public safety is impacted. These liabilities could exceed our insurance limits or could impact our ability to obtain insurance in the future. In addition, customers, subcontractors or suppliers who have agreed to indemnify us against any such liabilities or losses might refuse or be unable to pay us. An uninsured claim, either in part or in whole, if successful and of a material magnitude, could have a substantial impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe timing of new contracts and termination of existing contracts may result in unpredictable fluctuations in our cash flows and financial results.\nA substantial portion of our continental United States-based infrastructure services revenue is derived from project-based work that is awarded through a competitive bid process. It is generally very difficult to predict the timing and geographic distribution of the projects that we will be awarded. The selection of, timing of, or failure to obtain projects, delays in awards of projects, the re-bidding or termination of projects due to budget overruns, cancellations of projects or delays in completion of contracts could result in the under-utilization of our assets, which could lower our overall profitability and reduce our cash flows. Even if we are awarded contracts, we face additional risks that could affect whether, or when, work will begin. This can present difficulty in matching workforce size and equipment location with contract needs. In some cases, we may be required to bear the cost of a ready workforce and equipment that is larger than necessary, which could impact our cash flow, expenses and profitability. If an expected contract award or the related work release is delayed or not received, we could incur substantial costs without receipt of any corresponding revenues. Moreover, construction projects for which our services are contracted may require significant expenditures by us prior to receipt of relevant payments from the customer. Finally, the winding down or completion of work on significant projects that were active in previous periods will reduce our revenue and earnings if such significant projects have not been replaced in the current period.\nMany of our contracts may be canceled upon short notice, typically 30 to 90 days, even if we are not in default under the contract, and we may be unsuccessful in replacing our contracts if they are canceled or as they are completed or expire. We could experience a decrease in our revenue, net income and liquidity if contracts are canceled and if we are unable to replace canceled, completed or expired contracts. Certain of our infrastructure services customers assign work to us on a project-by-project basis under MSAs. Under these agreements, our customers often have no obligation to assign a specific amount of work to us. Our operations could decline significantly if the anticipated volume of work is not assigned to us or is canceled. Many of our contracts, including our MSAs, are opened to competitive bid at the expiration of their terms. There can be no assurance that we will be the successful bidder on our existing contracts that come up for re-bid.\nTiming of revenue for our infrastructure services backlog can be subject to change as a result of our delays, customer delays, regulatory delays or other factors. These changes could cause estimated revenue to be realized in periods later than originally expected, or not at all. As a result, our backlog as of any particular date is an uncertain indicator of future revenue and earnings.\nEstimated backlog for our infrastructure services represents the amount of revenue we expect to realize over the next 36 months from future work on uncompleted construction projects, including new contracts under which work has not begun. Our estimated backlog also includes amounts payable to us under master service and other service agreements, including demobilization costs in the case of Puerto Rico. Estimated infrastructure services backlog for work under master service and other service agreements is determined based on historical trends, experience from similar projects and estimates of customer demand based on communications with our customers. As of December 31, 2018, our infrastructure services backlog was $765 million, of which $625 million is attributable to operations in the continental United States and $140 million is attributable to operations in Puerto Rico. In 2019, we expect to realize approximately $200 million of our continental United States backlog and all $140 million of our Puerto Rico backlog for a total of $340 million.\nApproximately $691 million of our infrastructure services backlog as of December 31, 2018 is attributable to amounts under master service or other service agreements pursuant to which our customers are not contractually committed to purchase a minimum amount of services. Most of these agreements can be canceled on short or no advance notice. Timing of revenue for our infrastructure services backlog can be subject to change as a result of our delays, customer delays, regulatory delays or other factors. These changes could cause estimated revenue to be realized in periods later than originally expected, or not at all.\nWe occasionally experience postponements, cancellations and reductions in expected future work from master service agreements or other service agreements due to changes in our customers\u2019 spending plans, market volatility, governmental funding and regulatory factors. There can be no assurance as to our customers\u2019 requirements or the accuracy of our estimates. As a result, our backlog as of any particular date is an uncertain indicator of future revenue and earnings.\nBacklog is not a term recognized under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States; however, it is a common measurement used in the infrastructure industry. As such, our methodology for determining backlog is not comparable to the methodologies used by others.\nOpportunities associated with government contracts could lead to increased governmental regulation applicable to us.\nMost government contracts are awarded through a regulated competitive bidding process. If we were to be successful in being awarded government contracts, significant costs could be incurred by us before any revenues were realized from these contracts. Government agencies may review a contractor\u2019s performance, cost structure and compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards. If government agencies determine through these reviews that costs were improperly allocated to specific contracts, they will not reimburse the contractor for those costs or may require the contractor to refund previously reimbursed costs. If government agencies determine that we engaged in improper activity, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties. Government contracts are also subject to renegotiation of profit and termination by the government prior to the expiration of the term.\nDelays and reductions in government appropriations can negatively impact energy infrastructure construction, maintenance and repair projects and may impair the ability of our energy infrastructure customers to timely pay for products or services provided or result in their insolvency or bankruptcy, any of which exposes us to credit risk of our infrastructure customers.\nMany of our infrastructure customers derive funding from federal, state and local bodies. Delayed or reduced appropriations may cancel, curtail or delay projects and may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nA portion of our business depends on the oil and natural gas industry and particularly on the level of exploration and production activity within the United States and Canada, and the ongoing volatility in prices for oil and natural gas has had, and continues to have, an adverse effect on our revenue, cash flows, profitability and growth.\nDemand for our oil and natural gas products and services depends substantially on the level of expenditures by companies in the oil and natural gas industry. The significant decline in oil and natural gas prices during 2015 continued during the first part of 2016 before seeing a rebound during the second half of 2016. Oil prices began to stabilize during 2017 and increased during the first three quarters of 2018. However, during the fourth quarter of 2018, oil prices declined significantly. The low commodity price environment caused many of our customers to reduce spending on drilling, completion and other production activities. Although the prices for oil have increased from the lows experienced in the fourth quarter of 2018, industry conditions are dynamic and the continuation or a weakening of commodity prices from current levels may result in a material adverse impact on certain of our customers\u2019 liquidity and financial position resulting in spending reductions, delays in the collection of amounts owing to us and similar impacts. These conditions have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and it is difficult to predict how long the current commodity price environment will continue.\nMany factors over which we have no control affect the supply of and demand for, and our customers\u2019 willingness to explore, develop and produce oil and natural gas, and therefore, influence prices for our products and services, including:\n\u2022\nthe domestic and foreign supply of and demand for oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nthe level of prices, and expectations about future prices, of oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nthe level of global oil and natural gas exploration and production;\n\u2022\nthe cost of exploring for, developing, producing and delivering oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nthe expected decline rates of current production;\n\u2022\nthe price and quantity of foreign imports;\n\u2022\npolitical and economic conditions in oil producing countries, including the Middle East, Africa, South America and Russia;\n\u2022\nthe ability of members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls;\n\u2022\nspeculative trading in crude oil and natural gas derivative contracts;\n\u2022\nthe level of consumer product demand;\n\u2022\nthe discovery rates of new oil and natural gas reserves;\n\u2022\ncontractions in the credit market;\n\u2022\nthe strength or weakness of the U.S. dollar;\n\u2022\navailable pipeline and other transportation capacity;\n\u2022\nthe levels of oil and natural gas storage;\n\u2022\nweather conditions and other natural disasters;\n\u2022\npolitical instability in oil and natural gas producing countries;\n\u2022\ndomestic and foreign tax policy;\n\u2022\ndomestic and foreign governmental approvals and regulatory requirements and conditions;\n\u2022\nthe continued threat of terrorism and the impact of military and other action, including military action in the Middle East;\n\u2022\ntechnical advances affecting energy consumption;\n\u2022\nthe proximity and capacity of oil and natural gas pipelines and other transportation facilities;\n\u2022\nthe price and availability of alternative fuels;\n\u2022\nthe ability of oil and natural gas producers to raise equity capital and debt financing;\n\u2022\nmerger and divestiture activity among oil and natural gas producers; and\n\u2022\noverall domestic and global economic conditions.\nThese factors and the volatility of the energy markets make it extremely difficult to predict future oil and natural gas price movements with any certainty. Any of the above factors could impact the level of oil and natural gas exploration and production activity and could ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Further, future weakness in commodity prices could impact our business going forward, and we could encounter difficulties such as an inability to access needed capital on attractive terms or at all, recognizing asset impairment charges, an inability to meet financial ratios contained in our debt agreements, a need to reduce our capital spending and other similar impacts.\nThe cyclicality of the oil and natural gas industry may cause our operating results to fluctuate.\nWe derive a portion of our revenues from companies in the oil and natural gas exploration and production industry, a historically cyclical industry with levels of activity that are significantly affected by the levels and volatility of oil and natural gas prices. We have, and may in the future, experience significant fluctuations in operating results as a result of the reactions of our customers to changes in oil and natural gas prices. For example, prolonged low commodity prices experienced by the oil and natural gas industry during 2015 and the first part of 2016 and again in the fourth quarter of 2018, combined with adverse changes in the capital and credit markets, caused many exploration and production companies to reduce their capital budgets and drilling activity. This resulted in a significant decline in demand for oilfield services and adversely impacted the prices oilfield services companies could charge for their services. In addition, a majority of the service revenue we earn is based upon a charge for a relatively short period of time (e.g., an hour, a day, a week) for the actual period of time the service is provided to our customers. By contracting services on a short-term basis, we are exposed to the risks of a rapid reduction in market prices and utilization, with resulting volatility in our revenues.\nIf oil prices or natural gas prices decline, the demand for our oil and natural gas services could be adversely affected.\nThe demand for our oil and natural gas services is primarily determined by current and anticipated oil and natural gas prices and the related general production spending and level of drilling activity in the areas in which we have operations. Volatility or weakness in oil prices or natural gas prices (or the perception that oil prices or natural gas prices will decrease) affects the spending patterns of our customers and may result in the drilling of fewer new wells or lower production spending on existing wells. This, in turn, could result in lower demand for our services and may cause lower rates and lower utilization of our well service equipment.\nAny future decline in oil and gas prices could materially affect the demand for our services. Prices for oil and natural gas historically have been extremely volatile and are expected to continue to be volatile in the years to come. During 2018, West Texas Intermediate posted prices ranged from $42.53 to $76.41 per barrel and the New York Mercantile Exchange natural gas futures prices ranged from $2.55 to $4.84 per MMBtu. If the prices of oil and natural gas decline from current levels, our operations, financial condition and level of expenditures may be materially and adversely affected.\nDeterioration of the commodity price environment can negatively impact oil and natural gas exploration and production companies and, in some cases, impair their ability to timely pay for products or services provided or result in their insolvency or bankruptcy, any of which exposes us to credit risk of our oil and natural gas exploration and production customers.\nIn weak economic and commodity price environments, we may experience increased difficulties, delays or failures in collecting outstanding receivables from our customers, due to, among other reasons, a reduction in their cash flow from operations, their inability to access the credit markets and, in certain cases, their insolvencies. Such increases in collection issues could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. We cannot assure you that the reserves we have established for potential credit losses will be sufficient to meet write-offs of uncollectible receivables or that our losses from such receivables will be consistent with our expectations. To the extent one or more of our key customers commences bankruptcy proceedings, our contracts with these customers may be subject to rejection under applicable provisions of the United States Bankruptcy Code, or may be renegotiated. Further, during any such bankruptcy proceeding, prior to assumption, rejection or renegotiation of such contracts, the bankruptcy court may temporarily authorize the payment of value for our services less than contractually required, which could also have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nShortages, delays in delivery and interruptions in supply of drill pipe, replacement parts, other equipment, supplies and materials may adversely affect our contract land and directional drilling business or our pressure pumping business.\nDuring periods of increased demand for drilling and completion services, the industry has experienced shortages of drill pipe, replacement parts, other equipment, supplies and materials, including, in the case of our pressure pumping operations, replacement parts, other equipment, proppants, acid, gel and water. These shortages can cause the price of these items to increase significantly and require that orders for the items be placed well in advance of expected use. In addition, any interruption in supply could result in significant delays in delivery of equipment and materials or prevent operations. Interruptions may be caused by, among other reasons:\n\u2022\nweather issues, whether short-term such as a hurricane, or long-term such as a drought; and\n\u2022\nshortage in the number of vendors able or willing to provide the necessary equipment, supplies and materials, including as a result of commitments of vendors to other customers or third parties.\nThese price increases, delays in delivery and interruptions in supply may require us to increase capital and repair expenditures and incur higher operating costs. Severe shortages, delays in delivery and interruptions in supply could limit our ability to construct and operate our drilling rigs or pressure pumping fleets and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nOilfield services equipment, refurbishment and new asset construction projects, as well as the reactivation of oilfield service assets that have been idle for six months or longer, are subject to risks which could cause delays or cost overruns and adversely affect our business, cash flows, results of operations and financial position.\nOilfield services equipment or assets being upgraded, converted or re-activated following a period of inactivity may experience start-up complications and may encounter other operational problems that could result in significant delays, uncompensated downtime, reduced dayrates or the cancellation, termination or non-renewal of contracts. Construction and upgrade projects are subject to risks of delay or significant cost overruns inherent in any large construction project from numerous factors, including the following:\n\u2022\nshortages of equipment, materials or skilled labor;\n\u2022\nunscheduled delays in the delivery of ordered materials and equipment or shipyard construction;\n\u2022\nfailure of equipment to meet quality and/or performance standards;\n\u2022\nfinancial or operating difficulties of equipment vendors;\n\u2022\nunanticipated actual or purported change orders;\n\u2022\ninability by us or our customers to obtain required permits or approvals, or to meet applicable regulatory standards in our areas of operations;\n\u2022\nunanticipated cost increases between order and delivery;\n\u2022\nadverse weather conditions and other events of force majeure;\n\u2022\ndesign or engineering changes; and\n\u2022\nwork stoppages and other labor disputes.\nThe occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, results of operations and financial position.\nAdvancements in oilfield service technologies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe oilfield services industry is characterized by rapid and significant technological advancements and introductions of new products and services using new technologies. As new horizontal and directional drilling, pressure pumping, pressure control and well service technologies develop, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage, and competitive pressure may force us to implement new technologies at a substantial cost. We may not be able to successfully acquire or use new technologies. Further, our customers are increasingly demanding the services of newer, higher specification drilling rigs. There can be no assurance that we will:\n\u2022\nhave sufficient capital resources to build new, technologically advanced equipment and other assets;\n\u2022\nsuccessfully integrate additional oilfield service equipment and other assets;\n\u2022\neffectively manage the growth and increased size of our organization, equipment and other assets;\n\u2022\nsuccessfully deploy idle, stacked or additional oilfield service assets;\n\u2022\nmaintain crews necessary to operate additional drilling rigs or pressure pumping service equipment; or\n\u2022\nsuccessfully improve our financial condition, results of operations, business or prospects.\nIf we are not successful in building or acquiring new oilfield service equipment and other assets or upgrading our existing rigs and equipment in a timely and cost-effective manner, we could lose market share. New technologies, services or standards could render some of our services, equipment and other assets obsolete, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business depends upon our ability to obtain specialized equipment and parts from third-party suppliers, and we may be vulnerable to delayed deliveries and future price increases.\nWe purchase specialized equipment and parts from third party suppliers. At times during the business cycle, there is a high demand for hydraulic fracturing, coiled tubing and other oilfield services and extended lead times to obtain equipment needed to provide these services. Further, there are a limited number of suppliers that manufacture the equipment we use. Should our current suppliers be unable or unwilling to provide the necessary equipment and parts or otherwise fail to deliver the products timely and in the quantities required, any resulting delays in the provision of our services could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, future price increases for this type of equipment and parts could negatively impact our ability to purchase new equipment to update or expand our existing fleet or to timely repair equipment in our existing fleet.\nAn increase in the prices of certain materials used in our businesses could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows.\nWe are exposed to market risk of increases in certain commodity prices of materials, such as copper and steel, which are used as components of supplies or materials utilized in some of our infrastructure and pressure pumping businesses. An increase in these materials could increase our operating costs, limit our ability to service our customers\u2019 needs or otherwise materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows.\nInaccuracies in estimates of volumes and qualities of our sand reserves could result in lower than expected sales and higher than expected production costs.\nOn May 26, 2017, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Chieftain Sand and Proppant, LLC and Chieftain Sand and Proppant Barron, LLC, unrelated third party sellers, which we collectively refer to as Chieftain, following our successful bid in a bankruptcy court auction, which assets include a wet and dry plant and sand mine located on approximately 608 acres in New Auburn, Wisconsin. Also, on June 5, 2017, we acquired from Gulfport, certain affiliates of Wexford Capital LP, which we refer to as Wexford, and Rhino Exploration LLC, which we refer to as Rhino, all outstanding membership interests in Sturgeon Acquisitions LLC, which owns Taylor Frac, LLC, Taylor Real Estate Investments, LLC and South River Road, LLC (collectively referred to as Taylor Frac). These acquisitions added sand reserves to our operations and increased our production capacity.\nEstimates of our sand reserves are by nature imprecise and depend to some extent on statistical inferences drawn from available data, which may prove unreliable. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and qualities of sand reserves and costs to mine recoverable reserves, including many factors beyond our control. Estimates of economically recoverable sand reserves necessarily depend on a number of factors and assumptions, all of which may vary considerably from actual results, such as:\n\u2022\ngeological and mining conditions and/or effects from prior mining that may not be fully identified by available data or that may differ from experience;\n\u2022\nassumptions concerning future prices of frac sand, operating costs, mining technology improvements, development costs and reclamation costs; and\n\u2022\nassumptions concerning future effects of regulation, including the issuance of required permits and taxes by governmental agencies.\nAny inaccuracy in the estimates related to our sand reserves could result in lower than expected sales and higher than expected costs. For example, these estimates assume that our revenue and cost structure will remain relatively constant over the life of our reserves. If these assumptions prove to be inaccurate, some or all of our reserves may not be economically mineable, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, our current customer contracts require us to deliver frac sand that meets certain specifications. If the estimates of the quality of our sand reserves, including the volumes of the various specifications of those reserves, prove to be inaccurate, we may incur significantly higher excavation costs without corresponding increases in revenues, we may not be able to meet our contractual obligations, or our facilities may have a shorter than expected reserve life, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAs part of our natural sand proppant services business, we rely on third parties for raw materials and transportation, and the suspension or termination of our relationship with one or more of these third parties could adversely affect our business, financial conditions, results of operations and cash flows.\nAs part of our natural sand proppant services business, we mine and process sand into premium monocrystalline sand, a specialized mineral that is used as a proppant (also known as frac sand) at our Barron County and Jackson County, Wisconsin plants. We also buy processed sand from suppliers on the spot market. In addition, we also buy raw or washed sand and process it at our indoor sand processing plant located in Pierce County, Wisconsin. We sell natural sand proppant to our customers for use in their hydraulic fracturing operations to enhance the recovery rates of hydrocarbons from oil and natural gas wells. We also provide logistics solutions to deliver our frac sand products to our customers. Because our customers generally find it impractical to store frac sand in large quantities near their job sites, they seek to arrange for product to be delivered where and as needed, which requires predictable and efficient loading and shipping of product. To facilitate our logistics and transload facility capabilities, we contract with third party providers to transport our frac sand products to railroad facilities for delivery to our customers. We also lease a railcar fleet from various third parties to deliver our frac sand products to our customers and lease or otherwise utilize origin and destination transloading facilities. The suspension, termination or nonrenewal of our relationship with any one or more of these third parties involved in the sourcing, transportation and delivery of our frac sand products could result in material operational delays, increase our operating costs, limit our ability to service our customers\u2019 wells or otherwise materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFuture performance of our natural sand proppant services business will depend on our ability to succeed in competitive markets, and on our ability to appropriately react to potential fluctuations in the demand for and supply of frac sand.\nIn our natural sand proppant services business, we operate in a highly competitive market that is characterized by a small number of large, national producers and a larger number of small, regional or local producers. Competition in the industry is based on price, consistency and quality of product, site location, distribution and logistics capabilities, customer service, reliability of supply and breadth of product offering. The large, national producers with whom we compete include Badger Mining Corporation, Covia Holdings Corporation, Hi-Crush Partners LP, Preferred Proppants LLC, Smart Sand, Inc., Emerge Energy Services LP and U.S. Silica Holdings Inc. Our larger competitors may have greater financial and other resources than we do, may develop technology superior to ours, may have production facilities that are located closer to sand mines from which raw sand is mined or to their key customers than our facilities or have a more cost effective access to raw sand and transportation facilities than we do. Should the demand for hydraulic fracturing services decrease, prices in the frac sand market could materially decrease as producers may seek to preserve market share or exit the market and sell frac sand at below market prices. In addition, oil and natural gas exploration and production companies and other providers of hydraulic fracturing services could acquire their own frac sand reserves, develop or expand frac sand production capacity or otherwise fulfill their own proppant requirements and existing or new frac sand producers could add to or expand their frac sand production capacity, which may negatively impact pricing and demand for our frac sand. We may not be able to compete successfully against either our larger or smaller competitors in the future, and competition could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nDemand for our frac sand products could be reduced by changes in well stimulation processes and technologies, as well as changes in governmental regulations and other applicable law.\nAs part of our natural sand proppant services business, we mine, process and sell frac sand products to our customers for use in their hydraulic fracturing operations to enhance the recovery rates of hydrocarbons from oil and natural gas wells. A significant shift in demand from frac sand to other proppants, or the development of new processes to replace hydraulic fracturing altogether, could cause a decline in the demand for the frac sand we produce and result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Further, federal and state governments and agencies have adopted various laws and regulations or are evaluating proposed legislation and regulations that are focused on the extraction of shale gas or oil using hydraulic fracturing, a process which utilizes proppants such as those that we produce. Future hydraulic fracturing-related legislation or regulations could restrict the ability of our customers to utilize, or increase the cost associated with, hydraulic fracturing, which could reduce demand for our proppants and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. For additional information regarding the regulation of hydraulic fracturing, see \u201c-Risks Related to Our Business and the Oil and Natural Gas Industry-Federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays.\u201d\nAn increase in the supply of raw frac sand having similar characteristics as the raw frac sand we produce and sell could make it more difficult for us to market our sand on favorable terms or at all.\nFrom time to time we have entered into take-or-pay contracts with our principal raw frac sand supplier for our Pierce County, Wisconsin plant. If significant new reserves of raw frac sand continue to be discovered and developed, and those frac sands have similar characteristics to the frac sand we produce and sell, the market price for our frac sand may decline. If the market price for our frac sand falls below an amount equal to the contracted purchase price in our take-or-pay contract plus our processing and related transportation costs, this could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows over the remaining term of this contract.\nWe face distribution and logistics challenges in our business.\nIn response to various factors, including fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices, our customers may shift their focus among resource plays, some of which can be located in geographic areas that do not have well-developed transportation and distribution infrastructure systems. Some geographic areas, including the areas in which our sand facilities are located, have limited access to railroads. Any interruption or delay in the railroad access or service may affect our ability to ship and/or the timing of shipment of our frac sand to our customers, which may adversely affect our revenues or result in increased costs, and thus could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. Serving our customers in these less-developed areas presents distribution and other operational challenges that may affect our sales and could negatively impact our operating costs. Labor disputes, system constraints, derailments, adverse weather conditions or other environmental events, an increasingly tight railcar leasing market and changes to rail freight systems, among other factors, could interrupt or limit available transportation services, could affect our ability to timely and cost-effectively deliver our frac sand to our customers and could provide a competitive advantage to our competitors located in closer proximity to our customers. Failure to find long-term solutions to these logistics challenges could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIncreasing transportation and related costs could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nBecause of the relatively low cost of producing frac sand, transportation expenses and related costs, including freight charges, fuel surcharges, transloading fees, switching fees, railcar lease costs, demurrage costs and storage fees, comprise a significant component of the total delivered cost of frac sand sales. The relatively high transportation expenses and related costs tend to favor frac sand producers located in close proximity to their customers. As we expand our frac sand production, our need for additional transportation services and transload network access increases. We contract with truck and rail services to move frac sand from our production facilities to transload sites and our customers, and increased costs under these contracts could adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, we bear the risk of non-delivery under our contracts. A significant increase in transportation service rates, a reduction in the dependability or availability of transportation or transload services, or relocation of our customers\u2019 businesses to areas farther from our plants or transloading facilities could impair our ability to deliver our products economically to our customers and our ability to expand into different markets.\nDiminished access to water and inability to secure or maintain necessary permits may adversely affect operations of our frac sand processing plants.\nThe processing of raw sand and production of natural sand proppant require significant amounts of water. As a result, securing water rights and water access is necessary to operate our processing facilities. If the areas where our facilities are located experience water shortages, restrictions or any other constraints due to drought, contamination or otherwise, there may be additional costs associated with securing water access. Although we have obtained water rights to service our activities when we are operating our processing plants, the amount of water that we are entitled to use pursuant to our water rights must be determined by the appropriate regulatory authorities. Such regulatory authorities may amend the regulations regarding such water rights, increase the cost of maintaining such water rights or eliminate our current water rights, and we may be unable to retain all or a portion of such water rights. If implemented, these new regulations could also affect local municipalities and other industrial operations and could have a material adverse effect on costs involved in operating our processing plant. Such changes in laws, regulations or government policy and related interpretations pertaining to water rights may alter the environment in which we do business, which may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, a water discharge permit may be required to properly dispose of water at our processing sites when in operation. Certain of our facilities are also required to obtain storm water permits. The water discharge, storm water or any other permits we may be required to have in order to conduct our frac sand processing operations is subject to regulatory discretion, and any inability to obtain or maintain the necessary permits could have an adverse effect on our ability to run such operations.\nSimilar to our natural sand proppant services, certain of our completion and production services, particularly our hydraulic fracturing services, are substantially dependent on the availability of water. Restrictions on our ability, or our customers\u2019 ability, to obtain water may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWater is an essential component of deep shale oil and natural gas production during both the drilling and hydraulic fracturing processes. In recent years, certain areas in which we operate have experienced drought conditions and competition for water in such areas is growing. As a result, some local water districts have begun restricting the use of water subject to their jurisdiction for hydraulic fracturing to protect local water supply. Our inability, or customers\u2019 inability, to obtain water to use in our operations from local sources or to effectively utilize flowback water could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe customized nature, and remote location, of the modular camps that we provide and service present unique challenges that could adversely affect our ability to successfully operate our remote accommodations business.\nWe rely on a third-party subcontractor to manufacture and install the customized modular units used in our remote accommodations business. These customized units often take a considerable amount of time to manufacture and, once manufactured, often need to be delivered to remote areas that are frequently difficult to access by traditional means of transportation. In the event we are unable to provide these modular units in a timely fashion, we may not be entitled to full, or any, payment therefor under the terms of our contracts with customers. In addition, the remote location of the modular camps often makes it difficult to install and maintain the units, and our failure, on a timely basis, to have such units installed and provide maintenance services could result in our breach of, and non-payment by our customers under, the terms of our customer contracts. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our remote accommodation business and our overall financial condition and results of operations.\nHealth and food safety issues and food-borne illness concerns could adversely affect our remote accommodations business.\nWe provide food services to our customers as part of our remote accommodations business and, as a result, face health and food safety issues that are common in the food and hospitality industries. Food-borne illnesses, such as E. coli, hepatitis A, trichinosis or salmonella, and food safety issues have occurred in the food industry in the past and could occur in the future. Our reliance on third-party food suppliers and distributors increases the risk that food-borne illness incidents could be caused by factors outside of our control. New illnesses resistant to any precautions may develop in the future, or diseases with long incubation periods could arise. Further, the remote nature of our accommodation facilities and related food services may increase the risk of contamination of our food supply and create additional health and hygiene concerns due to the limited access to modern amenities and conveniences that may not be faced by other food service providers or hospitality businesses operating in an urban environment. If our customers become ill from food-borne illness, we could be forced to close some or all of our remote accommodation facilities on a temporary basis or otherwise. Any such incidents and/or any report of publicity linking us to incidents of food-borne illness or other food safety issues, including food tampering or contamination, could adversely affect our remote accommodations business as well as our overall financial condition and results of operations.\nDevelopment of permanent infrastructure in the Canadian oil sands region or other locations where we locate our remote accommodations could negatively impact our remote accommodations business.\nOur remote accommodations business specializes in providing modular housing and related services for work forces in remote areas which lack the infrastructure typically available in towns and cities. If permanent towns, cities and municipal infrastructure develop in the oil sands region of northern Alberta, Canada or other regions where we locate our modular camps, then demand for our accommodations could decrease as customer employees move to the region and choose to utilize permanent housing and food services.\nRevenue generated and expenses incurred by our remote accommodation business are denominated in the Canadian dollar and could be negatively impacted by currency fluctuations.\nOur remote accommodation business generates revenue and incurs expenses that are denominated in the Canadian dollar. These transactions could be materially affected by currency fluctuations. Changes in currency exchange rates could adversely affect our combined results of operations or financial position. We also maintain cash balances denominated in the Canadian dollar. At December 31, 2018, we had $2 million of cash in Canadian dollars, in Canadian accounts. A 10% increase in the strength of the Canadian dollar versus the U.S. dollar would have resulted in a decrease in pre-tax income of approximately $0.2 million as of December 31, 2018. Conversely, a corresponding decrease in the strength of the Canadian dollar would have resulted in a comparable increase in pre-tax income. We have not hedged our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and, as a result, could incur unanticipated translation gains and losses.\nOur business is difficult to evaluate because we have a limited operating history.\nMammoth Energy Services, Inc. was formed in June 2016, and did not conduct any material business operations prior to its initial public offering, or the IPO, which closed on October 19, 2016. Prior to the IPO, Mammoth Energy Services, Inc. was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mammoth Energy Partners LP, referred to as Mammoth Partners, which was originally formed in February 2014. Except as expressly noted otherwise, the historical financial information of Mammoth Energy Services, Inc. and operational data for the periods prior to October 12, 2016 is that of Mammoth Partners and its consolidated subsidiaries. These subsidiaries were formed or acquired between 2007 and 2016. As a result, there is only limited historical financial and operating information available upon which to base your evaluation of our performance.\nWe rely on a few key employees whose absence or loss could adversely affect our business.\nMany key responsibilities within our business have been assigned to a small number of employees. The loss of their services could adversely affect our business. In particular, the loss of the services of our Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer could disrupt our operations. We do not have any written employment agreement with our executives at this time. Further, we do not maintain \u201ckey person\u201d life insurance policies on any of our employees. As a result, we are not insured against any losses resulting from the death of our key employees.\nIf we are unable to employ a sufficient number of skilled and qualified workers, our capacity and profitability could be diminished and our growth potential could be impaired.\nThe delivery of our products and services requires skilled and qualified workers with specialized skills and experience who can perform physically demanding work. As a result of the volatility of the energy services industry and the demanding nature of the work, workers may choose to pursue employment in fields that offer a more desirable work environment at wage rates that are competitive. Our ability to be productive and profitable will depend upon our ability to employ and retain skilled workers. In addition, our ability to expand our operations depends in part on our ability to increase the size of our skilled labor force. The demand for skilled workers is high, and the supply is limited. As a result, competition for experienced energy service personnel is intense, and we face significant challenges in competing for crews and management with large and well established competitors. A significant increase in the wages paid by competing employers could result in a reduction of our skilled labor force, increases in the wage rates that we must pay, or both. If either of these events were to occur, our capacity and profitability could be diminished and our growth potential could be impaired.\nUnionization efforts could increase our costs or limit our flexibility.\nPresently, none of our employees work under collective bargaining agreements. Unionization efforts have been made from time to time within our industries, to varying degrees of success. Any such unionization could increase our costs or limit our flexibility.\nOur operations may be limited or disrupted in certain parts of the continental U.S., Puerto Rico and Canada during severe weather conditions, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe provide pressure pumping and well services and contract land and directional drilling services in the Utica, SCOOP, STACK, Permian Basin, Marcellus, Granite Wash, Cana Woodford and Eagle Ford resource plays located in the continental U.S. We provide infrastructure services in the northeast, southwest and midwest portions of the United States and Puerto Rico. We provide remote accommodation services in the oil sands in Alberta, Canada. We serve these markets through our facilities and service centers located in Ohio, Oklahoma, Texas, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Kentucky, Puerto Rico and Alberta, Canada. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we generated approximately 17% and 42%, respectively, of our revenue from our operations in Ohio, Wisconsin, Minnesota, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Canada where weather conditions may be severe, particularly during winter and spring months. Repercussions of severe weather conditions may include:\n\u2022\ncurtailment of services;\n\u2022\nweather-related damage to equipment resulting in suspension of operations;\n\u2022\nweather-related damage to our facilities;\n\u2022\ninability to deliver equipment and materials to jobsites in accordance with contract schedules; and\n\u2022\nloss of productivity.\nMany municipalities, including those in Ohio and Wisconsin, impose bans or other restrictions on the use of roads and highways, which include weight restrictions on the paved roads that lead to our jobsites due to the muddy conditions caused by spring thaws. This can limit our access to these jobsites and our ability to service wells in these areas. These constraints and the resulting shortages or high costs could delay our operations and materially increase our operating and capital costs in those regions. Weather conditions may also affect the price of crude oil and natural gas, and related demand for our services. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nConcerns over general economic, business or industry conditions may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nConcerns over global economic conditions, energy costs, geopolitical issues, inflation, the availability and cost of credit and the European, Asian and the United States financial markets have contributed to economic uncertainty and diminished expectations for the global economy. These factors, combined with volatility in commodity prices, business and consumer confidence and unemployment rates, have in the past precipitated and may in the future precipitate an economic slowdown. Concerns about global economic growth may have a significant adverse impact on global financial markets and commodity prices. If the economic climate in the United States or abroad deteriorates, worldwide demand for petroleum products could diminish, which could impact the price at which oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids can be sold, which could affect the ability of our customers to continue operations and ultimately adversely impact our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nA terrorist attack or armed conflict could harm our business.\nThe occurrence or threat of terrorist attacks in the United States or other countries, anti-terrorist efforts and other armed conflicts involving the United States or other countries, including continued hostilities in the Middle East, may adversely affect the United States and global economies and could prevent us from meeting our financial and other obligations. If any of these events occur, the resulting political instability and societal disruption could reduce overall demand for oil and natural gas, potentially putting downward pressure on demand for our services and causing a reduction in our revenues. Oil and natural gas related facilities could be direct targets of terrorist attacks, and our operations could be adversely impacted if infrastructure integral to our customers\u2019 operations is destroyed or damaged. Costs for insurance and other security may increase as a result of these threats, and some insurance coverage may become more difficult to obtain, if available at all.\nOur operations require substantial capital and we may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms or at all, which could limit our ability to grow.\nOur capital budget for 2019 is estimated to be $80 million. Since November 2014, we have funded our capital expenditures primarily with cash on hand, cash proceeds from our initial public offering, cash generated by operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility (other than our acquisitions in June 2017, which we completed with the issuance of shares of our common stock). We may be unable to generate sufficient cash from operations and other capital resources to maintain planned or future levels of capital expenditures which, among other things, may prevent us from acquiring new equipment or properly maintaining our existing equipment. Further, any disruptions or continuing volatility in the global\nfinancial markets may lead to an increase in interest rates or a contraction in credit availability impacting our ability to finance our operations. This could put us at a competitive disadvantage or interfere with our growth plans. Further, our actual capital expenditures for 2019 or future years could exceed our capital expenditure budget. In the event our capital expenditure requirements at any time are greater than the amount we have available, we could be required to seek additional sources of capital, which may include debt financing, joint venture partnerships, sales of assets, offerings of debt or equity securities or other means. We may not be able to obtain any such alternative source of capital. We may be required to curtail or eliminate contemplated activities. If we can obtain alternative sources of capital, the terms of such alternative may not be favorable to us. In particular, the terms of any debt financing may include covenants that significantly restrict our operations. Our inability to grow as planned may reduce our chances of maintaining and improving profitability.\nThe growth of our business through acquisitions may expose us to various risks, including those relating to difficulties in identifying suitable, accretive acquisition opportunities and integrating businesses, assets and personnel, as well as difficulties in obtaining financing for targeted acquisitions and the potential for increased leverage or debt service requirements.\nAs a component of our business strategy, we have pursued and intend to continue to pursue selected, accretive acquisitions of complementary assets, businesses and technologies. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including:\n\u2022\nunanticipated costs and assumption of liabilities and exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired businesses, including but not limited to environmental liabilities;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in integrating the operations and assets of the acquired business and the acquired personnel;\n\u2022\nlimitations on our ability to properly assess and maintain an effective internal control environment over an acquired business, in order to comply with public reporting requirements;\n\u2022\npotential losses of key employees and customers of the acquired businesses;\n\u2022\ninability to commercially develop acquired technologies;\n\u2022\nrisks of entering markets in which we have limited prior experience; and\n\u2022\nincreases in our expenses and working capital requirements.\nThe process of integrating an acquired business may involve unforeseen costs and delays or other operational, technical and financial difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of management attention and financial and other resources. Our failure to achieve consolidation savings, to incorporate the acquired businesses and assets into our existing operations successfully or to minimize any unforeseen operational difficulties could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, there is intense competition for acquisition opportunities in our industries. Competition for acquisitions may increase the cost of, or cause us to refrain from, completing acquisitions. In addition, we may not have sufficient capital resources to complete additional acquisitions. Historically, we have financed capital expenditures primarily with funding from our initial public offering, cash generated by operations, borrowings under our revolving credit facility and funding from our equity investors. We may incur substantial indebtedness to finance future acquisitions and also may issue equity, debt or convertible securities in connection with such acquisitions. Debt service requirements could represent a significant burden on our results of operations and financial condition and the issuance of additional equity or convertible securities could be dilutive to our existing stockholders. Furthermore, we may not be able to obtain additional financing on satisfactory terms. Even if we have access to the necessary capital, we may be unable to continue to identify additional suitable acquisition opportunities, negotiate acceptable terms or successfully acquire identified targets. Our ability to grow through acquisitions and manage growth will require us to continue to invest in operational, financial and management information systems and to attract, retain, motivate and effectively manage our employees. The inability to effectively manage the integration of acquisitions could reduce our focus on subsequent acquisitions and current operations, which, in turn, could negatively impact our earnings and growth. Our financial position and results of operations may fluctuate significantly from period to period, based on whether or not significant acquisitions are completed in particular periods.\nWe may have difficulty managing growth in our business, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nAs a recently formed company, growth in accordance with our business plan, if achieved, could place a significant strain on our financial, technical, operational and management resources. As we expand the scope of our activities, lines of our businesses and our geographic coverage through both organic growth and acquisitions, there will be additional demands on our financial, technical, operational and management resources. The failure to continue to upgrade our technical, administrative, operating and financial control systems or the occurrences of unexpected expansion difficulties, including the failure to recruit and retain experienced managers, engineers and other professionals in the energy services industry, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and our ability to successfully or timely execute our business plan.\nIf our intended expansion of our business is not successful, our financial condition, profitability and results of operations could be adversely affected, and we may not achieve increases in revenue and profitability that we hope to realize.\nA key element of our business strategy involves the expansion of our services, geographic presence and customer base. These aspects of our strategy are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including:\n\u2022\nan inability to retain or hire experienced crews and other personnel;\n\u2022\na lack of customer demand for the services we intend to provide;\n\u2022\nan inability to secure necessary equipment, raw materials (particularly sand and other proppants) or technology to successfully execute our expansion plans;\n\u2022\nshortages of water used in our sand processing operations and our hydraulic fracturing operations;\n\u2022\nunanticipated delays that could limit or defer the provision of services by us and jeopardize our relationships with existing customers and adversely affect our ability to obtain new customers for such services; and\n\u2022\ncompetition from new and existing services providers.\nEncountering any of these or any unforeseen problems in implementing our planned expansion could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and could prevent us from achieving the increases in revenues and profitability that we hope to realize.\nOur liquidity needs could restrict our operations and make us more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions.\nOur future indebtedness, whether incurred in connection with acquisitions, operations or otherwise, may adversely affect our operations and limit our growth, and we may have difficulty making debt service payments on such indebtedness as payments become due. Our level of indebtedness may affect our operations in several ways, including the following:\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nthe covenants that are contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness could limit our ability to borrow funds, dispose of assets, pay dividends and make certain investments;\n\u2022\nour debt covenants could also affect our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in the economy and in our industries;\n\u2022\nany failure to comply with the financial or other covenants of our debt, including covenants that impose requirements to maintain certain financial ratios, could result in an event of default, which could result in some or all of our indebtedness becoming immediately due and payable;\n\u2022\nour level of debt could impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate purposes; and\n\u2022\nour business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to enable us to meet our obligations under our indebtedness.\nOur revolving credit facility imposes, and any of our future credit facilities may impose, restrictions on us that may affect our ability to successfully operate our business.\nOur revolving credit facility limits, and any of our future credit facilities may limit, our ability to take various actions, such as:\n\u2022\nincurring additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\npaying dividends;\n\u2022\ncreating certain additional liens on our assets;\n\u2022\nentering into sale and leaseback transactions;\n\u2022\nmaking investments;\n\u2022\nentering into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nmaking material changes to the type of business we conduct or our business structure;\n\u2022\nmaking guarantees;\n\u2022\nentering into hedges;\n\u2022\ndisposing of assets in excess of certain permitted amounts;\n\u2022\nmerging or consolidating with other entities; and\n\u2022\nselling all or substantially all of our assets.\nIn addition, our revolving credit facility requires, and any future debt may require, us to maintain certain financial ratios and to satisfy certain financial conditions, which may require us to reduce our debt or take some other action in order to comply with each of them. These restrictions could also limit our ability to obtain future financings, make needed capital expenditures, withstand a downturn in our business or the economy in general, or otherwise conduct necessary corporate activities. We also may be prevented from taking advantage of business opportunities that arise because of the limitations imposed on us by the restrictive covenants under our revolving credit facility and any future debt agreements. If we fail to comply with the covenants in our existing revolving credit facility or any future debt agreements and such failure is not waived by the lender, a default may be declared by the lenders, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur revolving credit facility provides, and any future credit facilities may provide, for variable interest rates, which may increase or decrease our interest expense.\nAt December 31, 2018, we had no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility and availability under our credit facility was approximately $176 million, after giving effect to $8 million of outstanding letters of credit. As of July 31, 2018, the last day on which we had material outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility, a 1% increase or decrease in the interest rate at that time would have increased or decreased our interest expense by approximately $0.1 million per year, based on $6 million outstanding and a weighted average interest rate of 6.5%. We do not currently hedge our interest rate exposure.\nWe may not be able to provide services that meet the specific needs of oil and natural gas exploration and production companies or utilities at competitive prices.\nThe markets in which we operate are generally highly competitive and have relatively few barriers to entry. The principal competitive factors in our markets are price, product and service quality and availability, responsiveness, experience, technology, equipment quality and reputation for safety. We compete with large national and multi-national companies that have longer operating histories, greater financial, technical and other resources and greater name recognition than we do. Several of our competitors provide a broader array of services and have a stronger presence in more geographic markets. In addition, we compete with several smaller companies capable of competing effectively on a regional or local basis. Our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and services and changes in customer requirements. Some contracts are awarded on a bid basis, which further increases competition based on price. Pricing is often the primary factor in determining which qualified contractor is awarded a job. The competitive environment may be further intensified by mergers and acquisitions among oil and natural gas or utility companies or other events that have the effect of reducing the number of available customers. As a result of competition, we may lose market share or be unable to maintain or increase prices for our present services or to acquire additional business opportunities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, some exploration and production companies have begun performing hydraulic fracturing and directional drilling on their wells using their own equipment and personnel. Any increase in the development and utilization of in-house fracturing and directional drilling capabilities by our customers could decrease the demand for our oil and natural gas services and have a material adverse impact on our business.\nOur operations are subject to hazards inherent in the oil and natural gas and energy infrastructure industries, which could expose us to substantial liability and cause us to lose customers and substantial revenue.\nOur operations include hazards inherent in the oil and natural gas and energy infrastructure industries, such as equipment defects, vehicle accidents, fires, explosions, blowouts, surface cratering, uncontrollable flows of gas or well fluids, pipe or pipeline failures, abnormally pressured formations and various environmental hazards such as oil spills and releases of, and exposure to, hazardous substances. For example, our operations are subject to risks associated with hydraulic fracturing, including any mishandling, surface spillage or potential underground migration of fracturing fluids, including chemical additives. The occurrence of any of these events could result in substantial losses to us due to injury or loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property, natural resources and equipment, pollution or other environmental damage, clean-up responsibilities, regulatory investigations and penalties, suspension of operations and repairs required to resume operations. The cost of managing such risks may be significant. The frequency and severity of such incidents will affect operating costs, insurability and relationships with customers, employees and regulators. In particular, our customers may elect not to purchase our services if they view our environmental or safety record as unacceptable, which could cause us to lose customers and substantial revenues. In addition, these risks may be greater for us than some of our competitors because we sometimes acquire companies that may not have allocated significant resources and management focus to safety and environmental matters and may have a poor environmental and safety record and associated possible exposure. Our insurance may not be adequate to cover all losses or liabilities we may suffer. Also, insurance may no longer be available to us or, if it is, its availability may be at\npremium levels that do not justify its purchase. The occurrence of a significant uninsured claim, a claim in excess of the insurance coverage limits maintained by us or a claim at a time when we are not able to obtain liability insurance could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct normal business operations and on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, we may not be able to secure additional insurance or bonding that might be required by new governmental regulations. This may cause us to restrict our operations, which might severely impact our financial position.\nSince hydraulic fracturing activities are part of our operations, they are covered by our insurance against claims made for bodily injury, property damage and clean-up costs stemming from a sudden and accidental pollution event. However, we may not have coverage if we are unaware of the pollution event and unable to report the \u201coccurrence\u201d to our insurance company within the time frame required under our insurance policy. We have no coverage for gradual, long-term pollution events. In addition, these policies do not provide coverage for all liabilities, and the insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover claims that may arise, or we may not be able to maintain adequate insurance at rates we consider reasonable. A loss not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to extensive environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that may subject us to substantial liability or require us to take actions that will adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur business is significantly affected by stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of substances into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection and health and safety matters. As part of our business, we handle, transport and dispose of a variety of fluids and substances, including hydraulic fracturing fluids which can contain hydrochloric acid and certain petrochemicals. This activity poses some risks of environmental liability, including leakage of hazardous substances from the wells to surface and subsurface soils, surface water or groundwater. We also handle, transport and store these substances. The handling, transportation, storage and disposal of these fluids are regulated by a number of laws, including: the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act; the Clean Water Act; the Safe Drinking Water Act; and other federal and state laws and regulations promulgated thereunder. The cost of compliance with these laws can be significant. Failure to properly handle, transport or dispose of these materials or otherwise conduct our operations in accordance with these and other environmental laws could expose us to substantial liability for administrative, civil and criminal penalties, cleanup and site restoration costs and liability associated with releases of such materials, damages to natural resources and other damages, as well as potentially impair our ability to conduct our operations. We could be exposed to liability for cleanup costs, natural resource damages and other damages under these and other environmental laws. Such liability is commonly on a strict, joint and several liability basis, without regard to fault. Liability may be imposed as a result of our conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred or the conduct of, or conditions caused by, prior operators or other third parties. Environmental laws and regulations have changed in the past, and they are likely to change in the future. If existing environmental requirements or enforcement policies change and become more stringent, we may be required to make significant unanticipated capital and operating expenditures.\nRegulation of greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for oil and natural gas.\nIn recent years, federal, state and local governments have taken steps to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, or GHGs. The Environmental Protection Agency, or the EPA, has finalized a series of GHG monitoring, reporting and emissions control rules for the oil and natural gas industry, and the U.S. Congress has, from time to time, considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions. Almost one-half of the states have already taken measures to reduce emissions of GHGs primarily through the development of GHG emission inventories and/or regional GHG cap-and-trade programs. While we are subject to certain federal GHG monitoring and reporting requirements, our operations currently are not adversely impacted by existing federal, state and local climate change initiatives. For a description of existing and proposed GHG rules and regulations, see \u201c-Regulation of Hydraulic Fracturing.\u201d\nAt the international level, in December 2015, the United States participated in the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP-21) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, France. The resulting Paris Agreement calls for the parties to undertake \u201cambitious efforts\u201d to limit the average global temperature, and to conserve and enhance sinks and reservoirs of GHGs. The Agreement went into effect on November 4, 2016. The Agreement establishes a framework for the parties to cooperate and report actions to reduce GHG emissions. However, on June 1, 2017, President Trump announced that the United States would withdraw from the Paris Agreement, and begin negotiations to either re-enter or negotiate an entirely new agreement with more favorable terms for the United States. The Paris Agreement sets forth a specific exit process, whereby a party may not provide notice of its withdrawal until three years from the effective date, with such withdrawal taking effect one year from such notice. It is not clear what steps the Trump Administration plans to take to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, whether a new agreement can be negotiated or what terms would be included in such an\nagreement. Furthermore, in response to the announcement, many state and local leaders have stated their intent to intensify efforts to uphold the commitments set forth in the international accord.\nAlthough it is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address GHG emissions would impact our business, any such future laws and regulations imposing reporting obligations on, or limiting emissions of GHGs from, our equipment and operations could require us to incur costs to reduce emissions of GHGs associated with our operations. In addition, substantial limitations on GHG emissions could adversely affect demand for oil and natural gas and, consequently, the services we provide.\nIn addition, there have also been efforts in recent years to influence the investment community, including investment\nadvisors and certain sovereign wealth, pension and endowment funds promoting divestment of fossil fuel equities and pressuring lenders to limit funding to companies engaged in the extraction of fossil fuel reserves. Such environmental activism and initiatives aimed at limiting climate change and reducing air pollution could interfere with our business activities, operations and ability to access capital. Furthermore, claims have been made against certain energy companies alleging that GHG emissions from oil and natural gas operations constitute a public nuisance under federal and/or state common law. As a result, private individuals or public entities may seek to enforce environmental laws and regulations against us and could allege personal injury, property damage or other liabilities. While our business is not a party to any such litigation, we could be named in actions making similar allegations. An unfavorable ruling in any such case could significantly impact our operations and could have an adverse impact on our financial condition.\nMoreover, climate change may cause more extreme weather conditions such as more intense hurricanes,\nthunderstorms, tornadoes and snow or ice storms, as well as rising sea levels and increased volatility in seasonal\ntemperatures. Extreme weather conditions can interfere with our productivity and increase our costs and damage resulting\nfrom extreme weather may not be fully insured. However, at this time, we are unable to determine the extent to which climate\nchange may lead to increased storm or weather hazards affecting our operations.\nFederal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays.\nOur business is dependent on our ability to conduct hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling activities. Hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons, particularly natural gas, from tight formations, including shales. The process involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals (also called \u201cproppants\u201d) under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. There has been increasing public controversy regarding hydraulic fracturing with regard to the use of fracturing fluids, induced seismic activity, impacts on drinking water supplies, use of water and the potential for impacts to surface water, groundwater and the environment generally. A number of lawsuits and enforcement actions have been initiated across the country implicating hydraulic fracturing practices. The hydraulic fracturing process is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions. However, legislation has been proposed in recent sessions of Congress to amend the federal Safe Drinking Water Act, or SDWA, to repeal the exemption for hydraulic fracturing from the definition of \u201cunderground injection,\u201d to require federal permitting and regulatory control of hydraulic fracturing, and to require disclosure of the chemical constituents of the fluids used in the fracturing process. Furthermore, several federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process. In addition, several states and local jurisdictions in which we operate have adopted or are considering adopting regulations that could restrict or prohibit hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances, impose more stringent operating standards and/or require the disclosure of the composition of hydraulic fracturing fluids. For a more detailed description, see \"Business-Regulation-Regulation of Hydraulic Fracturing.\"\nIf new laws or regulations are adopted that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing, such laws could make it more difficult or costly for us to perform fracturing to stimulate production from tight formations as well as make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect groundwater. In addition, if hydraulic fracturing is further regulated at the federal, state or local level, our fracturing activities could become subject to additional permitting and financial assurance requirements, more stringent construction specifications, increased monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping obligations and also to attendant permitting delays and potential increases in costs, which could reduce the demand for our services. Such legislative or regulatory changes could cause us to incur substantial compliance costs, and compliance or the consequences of any failure to comply by us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. At this time, it is not possible to estimate the impact on our business of newly enacted or potential federal, state or local laws governing hydraulic fracturing.\nLegislation or regulatory initiatives intended to address seismic activity could restrict certain of our customers\u2019 drilling and production activities, as well as well as their ability to dispose of produced water gathered from such activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nState and federal regulatory agencies have recently focused on a possible connection between hydraulic fracturing related activities, particularly the underground injection of wastewater into disposal wells, and the increased occurrence of seismic activity, and regulatory agencies at all levels are continuing to study the possible linkage between oil and gas activity and induced seismicity. In addition, a number of lawsuits have been filed in some states alleging that disposal well operations have caused damage to neighboring properties or otherwise violated state and federal rules regulating waste disposal. In response to these concerns, regulators in some states are seeking to impose additional requirements, including requirements regarding the permitting of produced water disposal wells or otherwise to assess the relationship between seismicity and the use of such wells.\nCertain of our customers dispose of large volumes of produced water gathered from their drilling and production operations by injecting it into wells pursuant to permits issued to them by governmental authorities overseeing such disposal activities. While these permits are issued pursuant to existing laws and regulations, these legal requirements are subject to change, which could result in the imposition of more stringent operating constraints or new monitoring and reporting requirements, owing to, among other things, concerns of the public or governmental authorities regarding such gathering or disposal activities. The adoption and implementation of any new laws or regulations that restrict our ability to use hydraulic fracturing or dispose of produced water gathered from certain of our customers\u2019 drilling and production activities by owned disposal wells, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations in our natural sand proppant services business are dependent on our rights and ability to mine our properties and on our having renewed or received the required permits and approvals from governmental authorities and other third parties.\nWe hold numerous governmental, environmental, mining and other permits, water rights and approvals authorizing operations at our production facilities. For our extraction and processing in Wisconsin, the permitting process is subject to federal, state and local authority. For example, at the federal level, a Mine Identification Request must be filed and obtained before mining commences. If wetlands are implicated, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Wetland Permit is required. At the state level, a series of permits are required related to air quality, wetlands, water quality (waste water and storm water), grading, endangered species and archaeological assessments in addition to other permits depending upon site specific factors and operational detail. At the local level, zoning, building, storm water, erosion control, wellhead protection, road usage and access are all regulated and require permitting to some degree. A non-metallic mining reclamation permit is required. A decision by a governmental agency or other third party to deny or delay issuing a new or renewed permit or approval, or to revoke or substantially modify an existing permit or approval, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations.\nTitle to, and the area of, mineral properties and water rights may also be disputed. Mineral properties sometimes contain claims or transfer histories that examiners cannot verify. A successful claim that we do not have title to our property or lack appropriate water rights could cause us to lose any rights to explore, develop and extract minerals, without compensation for our prior expenditures relating to such property. Our business may suffer a material adverse effect in the event we have title deficiencies.\nIn some instances, we have received access rights or easements from third parties, which allow for a more efficient operation than would exist without the access or easement. A third party could take action to suspend the access or easement, and any such action could be materially adverse to our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nPenalties, fines or sanctions that may be imposed by the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration could have a material adverse effect on our proppant production and sales business and our overall financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration, or MSHA, has primary regulatory jurisdiction over commercial silica operations, including quarries, surface mines, underground mines, and industrial mineral process facilities. In addition, MSHA representatives perform at least two annual inspections of our production facilities to ensure employee and general site safety. As a result of these and future inspections and alleged violations and potential violations, we and our suppliers could be subject to material fines, penalties or sanctions. Any of our production facilities or our suppliers\u2019 mines could be subject to a temporary or extended shut down as a result of an alleged MSHA violation. Any such penalties, fines or sanctions could have a material adverse effect on our proppant production and sales business and our overall financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIncreasing trucking regulations may increase our costs and negatively impact our results of operations.\nIn connection with our business operations, including the transportation and relocation of our energy service equipment and shipment of frac sand, we operate trucks and other heavy equipment. As such, we operate as a motor carrier in providing certain of our services and therefore are subject to regulation by the United States Department of Transportation and by various state agencies. These regulatory authorities exercise broad powers, governing activities such as the authorization to engage in motor carrier operations, driver licensing, insurance requirements, financial reporting and review of certain mergers, consolidations and acquisitions, and transportation of hazardous materials (HAZMAT). Our trucking operations are subject to possible regulatory and legislative changes that may increase our costs. Some of these possible changes include increasingly stringent environmental regulations, changes in the hours of service regulations which govern the amount of time a driver may drive or work in any specific period, onboard black box recorder device requirements or limits on vehicle weight and size. Interstate motor carrier operations are subject to safety requirements prescribed by the United States Department of Transportation. To a large degree, intrastate motor carrier operations are subject to state safety regulations that mirror federal regulations. Matters such as the weight and dimensions of equipment are also subject to federal and state regulations. From time to time, various legislative proposals are introduced, including proposals to increase federal, state, or local taxes, including taxes on motor fuels, which may increase our costs or adversely impact the recruitment of drivers. We cannot predict whether, or in what form, any increase in such taxes applicable to us will be enacted.\nCertain motor vehicle operators require registration with the Department of Transportation. This registration requires an acceptable operating record. The Department of Transportation periodically conducts compliance reviews and may revoke registration privileges based on certain safety performance criteria that could result in a suspension of operations.\nRestrictions on drilling activities intended to protect certain species of wildlife may adversely affect our ability to conduct mining or drilling activities in some of the areas where we operate.\nOil and natural gas operations in our operating areas can be adversely affected by seasonal or permanent restrictions on mining or drilling activities designed to protect various wildlife, which may limit our ability to operate in protected areas. Permanent restrictions imposed to protect endangered species could prohibit drilling in certain areas or require the implementation of expensive mitigation measures. Additionally, the designation of previously unprotected species as threatened or endangered in areas where we operate could result in increased costs arising from species protection measures. Restrictions on oil and natural gas operations to protect wildlife could reduce demand for our services.\nConservation measures and technological advances could reduce demand for oil and natural gas and our services.\nFuel conservation measures, alternative fuel requirements, increasing consumer demand for alternatives to oil and natural gas, technological advances in fuel economy and energy generation devices could reduce demand for oil and natural gas, resulting in reduced demand for oilfield services. The impact of the changing demand for oil and natural gas services and products may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nChanges in tax laws and regulations or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our tax returns may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.\nOn December 22, 2017, the President of the United States signed into law Public Law No. 115-97, a comprehensive tax reform bill commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the Tax Act, that significantly reforms the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. Among other changes, the Tax Act (i) permanently reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate, (ii) provided for a transition tax (toll tax) on a one-time \u201cdeemed repatriation\u201d of accumulated foreign earnings, (iii) repealed the corporate alternative minimum tax, (iv) imposed new limitations on the utilization of net operating losses, and (v) provided for more general changes to the taxation of corporations, including changes to the deductibility of interest expense, the adoption of a modified territorial tax system, and introducing certain anti-base erosion provisions. The Tax Act is complex and far-reaching, and we cannot predict with certainty the resulting impact its enactment will have on us. The ultimate impact of the Tax Act may differ from our estimates due to changes in interpretations and assumptions made by us as well as additional regulatory guidance that may be issued, and any such changes in our interpretations and assumptions could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.\nOn December 10, 2018, the Governor of Puerto Rico signed into law House Bill 1544 as Act 257-2018, or Act 257, which amended the Puerto Rico Internal Revenue Code. Among other changes, Act 257 (i) reduces the corporate income tax rate from 39% to 37.5%, (ii) provides that the 51% disallowance with respect to expenses paid or incurred with a related party\nmay not apply under certain circumstances and (iii) adds requirements for the deductibility of expenses, including meals and entertainment, travel and motor vehicles. We cannot predict with certainty the resulting impact the enactment of Act 257 will have on us. The ultimate impact of Act 257 may differ from our estimates due to changes in interpretations and assumptions made by us as well as additional regulatory guidance that may be issued, and any such changes in our interpretations and assumptions could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.\nIn addition, we are subject to tax liabilities imposed by multiple jurisdictions, including income taxes, indirect taxes (excise/duty, sales/use and value-added taxes), payroll taxes, franchise taxes, withholding taxes and ad valorem taxes. New tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed that could result in increased expenditures for tax liabilities in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Additionally, many of these liabilities are subject to periodic audits by the respective taxing authority. Subsequent changes to our tax liabilities as a result of these audits may subject us to interest and penalties.\nOur income tax returns are subject to review and examination by the applicable tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. We do not recognize the benefit of income tax positions we believe are more likely than not to be disallowed upon challenge by a tax authority. Although we believe our tax provisions are adequate, the final determination of tax audits and any related disputes could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of audits or related disputes could have an adverse effect on our financial statements for the periods for which the applicable final determinations are made.\nOur operations are subject to a number of operational risks which may result in unexpected costs or liabilities.\nUnexpected costs or liabilities may arise from lawsuits or indemnity claims related to the services we perform or have performed in the past. We have in the past been, and may in the future be, named as a defendant in lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings during the ordinary course of our business. These actions may seek, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury, workers\u2019 compensation, employment discrimination, breach of contract, property damage, environmental remediation, punitive damages, civil penalties or other losses, consequential damages or injunctive or declaratory relief. In addition, pursuant to our service arrangements, we generally indemnify our customers for claims related to the services we provide under those service arrangements. In some instances, our services are integral to the operation and performance of the electric distribution and transmission infrastructure. As a result, we may become subject to lawsuits or claims for any failure of the systems we work on, even if our services are not the cause for such failures. In addition, we may incur civil and criminal liabilities to the extent that our services contributed to any personal injury or property damage. The outcome of any of these lawsuits, claims or legal proceedings could result in significant costs and diversion of managements\u2019 attention to the business.\nLosses and liabilities from uninsured or underinsured activities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations.\nThe operational insurance coverage we maintain for our business may not fully insure us against all risks, either because insurance is not available or because of the high premium costs relative to perceived risk. Further, any insurance obtained by us may not be adequate to cover any losses or liabilities and this insurance may not continue to be available at all or on terms which are acceptable to us. Insurance rates have in the past been subject to wide fluctuation and changes in coverage could result in less coverage, increases in cost or higher deductibles and retentions. Liabilities for which we are not insured, or which exceed the policy limits of our applicable insurance, could have a material adverse effect on our business activities, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to claims for personal injury and property damage, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe operate with most of our customers under master service agreements, or MSAs. We endeavor to allocate potential liabilities and risks between the parties in the MSAs. Generally, under our MSAs, including those relating to our hydraulic fracturing services, we assume responsibility for, including control and removal of, pollution or contamination which originates above surface and originates from our equipment or services. Our customer assumes responsibility for, including control and removal of, all other pollution or contamination which may occur during operations, including that which may result from seepage or any other uncontrolled flow of drilling fluids. We may have liability in such cases if we are negligent or commit willful acts. Generally, our customers also agree to indemnify us against claims arising from their employees\u2019 personal injury or death to the extent that, in the case of our hydraulic fracturing operations, their employees are injured or their properties are\ndamaged by such operations, unless resulting from our gross negligence or willful misconduct. Similarly, we generally agree to indemnify our customers for liabilities arising from personal injury to or death of any of our employees, unless resulting from gross negligence or willful misconduct of the customer. In addition, our customers generally agree to indemnify us for loss or destruction of customer-owned property or equipment and in turn, we agree to indemnify our customers for loss or destruction of property or equipment we own. Losses due to catastrophic events, such as blowouts, are generally the responsibility of the customer. However, despite this general allocation of risk, we might not succeed in enforcing such contractual allocation, might incur an unforeseen liability falling outside the scope of such allocation or may be required to enter into an MSA with terms that vary from the above allocations of risk. As a result, we may incur substantial losses which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation.\nLoss of our information and computer systems could adversely affect our business.\nWe are heavily dependent on our information systems and computer based programs, including our well operations information and accounting data. If any of such programs or systems were to fail or create erroneous information in our hardware or software network infrastructure, whether due to cyberattack or otherwise, possible consequences include our loss of communication links and inability to automatically process commercial transactions or engage in similar automated or computerized business activities. Any such consequence could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are subject to cyber security risks. A cyber incident could occur and result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption and/or financial loss.\nThe energy services industry has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct certain processing activities. For example, we depend on digital technologies to perform many of our services and process and record financial and operating data. At the same time, cyber incidents, including deliberate attacks or unintentional events, have increased. The U.S. government has issued public warnings that indicate that energy assets might be specific targets of cyber security threats. Our technologies, systems and networks, and those of our vendors, suppliers and other business partners, may become the target of cyberattacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of proprietary and other information, or other disruption of our business operations. In addition, certain cyber incidents, such as surveillance, may remain undetected for an extended period. Our systems and insurance coverage for protecting against cyber security risks may not be sufficient. As cyber incidents continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to cyber incidents. Our insurance coverage for cyberattacks may not be sufficient to cover all the losses we may experience as a result of such cyberattacks.\nRisks Inherent to Our Common Stock\nOur two largest stockholders control a significant percentage of our common stock, and their interests may conflict with those of our other stockholders.\nWexford, through its affiliate MEH Sub LLC, and Gulfport beneficially own approximately 49.0% and 21.9%, respectively, of our outstanding common stock. As a result, each of Wexford and Gulfport can exercise significant influence over matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, changes to our organizational documents and significant corporate transactions. Further, three individuals who serve as our directors are affiliates of Wexford or Gulfport. This concentration of ownership and relationships with Wexford and Gulfport make it unlikely that any other holder or group of holders of our common stock will be able to affect the way we are managed or the direction of our business. In addition, we have engaged, and expect to continue to engage, in related party transactions involving Wexford and Gulfport, and certain companies they control. The interests of Wexford and Gulfport with respect to matters potentially or actually involving or affecting us, such as services provided, future acquisitions, financings and other corporate opportunities, and attempts to acquire us, may conflict with the interests of our other stockholders. This concentrated ownership will make it impossible for another company to acquire us and for you to receive any related takeover premium for your shares unless these stockholders approve the acquisition.\nA significant reduction by Wexford or Gulfport of their ownership interests in us could adversely affect us.\nWe believe that Wexford\u2019s and Gulfport\u2019s substantial ownership interests in us provide them with an economic incentive to assist us to be successful. Neither Wexford nor Gulfport is subject to any obligation to maintain its ownership interest in us and may elect at any time to sell all or a substantial portion of or otherwise reduce its ownership interest in us. If Wexford or Gulfport sells all or a substantial portion of its ownership interest in us, it may have less incentive to assist in our\nsuccess and its affiliates that serve as members of our board of directors may resign. Such actions could adversely affect our ability to successfully implement our business strategies which could adversely affect our cash flows or results of operations.\nWe have ceased to be an emerging growth company as of December 31, 2018 and, as a result, we are required to comply with enhanced internal control provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and increased disclosure and corporate governance requirements.\nWe generated over $1.07 billion in revenue in 2018. As a result, we ceased to be an emerging growth company as defined in the JOBS Act as of December 31, 2018. We are an accelerated filer as of December 31, 2018 and are subject to certain requirements that apply to other public companies, but did not previously apply to us due to our status as an emerging growth company. These requirements include:\n\u2022\nthe provisions of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requiring that our independent registered public accounting firm provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting;\n\u2022\nthe requirement to provide detailed compensation discussion and analysis in proxy statements and reports filed under the Exchange Act; and\n\u2022\nthe \"say on pay\" provisions, which require a non-binding stockholder vote to approve compensation of certain executive officers, and the \"say on golden parachute\" provisions, which require a non-binding stockholder vote to approve golden parachute arrangements for certain executive officers in connection with mergers and certain other business combinations, of the Dodd-Frank Act.\nThese changes require a commitment of additional resources. If we are unable to comply with these obligations or if the costs related to compliance are significant, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe have and will continue to incur increased costs and obligations as a result of being a public company.\nAs a public company, we have incurred and will continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses. These include costs associated with our public company reporting requirements and corporate governance requirements, including requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, as well as rules implemented by the SEC, The Nasdaq Global Select Market and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. These rules and regulations have increased our legal and financial compliance costs and made some activities more time-consuming and costly. These rules and regulations may also make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers. We estimate that we incur approximately $2.5 million of incremental costs per year associated with being a publicly traded company; however, it is possible that our incremental costs of being a publicly traded company will be higher than we currently estimate. As we ceased to be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as of December 31, 2018, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant additional expenses and devote substantial management effort toward ensuring compliance with those requirements applicable to companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies,\u201d including Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. See \u201c-Risks Related to Our Common Stock-We are subject to certain requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. If we are unable to continue to comply with Section 404 or if the costs related to compliance are significant, our profitability, stock price, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\u201d\nWe are subject to certain requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. If we are unable to continue comply with Section 404 or if the costs related to compliance are significant, our profitability, stock price, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nAs discussed above, as of December 31, 2018, we ceased to be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and are now required to comply with the enhanced provisions of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 applicable to non-emerging growth companies. Section 404 requires that we not only document and test our internal control over financial reporting and issue management\u2019s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting, as we have done in the past, but also that our independent registered public accounting firm attest to and report on the internal control assessments made by our management. As we perform the required testing of, and our auditors\u2019 audit, our internal control over financial reporting, we or they may identify areas requiring improvement, and we may have to design enhanced processes and controls to address issues identified through this review. We believe that the out-of-pocket costs, the diversion of management\u2019s attention from running the day-to-day operations and operational changes caused by the need to comply with the enhanced requirements of Section\n404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act applicable to non-emerging growth companies could be significant. If the time and costs associated with such compliance exceed our current expectations, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or if we or our auditors identify and report material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting, the accuracy and timeliness of the filing of our annual and quarterly reports may be materially adversely affected and could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock. In addition, a material weakness in the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could result in an increased chance of fraud and the loss of customers, reduce our ability to obtain financing and require additional expenditures to comply with these requirements, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe corporate opportunity provisions in our certificate of incorporation could enable Wexford, Gulfport or other affiliates of ours to benefit from corporate opportunities that might otherwise be available to us.\nSubject to the limitations of applicable law, our certificate of incorporation, among other things:\n\u2022\npermits us to enter into transactions with entities in which one or more of our officers or directors are financially or otherwise interested;\n\u2022\npermits any of our stockholders, officers or directors to conduct business that competes with us and to make investments in any kind of property in which we may make investments; and\n\u2022\nprovides that if any director or officer of one of our affiliates who is also one of our officers or directors becomes aware of a potential business opportunity, transaction or other matter (other than one expressly offered to that director or officer in writing solely in his or her capacity as our director or officer), that director or officer will have no duty to communicate or offer that opportunity to us, and will be permitted to communicate or offer that opportunity to such affiliates and that director or officer will not be deemed to have (i) acted in a manner inconsistent with his or her fiduciary or other duties to us regarding the opportunity or (ii) acted in bad faith or in a manner inconsistent with our best interests.\nThese provisions create the possibility that a corporate opportunity that would otherwise be available to us may be used for the benefit of one of our affiliates.\nWe have engaged in transactions with our affiliates and expect to do so in the future. The terms of such transactions and the resolution of any conflicts that may arise may not always be in our or our common stockholders\u2019 best interests.\nWe have engaged in transactions and expect to continue to engage in transactions with affiliated companies. As described elsewhere in this report, including in the notes to our consolidated financial statements, these transactions include, among others, a joint venture, agreements to provide our services and frac sand products to our affiliates and agreements pursuant to which our affiliates provide or will provide us with certain services, including administrative and advisory services and office space. Each of these entities is either controlled by or affiliated with Wexford or Gulfport, as the case may be, and the resolution of any conflicts that may arise in connection with such related party transactions, including pricing, duration or other terms of service, may not always be in our or our stockholders\u2019 best interests because Wexford and/or Gulfport may have the ability to influence the outcome of these conflicts. For a discussion of potential conflicts, see \u201c-Risks Inherent to Our Common Stock-Our two largest stockholders control a significant percentage of our common stock, and their interests may conflict with those of our other stockholders.\u201d\nPrior to the IPO, there was no public market for our common stock and if the price of our common stock fluctuates significantly, your investment could lose value.\nPrior to the completion of the IPO in October 2016, there was no public market for our common stock. Although our common stock is listed on The Nasdaq Global Select Market, an active public market for our common stock may not be maintained. If an active public market for our common stock is not maintained, the trading price and liquidity of our common stock will be materially and adversely affected. If there is a thin trading market or \u201cfloat\u201d for our common stock, the market price for our common stock may fluctuate significantly more than the stock market as a whole. Without a large float, our common stock is less liquid than the securities of companies with broader public ownership and, as a result, the trading prices of our common stock may be more volatile. In addition, in the absence of an active public trading market, investors may be unable to liquidate their investment in us. In addition, the stock market is subject to significant price and volume fluctuations, and the price of our common stock could fluctuate widely in response to several factors, including:\n\u2022\nour quarterly or annual operating results;\n\u2022\nchanges in our earnings estimates;\n\u2022\ninvestment recommendations by securities analysts following our business or our industries;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022\nchanges in the business, earnings estimates or market perceptions of our competitors;\n\u2022\nour failure to achieve operating results consistent with securities analysts\u2019 projections;\n\u2022\nchanges in industry, general market or economic conditions; and\n\u2022\nannouncements of legislative or regulatory change.\nThe stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years that have significantly affected the quoted prices of the securities of many companies, including companies in our industries. The changes often appear to occur without regard to specific operating performance. The price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our company and these fluctuations could materially reduce the price for our common stock.\nWexford and Gulfport beneficially own a substantial amount of our common stock and may sell such common stock in the public or private markets. Sales of these shares of common stock or sales of substantial amounts of our common stock by other stockholders, or the perception that such sales may occur, could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2018, Wexford and Gulfport beneficially owned 49.0% and 21.9% shares of our common stock, respectively. Sales of these shares of common stock or sales of substantial amounts of our common stock by other stockholders, or the perception that such sales may occur, could cause the price of our common stock to decline. In addition, the sale of these shares could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional common or preferred stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, if they adversely revise their recommendations regarding our stock or if our operating results do not meet their expectations, the price of our stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. Moreover, if one or more of the analysts who cover our company downgrades our stock or if our operating results do not meet their expectations, our stock price could decline.\nWe may issue preferred stock whose terms could adversely affect the voting power or value of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designations, preferences, limitations and relative rights, including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our board of directors may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could adversely impact the voting power or value of our common stock. For example, we might grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we might assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law make it more difficult to effect a change in control of the company, which could adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nThe existence of some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware corporate law could delay or prevent a change in control of our company, even if that change would be beneficial to our stockholders. Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make acquiring control of our company difficult, including:\n\u2022\nprovisions regulating the ability of our stockholders to nominate directors for election or to bring matters for action at annual meetings of our stockholders;\n\u2022\nlimitations on the ability of our stockholders to call a special meeting and act by written consent;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors to adopt, amend or repeal bylaws, and the requirement that the affirmative vote of holders representing at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock be obtained for stockholders to amend our bylaws;\n\u2022\nthe requirement that the affirmative vote of holders representing at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock be obtained to remove directors;\n\u2022\nthe requirement that the affirmative vote of holders representing at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock be obtained to amend our certificate of incorporation; and\n\u2022\nthe authorization given to our board of directors to issue and set the terms of preferred stock without the approval of our stockholders.\nThese provisions also could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. As a result, these provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders, which may limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation designates courts in the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that, subject to limited exceptions, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for:\n\u2022\nAny derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf;\n\u2022\nAny action asserting a claim of breach of fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders;\n\u2022\nAny action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law; or\n\u2022\nAny other action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine.\nIn addition, our certificate of incorporation provides that if any action specified above (each is referred to herein as a covered proceeding), is filed in a court other than the specified Delaware courts without the approval of our board of directors (each is referred to herein as a foreign action), the claiming party will be deemed to have consented to (i) the personal jurisdiction of the specified Delaware courts in connection with any action brought in any such courts to enforce the exclusive forum provision described above and (ii) having service of process made upon such claiming party in any such enforcement action by service upon such claiming party\u2019s counsel in the foreign action as agent for such claiming party. These provisions may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of our certificate of incorporation inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the covered proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nThe declaration of dividends on our common stock is within the discretion of our board of directors based upon a review of relevant considerations, and there is no guarantee that we will pay any dividends in the future or at levels anticipated by our stockholders.\nOn July 16, 2018, our board of directors initiated a quarterly dividend policy on shares of our common stock payable quarterly beginning with the second quarter of 2018. The decision to pay dividends, however, is solely within the discretion of, and subject to approval by, our board of directors. Our board of directors\u2019 determination with respect to any such dividends, including the record date, the payment date and the actual amount of the dividend, will depend upon our profitability and financial condition, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors that the board deems relevant at the time of such determination. Based on its evaluation of these factors, the board of directors may determine not to declare a dividend, or declare dividends at rates that are less than currently anticipated, either of which could reduce returns to our stockholders.", "PERMNO": 16401, "SIC": 1389, "TIC": "TUSK"}
