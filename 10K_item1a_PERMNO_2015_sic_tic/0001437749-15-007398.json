{"cik": "1004989", "company": "SPAR GROUP INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-04-15", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThere are various risks associated with investing in any common stock issued by SGRP (\"SGRP Common Stock\") that are more fully described below. You should carefully consider each of those risk factors (as well as the other risks, cautions and information noted in this Annual Report, the Proxy Statement and the Company's other SEC Reports) before you purchase or trade any SGRP Common Stock. If any of the described risks develops into actual events or circumstances, or any other risks arise and develop into actual events, the Company's present or future assets, business, capital, cash flow, credit, expenses, financial condition, income, liabilities, liquidity, locations, marketing, operations, prospects, sales, strategies, taxation or other achievement, results, risks or condition could be materially and adversely affected (in whole or in part), the market price of the SGRP Common Stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment in your SGRP Common Stock.\nThe Company has described the risk factors that it currently considers material to the Company based on its best estimates respecting those risk factors, the Company's current and anticipated future assets, business, capital, cash flow, credit, expenses, financial condition, income, liabilities, liquidity, locations, marketing, operations, prospects, sales, strategies, taxation or other achievement, results, risks or condition, the likelihood of those risks developing into actual events and the likely impact of those events on them, which all involve and include \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of applicable Securities Law (as discussed above). The Company also may be facing additional risks individually, and the Company's industry or the economy may be facing additional risks, whether domestically or internationally, that are currently unknown to the Company, that are more material or otherwise different than the Company currently believes, or that the Company may have incorrectly analyzed (whether as to the nature or likelihood of such risks or their potential effect). In addition, new risks and uncertainties arise from time to time, and it is impossible for the Company to predict these matters or how they may arise or affect the Company. There also may be risks that you (as a potential investor or trader) would recognize or consider more likely or material than the Company does.\nAny of the events of circumstances described in any of the risk factors, forward-looking statements or other cautionary information contained in this Annual Report or any other SEC Report, or any other event or circumstance bearing risk or harm, could at any time arise, become applicable, change or worsen (as the case may be) and materially and adversely affect the Company or any of its assets, business, capital, cash flow, credit, expenses, financial condition, income, liabilities, liquidity, locations, marketing, operations, prospects, sales, strategies, taxation or other achievement, results, risks or condition, the market price of the SGRP Common Stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment in SGRP Common stock.\nAccordingly, the Company's risk factors and forward-looking statements each involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, potential errors and misjudgments and other risks, uncertainties and unpredictable factors (many of which are beyond the Company's control) that could materially and adversely affect, and could contribute to the Company's failure to achieve or realize, in whole or in part, the Company's estimated or desired assets, business, capital, cash flow, credit, expenses, financial condition, income, liabilities, liquidity, locations, marketing, operations, prospects, sales, strategies, taxation or other achievement, results, risks or condition, whether as expressed or implied by such risk factors or forward-looking or other statements.\nThe Company does not intend or promise, and the Company expressly disclaims any obligation, to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, risk factors or other risks, cautions or information (in whole or in part), whether as a result of new information, risks or uncertainties, future events or recognition or otherwise, except as and to the extent required by applicable law.\nDependence on Largest Customer and Large Retail Chains\nAs discussed above in Company's Customer Base, the Company currently does not have a significant customer concentration. However, the loss of any of its customers, the loss of the ability to provide merchandising and marketing services in those chains, or the failure to attract new large clients could significantly decrease the Company's revenues and such decreased revenues could have a material adverse effect on the Company or its estimated or desired assets, business, capital, cash flow, credit, expenses, financial condition, income, liabilities, liquidity, locations, marketing, operations, prospects, sales, strategies, taxation or other achievement, results or condition.\nDependence on Trend Towards Outsourcing\nThe business and growth of the Company depends in large part on the continued trend toward outsourcing of merchandising and marketing services, which the Company believes has resulted from the consolidation of retailers and manufacturers, as well as the desire to seek outsourcing specialists and reduce fixed operation expenses. There can be no assurance that this trend in outsourcing will continue, as companies may elect to perform such services internally. A significant change in the direction of this trend generally, or a trend in the retail, manufacturing or business services industry not to use, or to reduce the use of, outsourced marketing services such as those provided by the Company, could significantly decrease the Company's revenues and such decreased revenues could have a material adverse effect on the Company or its estimated or desired assets, business, capital, cash flow, credit, expenses, financial condition, income, liabilities, liquidity, locations, marketing, operations, prospects, sales, strategies, taxation or other achievement, results or condition.\nDependence on Retailers with Physical Stores\nRetailers with physical store locations are facing increasing competition from virtual stores on the internet. Some retailers with physical stores have failed and others are struggling in this highly competitive environment. Although the Company's merchandising services help physical retailers in successfully competing against such virtual online stores, and the Company provides assembly and other services utilized by online retailers, the Company's business and growth depends in large part on the continuing need for in-store merchandising of products and the continuing success of retailers with physical store locations. There can be no assurance that the in-store merchandising of products will increase or even continue at current levels or that retailers with physical store locations will continue to compete successfully in those stores, and some retailers are shifting their sales focus to their virtual online stores. A significant decrease in such need for in-store merchandising or success of such physical stores could significantly decrease the Company's revenues and such decreased revenues could have a material adverse effect on the Company or its estimated or desired assets, business, capital, cash flow, credit, expenses, financial condition, income, liabilities, liquidity, locations, marketing, operations, prospects, sales, strategies, taxation or other achievement, results or condition.\nFailure to Successfully Compete\nThe merchandising and marketing services industry is highly competitive and the Company has competitors that are larger (or part of larger holding companies) and may be better financed. In addition, the Company competes with: (i) a large number of relatively small enterprises with specific client, channel or geographic coverage; (ii) the internal merchandising and marketing operations of its existing and prospective clients; (iii) independent brokers; and (iv) smaller regional providers. Remaining competitive in the highly competitive merchandising and marketing services industry requires that the Company monitor and respond to trends in all industry sectors. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to anticipate and respond successfully to such trends in a timely manner. If the Company is unable to successfully compete, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company or its estimated or desired assets, business, capital, cash flow, credit, expenses, financial condition, income, liabilities, liquidity, locations, marketing, operations, prospects, sales, strategies, taxation or other achievement, results or condition.\nIf certain competitors were to combine into integrated merchandising and marketing services companies, or additional merchandising and marketing service companies were to enter into this market, or existing participants in this industry were to become more competitive, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company or its estimated or desired assets, business, capital, cash flow, credit, expenses, financial condition, income, liabilities, liquidity, locations, marketing, operations, prospects, sales, strategies, taxation or other achievement, results or condition.\nRisks of Losses and Financial Covenant Violations\nIn the past, the Company occasionally suffered operating losses. As a result of those losses and related effects, the Company had repeated technical violations of certain covenants in the Company's prior domestic credit facility, which its lender periodically waived for fees rather than permanently resetting them to realistically achievable levels. However, the Company changed its domestic lenders in July 2010 and entered into a new credit facility with financial covenants that the Company believes are more realistic and thus less likely to require waivers. The Company was in compliance of all its new domestic lender's bank covenants in 2014 and 2013. See Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Liquidity and Capital Resources, below, and Note 4 to Consolidated Financial Statements - Credit Facilities, below.\nThere can be no assurances that in the future the Company will be profitable, will not violate covenants of its current or future credit facilities, its lenders will waive any violations of such covenants, the Company will continue to have adequate lines of credit, or will continue to have sufficient availability under its lines of credit. Accordingly, marginal profitability by the Company, as well as any failure to maintain sufficient availability or lines of credit from the Company's lenders, could have a material adverse effect on the Company or its estimated or desired assets, business, capital, cash flow, credit, expenses, financial condition, income, liabilities, liquidity, locations, marketing, operations, prospects, sales, strategies, taxation or other achievement, results or condition.\nVariability of Operating Results and Uncertainty in Client Revenue\nThe Company has experienced and, in the future, may experience fluctuations in quarterly operating results. Factors that may cause the Company's quarterly operating results to vary from time to time and may result in reduced revenue and profits include: (i) the number of active client projects; (ii) seasonality of client products; (iii) client delays, changes and cancellations in projects; (iv) the timing requirements of client projects; (v) the completion of major client projects; (vi) the timing of new engagements; (vii) the timing of personnel cost increases; and (viii) the loss of major clients. In addition, the Company is subject to revenue or profit uncertainties resulting from factors such as unprofitable client work (see below) and the failure of clients to pay. The Company attempts to mitigate these risks by dealing primarily with large credit-worthy clients, by entering into written or oral agreements with its clients and by using project budgeting systems. These revenue fluctuations could materially and adversely affect the Company or its estimated or desired assets, business, capital, cash flow, credit, expenses, financial condition, income, liabilities, liquidity, locations, marketing, operations, prospects, sales, strategies, taxation or other achievement, results or condition.\nRisks of Unprofitable Services\nThe Company has agreed, and in the future may agree, from time to time to perform services for its client that become or turn out to be unprofitable even though the Company expected to make a profit when agreeing to perform them. The Company's services for a particular client or project may be or become unprofitable due to mistakes or changes in circumstance, including (without limitation) any (i) mistake or omission made in investigating, evaluating or understanding any relevant circumstance, requirement or request of the Company's client or any aspect of the prospective services or their inherent problems, (ii) mistake made in pricing, planning or performing the prospective service, (iii) service non-performance, or free re-performance, or (iv) change in cost, personnel, regulation or other performance circumstance. Unprofitable services could reduce the Company's net revenues and, if material in gross amount or degree of unprofitability, could materially and adversely affect the Company or its actual, expected, estimated or desired assets, business, capital, cash flow, credit, expenses, financial condition, income, liabilities, liquidity, locations, marketing, operations, prospects, sales, strategies, taxation or other achievement, results or condition.\nFailure to Develop New Services\nA key element of the Company's growth strategy is the development and sale of new services. While several new services are under current development, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully develop and market new services. The Company's inability or failure to devise useful merchandising or marketing services or to complete the development or implementation of a particular service for use on a large scale, or the failure of such services to achieve market acceptance, could adversely affect the Company's ability to achieve a significant part of its growth strategy and the absence of such growth could have a material adverse effect on the Company or its estimated or desired assets, business, capital, cash flow, credit, expenses, financial condition, income, liabilities, liquidity, locations, marketing, operations, prospects, sales, strategies, taxation or other achievement, results or condition and could limit the Company's ability to significantly increase its revenues and profits.\nInability to Identify, Acquire and Successfully Integrate Acquisitions\nAnother key component of the Company's growth strategy is the acquisition of businesses across the United States and worldwide that offer similar merchandising or marketing services. The successful implementation of this strategy depends upon the Company's ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates, acquire such businesses on acceptable terms, finance the acquisition and integrate their operations successfully with those of the Company. There can be no assurance that such candidates will be available or, if such candidates are available, that the price will be attractive or that the Company will be able to identify, acquire, finance or integrate such businesses successfully. In addition, in pursuing such acquisition opportunities, the Company may compete with other entities with similar growth strategies; these competitors may be larger and have greater financial and other resources than the Company. Competition for these acquisition targets could also result in increased prices of acquisition targets and/or a diminished pool of companies available for acquisition.\nThe successful integration of these acquisitions also may involve a number of additional risks, including: (i) the inability to retain the clients of the acquired business; (ii) the lingering effects of poor client relations or service performance by the acquired business, which also may taint the Company's existing businesses; (iii) the inability to retain the desirable management, key personnel and other employees of the acquired business; (iv) the inability to fully realize the desired efficiencies and economies of scale; (v) the inability to establish, implement or police the Company's existing standards, controls, procedures and policies on the acquired business; (vi) diversion of management attention; and (vii) exposure to client, employee and other legal claims for activities of the acquired business prior to acquisition. In addition, any acquired business could perform significantly worse than expected.\nThe inability to identify, acquire, finance and successfully integrate such merchandising or marketing services business could have a material adverse effect on the Company or its estimated or desired assets, business, capital, cash flow, credit, expenses, financial condition, income, liabilities, liquidity, locations, marketing, operations, prospects, sales, strategies, taxation or other achievement, results or condition.\nUncertainty of Financing for, and Dilution Resulting from, Future Acquisitions\nThe timing, size and success of acquisition efforts and any associated capital commitments cannot be readily predicted. Future acquisitions may be financed by issuing shares of the SGRP Common Stock, cash, or a combination of SGRP Common Stock and cash. If the SGRP Common Stock does not maintain a sufficient market value, or if potential acquisition candidates are otherwise unwilling to accept the SGRP Common Stock as part of the consideration for the sale of their businesses, the Company may be required to obtain additional capital through debt or equity financings. To the extent the SGRP Common Stock is used for all or a portion of the consideration to be paid for future acquisitions, dilution may be experienced by existing stockholders. In addition, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain the additional financing it may need for its acquisitions on terms that the Company deems acceptable. Failure to obtain such capital would materially and adversely affect the Company or its estimated or desired assets, business, capital, cash flow, credit, expenses, financial condition, income, liabilities, liquidity, locations, marketing, operations, prospects, sales, strategies, taxation or other achievement, results or condition.\nReliance on the Internet and Third Party Vendors\nThe Company relies on the Internet for the scheduling, tracking, coordination and reporting of its merchandising and marketing services. The Internet has experienced, and is expected to continue to experience, significant growth in the numbers of users and amount of traffic as well as increased attacks by hackers and other saboteurs. To the extent that the Internet continues to experience increased numbers of users, frequency of use or increased bandwidth requirements of users, there can be no assurance that the Internet infrastructure will continue to be able to support the demands placed on the Internet by this continued growth or that the performance or reliability of the Internet will not be adversely affected. Furthermore, the Internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of accidental and intentional damage to portions of its infrastructure, and could face such outages and delays in the future of similar or greater effect. The Company relies on third-party vendors to provide its Internet access and other services used in its business, and the Company has no control over such third-party providers. Any protracted disruption or material slowdown in Internet or other services could increase the Company's costs of operation and reduce efficiency and performance, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company or its estimated or desired assets, business, capital, cash flow, credit, expenses, financial condition, income, liabilities, liquidity, locations, marketing, operations, prospects, sales, strategies, taxation or other achievement, results or condition.\nEconomic and Retail Uncertainty\nThe markets in which the Company operates are cyclical and subject to the effects of economic downturns. The current political, social and economic conditions, including the impact of terrorism on consumer and business behavior, make it difficult for the Company, its vendors and its clients to accurately forecast and plan future business activities. Substantially all of the Company's key clients are either retailers or those seeking to do product merchandising at retailers. Should the retail industry experience a significant economic downturn, the resultant reduction in product sales could significantly decrease the Company's revenues. The Company also has risks associated with its clients changing their business plans and/or reducing their marketing budgets in response to economic conditions, which could also significantly decrease the Company's revenues. Such revenue decreases could have a material adverse effect on the Company or its estimated or desired assets, business, capital, cash flow, credit, expenses, financial condition, income, liabilities, liquidity, locations, marketing, operations, prospects, sales, strategies, taxation or other achievement, results or condition.\nRisks Associated with Furniture and Other Related Assembly Services\nThe Company's technicians assemble furniture and other products in the homes and offices of customers. Working at a customer's home or office could give rise to claims against the Company for errors, omissions or misconduct by those technicians, including (without limitation) harassment, personal injury, death, damage to or theft of customer property, or other civil or criminal misconduct by such technicians. Claims also could be made against the Company as a result of its involvement in such assembly services due to (among other things) product assembly errors and omissions, product defects, deficiencies, breakdowns or collapse, products that are not merchantable or fit for their particular purpose, products that do not conform to published specifications or satisfy customer expectations, or products that cause personal injury, death or property damage, in each case whether actual, alleged or perceived by customers, and irrespective of how much time may have passed since such assembly. If such claims are asserted and adversely determined against the Company, then to the extent such claims are not covered by indemnification from the product's seller or manufacturer or by insurance, they could have a material adverse effect on the Company or its estimated or desired assets, business, capital, cash flow, credit, expenses, financial condition, income, liabilities, liquidity, locations, marketing, operations, prospects, sales, strategies, taxation or other achievement, results or condition.\nRisks Associated with Audit Services\nThe auditing services industry is highly competitive and the Company has competitors that are larger (or part of larger holding companies) and may be better financed. In addition, the Company competes with: (i) a large number of relatively small enterprises with specific client, channel or geographic coverage; (ii) the internal auditing operations of its existing and prospective clients; and (iii) smaller regional providers. Remaining competitive in the highly competitive auditing services industry requires that the Company monitor and respond to trends in all industry sectors. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to anticipate and respond successfully to such trends in a timely manner. If the Company is unable to successfully compete, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company or its estimated or desired assets, business, capital, cash flow, credit, expenses, financial condition, income, liabilities, liquidity, locations, marketing, operations, prospects, sales, strategies, taxation or other achievement, results or condition.\nDependence Upon and Cost of Services Provided by Affiliates\nThe success of the Company's domestic business is dependent upon the successful execution of its field merchandising, assembly and management services by SPAR Business Services, Inc., formerly known as SPAR Marketing Services, Inc., and SMS (\"SBS\"), SPAR Administrative Services, Inc., formerly known as SPAR Management Services, Inc., and SMSI (\"SAS\"), National Retail Source, LLC (\"NRS\"), and certain foreign affiliates, each of which is an affiliate, but not a subsidiary, of the Company, and none of which is consolidated in the Company's consolidated financial statements. NRS provides substantially all of the field merchandising services used by National Merchandising Services, LLC (\"NMS\"), which is a subsidiary of SGRP and part of the Company, and has done so since August 1, 2013 (prior to which those services were provided by NRS's affiliate of National Merchandising of America, Inc.). SBS provides a majority of all of the other domestic field merchandising and assembly services used by the Company other than NMS (87% of the domestic field merchandising and assembly expenses in 2014, excluding NMS field expenses), and SAS provides substantially all of the other domestic field management services used by the Company (92% of the domestic field management expense in 2014, excluding NMS field expenses). Services were provided to the Company (other than NMS) by SBS and SAS at rates equal to their net total cost plus four percent pursuant to contracts that expired on November 30, 2014, and are currently under negotiation. Services are provided to NMS by NMA at rates equal to their total cost (with certain exclusions) plus two percent pursuant to a contract that is cancelable on 60 days' prior notice at any time after December 31, 2014. See Potential Conflicts in Services Provided by Affiliates, below, Item 13 - Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence, below, and Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements - Related-Party Transactions, below.\nThe Company has determined that the rates charged by SBS, SAS and NRS for their services are slightly favorable to the Company (when compared to other possible providers). SBS and NRS have independently advised the Company that those favorable rates are dependent (at least in part) on the ability of each of them to continue to use independent merchandisers as its field merchandising specialists, that such merchandising specialists generally provide greater flexibility and performance quality at lower total costs as a result of their independence, that it complies with applicable legal requirements for the individuals and companies it retains as field merchandising specialists, and that the appropriateness of its treatment of such independent field merchandising specialists has been routinely subject to challenge (both currently and historically) by various states. The expenses of defending those challenges are part of the total costs of SBS borne by the Company but are excluded from the total costs of NRS borne by the Company. There can be no assurance that either SBS or NRS will succeed in defending any such challenge, and an adverse determination could increase its costs of doing business. Any material increase in the costs of SBS, SAS or NRS (and thus the costs it charges to the Company), or any decrease in such performance quality, could have a material adverse effect on the Company or its estimated or desired assets, business, capital, cash flow, credit, expenses, financial condition, income, liabilities, liquidity, locations, marketing, operations, prospects, sales, strategies, taxation or other achievement, results or condition.\nPotential Conflicts in Services Provided by Affiliates\nSBS and SAS are affiliates (but not subsidiaries) of SGRP and are owned variously by Mr. Robert G. Brown, founder, director, Chairman and a significant stockholder of the Company, and Mr. William H. Bartels, founder, director, Vice Chairman and a significant stockholder of the Company. Mr. Brown and Mr. Bartels are also stockholders, directors and executive officers of various other affiliates of SGRP. NRS is an affiliate (but not a subsidiary) of NMS, and NMS is a consolidated subsidiary of SGRP. Mr. Edward Burdekin is the Chief Executive Officer and President and a director of both NRS and NMS, NRS is owned by Mr. Burdekin, NMA is owned by Andrea H. Burdekin (Mr. Burdekin's wife), and NMA owns 49% of the membership units in NMS. SGRP owns the other 51% of the membership units in NMS. In the event of any dispute in the business relationships between the Company and one or more of SBS, SAS or NRS, it is possible that Messrs. Brown, Bartels or Burdekin may have one or more conflicts of interest with respect to those relationships and could cause one or more of SBS, SAS or NRS to renegotiate or cancel their approved affiliate contracts with the Company or otherwise act in a way that is not in the Company's best interests. To a lesser extent, similar conflicts and events could arise with respect to the Company's contracts with affiliates in South Africa and Turkey. See Dependence Upon and Cost of Services Provided by Affiliates, above, Item 13 - Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence, below, and Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements - Related-Party Transactions, below.\nWhile the Company's relationships with SBS, SAS and NRS are good, there can be no assurance that the Company could (if necessary under the circumstances) replace the field merchandising specialists and management currently provided by SBS and SAS, respectively, or those provided by NRS, in sufficient time to perform its client obligations or at such favorable rates in the event one or more of SBS, SAS or NRS no longer performed those services. Any cancellation, other nonperformance or material pricing increase under those approved affiliate contracts could have a material adverse effect on the Company or its estimated or desired assets, business, capital, cash flow, credit, expenses, financial condition, income, liabilities, liquidity, locations, marketing, operations, prospects, sales, strategies, taxation or other achievement, results or condition.\nRisks of Common Stock Ownership\nDividends on SGRP Common Stock are discretionary, have never been paid, are subject to restrictions in the Company's credit facilities and applicable law and can only be paid to the holders of SGRP Common Stock if the accrued and unpaid dividends and potential dividends are first paid to the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock. In the event of the Company's liquidation, dissolution, or winding-up, the holders of Common Stock are only entitled to share in the Company's assets, if any, that remain after the Company makes payment of and provision for all of the Company's debts and liabilities and the liquidation preferences of all of the Company's outstanding Preferred Stock. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will remain in any such case for dividends or distributions to the holders of SGRP Common Stock.\nRisks related to the Company's Preferred Stock\nThe Company's ability to issue or redeem Preferred Stock, or any rights to purchase such shares, could discourage an unsolicited acquisition proposal. For example, the Company could impede a business combination by issuing a series of preferred stock containing class voting rights that would enable the holders of such preferred stock to block a business combination transaction. Alternatively, the Company could facilitate a business combination transaction by issuing a series of preferred stock having sufficient voting rights to provide a required percentage vote of the stockholders. Additionally, under certain circumstances, the Company's issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect the voting power of the holders of the Company's common stock. Although the Company's board of directors is required to make any determination to issue any preferred stock based on its judgment as to the best interests of the Company's stockholders, the Company's board of directors could act in a manner that would discourage an acquisition attempt or other transaction that some, or a majority, of the Company's stockholders may believe to be in their best interests or in which stockholders may receive a premium for their stock over prevailing market prices of such stock. The Company's board of directors does not at present intend to seek stockholder approval prior to any issuance of currently authorized stock, unless otherwise required by law or applicable stock exchange requirements.\nRisks of Illiquidity in SGRP Common Stock\nThe market price of the Company's common stock has historically experienced and may continue to experience significant volatility. During the year ended December 31, 2014, the sale price of SGRP Common Stock fluctuated from $1.27 to $2.17 per share. The Company believes that its Common Stock is subject to wide price fluctuations due to (among other things) the following:\n\u25cf\nthe relatively small public float and corresponding thin trading market for SGRP Common Stock, attributable to (among other things) the large block of voting shares beneficially owned by the Company's co-founders (as noted below) and generally low trading volumes, and that thin trading market may cause small trades to have significant impacts on SGRP Common Stock price;\n\u25cf\nthe substantial beneficial ownership of approximately 56.5% of the Company's voting stock and potential control by the Company's co-founders (who also are directors and Officers of the Company), Mr. Robert G. Brown, who beneficially owns approximately 32.5% (or 7.1 million shares) of SGRP Common Stock, and Mr. William H. Bartels, who beneficially owns approximately 24.0% (or 5.3 million shares) of SGRP Common Stock, which amounts were calculated using total beneficial ownership (15.4 million shares) and their individual beneficial ownerships at December 31, 2014 (including all shares then beneficially owned under currently exercisable warrants and vested options), as more fully described above and below;\n\u25cf\nthe periodic potential risk of the delisting of SGRP Common Stock from trading on Nasdaq (as described below);\n\u25cf\nany announcement, estimate or disclosure by the Company, or any projection or other claim or pronouncement by any of the Company's competitors or any financial analyst, commentator, blogger or other person, respecting (i) any new service created or improved, significant contract, business acquisition or relationship, or other publicized development by the Company or any of its competitors, or (ii) any change, fluctuation or other development in the Company's actual, estimated or desired assets, business, capital, cash flow, credit, expenses, financial condition, income, liabilities, liquidity, locations, marketing, operations, prospects, sales, strategies, taxation or other achievement, results or condition or in those of any of the Company's competitors, in each case irrespective of accuracy or validity and whether or not adverse or material; and\n\u25cf\nthe general volatility of stock markets, consumer and investor confidence and the economy generally (which often affect the prices of stock issued by the Company and many others without regard to financial results or condition).\nIf the Company issues (other than at fair market value for cash) or the Company's co-founders sell a large number of shares of SGRP Common Stock, or if the market perceives such an issuance or sale is likely or imminent, the market price of SGRP Common Stock could decline and that decline could be significant.\nThe Company also has repurchased SGRP Common Stock from time to time, and currently has in place a Repurchase Program (as defined and described in Item 5 - Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities, below). Those repurchases could adversely affect the market liquidity of the SGRP Common Stock.\nIn addition, the volatility in the market price of SGRP Common Stock could lead to class action securities litigation that (however unjustified) could in turn impose substantial costs on the Company, divert management's attention and resources and harm the Company's stock price, business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to the Company's Significant Stockholders: Potential Voting Control and Conflicts\nThe Company's co-founders, Mr. Robert G. Brown and Mr. William H. Bartels are directors, executive officers (Chairman and Vice-Chairman, respectively) and significant stockholders of the Company. Mr. Brown beneficially owns approximately 32.5%; Mr. Bartels beneficially owns approximately 24.0%; and they own approximately 56.5% in the aggregate of the SGRP Common Stock, which amounts were calculated using total beneficial ownership (15.4 million shares) and their individual beneficial ownerships (7.1 million shares and 5.3 million shares, respectively) at December 31, 2014. These ownerships included all shares beneficially owned under currently exercisable vested options. Mr. Brown and Mr. Bartels have, should they choose to act together, and under certain circumstances Mr. Brown acting alone may have, the ability to control the election or removal of directors, the appointment or removal of executives, the approval or disapproval of acquisitions, mergers, conflicts of interest, and all other matters that must or may be approved by the Company's stockholders. In any event, Mr. Brown and Mr. Bartels continue to have significant influence over the Company's business and operations and the outcome of the Company's corporate actions, including those involving stockholder approvals. The interests of any significant stockholder may be different from time to time from, and potentially in conflict with, the interests of other stockholders, and ownership concentration could delay or prevent a change in the Company's control or otherwise discourage the Company's potential acquisition by another person, any of which could cause the market price of the SGRP Common Stock to decline and that decline could be significant.\nRisks of Dilution\nThe Company may issue stock options and award restricted stock to directors, officers, employees and consultants in the future at Common Stock per-share exercise prices below the price you may have paid. In addition, the Company may issue shares of SGRP Common Stock in the future in furtherance of the Company's acquisitions or development of businesses or assets. Each of those and other issuances of SGRP Common Stock could have a dilutive effect on the value of your shares, depending on the price the Company is paid (or the value of the assets or business acquired) for such shares, market conditions at the time and other factors.\nRisks of a Nasdaq Delisting\nThere can be no assurance that the Company will be able to comply in the future with the Bid Price Rule or Nasdaq's continued listing requirements. If the Company fails to satisfy the Bid Price Rule and continues to be in non-compliance after notice and the applicable six month grace period ends, Nasdaq may commence delisting procedures against the Company (during which the Company will have additional time of up to six months to appeal and correct its non-compliance). If the SGRP Common Stock shares were ultimately delisted by Nasdaq, the market liquidity of the SGRP Common Stock could be adversely affected and its market price could decrease, even though such shares may continue to be traded \"over the counter\", due to (among other things) the potential for increased spreads between bids and asks, lower trading volumes and reporting delays in over-the-counter trades and the negative implications and perceptions that could arise from such a delisting.\nRisks of Having Material Local Investors in International and Domestic Subsidiaries\nThe Company's international model is to join forces with Local Investors having merchandising service expertise and combine their knowledge of the local market with the Company's proprietary software and expertise in the merchandising business. The Company also has begun to use this model in the United States (see Item 1 - The Company's Domestic and International Segments, above). As a result, each of the Company's international subsidiaries (other than Canada and Japan) and NMS domestically is owned in material part by an entity in the local country where the international or domestic subsidiary resides and that entity is not otherwise affiliated with the Company (e.g., the \"Local Investor\"). The agreements between the Company and the Local Investor in the respective international or domestic subsidiaries specify, among other things, the equity, programming and support services the Company is required to provide and the equity, credit support, certain services and management support that the Local Investor is required to provide to the international or domestic subsidiary. Certain of those subsidiaries also may be procuring field merchandising execution through affiliates of the applicable Local Investors. In the event of any disagreement or other dispute in the business relationships between the Company and Local Investor, it is possible that the Local Investor may have one or more conflicts of interest with respect to the relationship and could cause the applicable international or domestic subsidiary to operate or otherwise act in a way that is not in the Company's best interests.\nThe agreements generally have unlimited contract terms and parties generally do not have the right to unilaterally withdraw. However, a non-defaulting party has the right to terminate such agreement upon the other party's default, receipt of notice and failure to cure within a specified period (generally 60 days internationally or 30 days domestically). In addition, either party, at any time after the end of a specified period (usually between three and five years), may: (1) sell all or part of its equity interest in the international subsidiary to a third party by providing a written notice to the other party of such intentions (in which case the other party has the right of first refusal and may purchase the equity of the offering party under the same terms and conditions) (a \"Right of First Refusal\"); or (2) offer to purchase the equity of the other party (in which case the other party generally has 120 days to either accept or reject the offer or to reverse the transaction and actually purchase the offering party's equity under the same terms and conditions) (a \"Buy/Sell Right\").\nThe Company believes its relationships with the Local Investors in its international subsidiaries remain good. Several of the Company's respective international subsidiary contracts are either at or near the end of the applicable periods during which either of the parties may trigger the Right of First Refusal and Buy/Sell provisions described above. Both the Company and such Local Investors, as part of their ongoing relationship, are or will be assessing appropriate action as described above.\nThere can be no assurance that the Company could (if necessary under the circumstances) replace equity, credit support, management, field merchandiser and other services currently provided by any Local Investor in sufficient time to perform its client obligations or that the Company could provide these services and or equity in the event the Local Stockholder was to sell its stock or reduce any support to the Company's subsidiary in the applicable country. Any cancellation, other nonperformance or material change under the subsidiary agreements with Local Investors could have a material adverse effect on the Company or its estimated or desired assets, business, capital, cash flow, credit, expenses, financial condition, income, liabilities, liquidity, locations, marketing, operations, prospects, sales, strategies, taxation or other achievement, results or condition.\nRisks Associated with International and Domestic Subsidiaries\nWhile the Company endeavors to limit its exposure for claims and losses in any international or domestic consolidated subsidiary through contractual provisions, insurance and use of single purpose entities for such ventures, there can be no assurance that the Company will not be held liable for the claims against and losses of a particular international or domestic consolidated subsidiary under applicable local law or local interpretation of any subsidiary agreements or insurance provisions. If any such claims and losses should occur, be material in amount and be successfully asserted against the Company, such claims and losses could have a material adverse effect on the Company or its estimated or desired assets, business, capital, cash flow, credit, expenses, financial condition, income, liabilities, liquidity, locations, marketing, operations, prospects, sales, strategies, taxation or other achievement, results or condition.\nRisks Associated with Foreign Currency\nThe Company also has foreign currency exposure associated with its international subsidiaries. In 2014, these foreign currency exposures are primarily concentrated in the Australian Dollar, Canadian Dollar, Mexican Peso, South African Rand, Chinese Yuan, Indian Rupee and Japanese Yen.\nRisks Associated with International Business\nThe Company's expansion strategy includes expansion into various countries around the world. While the Company endeavors to limit its exposure by entering only countries where the political, social and economic environments are conducive to doing business, there can be no assurances that the respective business environments will remain favorable. In the future, the Company's international operations and sales may be affected by the following risks, which may adversely affect United States companies doing business in foreign countries:\n\u2022\nPolitical and economic risks, including terrorist attacks and political instability;\n\u2022\nVarious forms of protectionist trade legislation that currently exist or have been proposed;\n\u2022\nExpenses associated with customizing services and technology;\n\u2022\nLocal laws and business practices that favor local competition;\n\u2022\nDependence on local vendors and potential for undisclosed related party transactions;\n\u2022\nMultiple, conflicting and changing governmental laws, regulations and enforcement;\n\u2022\nPotentially adverse tax and employment law consequences;\n\u2022\nLocal accounting principles, practices and procedures and limited familiarity with US generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\");\n\u2022\nLocal legal principles, practices and procedures, local contract review and negotiation, and limited familiarity with contract issues (excessive warranties, extra-territoriality, sweeping intellectual property claims and the like);\n\u2022\nForeign currency exchange rate fluctuations and limits on the export of funds;\n\u2022\nSubstantial communication barriers, including those arising from language, culture, custom and time zones; and\n\u2022\nSupervisory challenges arising from agreements, distance, physical absences and such communication barriers.", "PERMNO": 83303, "SIC": 7389, "TIC": "SGRP"}
