You should consider carefully the following risk factors and all other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If any of the following risks, as well as additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial but are in fact material, occur, our business, liquidity, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. If this were to happen, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly, and you could lose all or a part of the value of your ownership in our common stock. Some statements in this Annual Report, including statements in the following risk factors, constitute forward-looking statements. Please refer to the section in this Annual Report entitled \u201cForward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nThe cyclical nature of automotive sales and production can adversely affect our business. The market is currently experiencing a significant decline in light vehicle production (LVP) and LVP may decline for the next several years. A prolonged recession and/or a downturn in our industry or deteriorating performance of our business, could adversely affect our business and require impairments or restructuring actions.\nOur business is related to LVP in the global market and by our customers, and automotive sales and LVP are critical drivers for our sales. A prolonged downturn in or uncertainty relating to global or regional economic conditions, or any significant reduction in automotive sales and/or LVP by our customers, whether due to general economic conditions or any other factors relevant to sales or LVP, will likely have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. If global economic conditions deteriorate or economic uncertainty increases, our customers and potential customers may experience deterioration of their businesses, which may result in the delay or cancellation of plans to purchase our products.\nFurthermore, our ability to generate cash from our operations is highly dependent on regional and global economic conditions, automotive sales and LVP. Additionally, we have a substantial number of important product and program launches in the next 18 months. These launches are important from both a sales and cash flow perspective. A continued lower LVP or lower sales volumes on these new vehicles being launched as well as lower sales on other vehicles may delay the return on our investment in R&D and a return on the resources expended to ensure timely and quality launches. Given the high level of R&D that is required in our products, including new product and program launches, a significantly negative cash flow could have a materially negative impact on our business. A prolonged downturn in global economic conditions or LVP would likely result in us experiencing a significantly negative cash flow.\nOrder intake and the dollar amount of the order intake are not necessarily indicative of future net sales revenues and are subject to a number of uncertainties. If order intake fails to translate into future net sales revenue it may adversely affect our business.\nWe monitor order intake to make certain predictions related to our capital needs and expenditures and in providing long-term targets, earnings guidance and estimates. Our order intake is the estimated future average annual sales attributable to documented new business awarded based on estimated average annual product volumes, average annual sales price for such products over their anticipated life, and exchange rates. Order intake is not recorded as revenue until the order is completed. The aggregate value of order intake is considered our \u201corder book\u201d and is part of it until the products are manufactured and delivered to customers and we realize net sales revenue from such orders. Since the general lead time from an \u201corder\u201d to the start of production is three to four years and it may take several months for production of a certain vehicle model to fully ramp up, the assumptions we use to determine order intake may no longer be accurate at the time production begins or the order is completed. For example, active safety and restraint control systems order intake from 2013 to 2015 is reflected in sales from 2017 to 2019.\nTo determine our estimated order intake, we make several assumptions related to vehicle production in a particular year of a particular model, annual product values, sales prices for such products and exchange rates. If any of the inputs to these assumptions fail to materialize as we expect, the net sales revenue actually realized may be adversely impacted. We cannot predict when our customers will decide to either increase or reduce inventory levels or whether new inventory levels will approximate historical inventory levels. Our customers generally do not guarantee order volumes. Additionally, the commercial success of the vehicle models which include our products will also impact whether our order intake translates into net sales revenue. Finally, any significant reduction in automotive sales and/or LVP by our customers, whether due to general economic conditions or any other factors relevant to sales or LVP, will likely have a material adverse effect on whether net sales revenue is ultimately realized from our estimated order book.\nGrowth rates in safety content per vehicle, which may be impacted by changes in consumer trends and political decisions, could affect our results in the future.\nVehicles produced in different markets may have various safety content values. For now, our products are typically found in vehicles with higher safety content. Because growth in global LVP is highly concentrated in markets such as China and India, our operating results may suffer if the safety content per vehicle remains low in our growth markets. As safety content per vehicle is also an indicator of our sales development, should this trend continue, the average safety systems per vehicle could decline.\nOur estimate of total addressable market is subject to numerous uncertainties. If we have overestimated the size of our total addressable market, our future growth rate may be limited.\nThe Company\u2019s estimates of total addressable market, or TAM, are based on a variety of inputs, including production estimates per product group (which are based in significant part on LVP data and estimates from IHS), and in particular in relation to content per vehicle, or CPV, estimates, the Company\u2019s own market insights, estimates as to the pace and extent of standard-setting and regulatory change, internal market intelligence on prices and penetration/adoption rates of each expected product group and the Company\u2019s history operating in the market (including, among other things, its order and bid experience).\nWe have not independently verified any third-party information, including LVP estimates by IHS, and cannot assure you of its accuracy or completeness. While we believe our market size estimates are reasonable, such information is inherently imprecise. For example, IHS\u2019s January 2020 estimates of LVP over the time period from 2020 to 2023 are reduced by approximately 50 million vehicles compared to forecasts in June 2018 (around the time of the completion of our spin-off from Autoliv). Compared to forecasts in June 2018, the current global LVP forecast is 11% lower for 2019, 13% lower for 2020 and 12% lower for 2022. In Western Europe, the current forecast is 10% lower for 2019, 11% lower for 2020 and 5% lower for 2022. In North America, the current forecast is 7% lower for 2019, 6% lower for 2020 and 7% lower for 2022. In China, the current forecast is 18% lower for 2019, 22% lower for 2020 and 19% lower for 2022. If IHS or other third-party or internally generated data that is used in our estimates proves to be inaccurate or we make errors in our assumptions based on that data, our actual market may be more limited than our estimates. In addition, these inaccuracies or errors may cause us to misallocate capital and other critical business resources, which could harm our business. Even if our total addressable market meets our size estimates and experiences growth, we may not continue to grow our share of the market. Our growth is subject to many factors, including our success in implementing our business strategy, which is subject to many risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, the estimates of our total addressable market included in this Annual Report should not be taken as indicative of our ability to grow our business.\nWe operate in highly competitive markets.\nThe markets in which we operate are highly competitive. We compete with a number of companies that design, produce and sell similar products. Among other factors, our products compete on the basis of price, quality, manufacturing and distribution capability, design and performance, technological innovation, delivery and service. Some of our competitors are subsidiaries (or divisions, units or similar) of companies that are larger than we are and have greater financial and other resources than us. Some of our competitors as well as some of our customers have strategic relationships with outside partners, enabling them to pool resources. Additionally, some of our competitors may also have \u201cpreferred status\u201d as a result of special relationships or ownership interests with certain customers. Our ability to compete successfully depends, in large part, on our ability to innovate and manufacture products that have commercial success with consumers, differentiate our products from those of our competitors, deliver quality products in the time frames required by our customers, create confidence in our financial stability, and achieve best-cost production.\nFurthermore, given that some of our competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial resources, our ability to create confidence in our customers and potential customers that we have the financial strength and resources to support their ambitious programs and can timely deliver quality products over the life of a vehicle program will also be a significant factor in our ability to be competitive. Because the supply chain in our industry is very complex and many of our competitors have greater financial resources, our customers and potential customers may consider us as a supply risk and become concerned that we will be unable to continue to provide products to them at a quality level that meets their needs. If we are unable to create confidence in our financial position, customers may choose other suppliers, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur ability to maintain and improve existing products, while successfully developing and introducing distinctive new and enhanced products that anticipate changing customer and consumer preferences and capitalize upon emerging technologies will\nbe a significant factor in our ability to be competitive. If we are unsuccessful or are less successful than our competitors in predicting the course of market development, developing innovative products, processes, and/or use of materials or adapting to new technologies or evolving regulatory, industry or customer requirements, we will suffer from a competitive disadvantage. Further, the global automotive industry is experiencing a period of significant technological change, including a focus on environmentally sustainable products. As a result, the success of portions of our business requires us to develop, acquire and/or incorporate new technologies. There is a risk that our investments in research and development initiatives will not lead to successful new products and a corresponding increase in revenue. We may also encounter increased competition in the future from existing or new competitors. The inability to compete successfully could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe operate in a developing market that may be subject to greater uncertainty and fluctuations in levels of competition than a more mature market.\nThe field of active safety is a developing segment in the automotive industry and is expected to act as a basis for and enable the development and introduction of commercially viable autonomous vehicles. The number of competitors may increase as suppliers from outside the traditional automotive industry, such as Google, Argo, Uber, Lyft, Cruise, Samsung, Panasonic, Here, Tesla, Intel, NVIDIA and other technology companies, consider the significant business opportunities presented by autonomous driving. Some of our customers are also partnering together to develop autonomous driving solutions. The evolving nature of the competitive landscape creates greater uncertainty than the traditional automotive market.\nProducts and services provided by companies outside the automotive industry may also reduce demand for our products, which require substantial investment in research and development. For example, there has been an increase in consumer preferences for mobility on demand services, such as car- and ride-sharing, as opposed to automobile ownership, which may result in a long-term reduction in the number of vehicles per capita. Today, in most markets, active safety products are considered to be premium equipment rather than standard automotive safety items, which can create significant volatility in demand for certain of our products.\nThe high development costs of active safety and autonomous driving products increases the risk that we will be unable to effectively compete in the market and our inability to effectively manage the timing, quality and costs of new program launches could adversely affect our financial performance.\nMost of our products are technologically complex and innovative and there can be a significant amount of time between design and production. Development delays resulting from the challenges of integrating new functionality into vehicles and the evolution of our customers\u2019 performance requirements during the development cycle subject us to the risk that our customers cancel or postpone a contract in the time period that it takes us to begin production of a particular product. If we are unable to develop and deliver innovative and competitive products, or unable to do so within the same timeframe as our competitors, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nTo compete effectively in the automotive supply industry, we must be able to launch new products to meet our customers\u2019 timing, performance and quality standards. Our inability to do so may result in the loss of awarded business, or being put on a \u201c new business hold\u201d (prohibiting us from competing for new business with the customer), as well as significant liabilities and/penalties. Certain state of the art products we launch may need to be developed on an especially accelerated time frame for speed-to-market. There is a risk that we will not be able to install and certify the equipment needed to produce products for new programs in time for the start of production, or that the transitioning of our manufacturing facilities and resources to full production for such new programs will not impact production rates or other operational efficiency measures at our facilities. In addition, there is a risk that our customers will not execute on schedule the launch of their new product programs. A declining LVP increases the risk that new programs will be delayed or have a slow launch process.\nAdditionally, as a Tier 1 automotive supplier, we must effectively coordinate the activities of numerous suppliers in order to launch programs successfully. Given the complexity of new program launches, especially involving new and innovative technologies, we may experience difficulties managing product quality, timeliness and associated costs. These risks with new technologies are increased when the customer relationship is new and the customer is subject to the same pressures on product quality and timeliness. In addition, new program launches require a significant ramp up of costs; however, the sales related to these new programs generally are dependent upon the timing and success of the introduction of new vehicles by our customers. Furthermore, if it becomes necessary to request that our customers cover or share in these costs due to the complexities and changes requested by the customers, this could impact our relationships with our customers and the development of these programs. These negotiations can take considerable time and effort and risk deterioration of our relationships with our customers, and there can be no assurances that any specific negotiations will result in amendments that are beneficial to us on a timely basis. We have a significant number of new program and product launches in the next 18 months. As the start of production grows closer for these programs and products, the potential risk related to timeliness and potential costs for failure to\ndeliver timely may increase depending on the program or product as there is less time to implement any necessary changes to these programs even if they are requested by our customers. We may also have contractual liabilities for any such delays. Additionally, any such delays may impact our relationship with our customers and could impact potential future business opportunities. These issues may also be exacerbated due to deteriorating business conditions or declines in LVP. Our inability to effectively manage the timing, quality and costs of these new program launches could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAutonomous driving involves complex technology and requires a number of different hardware and software competencies and technologies and there is a risk that these competencies or technologies will not develop at a sufficient pace to address marketplace needs.\nAutonomous driving requires various types of sensor technology, including cameras, radar and LiDAR technology as well as software technology to control such sensors. These technologies are under various stages of development and marketplace acceptance. There is a risk that these technological solutions will not develop at a sufficient pace to gain acceptance with our customers. If we are unable to develop our autonomous driving solutions fast enough to keep pace with the market, our future business prospects, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nThere are also challenges to develop autonomous driving solutions that are outside of our control, including regulatory requirements from state and federal agencies, cybersecurity and privacy concerns, product liability concerns and perceptions of drivers regarding autonomous driving capabilities and solutions. We may need to adjust our strategy and projected timelines based on how these challenges, and others, evolve over time. There is a risk that these challenges will not be overcome, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe inability to effectively manage the timing, quality and costs of new program launches could adversely affect our financial performance.\nTo compete effectively in the automotive supply industry, we must be able to launch new products to meet our customers\u2019 timing, performance and quality standards. Our inability to do so may result in the loss of awarded business as well as significant liabilities and/penalties. Certain state of the art products we launch may need to be developed on an especially accelerated time frame for speed-to-market. There is a risk that we will not be able to install and certify the equipment needed to produce products for new programs in time for the start of production, or that the transitioning of our manufacturing facilities and resources to full production for such new programs will not impact production rates or other operational efficiency measures at our facilities. In addition, there is a risk that our customers will not execute on schedule the launch of their new product programs, for which we might supply products. Additionally, as a Tier 1 automotive supplier, we must effectively coordinate the activities of numerous suppliers in order to launch programs successfully. Given the complexity of new program launches, especially involving new and innovative technologies, we may experience difficulties managing product quality, timeliness and associated costs. These risks with new technologies are increased when the customer relationship is new and the customer is subject to the same pressures on product quality and timeliness. In addition, new program launches require a significant ramp up of costs; however, the sales related to these new programs generally are dependent upon the timing and success of the introduction of new vehicles by our customers. Furthermore, if it becomes necessary to request that our customers cover or share in these costs due to the complexities and changes requested by the customers, this could impact our relationships with our customers and the development of these programs. These negotiations can take considerable time and effort and risk deterioration of our relationships with our customers, and there can be no assurances that any specific negotiations will result in amendments that are beneficial to us on a timely basis. Our inability to effectively manage the timing, quality and costs of these new program launches could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nA prolonged recession and/or a downturn in our industry or deteriorating performance of our business, or further decreases in our market capitalization, could adversely affect our business and require impairments or restructuring actions or require us to seek additional sources of financing to continue our operations, which may not be available to us or be available only on materially different terms than what has historically been available.\nOur ability to generate cash from our operations is highly dependent on regional and global economic conditions, automotive sales and LVP. A prolonged downturn in or uncertainty relating to global or regional economic conditions, a downturn in the automotive industry or LVP are conditions that could adversely impact our business. Such adverse impacts could require us to shut down plants or result in impairment charges, restructuring actions or changes in our valuation allowances against deferred tax assets, which could be material to our financial condition and results of operations. If global economic conditions deteriorate or economic uncertainty increases, our customers and potential customers may experience deterioration of their\nbusinesses, which may result in the delay or cancellation of plans to purchase our products. Deteriorating global economic conditions and/or deteriorating performance of our business may also result in a negative impact on our market capitalization, which could also result in impairment charges. For example, given our market capitalization, further decreases in our market capitalization may necessitate additional impairment testing. If it is determined that an impairment has occurred this could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nA prolonged downturn in global economic conditions or LVP would likely result in us experiencing a significantly negative cash flow. Similarly, if cash losses from customer defaults rise sharply, we would experience a negative cash flow. Such negative cash flow could result in our having insufficient funds to continue our operations unless we can procure external financing, which may not be possible. These risks could be exacerbated by instability in the global credit markets and global economic pressure. If external financing is unavailable to us when necessary, we may have insufficient funds to continue our operations.\nWe may not have sufficient resources to fund all future research and development and capital expenditures or possible acquisitions or joint ventures.\nIn order to remain competitive, we must make substantial investments in research and development of new or enhanced products. Our products may require significant resources to develop both hardware and software solutions. Challenges of integrating new functionality into vehicles and the evolution of our customers\u2019 performance requirements during development may also increase research and development costs. Customer demands for changes to our products to meet such performance requirements are difficult to predict both in terms of timing and cost. Since our revenue is largely based on sales over time, new customer demands can delay payment for our products which can make it difficult for us to fund these critical up-front investments. We may be unable to fund all of our research and development and capital investment needs or possible acquisitions or joint ventures, and we may have to pass on valuable long-term opportunities that arise. Our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on a variety of factors, some of which will not be within our control, including the existence of a public offering market, investor perceptions of us, our businesses and the industries in which we operate, and general economic conditions. Failure to successfully raise needed capital on a timely or cost-effective basis could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur ability to raise capital in the future may be limited, which could limit our business plan or adversely affect the rights of our stockholders.\nAlthough we expect our current cash balance, combined with our future cash flows, will address our capital needs for at least the next 12 months, we cannot be assured that this will be the case. Our operating environment is increasingly challenging, and our business and strategic plans may consume resources faster than we presently anticipate. Specifically, short term deteriorating business conditions and lower than expected light vehicle production, along with the demand for increased RD&E investment to support our continued strong order intake, the successful execution of challenging customer projects, and the continued development of our product portfolio could potentially result in a future need to raise additional capital. We may finance future cash needs through public or private equity offerings and may also use debt financings or strategic collaborations and licensing arrangements. Our ability to access the capital markets, if needed, on a timely basis or at all will depend on a number of factors, such as the state of the financial markets and securities law requirements and standards. In the event of rising interest rates, disruptions in financial markets, negative perceptions of our business or our financial strength, or other factors that would increase our cost of borrowing, we cannot be sure of our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, on terms acceptable to us, and we may be forced to consider alternative transactions (including the sale of non-core / non-active safety assets on terms our existing security holders perceive as unattractive) in order to fund our operations, repay debt or make new investments, or we may be unable to do so.\nEven if we are successful in raising any required funds through additional financings, this may adversely impact our existing security holders. For example, if we raise funds by issuing additional securities, the securities that we issue may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock or may be issued at a discount to the market price of our common stock which would result in dilution to our existing stockholders. If we raise additional funds by issuing debt, we may be subject to debt covenants, which could place limitations on our operations. Further, we may incur substantial costs in pursuing future capital and/or financing, including investment banking fees, legal fees, accounting fees, printing and distribution expenses and other costs. We may also be required to recognize non-cash expenses in connection with certain securities we may issue, such as convertible notes and warrants, which will adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to raise required capital on a timely basis, we may be forced to adjust our strategic and business plans to prioritize more essential funding needs. This could result in delaying certain research or development initiatives, which could impact our ability to develop innovative products and technologies. If capital is not available, or is not available on acceptable\nterms if and when needed, our ability to fund our operations, take advantage of market opportunities, develop or enhance our products, or otherwise respond to market changes or competitive pressures could be limited.\nOur indebtedness may harm our financial condition and results of operations.\nAs of December 30, 2019, we have outstanding debt of $171 million. We may incur additional debt for a variety of reasons. Although our significant debt agreements do not have any financial covenants, our level of indebtedness will have several important effects on our future operations, including, without limitation (i) a portion of our cash flows from operations will be dedicated to the payment of any interest or could be used for amortization required with respect to outstanding indebtedness; (ii) increases in our outstanding indebtedness and leverage will increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions, as well as to competitive pressure; (iii) depending on the levels of our outstanding debt, our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, acquisitions, capital expenditures, general corporate and other purposes may be limited; and (iv) potential future tightening of the availability of capital both from financial institutions and the debt markets may have an adverse effect on our ability to access additional capital.\nWe may not be able to protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property rights, which could result in the loss of our rights or increased costs.\nWe have developed a considerable amount of proprietary technology related to our products and rely on a number of patents to protect our intellectual property rights in such technology. Our intellectual property plays an important role in maintaining our competitive position in a number of the markets we serve. In addition to our in-house research and development efforts, we have acquired and may continue to seek to acquire rights to new intellectual property through corporate acquisitions, asset acquisitions, licensing and joint venture arrangements. Developments or assertions by or against us relating to our intellectual property rights could negatively impact our business. If claims alleging patent, copyright or trademark infringement are brought against us and are successfully prosecuted against us, they could result in substantial costs.\nIf we are not able to protect our patents, trademarks, or other intellectual property rights, either owned or licensed by us, against infringement and unauthorized use, we could lose those rights and/or incur substantial costs policing and defending those rights. We also generate license revenue from our intellectual property, which we may lose if we do not adequately protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights. Our means of protecting our intellectual property may not be adequate, and our competitors may independently develop technologies that are similar or superior to our proprietary technologies, or design around the patents we own or license. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as the laws of the U.S. If we cannot protect our proprietary technology, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, certain of our products utilize components that are developed by third parties and licensed to us or our joint ventures. If claims alleging patent, copyright or trademark infringement are brought against such licensors and successfully prosecuted, they could result in substantial costs, and we may not be able to replace the functions provided by these licensors. Alternate sources for the technology currently licensed to us or our joint ventures may not be available in a timely manner, may not provide the same functions as currently provided or may be more expensive than products currently used. Additionally, there is a risk that any patents owned or licensed by us may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, limiting competitive advantage of affected products or technologies.\nBecause we develop proprietary information through our in-house research and development efforts, consulting arrangements and research collaborations with other entities or organizations, there is also a risk that our attempts to protect this proprietary information by entering into confidentiality agreements, or consulting, services or employment agreements that contain non-disclosure and non-use provisions, with our employees, consultants, contractors, scientific advisors and third parties are unsuccessful. Even if agreements are entered into, these agreements may be breached or may otherwise fail to prevent disclosure, third-party infringement or misappropriation of our proprietary information, may be limited as to their term and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure or use of proprietary information. If we develop an increasing amount of our intellectual property through collaborations and development agreements, more of the technology we depend on could be subject to risks related to protecting these rights. Any of the risks related to the protection of our proprietary technology described above could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nSome of our products and technologies may use \u201copen source\u201d software, which may restrict how we use or distribute our products or require that we release the source code of certain products subject to those licenses.\nSome of our products and technologies may incorporate software licensed under so-called \u201copen source\u201d licenses. In addition to risks related to license requirements, usage of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on origin of the software. Additionally, open\nsource licenses typically require that source code subject to the license be made available to the public and that any modifications or derivative works to open source software continue to be licensed under open source licenses. These open source licenses typically mandate that proprietary software, when combined in specific ways with open source software, become subject to the open source license. If we combine our proprietary software in such a way with open source software, we could be required to release the source code of our proprietary software. Few courts have interpreted open source licenses, and the manner in which these licenses may be interpreted and enforced is therefore subject to some uncertainty.\nIf these risks materialize, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe discontinuation, lack of commercial success, or loss of business with respect to a customer or particular vehicle model for which we are a significant supplier could reduce our sales and harm our profitability.\nA number of our customer contracts require us to supply a customer\u2019s annual requirements for a particular vehicle model and assembly facilities, rather than for manufacturing a specific quantity of products. Such contracts range from one year to the life of the model, which is generally four to seven years. These contracts are often subject to renegotiation, sometimes as frequent as on an annual basis, which may affect product pricing, and generally may be terminated by our customers at any time. The unpredictable nature of such customer contracts has made, and may continue to make, our sales variable. Furthermore, the discontinuation of, the loss of business with respect to, or a lack of commercial success of a customer or particular vehicle model or brand for which we are a significant supplier could reduce our sales and harm our profitability.\nScaling our business has become increasingly critical to our success as OEMs have adopted global vehicle platforms and sought to increase standardization, reduce per unit cost and increase capital efficiency. We are investing in technologies that are intended to become the architecture for other products. If we are not able to scale according to our current expected timelines and needs of our current and prospective customers, we will lose the trust of our customers and our customer relationships may suffer.\nWe may incur material losses and costs as a result of product liability, warranty and recall claims that may be brought against us or our customers.\nWe face risks related to product liability claims, warranty claims and recalls in the event that any of our products actually or allegedly are defective, fail to perform as expected or the use of our products results, or is alleged to result, in bodily injury and/or property damage. We may not be able to anticipate all of the possible performance or reliability problems that could arise with our products after they are released to the market. Additionally, increasing regulation, including reporting requirements, regarding potentially defective products, particularly in the U.S., may increase the possibility that we become involved in additional product liability or recall investigations or claims. There is a risk that our product liability and product recall insurance will not provide adequate coverage against potential claims, such insurance will not be available in the appropriate markets or that we will not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future. There is also a risk that Autoliv or one of our customers may be unable or unwilling to indemnify us for product liability, warranty or recall claims although they are contractually obligated to do so or we may be required to indemnify Autoliv or such customer for such claims, which may significantly increase our exposure and potential loss with respect to any such claims.\nThere is a risk that our current and future investments in our engineering, design, and quality infrastructure will be insufficient and that our products could suffer from defects or other deficiencies or that we will experience material warranty claims or additional product recalls. This is especially relevant in the dynamic active safety market, which is characterized by accelerated development cycles, fluctuating performance requirements and identification of potential failure modes, and the need to integrate products into advanced vehicle environments In the future, we could experience additional material warranty or product liability losses and incur significant costs to process and defend these claims.\nEscalating pricing pressures from our customers may adversely affect our business.\nThe automotive supplier industry continues to experience increasingly aggressive pricing pressure from OEM customers. This trend is partly attributable to the major automobile manufacturers\u2019 strong purchasing power. As an automotive component manufacturer, we may be expected to quote fixed prices or be forced to accept prices with annual price reduction commitments for long-term sales arrangements or discounted reimbursements for engineering work. Price reductions may impact our sales and profit margins. Our future profitability will depend upon, among other things, our ability to continuously reduce our cost per unit and maintain our cost structure. Our profitability is also influenced by our success in designing and marketing technological improvements in automotive safety systems. If we are unable to offset continued price reductions, these price reductions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nDisruptions in our supply or delivery chain, or those of our OEM customers, could cause one or more of our customers to halt or delay production.\nWe, as with other component manufactures in the automotive industry, ship our products to customer vehicle assembly facilities throughout the world on a \u201cjust-in-time\u201d basis to allow our customers to maintain low inventory levels. Our suppliers (external suppliers as well as our own production sites) use a similar method in providing raw materials and components to us. This \u201cjust-in-time\u201d method makes the logistics supply chain in our industry very complex and vulnerable to disruptions.\nDisruptions in our supply chain such as large recalls or field actions impacting suppliers, facility closures, strikes, electrical outages, critical health and safety and other working conditions issues, pandemic diseases, such as the coronavirus (COVID-19), natural disasters or other logistical or mechanical failures, could inhibit our ability to timely deliver on orders. We may also experience disruptions if there are delays in customs processing, including if we are unable to obtain government authorization to export or import certain materials.\nIn addition, financial pressure and/or instability resulting from a prolonged downturn in or uncertainty relating to global or regional economic conditions, or any significant reduction in automotive sales and/or LVP, may affect our suppliers\u2019 agility and willingness and/or ability to accommodate our commercial demands, including with respect to cost and timing.\nWhen we fail to timely deliver or cause a disruption in our customers\u2019 production, we risk damaging our customer relationship, and may lose the business or have to absorb our own costs for identifying and resolving the ultimate problem as well as expeditiously producing and shipping replacement components or products. Generally, we must also carry the costs associated with \u201ccatching up,\u201d such as overtime and premium freight, and may be financially responsible for damages to the customer caused by such delays.\nSimilar widespread disruptions in our OEM customers\u2019 supply chains may also cause a halt or delay in production that could adversely affect our business. In particular, if the current coronavirus outbreak continues and results in a prolonged period of travel, commercial and other similar restrictions, particularly to and from China, we and our OEM customers could experience supply chain and production disruptions. The extent to which the coronavirus impacts our results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nWe currently do not have long-term supply contracts with many of our third-party suppliers and make substantially all of our purchases on a purchase order basis. Our standard terms and conditions of purchase require a commitment from our suppliers to produce raw materials or components at the last piece part price accepted by the parties for at least five years following the end of a production contract, and service parts for fifteen (15) years after fulfillment of a purchase order. However, not all suppliers accept these terms and, even if accepted, we cannot be assured they will honor their contractual commitments. Autonomous driving solutions are rapidly developing and increasingly complex and require the use of advanced components that may be single-sourced or not easily replaced if the technology or the vendor does not perform as expected or agree to supply on a continuing basis. We expect that it would take approximately 12 to 18 months to transition from a current supplier to new providers for our more advanced components. Such a transition would also likely require a qualification process by our customers.\nWe may choose to pursue arrangements with suppliers that include commitments to purchase specified quantities over extended periods or nonrefundable deposits or loans in exchange for capacity commitments. If we do so, we may not be able to make any such arrangement in a timely fashion or at all, and any arrangements may be costly, reduce our financial flexibility, and not be on terms favorable to us. To date, we have not entered into such arrangements with our suppliers.\nWe are subject to risks associated with the development and implementation of new manufacturing process technology.\nWe may not be successful or efficient in developing or implementing new production processes. We are continually engaged in the transition from our existing process to the next-generation process technology. This consistent innovation involves significant expense and carries inherent risks, including difficulties in designing and developing next-generation process technologies, development and production timing delays, lower than anticipated manufacturing yields, and product defects and errors. Production issues can lead to increased costs and may affect our ability to meet product demand, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAdditionally, scaling our business has become increasingly critical to our success as OEMs have adopted global vehicle platforms and sought to increase standardization, reduce per unit cost and increase capital efficiency and profitability. We are investing in technologies that are intended to become the architecture for other products. If we are not able to scale according to our current expected timelines and needs of our current and prospective customers, we will lose the trust of our customers and our customer relationships may suffer.\nWork stoppages or other labor issues at our customers\u2019 facilities or at our facilities could adversely affect our operations.\nBecause the automotive industry relies heavily on \u201cjust-in-time\u201d delivery of components during the assembly and manufacture of vehicles, a work stoppage at one or more of our facilities could have material adverse effects on our business. Similarly, if any of our customers were to experience a work stoppage, that customer may halt or limit the purchase of our products, or a work stoppage at another supplier could interrupt production at one of our customers\u2019 facilities which would have the same effect. A work stoppage at one or more of our facilities or our customers\u2019 facilities could cause us to shut down production facilities supplying these products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in the source, cost, availability of and regulations pertaining to raw materials and components may adversely affect our profit margins.\nOur business uses a broad range of raw materials and components in the manufacture of our products, many of which are generally available from a number of qualified suppliers. Our industry may be affected from time to time by limited supplies or price fluctuations of certain key components and materials. Price fluctuations may intensify or occur with greater frequency as demand for our principal raw materials and components is significantly impacted by demand in emerging markets. Commercial negotiations with our customers and suppliers may not offset the adverse impact of higher raw material, energy and commodity costs. Even where we are able to pass price increases along to our customer, there may be a lapse of time before we are able to do so such that we must absorb the cost increase. Some of our suppliers may not be able to handle the volatility in commodity costs, which could cause them to experience supply disruptions resulting in delivery or production delays by our suppliers. Risks associated with the cost and availability of raw materials and components could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe SEC requires companies that manufacture products containing certain minerals and their derivatives that are, known as \u201cconflict minerals,\u201d originating from the Democratic Republic of Congo or adjoining countries to diligence and report the source of such materials. There are significant consequences associated with complying with these requirements, including diligence efforts to determine the sources of conflict minerals used in our products, changes to our processes or supplies as a result of such diligence and our ability to source \u201cconflict free\u201d materials. Accordingly, these rules could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business could be materially and adversely affected if we lost our largest customers or if they were unable to pay their invoices.\nWe are dependent on a few large customers with strong purchasing power. Business with any given customer is typically split into several contracts (either on the basis of one contract per vehicle model or on a broader platform basis). The loss of business from any of our largest customers (whether by lower overall demand for vehicles, cancellation of existing contracts or the failure to award us new business) could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nCustomers may put us on a \u201cnew business hold,\u201d which limits our ability to quote or be awarded all or part of their future vehicle contracts if quality or other issues arise in the vehicles for which we were a supplier. Such new business holds range in length and scope and are generally accompanied by a certain set of remedial conditions that must be met before we are eligible to bid for new business. Meeting any such conditions within the prescribed timeframe may require additional Company resources. A failure to satisfy any such conditions may have a materially adverse impact on our financial results in the long term. Additionally, we have no fixed volume commitments from our customers. Thus, even if we have won a bid for business from a customer there are no guaranteed purchase volumes.\nThere is a risk that one or more of our largest customers could be unable to pay our invoices as they become due or that a customer will simply refuse to make such payments, for reasons such as financial difficulties. If one of our largest customers would enter into bankruptcy proceedings or similar proceedings whereby contractual commitments are subject to stay of execution and the possibility of legal or other modification, or if one of our largest customers otherwise successfully procures protection against us legally enforcing its obligations, it is likely that we will be forced to record a substantial loss.\nChanges in our product mix may impact our financial performance.\nWe sell products that have varying profit margins. Our financial performance can be impacted depending on the mix of products we sell during a given period. Our earnings guidance and estimates assume a certain geographic sales mix as well as a\nproduct sales mix. There is a risk that the mix of offerings by our customers and demand for such offerings could change. If actual results vary from this projected geographic and product mix of sales, it could have an unfavorable impact on our revenue and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nWe may be involved from time to time in legal proceedings and our business may suffer as a result of adverse outcomes of future legal proceedings.\nWe may be from time to time involved in litigation, regulatory proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes that may be significant. These matters may include, without limitation, disputes with our suppliers and customers, intellectual property claims, stockholder litigation, government investigations, class action lawsuits, personal injury claims, environmental issues, customs and value added tax (VAT) disputes and employment and tax issues. In such matters, government agencies or private parties may seek to recover from us very large, indeterminate amounts in penalties or monetary damages (including, in some cases, treble or punitive damages) or seek to limit our operations in some way. There is a risk that claims may be asserted against us and their magnitude may remain unknown for long periods of time. These types of lawsuits could require significant management time and attention, and a substantial legal liability or adverse regulatory outcome and the substantial expenses to defend the litigation or regulatory proceedings may have a material adverse effect on our customer relationships, business prospects, reputation, operating results, cash flows and financial condition. There is a risk that such proceedings and claims will have a material adverse impact on our profitability and consolidated financial position or that our established reserves or our available insurance will not be adequate to mitigate such impact.\nOur ability to operate our company effectively could be impaired if we fail to attract and retain executive officers and other key personnel.\nWe compete in a market that involves rapidly changing technological and other developments, which requires us to attract and employ a workforce with broad expertise and intellectual capital. Our ability to operate our business and implement our strategies effectively depends, in part, on the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees. In addition, our future success will depend on, among other factors, our ability to attract, develop and retain other qualified personnel, particularly engineers and other employees with software and technical expertise. The loss of the services of any of our senior executives or other key employees or the failure to attract or retain other qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nImpairment charges relating to our assets, goodwill and other intangible assets could adversely affect our financial performance.\nIf one or more of our customers\u2019 facilities cease production or decrease their production volumes, the assets we carry related to our facilities serving such customers may decrease in value because we may no longer be able to utilize or realize them as intended. Where such decreases are significant, such impairments may have a materially adverse impact on our financial results. Impairment of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets may result from, among other things, deterioration in our performance and especially the cash flow performance of these goodwill assets, adverse market conditions (including a resulting decline in our market capitalization from such adverse market conditions or deteriorating performance) and adverse changes in applicable laws or regulations. If there are changes in these circumstances or the other variables associated with the estimates, judgments and assumptions relating to the valuation of goodwill, when assessing the valuation of our goodwill items, we may determine that it is appropriate to write down a portion of our goodwill or intangible assets and record related non-cash impairment charges. In the event that we determine that we are required to write down a portion of our goodwill items and other intangible assets and thereby record related non-cash impairment charges, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nWe face risks related to our defined benefit pension plans and employee benefit plans, including the need for additional funding as well as higher costs and liabilities.\nOur defined benefit pension plans or employee benefit plans may require additional funding or give rise to higher related costs and liabilities which, in some circumstances, could reach material amounts and negatively affect our results of operations. We are required to make certain year-end assumptions regarding our pension plans. Our pension obligations are dependent on several factors, including factors outside our control such as changes in interest rates, the market performance of the diversified investments underlying the pension plans, actuarial data and adjustments and an increase in the minimum funding requirements or other regulatory changes governing the plans. Adverse equity market conditions and volatility in the credit market may have an unfavorable impact on the value of our pension assets and our future estimated pension liabilities. Internal factors such as an adjustment to the level of benefits provided under the plans may also lead to an increase in our pension liability. There are also uncertainties as the Company settles certain benefit plan relationships with Autoliv. If these or other internal and external risks\nwere to occur, alone or in combination, our required contributions to the plans and the costs and net liabilities associated with the plans could increase substantially and have a material effect on our business.\nCybersecurity incidents could disrupt business operations, result in the loss of critical and confidential information, and adversely impact our reputation and results of operations.\nWe rely extensively on information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) networks and systems, our global data centers and services provided over the internet to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes or activities across our facilities worldwide. The secure operation of our IT networks and systems and the proper processing and maintenance of this information are critical to our business operations. We have been, and likely will continue to be, subject to cyber-attacks. To date we have seen no material impact on our business from these attacks or events. Although we seek to deploy comprehensive security measures to prevent, detect, address and mitigate these threats, there has been an increased level of activity, and an associated level of sophistication, in cyber-attacks against large multinational companies. The ever-evolving threats mean we and our third-party service providers and vendors must continually evaluate and adapt our respective systems and processes and overall security environment, as well as those of any companies we acquire. There is no guarantee that these measures will be adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches, system compromises or misuses of data.\nOur security measures may be breached due to human error, system malfunctions or attacks from uncoordinated individuals or sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats, directed at the Company, its products, its customers and/or its third-party service providers.\nDisruptions and attacks on our IT systems or the systems of third parties storing our data could result in the misappropriation, loss or corruption of our critical data and confidential or proprietary information, personal information of our employees, and the leakage of our or our customers\u2019 confidential information, improper use of our systems and networks, production downtimes and both internal and external supply shortages, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The potential consequences of a material cybersecurity incident include reputational damage, litigation with third parties, diminution in the value of our investment in research, development and engineering, diversion of the attention of management away from the operation of our business and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs, which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations.\nWe rely on third parties to provide or maintain some of our IT systems, data centers and related services and do not exercise direct control over these systems. There is a risk that security measures implemented at our own and at third party locations may not be sufficient and that our IT systems, data centers and cloud services are vulnerable to disruptions, including those resulting from natural disasters, cyberattacks or failures in third party-provided services. While we obtain assurances that any third parties we provide data to will protect this information and, where we believe appropriate, monitor the protections employed by these third parties, there is a risk the confidentiality of data held by us or by third parties may be compromised and expose us to liability for such breach.\nCyberattacks have become increasingly frequent, sophisticated and globally widespread and could target software embedded in our products. Embedded software code could be compromised during software development or manufacturing processes or within the car itself. Cyberattacks on our products within the car can lead to malfunction or complete damage of the products, which could result into loss of control of the car and its safety features. To the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a misappropriation, loss or damage to our data, or an inappropriate disclosure of our confidential information or our customer\u2019s information, it could cause significant damage to our reputation, affect our relationships with our customers, lead to claims against us and ultimately harm our business. In addition, we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future. In addition, as the regulatory environment related to information security, data collection and use, and privacy becomes increasingly rigorous, with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business, compliance with those requirements could result in additional costs. Any future significant compromise or breach of our data security, whether external or internal, or misuse of customer, associate, supplier or Company data, could result in significant costs, lost sales, fines, lawsuits, and damage to our reputation.\nOur business is exposed to risks inherent in international operations.\nWe currently conduct operations in various countries and jurisdictions, including locating certain of our manufacturing and distribution facilities internationally, which subjects us to the legal, political, regulatory and social requirements and economic conditions in these jurisdictions. International sales and operations subject us to certain risks inherent in doing business abroad, including exposure to local economic and political conditions, health foreign tax consequences, issues with enforcing legal agreements, currency controls, imposition of tariffs, preferences of foreign nations for domestically manufactured products, and concerns about human rights, working conditions and other labor rights and conditions and the environmental impact in foreign\ncountries where our products are produced and raw materials and/or components are sourced. These risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.\nThe 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Act\u201d) significantly changed the taxation of U.S. based multinational corporations, including, inter alia, reducing the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, creating new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings and a new minimum tax calculated on certain U.S. outbound payments. We have completed our accounting for the impact of the Tax Act as of December 22, 2018 based on published guidance. We expect that the U.S. Treasury Department, the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d), and state tax authorities will be issuing additional guidance on how the provisions of the Tax Act will be applied or otherwise administered, and such guidance may be different from our current interpretation. The legislation could be subject to potential amendments and technical corrections, any of which could materially lessen or increase certain adverse impacts of the legislation. As regulations and guidance evolve with respect to the Tax Act, and as we gather information and perform more analysis, our results may differ from previous estimates and may materially affect our financial position. Changes in tax laws or policies by foreign jurisdictions could result in a higher effective tax rate on our worldwide earnings and such change could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe current U.S. administration has recently initiated substantial changes in U.S. trade policy and U.S. trade agreements, including the initiation of tariffs on certain foreign goods, and has created uncertainty about the future relationship between the U.S. and certain of its trading partners. In addition, the U.S. is negotiating or has entered into new trade agreements that could affect adversely us, including the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which if adopted, would replace the North American Free Trade Agreement. A trade war, trade barriers or other governmental actions related to tariffs, international trade agreements, import or export restrictions or other trade policies could adversely impact demand for our products, our costs, customers, suppliers and/or the U.S. economy or certain sectors thereof and, therefore, adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business in China is subject to aggressive competition and is sensitive to economic and market conditions as well as restrictions placed on foreign automakers.\nWe operate in the highly competitive automotive supply market in China and face competition from both international and smaller domestic manufacturers. Maintaining a strong position in the Chinese market is a key component of our global growth strategy. Our business is sensitive to economic and market conditions that impact automotive sales volumes and growth in China and may be affected if the pace of growth slows as the Chinese market matures or if there are reductions in vehicle demand in China. We anticipate that additional competitors, both international and domestic, may seek to enter the Chinese market resulting in increased competition. Increased competition may result in price reductions, reduced margins and our inability to gain or hold market share. There have been periods of increased market volatility and moderation in the levels of economic growth in China, which resulted in periods of lower automotive production growth rates in China than those previously experienced. Furthermore, the Chinese government has increased demand for domestic production of electric cars by offering purchase incentives for electric cars and has restricted foreign automakers from digital mapping within its borders impacting many of our customers\u2019 ability to manufacture self-driving vehicles within China. Many of our customers are not domestic Chinese companies. If our non-Chinese customers are prevented or deterred from doing business in China, it could impair our position in the Chinese market. If we are unable to maintain our position in the Chinese market, the pace of growth slows or vehicle sales in China decrease, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nWe are exposed to exchange rate risks.\nWe have currency exposures related to buying, selling and financing in currencies other than the local currencies of the countries in which we operate. We are particularly vulnerable to a strong U.S. dollar as certain raw materials and components are sourced in U.S. dollars while sales are also currently in other currencies, like the Euro. Our risks include:\n\u2022transaction exposure, which arises because the cost of a product originates in one currency and the product is sold in another currency;\n\u2022revaluation effects, which arise from valuation of assets denominated in other currencies than the reporting currency of each unit;\n\u2022translation exposure in the income statement, which arises when the income statements of non-U.S. subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars;\n\u2022translation exposure in the balance sheet, which arises when the balance sheets of non-U.S. subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars; and\n\u2022changes in the reported U.S. dollar amounts of cash flows.\nFor example, in 2019 the Company\u2019s gross transaction exposure was approximately $1.0 billion, with a net exposure of $0.9 billion due to counter-flows. The largest net transaction exposures were the sale of Euro against the U.S. Dollar, and the purchase of U.S. Dollar against Korean Won. In 2019, the five largest currency pairs accounted for approximately 82% of the Company\u2019s net currency transaction exposure. These exchange rate risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe face risks in connection with identifying, completing and integrating acquisitions.\nOur business\u2019s growth has been enhanced through strategic opportunities, including acquisitions of businesses, products and technologies, and joint development agreements. We may continue to identify and engage in strategic opportunities in the future. However, we may not be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates or complete transactions on acceptable terms, integrate acquired operations into our existing operations or expand into new markets. Our failure to identify suitable strategic opportunities may restrict our ability to grow our business. These strategic opportunities also involve numerous additional risks to us and our investors, including risks related to retaining acquired management and employees, difficulties in integrating the acquired technology, products, operations and personnel with our existing business, assumption of contingent liabilities, and potentially adverse financial impact of acquisitions. Consequently, there is a risk that the acquisitions and other transactions may not result in revenue growth, operational synergies or service or technology enhancements, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks associated with joint venture partnerships and other collaborations may adversely affect our business and financial results.\nCertain of our operations are currently conducted through joint ventures and collaborations, and we may enter into additional joint ventures and collaborations in the future. Our joint ventures and collaborations are generally focused on opening or expanding opportunities for our technologies and supporting the design and introduction of new products and services (or enhancing existing products or services). Such activities entail a high degree of risk and often require significant capital investments. We may underestimate the costs and/or overestimate the benefits, including technology, product, revenue, cost and other synergies and growth opportunities, that we expect to realize, and we may not achieve those benefits, or may do so later than expected. The market and customer demand for products and technologies provided by our joint ventures may also shift. For example, we have begun to see a shift in our customer\u2019s focus to products and systems supporting \u201cLevel 2 plus driver assistance\u201d technologies over systems supporting fully autonomous driving as it appears that fully autonomous vehicles will come to market in significant numbers later than previously expected. This means that some of the anticipated benefits of our Zenuity joint venture, including sales from technologies developed by the joint venture, may not materialize or may come later than previously expected. We are currently in discussions with our Zenuity joint venture partner regarding the development priorities of Zenuity in light of the market shift toward autonomous vehicle solutions and are presently evaluating our strategic and business plans for Zenuity, as well as its ongoing funding needs. The outcome of these discussions may influence the level of funding and participation of Veoneer in Zenuity, as well as future sharing of intellectual property and IP licenses and may result in a different strategy, focus, structure and/or purpose of Zenuity or implementation of other strategic options being reviewed.\nFurthermore, our joint venture partners may be unable or unwilling to meet their economic or other contractual obligations, and we may in some cases and/or for some time choose to fulfill those obligations alone to ensure the ongoing success of a joint venture, or we may choose to dissolve and liquidate it. For example, in connection with ongoing disagreements with Nissin Kogyo, our joint venture partner in VNBS, we have entered into agreements to separate and terminate the joint venture. In June 2019, we acquired Nissin Kogyo\u2019s interests in the US operations of VNBS, or VBS, and released Nissin Kogyo from any obligations to fund VBS in the future and from any claims Veoneer may have had against Nissin Kogyo relating to VBS. Further, in February 2020 we completed the sale of our 51% ownership in the Japanese and Chinese entities that comprise the remainder of the VNBS joint venture to Nissin Kogyo and Honda Motor Co., Ltd. thereby terminating the VNBS joint venture.\nIn addition, our joint venture and collaboration partners may at any time have economic, business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with our goals or with the goals of the joint venture. Our products and technologies may from time to time overlap with certain aspects of the technologies developed with one of our joint venture or collaboration partners which may cause the parties to consider the impact on the contractual relationship. Depending on our level of control over the governance and/or operations of a joint venture or collaboration, we may be unable to implement actions with respect to the joint venture\u2019s activities that we believe are favorable if the joint venture partner does not agree. Disagreements with our business partners may impede our ability to maximize the benefits of our partnerships. We may have difficulty resolving disputes with or claims against our joint venture partners, which could lead to us bearing liability for claims that we are not responsible for and may have a material adverse impact on the joint venture. We may not have access to these technologies or suitable replacements\nwithout these joint ventures or collaborations. If one or more of our joint venture partners or collaboration partners experiences operating difficulties or economic uncertainties, our access to these development technologies may be jeopardized and our product development may be negatively impacted. The above risks, if realized, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to respond quickly enough to changes in technology and technological risks and to develop our intellectual property into commercially viable products.\nChanges in legislative, regulatory or industry requirements or in competitive technologies may render certain of our products obsolete or less attractive to our customers. We currently license certain proprietary technology to third parties and, if such technology becomes obsolete or less attractive, those licensees could terminate our license agreements, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Our ability to anticipate changes in technology and regulatory standards and to successfully develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis will be a significant factor in our ability to be competitive. There is a risk that we will not be able to achieve the technological advances that may be necessary for us to be competitive or that certain of our products will become obsolete. We are also subject to the risks generally associated with new product introductions and applications, including lack of market acceptance, delays in product development and failure of products to operate properly. As part of our business strategy, we may from time to time seek to acquire businesses or assets that provide us with additional intellectual property. We may experience problems integrating acquired technologies into our existing technologies and products, and such acquired intellectual property may be subject to known or contingent liabilities such as infringement claims. These risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Government Regulations & Taxes\nOur business may be adversely affected by if our policies and procedures do not adequately protect our employees or others or otherwise meet the requirements of applicable laws or regulations, including international, environmental, occupational health and safety or other governmental regulations.\nWe are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations, including those related to the requirements of environmental, occupational health and safety, financial and other matters. We cannot predict the substance or impact of pending or future legislation or regulations, or the application thereof. The introduction of new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations, or the interpretations thereof, could increase the costs of doing business for us or our customers or suppliers or restrict our actions and adversely affect our operating results, cash flows and financial condition.\nOur operations are subject to environmental and safety laws and regulations governing, among other things, emissions to air, discharges to waters and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste and other materials. Environmental laws, regulations, and permits and the enforcement thereof change frequently and have tended to become increasingly stringent over time. The operation of automotive parts manufacturing facilities entails health and safety and environmental risks, and our development processes includes vehicle testing and data collection that could expose employees to risks inherent in driving on public roads and test tracks. Although we employ safety procedures in the design and operation of our facilities and development programs, there is a risk that an accident or injury could occur. Any accident or injury could result in litigation, manufacturing and/or development delays, property loss and/or and harm to our reputation, which could negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, here is a risk that we will incur material costs or liabilities including fines and/or penalties if regulators determine that proper controls were not in place.\nWe are also subject to local regulations and declarations related to public health issues, including travel bans, quarantines and mandated facility closures implemented in response to local, national or international epidemics or pandemics. Any unanticipated limitations on our ability to operate or our employees or contractors\u2019 ability to travel or work could inhibit our ability to maintain customer supply, either directly or through impact on our suppliers.\nDue to our global operations, we are also subject to many laws governing our activities in other countries (including, but not limited to, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and other anti-bribery regulations in foreign jurisdictions where we do business, and the U.S. Export Administration Act), which prohibit improper payments to government officials and restrict where and how we can do business, what information or products we can supply to certain countries and what information we can provide to authorities in governmental authorities.\nThere is a risk that our policies and procedures will not protect us from the intentional or reckless acts of our employees or representatives, particularly in the case of recently acquired operations that may not have significant training in applicable compliance policies and procedures. Any costs, liabilities, and obligations that we incur relating to such regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business may be adversely affected by changes in automotive safety regulations or concerns that drive further regulation of the automobile safety and autonomous driving markets.\nGovernment vehicle safety regulations are a key driver in our business. Historically, these regulations have imposed ever more stringent safety regulations for vehicles. Safety regulations have a positive impact on driver awareness and acceptance of active safety products and technology. These more stringent safety regulations often require vehicles to have more safety content per vehicle and more advanced safety products, including active safety technology, which has thus been a driver of growth in our business.\nThese regulations are subject to change based on a number of factors that are not within our control, including new scientific or medical data, adverse publicity regarding autonomous vehicles or technology, domestic and foreign political developments or considerations, and litigation relating to our products and our competitors\u2019 products. Changes in government regulations in response to these and other considerations could have a severe impact on our business. If government priorities shift and we are unable to adapt to changing regulations, our business may suffer material adverse effects.\nThe regulatory obligation of complying with safety regulations could increase as federal and local regulators impose more stringent compliance and reporting requirements in response to product recalls, safety issues and product innovations in our industry. In the U.S., we are subject to the existing Transportation Recall Enhancement, Accountability and Documentation (TREAD) Act, which requires manufacturers to comply with \u201cEarly Warning\u201d requirements by reporting to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (\u201cNHTSA\u201d) information related to defects or reports of death related to their products. TREAD imposes criminal liability for violating such requirements if a defect subsequently causes death or bodily injury. In addition, the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act authorizes NHTSA to require a manufacturer to recall and repair vehicles that contain safety defects or fail to comply with federal motor vehicle safety standards. In September 2016, U.S. Department of Transportation issued a Federal Automated Vehicles Policy as agency guidance for comment rather than in a rulemaking in order to enable the delivery of an initial regulatory framework and best practices to guide manufacturers and other entities in the safe design, development, testing, and deployment of highly automated vehicles. Since September 2016, the U.S. Department of Transportation has issued voluntary \u201cguidance\u201d for autonomous vehicle (AV) standards, including the most recent \u201cEnsuring American Leadership in Automated Vehicle Technologies - Automated Vehicles 4.0\u201d dated January 2020, to promote autonomous vehicle development. It is unknown when specific U.S. regulations for AVs may be released and what, if any, impact such regulations may have on us or our customers in terms of products, features and performance requirements.\nAs our technologies advance and develop beyond traditional automotive products, we may be subject to regulatory regimes beyond traditional vehicle safety rules and requirements. As a result, we may not identify all regulatory licenses or permits required for our products, or our products may operate beyond the scope of the licenses and permits we have obtained. Failing to obtain the required licenses, permits or other regulatory authorizations could result in investigations, fines or other penalties or proceedings. If any of the regulatory risks described above materialize, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities.\nWe may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities.\nThe determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires estimation and significant judgment, and there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. As a multinational corporation, we are subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. Our determination of our tax liability is always subject to audit and review by applicable domestic and foreign tax authorities. Although we are currently under audit in a jurisdiction, we are indemnified by Autoliv for any tax settlements for tax periods prior to April 1, 2018. Any adverse outcome of any such audit or review for tax periods after April 1, 2018 could have a negative effect on our business and the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made. There is a risk that our established reserves, which are based on assumptions and estimates that we believe are reasonable to cover such eventualities, may prove to be insufficient. In addition, our future income taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated (or by the incurrence of losses) in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles, as well as certain discrete items.\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s (\u201cU.K.\u201d) referendum to exit from the European Union (\u201cE.U.\u201d) will continue to have uncertain effects and could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nOn June 23, 2016, the U.K. held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the E.U. (commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d), and the U.K. ceased to be a member state of the E.U. on January 31, 2020. As a result of Brexit, the U.K. will lose\naccess to the E.U. single market and to E.U. trade deals negotiated with other jurisdictions at that time, so the long-term effects of Brexit will depend on the agreements or arrangements with the E.U. for the U.K. to retain access to E.U. markets either during a transitional period or more permanently. The long-term effects of Brexit may include, among other things, greater restrictions on imports and exports between the U.K. and E.U. countries, a fluctuation in currency exchange rates and additional regulatory complexity. Such changes could be costly and potentially disruptive to our operations and business relationships in these markets. If we are unable to manage any of these risks effectively, our business and financial results could be adversely affected. Our operations in the U.K. represented an immaterial part of our business as of December 31, 2019.\nRisks Related to the 2018 Spin-Off from Autoliv\nWe have a limited history of operating as an independent, stand-alone company, and our historical financial information does not predict our future results.\nOur historical financial information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2019 in relation to periods or times up to the Spin-Off refers to our business as operated by and integrated with Autoliv. Our historical financial information included in this Annual Report in relation to periods or times prior to the completion of the Spin-Off is derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of Autoliv. Accordingly, the historical financial information included herein in relation to periods or times prior to the completion of the Spin-Off does not necessarily reflect the financial condition, results of operations or cash flows that we would have achieved as a separate, publicly traded company during the periods presented or those that we will achieve in the future primarily as a result of the factors described below.\nPrior to the Spin-Off, our business was operated by Autoliv as part of its broader corporate organization, rather than as an independent company. Autoliv or one of its affiliates performed various corporate functions for us, such as legal, accounting, treasury, internal auditing, and human resources and also provided our IT and other corporate infrastructure. Our historical financial results reflect allocations of corporate expenses from Autoliv for such functions and are likely to be less than the expenses we would have incurred had we operated as a separate publicly traded company. As a result of the Spin-Off, we are responsible for the costs related to such functions previously performed by Autoliv, and such costs have increased. Autoliv is providing some of these functions to us pursuant to a transition services agreement. We will need to make investments to replicate or outsource from other providers certain facilities, systems, infrastructure, and personnel to which we no longer have access as a result of the Spin-Off. These initiatives to develop our independent ability to operate without access to Autoliv\u2019s existing operational and administrative infrastructure will have a cost to implement. We may not be able to operate our business efficiently or at comparable costs, and our profitability may decline. Additionally, prior to the Spin-Off, we shared economies of scale in costs, employees, vendor relationships and customer relationships with Autoliv. Although we have entered into a transition services agreement with Autoliv for certain services, these arrangements may not fully capture the benefits that we have enjoyed as a result of being integrated with Autoliv and may result in us paying higher amounts than in the past for certain products and services. This could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition as separate, publicly traded company.\nOther changes may occur in our cost structure, management, financing and business operations, as compared to the past financial performance of our business, as a result of operating as a company separate from Autoliv. These risks could, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur ability to meet our capital needs has materially changed by the loss of financial support from Autoliv since the Spin-Off, and it may be more difficult for us to obtain capital to fund our business.\nThe loss of financial support from Autoliv since the completion of the Spin-Off has changed our previous source of capital. Autoliv previously provided certain capital that was needed in excess of the amounts generated by our operating activities. We currently expect to obtain any funds needed in excess of the amounts contributed by Autoliv in the Spin-Off and generated by our operating activities through the capital markets, bank financing, strategic relationships or other arrangements, and not from Autoliv. However, given the smaller relative size of our company, as compared to Autoliv after the Spin-Off, we may incur higher debt servicing and other costs relating to new indebtedness than we would have otherwise incurred as a part of Autoliv. As a stand-alone company, the cost of our financing also will depend on other factors such as our performance and financial market conditions generally. Further, we cannot guarantee you that we will be able to obtain capital market financing or credit on favorable terms, or at all, in the future. We cannot assure you that our ability to meet our capital needs will not be harmed by the loss of financial support from Autoliv.\nWe may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve from the Spin-Off.\nWe and Autoliv believe that the tax-free Spin-Off will enhance our long-term value. However, by separating from Autoliv, we may be more susceptible to market fluctuations and other adverse events than we would have been were we still a part of\nAutoliv. In addition, we may not be able to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve as an independent company in the time we expect, if at all.\nWe may be responsible for U.S. federal income tax liabilities that relate to the distribution.\nAutoliv received an opinion from its outside tax counsel to the effect that the distribution of our common stock, together with certain related transactions, should qualify as a transaction that is tax-free under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Code. The opinion was based on and relied on, among other things, certain facts and assumptions, as well as certain representations, statements and undertakings of Autoliv and the Company, including those relating to the past and future conduct of Autoliv and the Company. If any of these representations, statements or undertakings are, or become, inaccurate or incomplete, or if Autoliv or the Company breach any of their respective covenants in the Spin-Off documents, the opinion of counsel may be invalid and the conclusions reached therein could be jeopardized. Notwithstanding the opinion of counsel, the IRS could determine that the distribution, together with certain related transactions, should be treated as a taxable transaction if the IRS determines that any of these representations, assumptions, or undertakings upon which such opinion was based are incorrect or have been violated or if the IRS disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion of counsel. An opinion of counsel is not binding on the IRS or any court and there is a risk that the IRS will challenge the conclusions reached in the opinion. The IRS did not provide any opinion in advance of the Spin-Off that the Spin-Off will be tax-free.\nIf the distribution, together with certain related transactions, failed to qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Code, Autoliv would recognize taxable gain as if it had sold our common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value, Autoliv stockholders who received our common stock in the distribution would be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of such shares, and we could incur significant liabilities. In addition, if the Spin-Off is not tax-free, Veoneer would be responsible for tax liabilities as allocated by the Tax Matters Agreement.\nEven if the Spin-Off otherwise qualifies as a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the distribution will be taxable to Autoliv if there are (or have been) one or more acquisitions (including issuances) of our stock or the stock of Autoliv, representing 50% or more, measured by vote or value, of the stock of any such corporation and the acquisition or acquisitions are deemed to be part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the distribution. Any acquisition of our common stock within two years before or after the distribution (with exceptions, including public trading by less-than-5% stockholders and certain compensatory stock issuances) generally will be presumed to be part of such a plan unless that presumption is rebutted. The resulting tax liability would be substantial, and under U.S. Treasury regulations, each member of the Autoliv group at the time of the Spin-Off (including us and our subsidiaries) would be severally liable for the resulting U.S. federal income tax liability.\nPursuant to the Tax Matters Agreement, we agreed not to enter into certain transactions that could cause any portion of the Spin-Off to be taxable to Autoliv, including under Section 355(e) of the Code. We also agreed to indemnify Autoliv for any tax liabilities resulting from such transactions or other actions we take, and Autoliv agreed to indemnify us for any tax liabilities resulting from transactions entered into by Autoliv. These obligations may discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company, which could have a materially adverse effect on our business. For additional details, see \u201cSpin-Off Related Agreements, Tax Matters Agreement.\u201d\nOur internal controls around accounting and financial reporting may not be adequate to ensure complete and accurate reporting of our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Exchange Act requires that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition. Under the Sarbanes Oxley Act, we are required to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting. Any failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe could incur substantial additional costs and experience temporary business interruptions as we install and implement our information technology infrastructure and transition our data to our own systems.\nWe are finalizing the implementation of information technology to support certain of our business functions, including accounting and reporting, manufacturing process control and distribution. We may incur temporary interruptions in business operations if we cannot fully transition effectively from Autoliv\u2019s existing transactional and operational systems, data centers and the transition services that support these functions. We may not be successful in implementing our new systems and transitioning our data, and we may incur substantially higher costs for implementation than currently anticipated. Our failure to avoid operational interruptions as we implement the new systems and replaces Autoliv\u2019s information technology services, or our failure to implement the new systems and replace Autoliv\u2019s services successfully, and any substantially higher costs could\ndisrupt our business and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, if we are unable to replicate or transition certain systems, our ability to comply with regulatory requirements could be impaired.\nAutoliv may fail to perform under various agreements that were executed in connection with the Spin-Off and we may have greater costs or potential liability pursuant to such agreements.\nIn connection with the internal reorganization and Spin-Off, we and Autoliv entered into a Master Transfer Agreement, Distribution Agreement and various other agreements, including the Transition Services Agreement, Tax Matters Agreement and an Employee Matters Agreement. Certain of these agreements provide for the performance of services by each company for the benefit of the other following the Spin-Off. We are relying on Autoliv to satisfy its performance and payment obligations under these agreements. If Autoliv is unable to satisfy its obligations under these agreements, including its indemnification obligations, we could incur operational difficulties or losses.\nFurthermore, these agreements may not reflect terms that would have resulted from arm\u2019s-length negotiations among unaffiliated third parties. To the extent that certain terms of those agreements provide for rights and obligations that could have been procured from third parties, we may have received better terms from third parties. There is a risk that we may incur greater costs or be subject to greater potential liability pursuant to our agreements with Autoliv for certain rights and obligations that could have been procured from unaffiliated third parties. See \u201cSpin-Off Related Agreements.\u201d\nCurrently, we rely on Autoliv to provide certain corporate and administrative services such as certain information technology, financial and human resource services. We are in the process of creating our own, or engaging third parties to provide, systems and services to replace many of the systems and services Autoliv currently provides to us pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement. If Autoliv is unable or unwilling to provide such services pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement, or if we do not have in place our own systems and services, or if we do not have agreements with other providers of these services, once the agreement terminates, or if these services are only available for substantially less favorable terms, we may not be able to operate our business effectively and our financial condition and result of operations may be adversely affected. The Transition Services Agreement terminates on April 1, 2020.\nPotential indemnification liabilities to Autoliv or a refusal of Autoliv to indemnify us pursuant to the Distribution Agreement could materially adversely affect us.\nThe transaction documents we entered into with Autoliv in connection with the internal reorganization and the Spin-Off provide for cross-indemnities that require Autoliv and Veoneer to bear financial responsibility for each company\u2019s business prior to the internal reorganization or Spin-Off, as applicable, and to indemnify the other party in connection with a breach of such party of the transaction agreements; provided, however, certain warranty, recall and product liabilities for electronics products manufactured prior to the completion of the internal reorganization have been retained by Autoliv and Autoliv will indemnify us for any losses associated with such warranty, recall or product liabilities pursuant to the Distribution Agreement. If we are required to indemnify Autoliv under the circumstances set forth in the transaction documents, we may be subject to substantial liabilities. In addition, there can be no assurance that the indemnities from Autoliv will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of any potential liabilities. Even if we do succeed in recovering from Autoliv any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves. In addition, each of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be unable to take certain actions because such actions could jeopardize the tax-free status of the Spin-Off, and such restrictions could be significant.\nTo preserve the tax-free treatment of the Spin-Off, for the initial two-year period following the Spin-Off, we are prohibited, except in limited circumstances, from taking or failing to take certain actions that would prevent the Spin-Off and related transactions from being tax-free, including: (1) entering into any transaction pursuant to which our stock would be acquired, whether by merger or otherwise; (2) issuing any equity securities or securities that could possibly be converted into our equity securities; (3) selling or otherwise disposing of substantially all of our assets; or (4) repurchasing our equity securities. These restrictions may limit our ability to issue equity and to pursue strategic transactions or engage in new business or other transactions that may maximize the value of our business. In addition, if we take, or fail to take, actions that prevent the Spin-Off and related transactions from being tax-free, we could be liable for the adverse tax consequences resulting from such actions.\nThe Spin-Off and related transactions may expose us to potential liabilities arising out of state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws and legal distribution requirements.\nThe Spin-Off could be challenged under various state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws. An unpaid creditor or an entity vested with the power of such creditor (such as a trustee or debtor-in-possession in a bankruptcy) could claim that Autoliv did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value in the Spin-Off, and that the Spin-Off left Autoliv insolvent or with unreasonably small capital or that Autoliv intended or believed it would incur debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature. If a court were to agree with such a plaintiff, then such court could void the Spin-Off as a fraudulent transfer and could impose a number of different remedies, including without limitation, returning our assets or your shares in our company to Autoliv or providing Autoliv with a claim for money damages against us in an amount equal to the difference between the consideration received by Autoliv and the fair market value of our company at the time of the Spin-Off. No assurance can be given as to what standard a court would apply to determine insolvency or that a court would determine that Autoliv was solvent at the time of or after giving effect to the Spin-Off, including the distribution of our common stock.\nCertain of our officers and directors may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their service as executive officers or directors of Autoliv.\nCertain of our directors and officers own Autoliv common stock and equity awards. Even though our board of directors consists of a majority of directors who are independent, several of our directors continue to have a financial interest in Autoliv common stock and equity awards. Continuing ownership of Autoliv common stock and equity awards, or service as a director at both companies could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest for our directors and officers with prior or continuing positions with Autoliv if we have disagreements with Autoliv about the agreements between us that continue or face decisions that could have different implications for us and Autoliv.\nRisks Related to Investing in Our Securities\nOur board of directors may change significant corporate policies without stockholder approval.\nOur financing, borrowing and dividend policies and our policies with respect to all other activities, including growth, debt, capitalization and operations, are determined by our board of directors. These policies may be amended or revised at any time and from time to time at the discretion of our board of directors without a vote of our stockholders. In addition, our board of directors may change our policies with respect to conflicts of interest provided that such changes are consistent with applicable legal requirements. A change in these policies could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, the per share trading price of our common stock and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay dividends to our stockholders.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law might discourage or delay acquisition attempts for us that you might consider favorable.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make the merger or acquisition of the Company more difficult without the approval of our board of directors. Among other things:\n\u2022although we do not have a stockholder rights plan, our certificate of incorporation allows us to authorize the issuance of undesignated preferred stock in connection with a stockholder rights plan or\n\u2022otherwise, the terms of which may be established and the shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval, and which may include super voting, special approval, dividend, or other rights or preferences superior to the rights of the holders of common stock;\n\u2022we have a classified board of directors, and any director may be removed only for cause and only by the affirmative vote of at least 75% of the voting power of all the then-outstanding shares of voting stock;\n\u2022our board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws and our stockholders may only amend our bylaws by the affirmative vote of at least 80% of the voting power of all the then-outstanding shares of voting stock;\n\u2022our certificate of incorporation and bylaws permits only our board of directors to call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u2022our certificate of incorporation and bylaws do not permit stockholder action by written consent; and\n\u2022our bylaws establish advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\nFurther, as a Delaware corporation, we are subject to provisions of Delaware law, which may impair a takeover attempt that our stockholders may find beneficial. These anti-takeover provisions and other provisions under Delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of the Company, including actions that our stockholders may deem\nadvantageous, or negatively affect the trading price of our common stock. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions you desire.\nOur certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain litigation that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our current or former directors, officers or stockholders.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our stockholders, directors, officers or other employees to us or to our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising out of or pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, (iv) the certificate of incorporation or amended and bylaws, or (v) any action asserting a claim government by the internal affairs doctrine. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise holding any interest in shares of our capital stock will be deemed to have notice of, and consented to, the provision in our restated certificate of incorporation related to choice of forum. This provision may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against our directors, officers or employees by limiting our stockholders\u2019 ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that they find favorable for disputes.\nThe market price and trading volume of our common stock may fluctuate widely.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly, depending upon many factors, some of which may be beyond our control, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022a shift in our investor base;\n\u2022our quarterly or annual earnings, or those of comparable companies;\n\u2022actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022our ability to obtain financing as needed;\n\u2022changes in laws and regulations affecting our business;\n\u2022changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u2022announcements by us or our competitors of significant investments, acquisitions or dispositions;\n\u2022the failure of securities analysts to cover our common stock;\n\u2022changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates;\n\u2022the operating performance and stock price of comparable companies;\n\u2022overall market fluctuations;\n\u2022a decline in the automotive market; and\n\u2022general economic conditions and other external factors.\nFuture issuances of common stock by us may cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could substantially decrease the market price of our common stock.\nIn connection with the Spin-Off, we adopted an equity incentive plan in which our employees, non-employee directors and other service providers may participate, under which an aggregate of 3,000,000 shares of our common stock are available for future issuance, plus a number of shares to satisfy equity-based awards that were issued to holders of certain equity awards outstanding under Autoliv\u2019s Amended and Restated Stock Incentive Plan at the time of the Spin-Off. We filed a registration statement on Form S-8 under the Securities Act to register shares of our common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of our common stock issued pursuant to our equity incentive plan. Accordingly, shares registered under such registration statement are available for sale in the open market.\nYour ownership in our stock may be diluted by additional equity issuances.\nYour percentage ownership in our common stock could be diluted in the future as a result of equity issuances for acquisitions, capital market transactions or otherwise, including any equity awards that we grant to our directors, officers and employees. Such awards could have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. In addition, our certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred shares having such designation, powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights as our board of directors generally may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred shares could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common stock.\nWe have no current plans to pay cash dividends on our common stock, and certain factors could limit our ability to pay dividends in the future.\nThe declaration, amount and payment of any future dividends on shares of our common stock will be at the absolute and sole discretion of our board of directors. Our board of directors may take into account general and economic conditions, our financial condition and results of operations, our available cash and current and anticipated cash needs, capital requirements, contractual, legal, tax and regulatory restrictions and implications on the payment of dividends by us to our stockholders or by our subsidiaries to us and such other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant. In addition, our ability to pay dividends may be limited by covenants of indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur in the future. We have no current plans to pay any cash dividends.\nRisks Related to an Investment in our SDRs\nVeoneer SDR holders do not have the same rights as our stockholders.\nA Veoneer SDR holder does not have equivalent rights as our holders of common stock, whose rights are governed by U.S. federal law and the Delaware General Corporation Law. The rights of Veoneer SDR holders are set forth and described in to the General Terms and Conditions for Swedish Depository Receipts in Veoneer (the \u201cGeneral Terms and Conditions\u201d). Although the General Terms and Conditions generally allow Veoneer SDR holders to vote in general meetings of stockholders or to be entitled to dividends as if they held our shares of common stock directly, the rights of Veoneer SDR holders differ in some instances from the rights of Veoneer stockholders. In particular, Veoneer SDR holders do not have the ability to nominate directors for election or bring proposals before our annual meeting to the extent provided for in our governing documents or by applicable U.S. state or federal law. Additionally, Veoneer SDR holders may not be able to enforce their rights under the General Terms and Conditions in relation to their SDRs in the same manner as one of our stockholders could with respect to our shares of common stock under applicable U.S. law.\nThe trading market for Veoneer SDRs may be limited in the future.\nThere is a risk that a trading market for Veoneer SDRs will not develop or be sustained in the future. Veoneer SDRs traded in Stockholm are not equivalent to a Swedish security being traded on Nasdaq Stockholm. Specifically, Veoneer SDRs represent shares of a U.S. company and are not themselves shares of stock. The lack of an active trading market may make it more difficult for you to sell your Veoneer SDRs and could lead to the price of Veoneer SDRs being depressed or more volatile.", "PERMNO": 17859, "SIC": 3714, "TIC": "VNE"}
