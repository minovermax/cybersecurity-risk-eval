Risk Factors.\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risk factors set forth below as well as the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other public filings in evaluating our business. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. The risks described below are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently view to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. In these circumstances, the market price of our common stock would likely decline.\nRisks Related to the Commercialization of Twirla\nWe are significantly dependent on the commercial success of Twirla, our only approved product. If we are unable to successfully commercialize Twirla, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects and value of our common stock will be materially adversely affected.\nTwirla will be the first product that we commercialize. The rest of our pipeline of potential product candidates are in earlier stages of clinical development and will require additional clinical studies and product development and funding in order to advance towards commercialization, which could take considerable time. In addition, we will require additional capital for the validation of our commercial manufacturing process and commercial launch of Twirla. We will not be able to commercially launch Twirla until validation is complete and we may not be successful in completing validation within expected timelines or at all. We will also require capital to develop and initiate post-marketing studies of Twirla. Our ability to generate revenues and become profitable will depend in large part on the commercial success of Twirla. Potential prescribers of Twirla include physicians, nurse practitioners, or NPs, physician's assistants, or PAs, and pharmacists. Registered Pharmacists are authorized to prescribe contraceptives in some states, and other states have pending legislation that would allow pharmacists to prescribe contraceptives. If Twirla does not gain an adequate level of acceptance among prescribers, patients and third parties, we may not generate significant product revenues or become profitable. Market acceptance of Twirla by prescribers, patients and third-party payors will depend on a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022 Efficacy, safety and other potential advantages of Twirla in relation to alternative treatments;\n\u2022 Relative convenience and ease of administration of Twirla;\n\u2022 Availability of adequate coverage or reimbursement of Twirla by third parties, such as insurance companies and other payors, and by government healthcare programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and state health insurance exchanges;\n\u2022 Prevalence and severity of adverse events associated with Twirla;\n\u2022 Cost of Twirla in relation to alternative treatments, including generic products;\n\u2022 Extent and strength of our third-party manufacturer and supplier support and ability to meet our market demand;\n\u2022 Extent and strength of our marketing and distribution support;\n\u2022 Limitations, warnings, or contraindications contained in Twirla's FDA approved labeling, including safety warnings and precautions, contraindications and limitations on the use of Twirla for women based on BMI. By example, Twirla's label includes the class-wide black box warning, contraindications, and warnings and precautions applicable to all combined hormonal contraceptives, or CHCs. Twirla also includes a black box warning that Twirla is contraindicated in women with a BMI \u00b3 30 kg/m2, and that compared to women with a lower BMI, women with a BMI \u00b3 30 kg/m2 had reduced effectiveness and may have a higher risk for venous\nthromboembolic events. Twirla's label also contains a limitation of use to consider Twirla's reduced effectiveness in women with a BMI of \u00b325 to \u00a330 kg/m2 before prescribing.\nFor example, prescribers and patients may not be immediately receptive to a transdermal contraceptive system, as opposed to a pill or any other method, and may be slow to adopt it as an accepted treatment for the prevention of pregnancy. In addition, even though we believe Twirla has advantages over other treatment options, because no adequate head-to-head trials comparing the safety and efficacy of Twirla to the competing approved patch or other contraceptive products have been conducted, we cannot make claims that Twirla is safer or more effective than the currently approved patch product, or other contraceptive products, without conducting a supportive head-to-head postmarketing study. Moreover, we will not be able to make any other Twirla marketing or promotional claims to the extent that they are inconsistent with the Twirla FDA-approved label or are not otherwise supported. The availability of numerous inexpensive generic forms of contraceptive products may also limit acceptance of Twirla among prescribers, patients and third-party payors. If Twirla does not achieve an adequate level of acceptance among prescribers, patients and third-party payors, we may not generate significant product revenues or become profitable, and the value of our common stock may suffer.\nWe may not be able to successfully commercialize Twirla, and the revenue that we generate from its sales, if any, may be limited.\nThe commercial success of Twirla will depend upon the contraceptive market landscape as well as acceptance and uptake of Twirla by prescribers, patients and third-party payors.\nRisks related to the contraceptive market landscape include:\n\u2022 The prescription contraceptive market could experience a decrease in growth or negative growth if fewer women choose to use hormonal contraception;\n\u2022 The perceived safety of hormonal contraceptives could be negatively affected by media reports of adverse effects and advertisements for mass tort lawsuits due to adverse effects;\n\u2022 Price pressures from third party payors, including managed care organizations and government-sponsored health systems, could limit our revenue;\n\u2022 The proportion of the contraceptive market comprised of generic products could continue to increase, making the introduction of a branded contraceptive difficult and expensive;\n\u2022 Competition in the contraceptive market could increase, with the introduction of new contraceptives, including the potential of a new generic or branded competitive contraceptive patch;\n\u2022 Competition from generic contraceptive products could increase as additional generic contraceptives receive FDA approval;\n\u2022 Healthcare reform activities, including, without limitation, the repeal, reform or replacement of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Healthcare and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 or, collectively, the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, and its effects on pharmaceutical coverage, reimbursement and pricing, could limit our revenue;\n\u2022 Access to the prescriber universe, particularly obstetrics and gynecology physicians, could be limited, decreasing our ability to promote Twirla efficiently; and\n\u2022 Our ability to access pharmacists in states where they are authorized by law to prescribe contraceptives could be limited, decreasing our ability to promote Twirla.\nThe degree of acceptance and uptake of Twirla by prescribers, patients and third-party payors will depend upon a number of factors, including:\n\u2022 The level of contraceptive effectiveness of Twirla demonstrated in our clinical trials;\n\u2022 The incidence and severity of adverse effects associated with Twirla;\n\u2022 Limitations, warnings, or contraindications contained in Twirla's FDA approved labeling, including safety warnings and precautions, contraindications, and limitations on the use of Twirla for women based on BMI;\n\u2022 Acceptability to patients of the appearance and feel of Twirla;\n\u2022 Willingness of prescribers to prescribe a contraceptive patch based on the labeling and prior experience with the generic contraceptive patch already on the market;\n\u2022 Willingness of prescribers to prescribe a contraceptive patch in light of safety issues and restrictive labeling of the generic contraceptive patch already on the market;\n\u2022 The cost of Twirla to the patient, as compared to other contraceptive products and methods;\n\u2022 Our ability to obtain and maintain sufficient third-party coverage or reimbursement for Twirla from private health insurers, government healthcare programs (including Medicare, Medicaid and 340B Clinics) and other third-party payors; and\n\u2022 The effectiveness of our or any future collaborators' sales and marketing strategies.\nIn addition, we may face additional generic or other drug product competition sooner than we anticipate for Twirla or our potential product candidates, which would potentially limit their commercial success. We believe that Twirla is eligible for three years of FDA marketing exclusivity for Twirla. The FDCA provides a period of three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, Section 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA for a drug product that contains a previously approved active moiety, if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies, were conducted or sponsored by the applicant and are determined by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application. This three-year marketing exclusivity, however, does not protect drug products from all competition. For instance, it does not protect against the approval of a full NDA. It also would only protect against the approval of a product that contains the same conditions of approval as Twirla. We, however, may not receive the three-year exclusivity for them, and, even if we do, it may not adequately protect us from competition. Competition that Twirla and our potential product candidates may face from generic or similar versions of the same or similar products could materially and adversely impact our future revenue, profitability and cash flows and substantially limit our ability to obtain a return on the investments we have made in Twirla or our potential product candidates.\nIf Twirla does not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by prescribers, third-party payors and patients, we may not generate sufficient revenue and we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability. Our efforts to educate prescribers, patients and third-party payors on the benefits of Twirla may require significant resources and may never be successful. Even if we are able to demonstrate and maintain a competitive advantage over our competitors and become profitable, if the market for hormonal contraceptives fails to achieve expected future growth or decreases, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue or sustain profitability. Our ability to generate sufficient revenue from Twirla will also be dependent on our ability to support the commercial demand for Twirla and we cannot assure you that we along with our manufacturing partner Corium will be able to complete validation of our commercial manufacturing successfully and in a timely manner, and, ultimately, to commercially market Twirla. We also cannot assure that we and Corium will be able to manufacture sufficient quantities of Twirla in order to meet commercial demand.\nIt will be difficult for us to profitably sell Twirla if coverage and reimbursement for such product is limited.\nMarket acceptance and sales of Twirla will depend on coverage and reimbursement policies and may be affected by future healthcare reform measures. Government authorities and third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which medications they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels for approved medications. A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry is cost containment. Government authorities and these third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications. We cannot be sure that coverage or reimbursement will be available for Twirla and, if coverage is available, we cannot be sure of the level of reimbursement. Even when a payor determines that a product is eligible for reimbursement, the payor may set a reimbursement rate that is too low to support a profitable sales price for the product. Subsequent approvals of competitive products could result in a detrimental change to the reimbursement of our products. Reimbursement may impact the demand for, or the price of, Twirla. Numerous generic products may be available at lower prices than branded therapy products, such as Twirla, which may also reduce the likelihood and level of reimbursement for Twirla. If coverage and reimbursement are not available or are available only at limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize Twirla, which would adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects and the value of our common stock.\nIf we are unable to establish effective marketing and sales capabilities for Twirla or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell Twirla, we may be unable to generate product revenues.\nAt present, we have no sales personnel and a limited number of marketing personnel. Initially, we do not plan to establish our own sales force. Rather, we plan to engage a contract sales organization in the United States and, depending on our available capital resources, we plan to also hire a limited number of additional marketing personnel in the second and third quarters of 2020. At the time of our anticipated commercial launch of Twirla, our sales and marketing team will have worked together for only a limited period of time. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in marketing Twirla in the United States.\nWe may not be able to establish our own marketing capabilities or a contract sales force in a cost-effective manner or realize a positive return on this investment. In addition, we will have to compete with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to recruit, hire, train and retain sales and marketing personnel. Factors that may inhibit our efforts to commercialize Twirla in the United States include:\n\u2022 Our ability to obtain additional capital;\n\u2022 Our or our contractor's inability to timely recruit and retain adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel;\n\u2022 The inability of sales personnel to obtain access to or persuade adequate numbers of prescribers to prescribe Twirla;\n\u2022 The lack of complementary products to be offered by sales personnel, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies with more extensive product lines;\n\u2022 The costs associated with training sales and marketing personnel on legal and regulatory compliance matters and monitoring their actions;\n\u2022 Liability for sales or marketing personnel who fail to comply with the applicable legal and regulatory requirements; and\n\u2022 Unforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating an independent sales and marketing organization or engaging a contract sales organization.\nIf we are not successful in recruiting sales and marketing personnel or in building a sales and marketing infrastructure, or if we do not successfully enter into appropriate collaboration arrangements, we will have difficulty commercializing Twirla, which would adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIf we intend to commercialize Twirla outside the United States, we will likely enter into collaboration agreements with pharmaceutical partners, and we may have limited or no control over the sales, marketing and distribution activities of these third parties. Our future revenues may depend on the success of the efforts of these third parties.\nTo the extent that we rely on, or partner with, third parties to commercialize Twirla, we may receive less revenue than if we commercialized these products ourselves. In addition, we would have less control over the sales efforts of any other third parties involved in our commercialization efforts. We, however, will remain responsible for the conduct of any contract sales force, which could expose us to legal and regulatory enforcement actions and liability. In the event that we are unable to partner with a third-party marketing and sales organization, our ability to generate product revenues may be limited in the United States, internationally or both.\nIf estimates of the size of the potential market for Twirla are overstated or data we have used to identify physicians is inaccurate, our ability to earn revenue to support our business could be materially adversely affected.\nWe have relied on a number of external sources, as well as market research funded by us and internal analyses and calculations, to estimate the potential market opportunity for Twirla in the United States. We have not independently verified the externally sourced information used to develop the estimates for the potential market for Twirla, and their accuracy and completeness cannot be assured. Similarly, our internal analyses and calculations are based upon analysis of the current and expected future U.S. contraceptive market and management's understanding and assessment of numerous inputs and market conditions, including, but not limited to, the addressable market segment for combined hormonal contraceptives and the reimbursement status of contraceptives under the federal Affordable Care Act and similar state laws. These understandings and assessments necessarily require assumptions subject to significant judgment and may prove to be inaccurate. As a result, our estimates of the size of the potential market for Twirla could prove to be overstated, perhaps materially.\nIn addition, we are relying on third party data to identify the healthcare providers who prescribe contraception in the U.S. and to determine how to deploy resources to market to those healthcare providers; however, we may not be marketing to the appropriate physicians and may therefore be limiting our market opportunity.\nWe may develop estimates with respect to market opportunities for potential product candidates in the future, and such estimates would be subject to similar risks. Even if we obtain regulatory approval for one or more potential product candidates, we may be unable to commercialize the product on a scale sufficient to generate significant revenue, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects and the value of our common stock.\nThe proportion of the contraceptive market that is made up of generic products could continue to increase, making introduction of a branded contraceptive difficult and expensive.\nThe proportion of the U.S. market that is made up of generic products has been increasing over time. For example, in 2005, generic contraceptive products held 49% of prescription volume and 36% of sales and, by 2019, those values had risen to 88% and 43%, respectively. Recently, Congress and the FDA have taken steps to increase generic competition in the market. If this trend continues, it may be more difficult to introduce Twirla as a branded contraceptive at a price that will maximize our revenue and profits. Also, there may be additional marketing costs to introduce Twirla in order to overcome the\ntrend towards generics and to gain access to reimbursement by payors. If we are unable to introduce Twirla at a price that is commensurate with that of current branded contraceptive products, or we are unable to gain reimbursement from payors for Twirla, or if patients are unwilling to pay any price differential between Twirla and a generic contraceptive, our revenues will be limited. For example, in light of the introduction of the branded generic version of the Ortho Evra product by Mylan Inc. in April 2014, and the subsequent discontinuation of distribution of Ortho Evra in October 2014 by Janssen we may have to take additional measures in order to be competitive and gain market share. For example, we may increase the rebates available to commercial payors or we may provide incentives to consumers covered by non-governmental payors, such as coupons or rebates, in order to make up for the difference in the co-payment for Twirla and the generic patch product.\nPrescribers, patients and payors may not adopt a new contraceptive patch due to concerns based upon the prior experience with or perception of the previously marketed contraceptive patch and its currently marketed generic equivalent product.\nThe Ortho Evra\u00ae contraceptive patch, or Evra, was introduced in early 2002 and was the first FDA-approved contraceptive patch. The following is a brief history of the Evra market experience:\n\u2022 Evra had rapid uptake in the contraceptive market, achieving a 10% share of the CHC market by September 2003. The initial approved labeling for Evra indicated that it delivered a daily EE dose of 20 micrograms.\n\u2022 Following the approval of Evra, the manufacturer of Evra and the FDA began receiving reports of thrombotic and thromboembolic events.\n\u2022 A pharmacokinetic study was conducted in 2005 and later published in the Journal of Clinical Pharmacology comparing Evra to an oral contraceptive, which demonstrated that Evra was delivering higher serum concentrations of EE compared to an oral contraceptive with an EE dose of 35 micrograms. A pharmacokinetic study evaluates how the body handles a given drug over time; these studies are conducted by measuring the amount of time it takes for the drug to be absorbed, distributed and eliminated throughout the body.\n\u2022 Johnson & Johnson, the manufacturer of Evra, revised the Evra labeling in November 2005 to include information that EE exposure with Evra is 60% higher than that of an oral contraceptive containing EE of 35 micrograms, based on area under the curve, a commonly-used metric for measuring EE exposure in contraceptives. This information was ultimately included in a unique boxed warning and bolded warning in the Evra labeling.\n\u2022 The FDA held a Joint Meeting of the Advisory Committees for Reproductive Health Drugs and Drug Safety and Risk Management on December 9, 2011. The Committees concluded that users of Evra have an increased risk of venous thromboembolism, or VTE compared to users of second-generation contraceptives, such as those containing LNG. The Committees, through a vote, concluded that the benefits of Evra outweighed the risks, but that the current package insert did not adequately reflect the risk/benefit profile.\n\u2022 A subsequent change to the labeling for Evra was implemented in August 2012.\n\u2022 The Evra market share declined rapidly following the labeling changes, from a peak share of 11% in 2005, to 4% by the end of 2006, to 1.4% by the end of 2013.\n\u2022 In April 2014, the Evra label was revised to provide revised dosage form and strength information. However, this revision did not affect the unique boxed warning and bolded warning in the Evra label.\n\u2022 The approval of a generic equivalent to Evra, Xulane was announced by Mylan Inc. in April 2014. Subsequently, in October 2014, Janssen discontinued distribution of Evra and currently over 99% of patch prescriptions are filled with the generic.\nWe have conducted pharmacokinetic studies of Twirla to demonstrate that it delivers a daily EE dose of approximately 30 micrograms, which is less than that delivered by Xulane, according to its FDA approved label. However, because none of our completed Phase 3 clinical trials studied Twirla in a head-to-head comparison with Xulane, we will not be able to make comparative claims regarding the EE exposure, safety, or efficacy of Twirla as compared to Xulane without conducting a supportive head-to-head post-marketing study., As a result, uptake and usage of Twirla and our related revenues could ultimately be limited.\nTwirla could develop unexpected safety, efficacy or quality concerns, which would likely have a material adverse effect on us.\nTwirla was approved in the U.S. based on the SECURE clinical trial, in which patients were enrolled for 13 cycles of treatment. Twirla will now be used by larger numbers of patients, potentially for longer periods of time, and we and others (including regulatory agencies and private payors) will endeavor to collect extensive information on the efficacy and safety of Twirla by monitoring its use in the marketplace. In addition, we will endeavor to conduct a long-term post marketing safety study required by the FDA to compare the risks for venous thromboembolism (VTE) and arterial thromboembolism (ATE) in new users of Twirla to new users of oral combined hormonal contraceptives (CHCs) and new users of Xulane in U.S. women of reproductive age. Further, we may conduct additional trials in connection with lifecycle management programs for Twirla. New safety or efficacy data from both market surveillance and our post-marketing clinical trials may result in negative consequences including:\n\u2022 Modification to product labeling or promotional statements, such as additional boxed or other warnings contraindications, or limitations, or the issuance of \"Dear Doctor Letters\" or similar communications to healthcare professionals or the public regarding safety or efficacy concerns;\n\u2022 Imposition of additional post-marketing clinical trial requirements, distribution restrictions or other risk management measures, such as a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, REMS, which could include elements to assure safe use;\n\u2022 Suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approval;\n\u2022 Suspensions or termination of ongoing clinical trials or refusal by regulators to approve pending marketing applications or supplements to approved applications;\n\u2022 Suspension of, or imposition of restrictions on, our operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements with respect to Twirla;\n\u2022 Costly and time-consuming corrective actions; and\n\u2022 Voluntary or mandatory product recalls or withdrawals from the market and costly product liability claims.\nFurthermore, the discovery of significant problems with a product similar to Twirla that implicate (or are perceived to implicate) the entire class of products could have an adverse impact on our ability to commercialize Twirla. Any of these circumstances could reduce Twirla's market acceptance and would inhibit or delay our ability to commercialize Twirla or gain and/or sustain market share, any of which would adversely affect sales of Twirla.\nWe face competition from other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies and our operating results will suffer if we fail to compete effectively.\nThe biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are intensely competitive. We would have significant competition with contraceptive products already in the marketplace, many of which have substantially greater name recognition, commercial infrastructures and financial, technical and personnel resources than we have. Any new product that competes with a previously approved product may need to demonstrate compelling advantages in efficacy, convenience, tolerability or safety to be commercially successful. In addition, new products developed by others could emerge as competitors to Twirla. If we are not able to compete effectively against our current and future competitors, our business will not grow, and our financial condition and operations will suffer.\nOur potential competitors include, but are not limited to, large, well-established pharmaceutical companies, and specialty pharmaceutical sales and marketing companies. These companies include Merck & Co., Inc., or Merck, which markets Nuvaring\u00ae, TherapeuticsMD, Inc., or TherapeuticsMD, which has licensed and will market Annovera\u00ae, a recently approved contraceptive ring, Allergan, Inc., or Allergan, which markets several branded and generic contraceptives including Minastrin\u00ae 24, LoLoestrin\u00ae, and Taytulla\u00ae, Bayer AG, or Bayer, which markets Beyaz\u00ae, Yaz\u00ae, Yasmin\u00ae, and Natazia\u00ae, and Mylan N.V., which markets Xulane\u00ae, a generic version of Ortho Evra. Additionally, several generic manufacturers currently market and continue to introduce new generic contraceptives, including Sandoz International GmbH, Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Ltd., Lupin Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and Amneal Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\nThere are other contraceptive product candidates in development that, if approved, would potentially compete with Twirla. Specifically, Bayer has a contraceptive patch approved in the European Union, or E.U. Bayer entered into a license and distribution agreement for the sale of this contraceptive patch in Europe with Gedeon Richter Ltd. Other companies that have new hormonal contraceptive product candidates in various stages of development include Allergan (progestin-only vaginal ring for which they received a CRL from the FDA), The Population Council in collaboration with Antares Pharma, Inc. (transdermal gel contraceptive in Phase 2), Mithra Pharmaceuticals SA (combination oral contraceptive in Phase 3), and Panterhei Bioscience (combination oral contraceptive in Phase 2).\nSales of Twirla may be adversely affected by the consolidation among wholesale drug distributors and the growth of large retail drug store chains.\nThe network through which we will sell Twirla and our potential product candidates, if and when approved, has undergone significant consolidation marked by mergers and acquisitions among wholesale distributors and the growth of large retail drugstore chains. As a result, a small number of large distributors control a significant share of the market. In 2018, three companies generated about 95% of all revenues from drug distribution in the United States, and in 2019, the top five chain pharmacy companies owned about 35% of all retail pharmacy outlets. Consolidation of drug wholesalers and retailers, as well as any increased pricing pressure that those entities face from their customers, including the U.S. government, may increase pricing pressure and place other competitive pressures on drug manufacturers, including us.\nExisting and future legislation may increase the difficulty and cost for us to commercialize Twirla and may affect the prices we may obtain.\nIn the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to profitably sell Twirla.\nLegislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products. We do not know whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether the FDA's regulations, guidance or interpretations will change, or what the impact of such changes on our ability to market of Twirla may be.\nIn March 2010, President Obama signed into law the ACA, a sweeping law intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for the healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the healthcare industry and impose additional healthcare policy reforms. The ACA, among other things, increased the Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program for both branded and generic drugs, extended the rebate program to certain individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, addressed new methodologies by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are line extension products and expanded the 340B drug discount program (excluding orphan drugs) to other entities. Further, the ACA imposed a significant annual tax on companies that manufacture or import branded prescription drug products. Substantial new provisions affecting compliance have also been enacted, which may require us to modify our business practices with regard to healthcare practitioners.\nOf particular relevance to our business is the ACA requirement that all health plans, with limited exceptions, cover certain preventive services for women with no cost-sharing, which means no deductible, no co-insurance and no co-payments by the patient. Contraceptive methods and counseling, including all FDA-approved contraceptive methods as prescribed, are included in the ACA mandate, and this has come to be known as the \"contraceptive mandate.\" Under the ACA, payors are only required to cover one favored product within each contraceptive \"method\" without imposing any cost-sharing obligations on the patient. For example, the introduction of a generic contraceptive patch product with a price that will likely be lower than the price of Twirla makes it less clear that Twirla would have a preferred position, such as coverage without a co-insurance payment, under the ACA contraceptive mandate. Other products within the same method may also be covered, but payors are allowed to use reasonable medical management techniques, such as the application of cost-sharing obligations. An amendment was issued that provided an exemption to the contraceptive mandate for group health plans established or maintained by religious employers. However, the contraceptive mandate has remained controversial, with several legal challenges filed around the country. In June 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that owners of certain private companies can object to the contraceptive mandate on religious grounds and in November 2015, the Court agreed to hear arguments from non-profit organizations requesting similar treatment. In October 2017, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced it will seek to issue regulations that will allow all companies to qualify for the exemption from the contraceptive mandate on the basis of religious and moral grounds. While there is an injunction against the administration prohibiting it from implementing these rules, the ultimate outcome of that litigation, which is currently in front of the Supreme Court, cannot be predicted. The ACA appears likely to continue to apply pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, especially under the Medicare program, and may also increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs. Further, on January 20, 2017, the current administration signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the ACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the ACA that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices, among others. There are several proposals to reform the federal healthcare laws being advocated and it is still unclear whether such reform efforts will succeed and if so, which proposals will ultimately be successful. Therefore, it is difficult to determine the full effect of the ACA or any other healthcare reform efforts on our business.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. On August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation's automatic reduction in funding to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and will stay in effect through 2024 unless additional Congressional action is taken. On January 2, 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. We expect that additional federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, and in turn could significantly reduce the projected value of Twirla and our potential product candidates and reduce our profitability.\nMoreover, the Drug Quality and Security Act imposes obligations on manufacturers of pharmaceutical products related to product tracking and tracing. Among the requirements of this legislation, manufacturers are required to provide certain information regarding the drug product to individuals and entities to which product ownership is transferred, are required to label the drug product with a product identifier and are required to keep certain records regarding the drug product. The transfer of information to subsequent product owners by manufacturers is required to be done electronically. Manufacturers must also verify that purchasers of the manufacturers' products are appropriately licensed. Further, under this legislation, manufacturers have drug product investigation, quarantine, disposition, and FDA and trading partner notification responsibilities related to counterfeit, diverted, stolen and intentionally adulterated products, as well as products that are the subject of fraudulent transactions or which are otherwise unfit for distribution such that they would be reasonably likely to result in serious health consequences or death.\nOther measures have also been taken by Congress, the Administration, and administrative agencies to increase drug competition and thus, decrease drug prices. By example, in 2019 FDA introduced a proposed rule and draft guidance to facilitate drug importation. Congress also passed a bill requiring sponsors of NDA approved products to provide sufficient quantities of drug product on commercially reasonable market based terms to entities developing generic and similar drug products. New legislative and regulatory efforts could ultimately have an adverse impact on our business and results of operation.\nThird-party coverage and reimbursement and healthcare cost containment initiatives and treatment guidelines may constrain our future revenues.\nOur ability to successfully market Twirla will depend in part on the level of coverage and reimbursement that government authorities, private health insurers and other organizations provide for Twirla and contraceptives in general. Countries in which Twirla is sold through reimbursement schemes under national health insurance programs frequently require that manufacturers and sellers of pharmaceutical products obtain governmental approval of initial prices and any subsequent price increases. In certain countries, including the United States, government-funded and private medical care plans can exert significant indirect pressure on prices. We may not be able to sell Twirla profitably if adequate prices are not approved or coverage and reimbursement are unavailable or limited in scope. Increasingly, third party payors attempt to contain healthcare costs in ways that are likely to impact our development of products including:\n\u2022 Failing to approve or challenging the prices charged for healthcare products;\n\u2022 Introducing reimportation schemes from lower-priced jurisdictions;\n\u2022 Limiting both coverage and the amount of reimbursement for new therapeutic products;\n\u2022 Denying or limiting coverage for products that are approved by the regulatory agencies but are considered to be experimental or investigational by third party payors; and\n\u2022 Refusing to provide coverage when an approved product is used for off-label indications.\nWe may never seek or receive marketing approval for or commercialize Twirla outside the United States.\nIn order to market Twirla outside the United States, we must obtain separate marketing approvals and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials and commercial sales, pricing and distribution of Twirla. The time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ from and be longer than the time required to obtain FDA approval. The marketing approval process in other countries may include all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval in the United States, as well as other risks. For example, legislation analogous to Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA in the United States may not exist in other countries. In territories where data is not freely available, we may not have the ability to commercialize Twirla, or any products approved in the future, without negotiating the rights from third parties to refer to their clinical data in our regulatory applications, which could require the expenditure of significant additional funds. Further, we may be unable to obtain rights to the necessary clinical data and may be required to develop our own proprietary safety and efficacy dossiers. In addition, in many countries outside the United States, it is required that a product receive pricing and reimbursement approval before the product can be commercialized. This can result in substantial delays in the advancement of our products in such countries. Further, product labeling requirements outside the United States may be different and inconsistent with the U.S. labeling, potentially negatively affecting our ability to market in countries outside the United States.\nMarketing approval in one country does not ensure marketing approval in another, but failure or delay in obtaining marketing approval in one country may have a negative effect on the regulatory process in others. In addition, we may be subject to fines, suspension or withdrawal of marketing approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions, and criminal prosecution if we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements. If we fail to comply with regulatory requirements in international markets or to obtain and maintain required approvals, our ability to market to our full target market will be reduced and our ability to realize the full marketing potential of our products will be harmed.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Capital\nWe have incurred operating losses in each year since our inception and expect to continue to incur substantial losses for the foreseeable future. Management has concluded that these factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe have incurred losses in each year since our inception in December 1997. Our net loss was $18.6 million, $19.8 million and $28.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $260.4 million. In February 2020, we entered into a Credit Agreement and Guaranty with Perceptive Credit Holdings III, LP, or Perceptive, for a senior secured term loan facility of up to $35 million, which we refer to as the Perceptive Credit Agreement. We believe that our cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2019, along with the proceeds of the Perceptive Credit Agreement we have received to date, will be sufficient to meet our projected operating requirements through the end of 2020. They will not be sufficient to fund our current and planned operations through the 12 months following the date\non which this Annual Report on Form 10-K is filed, which raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern may create negative reactions to the price of our common stock and we may have a more difficult time obtaining financing in the future.\nSpecialty pharmaceutical product development is a speculative undertaking, involves a substantial degree of risk and is a capital-intensive business. We expect to incur expenses without corresponding revenues until we are able to sell Twirla in significant quantities, which may not happen. We have devoted most of our financial resources to research and development, including our non-clinical development activities and clinical trials. We expect we will need to incur additional expenses as we complete the qualification and validation of our commercial manufacturing process, initiate pre-launch commercial activities, commercially launch Twirla, advance our other potential product candidates and expand our research and development programs. We will require additional capital to fund our operating needs beyond 2020, including among other items, the completion of our commercial plan for Twirla, which primarily includes validation of our commercial manufacturing process, as well as the commercial launch of Twirla and advancing the development of our other potential product candidates. We may not be able to obtain sufficient additional funding to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce, or even terminate, our operations. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through sales of common stock, convertible preferred stock and convertible promissory notes and to a lesser extent, through term loans and government grants. Our potential product candidates will also require the completion of regulatory review, significant marketing efforts and substantial investment before they can provide us with any revenue.\nWe expect that our expenses will increase as we prepare for the commercial launch of Twirla. As a result, we expect to continue to incur substantial losses for the foreseeable future, and these losses may increase. We are uncertain when or if we will be able to achieve or sustain profitability. If we achieve profitability in the future, we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods. Any failure to become and remain profitable would impair our ability to sustain operations and adversely affect the price of our common stock and our ability to raise additional capital. We are significantly dependent on the success of Twirla, and if we do not achieve the commercial success of Twirla and/or are unable to obtain additional funding, we will need to reassess our operating capital needs and may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce, or even terminate, our operations.\nWe have never been profitable. Currently, we have no products available for commercial sale, no source of revenue pending the commercial launch of Twirla, and we may never become profitable.\nWe have never been profitable and do not expect to be profitable in the foreseeable future. We have no products currently available for commercial sale, and will not have any products available for sale until the commercial launch of Twirla, which we currently anticipate will commence in the fourth quarter of 2020. To date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales. Even if we are able to commercialize Twirla or any other potential product candidate, there can be no assurance that we will generate significant revenues or ever achieve profitability. Our ability to generate product revenue depends on a number of factors, including our ability to:\n\u2022 Obtain additional capital for the commercial scale-up of the Twirla manufacturing process and commercial launch of Twirla as well as advancing the development or our other potential product candidates;\n\u2022 Set an acceptable price for Twirla and our other potential product candidates, if approved, and obtain adequate coverage and reimbursement from third party payors;\n\u2022 Obtain commercial quantities of Twirla and our other potential product candidates, if approved, at acceptable cost levels from our third-party manufacturer;\n\u2022 Successfully market and sell Twirla and our other potential product candidates, if approved, in the United States and abroad; and\n\u2022 Successfully receive regulatory approval for our other potential product candidates.\nIn addition, because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product commercialization and product candidate development, we are unable to predict the timing or amount of increased expenses, or when, or if, we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. In addition, our expenses could increase beyond our current expectations and resources if we are required to provide increased rebates to managed care payors, experience set-backs in the validation of our commercial manufacturing process, we need to increase our manufacturing capacity sooner than planned, experience disruptions in our manufacturing capabilities, or need to alter our marketing strategy. We anticipate incurring significant costs associated with the commercial launch of Twirla and our other potential product candidates, if approved.\nOur ability to become and remain profitable depends on our ability to generate revenue in excess of our increasing costs. Even if we are able to generate revenues from the sale of Twirla and our other potential product candidates, if approved, we may not become profitable and may need to obtain additional funding to continue operations. If we fail to become profitable or obtain additional funding or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis, then we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce our operations. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to become and remain profitable would decrease the value of our company and could impair our ability to raise additional capital, expand our business or continue our operations. A decline in the value of our company could also cause you to lose all or part of your investment.\nOur operating activities may be restricted as a result of covenants related to the outstanding indebtedness under our loan agreement and we may be required to repay the outstanding indebtedness in an event of default, which could have a materially adverse effect on our business.\nIn February 2020, we entered into the Perceptive Credit Agreement for a senior secured term loan facility of up to $35.0 million. A first tranche of $5 million was funded on execution of the Perceptive Credit Agreement. A second tranche of $15 million was funded as a result of the approval of Twirla by the FDA. Another $15 million tranche will be available upon the achievement of certain revenue milestones. The facility will be interest only until the third anniversary of the closing date.\nThe Perceptive Credit Agreement subjects us to various customary affirmative and negative covenants, including requirements as to financial reporting and insurance, and restrictions on our ability to dispose of our business or property, change our line of business, liquidate or dissolve, enter into any change in control transaction, merge or consolidate with any other entity or acquire all or substantially all the capital stock or property of another entity, incur additional indebtedness, incur certain types of liens on our property, including our intellectual property, pay any dividends or other distributions on our capital stock other than dividends payable solely in capital stock or redeem our capital stock. Our business may be adversely affected by these restrictions on our ability to operate our business. The Perceptive Credit Agreement also subjects us to financial covenants in respect of minimum liquidity and minimum product revenue.\nThe loans provided under the Perceptive Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of our property. We are currently required to make interest-only payments through February 2023. Loans under the Perceptive Credit Agreement currently bear interest at rate of 10.25% per annum plus one-month LIBOR, and mature on February 10, 2024.\nThe Credit Agreement contains certain customary Events of Default, which include, among others, non-payment of principal, violation of covenants, inaccuracy of representations and warranties,\nbankruptcy and insolvency events, material judgments, certain regulatory-related events and events constituting a Change of Control (as defined in the Credit Agreement). We may not have enough available cash or be able to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings to repay such indebtedness at the time any such event of default occurs. In that case, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our potential product candidate development or commercialization efforts or grant to others rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves. Perceptive could also exercise its rights as collateral agent to take possession and dispose of the collateral securing the loan for its benefit, which collateral includes substantially all of our property. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected as a result of any of these events.\nWe will need to obtain additional financing to fund our operations and, if we are unable to obtain such financing, we may be unable to commercialize Twirla or to complete the development and commercialization of our other potential product candidates.\nOur operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash since inception. From our inception to December 31, 2019, we have cumulative net cash flows used by operating activities of $227.3 million. We will need to obtain additional capital to fund our future operations, including the commercialization of Twirla. We will need to obtain additional financing to develop and commercialize our other potential product candidates and to complete the development of any additional product candidates we might acquire. Moreover, our fixed expenses such as rent, interest expense and other contractual commitments are substantial and are expected to increase in the future.\nOur future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022 Our ability to successfully commercialize Twirla and our other potential product candidates, if approved;\n\u2022 Our ability to have commercial product successfully manufactured consistent with FDA regulations;\n\u2022 Amount of sales and other revenues from Twirla and our other potential product candidates that we may commercialize, if any, including the selling prices for such products and the availability of adequate third-party coverage and reimbursement;\n\u2022 Sales and marketing costs associated with commercializing Twirla and our other potential product candidates, if approved, including the cost and timing of expanding our marketing and sales capabilities;\n\u2022 Time and cost necessary to obtain regulatory approvals for our other potential product candidates that may be required by regulatory authorities;\n\u2022 Progress, timing, scope and costs of our clinical trials, including the ability to timely enroll subjects in our ongoing, planned and any clinical trials;\n\u2022 Terms and timing of any potential future collaborations, licensing or other arrangements that we may establish;\n\u2022 Cash requirements of any future acquisitions or the development of other potential product candidates;\n\u2022 Time and cost necessary to respond to technological and market developments;\n\u2022 Costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights;\n\u2022 Costs associated with any potential business or product acquisitions, strategic collaborations, licensing agreements or other arrangements that we may establish;\n\u2022 Costs associated with the expansion of our commercial manufacturing process for Twirla and/or the establishment of a backup supplier;\n\u2022 Costs associated with the hiring of new employees and our contract sales force; and\n\u2022 Costs associated with the leasing of additional office space.\nUntil we can generate a sufficient amount of revenue, we may finance future cash needs through public or private equity offerings, license agreements, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances and marketing or distribution arrangements. Additional funds may not be available when we need them on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to delay or reduce the scope of our commercialization efforts or one or more of our research or development programs. We may seek to access the public or private capital markets whenever conditions are favorable, even if we do not have an immediate need for additional capital at that time. In addition, if we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams or potential product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us.\nOur planned timeline for the commercial launch of Twirla and our ability to fund our operations through the period of time necessary to successfully commercialize Twirla could be adversely affected based on our inability to timely and successfully complete the validation of our commercial manufacturing process, the failure of Twirla to gain acceptance in the marketplace, our inability to successfully compete with other contraceptive products and the need to provide higher rebates in order to gain a competitive formulary status. We may not be able to obtain sufficient additional funding to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce, or even terminate, our operations. Adequate additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when needed or on attractive terms, or we are unable to enter into strategic collaborations, we then may be unable to complete the commercialization of Twirla and may also be required to further cut operating costs, delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or future commercialization efforts or even terminate our operations, which may involve seeking bankruptcy protection. Our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operating requirements is a forward-looking statement and involves risks and uncertainties, and actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors, including the factors discussed elsewhere in this \"Risk Factors\" section. We have based this estimate on a number of assumptions that may prove to be wrong and changing circumstances beyond our control may cause us to consume capital more rapidly than we currently anticipate. If we choose to accelerate elements of our commercial plan or we encounter any unforeseen events that affect our business plan, we may choose to raise additional funds to provide us with additional working capital. Our inability to obtain additional funding when we need it could seriously harm our business and we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce, or even terminate, our operations.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to our existing stockholders or restrict our operations.\nWe may seek additional capital through a combination of private and public equity offerings, debt financings and strategic collaborations. The sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in the issuance of additional shares of our capital stock and could result in dilution to our stockholders. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed payment obligations and could also result in certain restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, limitations on our ability to acquire or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. We cannot guarantee that\nfuture financing will be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, we will be prevented from pursuing research and development efforts. This could harm our business, operating results and financial condition and cause the price of our common stock to fall.\nRisks Relating to Maintaining Regulatory Compliance and Approval of Twirla\nWe remain subject to substantial ongoing regulatory requirements related to Twirla, and failure to comply with these requirements could lead to penalties, including withdrawal from the market, suspension, or withdrawal of product approval.\nTwirla is subject to ongoing regulatory requirements governing the manufacturing, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, import, export, safety surveillance, advertising, marketing promotion, recordkeeping, reporting of adverse events and other post-market information, and further development, including ongoing requirements for costly post-marketing studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials or post-market surveillance. For example, as part of the FDA's approval of Twirla, the FDA has required a long-term post-marketing safety study to assess and describe the risks of Twirla, including the risk of VTE and ATE compared to oral combined hormonal contraceptives and Xulane. This study is similar to one recently required by FDA for another contraceptive product. We will also conduct a second small post-marketing study, required by FDA, to assess Twirla's residual drug content, strength, and adhesion. The results generated in these post-approval clinical trials could result in loss of marketing approval, changes in product labeling, or new or increased concerns about side effects or efficacy of a product. Failure to comply with post-market study requirements can also result in enforcement action or FDA removal of the product from the market.\nOther post-approval requirements include registration with the FDA, listing of our drug products, payment of annual fees, as well as continued compliance with cGCPs for any clinical trials that we conduct post-approval. Application holders must notify the FDA, and depending on the nature of the change, obtain FDA pre-approval for product manufacturing changes. In addition, manufacturers of drug products and their facilities are subject to continual review and routine inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with the FDA's manufacturing requirements relating to quality control, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents. If we are found to be noncompliant with applicable requirements, the FDA and other government authorities may issue a Warning Letter or Untitled Letter, or take other regulatory action such as a product seizure and detention, withdrawal of product approval, requests for a recall, refusal to allow the import or export of the product, criminal or civil penalties, injunction against or restriction of product manufacture or distribution, consent decrees, disgorgement, restitution, clinical holds or terminations of clinical trials, FDA debarment, debarment from government contracts or refusal of orders under existing contracts, exclusion from federal healthcare programs, corporate integrity agreements, or imprisonment.\nThe FDA has the authority to require a REMS after approval, which may impose further requirements or restrictions on the information that patients must be provided, distribution or use of an approved drug, such as limiting prescribing to certain physicians or medical centers that have undergone specialized training, limiting treatment to patients who meet certain safe-use criteria or requiring treated patients to enroll in a registry.\nWith respect to sales and marketing activities by us or any future collaborative partner, advertising and promotional materials must comply with the FDA's rules in addition to other applicable federal and local laws in the United States and similar legal requirements in other countries. In the United States, the distribution of product samples to physicians must comply with the requirements of the U.S. Prescription Drug Marketing Act and is subject to certain requirements. We may also be subject, directly or indirectly through our customers and partners, to various fraud and abuse laws, including,\nwithout limitation, the U.S. Anti-Kickback Statute, U.S. False Claims Act and similar state laws, which impact, among other things, our proposed sales, marketing and scientific/educational efforts. If we participate in the U.S. Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, the Federal Supply Schedule of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, or other government drug programs, we will be subject to complex laws and regulations regarding reporting and payment obligations. All of these activities are also potentially subject to U.S. federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. Similar requirements exist in many of these areas in other countries.\nIn addition, our product labeling, advertising and promotional materials for Twirla will be subject to regulatory requirements and continuing review by the FDA, Department of Justice, Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Inspector General, state attorneys general, members of Congress and the public. The FDA strictly regulates the promotional claims that may be made about prescription products. In particular, a product may not be promoted for uses that are not approved by the FDA as reflected in the product's approved labeling, a practice known as off-label promotion. Physicians may nevertheless prescribe the products to their patients in a manner that is inconsistent with the approved label. If we are found to have promoted such off-label uses, we may become subject to significant liability and government fines. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant sanctions. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion and has enjoined several companies from engaging in off-label promotion. The FDA has also requested that companies enter into consent decrees of permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed.\nIn the United States, engaging in the impermissible promotion of our products for off-label uses can also subject us to false claims litigation under federal and state statutes, which can lead to civil and criminal penalties and fines, agreements with governmental authorities that materially restrict the manner in which we promote or distribute drug products through, for example, corporate integrity agreements, and debarment, suspension or exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs. These false claims statutes include the federal civil False Claims Act, which allows any individual to bring a lawsuit against a pharmaceutical company on behalf of the federal government alleging submission of false or fraudulent claims or causing others to present such false or fraudulent claims, for payment by a federal program such as Medicare or Medicaid. If the government decides to intervene and prevails in the lawsuit, the individual will share in the proceeds from any fines or settlement funds. If the government declines to intervene, the individual may pursue the case alone. Since 2004, these False Claims Act lawsuits against pharmaceutical companies have increased significantly in volume and breadth, leading to several substantial civil and criminal settlements regarding certain sales practices promoting off-label drug uses involving fines that are as much as $3.0 billion. This growth in litigation has increased the risk that a pharmaceutical company will have to defend a false claim action, pay settlement fines or restitution, as well as criminal and civil penalties, agree to comply with burdensome reporting and compliance obligations, and be excluded from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs. If we do not lawfully promote our approved products, we may become subject to such litigation and, if we do not successfully defend against such actions, those actions may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIf we or a regulatory agency discover previously unknown problems with Twirla or with a potential product candidate, once approved, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, data integrity issues with regulatory filings, problems with the facility where the product is manufactured or we or our manufacturers or others working on our behalf fail to comply with applicable regulatory\nrequirements after marketing approval, we may be subject to reporting obligations as well as the following administrative or judicial sanctions:\n\u2022 Restrictions on the marketing, distribution or manufacturing of the product, withdrawal of the product from the market, or requests for product recalls;\n\u2022 Issuance of Warning Letters, Cyber Letters or Untitled Letters;\n\u2022 Mandated modification to promotional materials and labeling requirements or provision of corrective information to healthcare providers;\n\u2022 FDA or regulatory authority issuance of safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases, or other communications containing warnings and other safety information about the product;\n\u2022 Entry into a consent decree or corporate integrity agreement, which can include imposition of various fines, reimbursement for inspection costs, required due dates for specific actions and penalties for noncompliance;\n\u2022 Clinical holds or termination of clinical trials;\n\u2022 Injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties, imprisonment, monetary fines disgorgement or restitution;\n\u2022 Suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approval;\n\u2022 Suspension of any ongoing clinical trials;\n\u2022 Refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications filed by us, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;\n\u2022 Debarment;\n\u2022 Exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs or refusal of government contracts;\n\u2022 Suspension or imposition of restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements; or\n\u2022 Product seizure or detention or refusal to permit the import or export of product.\nThe occurrence of any event or penalty described above may inhibit our ability to commercialize Twirla or our potential product candidates, if approved, and generate revenue. Adverse regulatory action, whether pre- or post-approval, can also potentially lead to product liability claims and increase our product liability exposure.\nMoreover, the FDA's policies may change, and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay the sale and promotion of Twirla or marketing approval and the sale and promotion of our potential product candidates, if approved. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any obtained marketing approval, which would adversely affect our business, prospects and ability to achieve or sustain profitability.\nOur relationships with physicians, customers and payors will be subject to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, exclusion from government healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm and diminished profits and future earnings.\nHealthcare providers, physicians and others play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any products that we commercialize. Our arrangements with third-party payors,\nincluding government healthcare programs, and customers will expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute Twirla. Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations include the following:\n\u2022 The federal healthcare anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid;\n\u2022 The federal False Claims Act imposes criminal and civil penalties, including civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease, or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;\n\u2022 The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created federal criminal statutes that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;\n\u2022 HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, and its implementing regulations, impose obligations on covered healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses, as well as their business associates that create receive, maintain or transmit individually identifiable health information for or on behalf of a covered entity, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;\n\u2022 The federal physician payment transparency requirements and applicable regulations require manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report certain information to the Department of Health and Human Services including information related to payments and other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals and the ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and\n\u2022 Analogous state laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws that may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry's voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures and drug pricing; and state laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act, governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nCompliance with these and other federal and state laws applicable to the sale, marketing, and distribution of commercial drug products will require that we expend time and financial resources to maintain compliance. Additionally, the risk of our being found in violation of these laws and regulations is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the relevant government or regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. Moreover, healthcare reform legislation has strengthened these laws. For example, the ACA, among other things, amended the intent requirement of the federal anti-kickback and criminal healthcare fraud statutes; such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of these statutes or specific intent to violate them. In addition, the ACA provides that the government\nmay assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the false claims statutes.\nEfforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations are costly. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations, including anticipated activities conducted by our sales team in the sale of Twirla are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to a variety of different consequences, depending upon which law we are found to have violated, including significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, corporate integrity agreements, refusal of government contracts, contract debarment and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If any of the physicians or other providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found to not be in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs.\nRisks Related to Manufacturing and Our Reliance on Third Parties\nWe have no manufacturing capacity and anticipate continued reliance on Corium, our third-party manufacturer, for the commercialization of Twirla and development of our potential product candidates. We may not have or be able to obtain sufficient quantities of Twirla or our potential product candidates to meet our required supply for commercialization or clinical trials, which would materially harm our business.\nCorium is a biopharmaceutical company that focuses on the development, manufacture, and commercialization of specialty transdermal products. In addition to partnering with other companies to manufacture transdermal products, Corium also engages in the research and development of its own proprietary transdermal drug delivery products. We rely on Corium, our third-party manufacturer, to produce commercial supplies and samples of Twirla. We also plan to rely on them for clinical and commercial supplies and samples of our potential product candidates, if approved. We do not own or operate, and have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities for Twirla or our potential product candidates. We lack the resources and the capabilities to manufacture Twirla or any of our potential product candidates on a clinical or commercial scale.\nAs a third-party manufacturer, Corium's business operations are completely beyond our control, and we have no influence over whether Corium changes its management or its business operations or discontinues them entirely. For example, in 2018 Corium was acquired by Gurnet Holding Company, or GHC. Following completion of the transaction, Corium became a private company, wholly owned by GHC. Corium has announced that it plans to continue its operations in Grand Rapids, Michigan, where commercial supplies of Twirla are being manufactured.\nFurthermore, we do not control the manufacturing process of Twirla, and are completely dependent on Corium for compliance with the FDA's manufacturing regulatory requirements for the manufacture of Twirla, our potential product candidates and our other future products, if and when approved. As a manufacturer, Corium or other contract manufacturers that we may use are subject to routine inspection by regulatory authorities, including FDA. If Corium or other contract manufacturers that we may use cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and the strict regulatory requirements of the FDA, they may receive adverse inspectional findings, may need to undertake costly and time consuming corrective actions, and may not be able to maintain regulatory approval for their manufacturing facilities.\nIn addition, while the contracts with our manufacturers contain provisions to help ensure that quality standards and compliance with laws and regulations are maintained, we have no control over the ability of our contract manufacturers to maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance and\nqualified personnel. If in the future, the FDA withdraws its approval of Corium's facilities for the manufacture of Twirla, or if Corium experiences quality or other regulatory issues, we may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities that would also require FDA approval, which would significantly impact our ability to develop and sustain our market share of Twirla and to develop, and obtain, regulatory approval for and market our potential product candidates, if approved. Moreover, if our contract manufacturer cannot successfully manufacture materials that conform to our specifications and the strict regulatory requirements of the FDA, we may be subject to regulatory enforcement action such as adverse inspectional findings, Warning Letters, Untitled Letters, recall requests, withdrawal of product or investigational approvals, clinical holds or termination of clinical trials, refusals to approve pending applications, disgorgement, restitution, exclusion from federal healthcare programs, product seizures and detention, consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, criminal and civil penalties, including imprisonment, refusal to permit import or export of the product and injunction against or restriction of manufacture or distribution. If our contract manufacturer experiences issues in its manufacturing process or is unable to produce commercial supplies in adequate quantity and quality, our commercialization of Twirla could be delayed. An inability of our contract manufacturer to produce supplies in adequate quantity and quality of our Twirla and our potential product candidates could also delay our ability to conduct clinical trials. This may adversely impact our ability to fulfil our post-marketing study requirements for Twirla and obtain regulatory approval of our potential product candidates.\nThe machinery and process to produce the commercial supply of Twirla must be qualified and validated, which is time-consuming and expensive, and this machinery is located within one manufacturing site and is customized to the particular manufacturing specifications of Twirla. If Corium is unable to qualify and validate this equipment and the processes in a timely manner and successfully produce validation batches, our ability to launch and commercialize Twirla will be compromised and we could require additional capital to complete the validation process. If this customized equipment malfunctions at any time during the production process, the time it may take Corium to secure replacement parts, to undertake repairs and to revalidate the equipment and process could limit our ability to meet the commercial demand for Twirla. Similar manufacturing conditions may also apply to our potential product candidates. This may increase the risk that the third-party manufacturer may not manufacture Twirla in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements, that we may not have sufficient quantities of Twirla or our potential product candidates or that we may not have such quantities at an acceptable cost, any of which could delay, prevent, or impair the commercialization of Twirla and the development of our potential product candidates.\nAlthough we have manufacturing agreements with Corium for the commercial supply of Twirla, Corium and several of its suppliers of raw materials will be single source providers to us for a significant period of time. In particular, Corium manufactures Twirla using EE and LNG and components that it purchases from third parties, most of which are single source suppliers of the applicable material. We do not have any control over the process or timing of the acquisition of these raw materials by Corium. Corium's failure to timely obtain, or a disruption in the supply of, these raw materials could lead to an inability to adequately supply the commercial market with finished product of Twirla and in turn adversely affect our business.\nBecause we outsource all of our manufacturing processes, there is no guarantee that there will be sufficient supplies to fulfill our requirements or that we may obtain such supplies on acceptable terms. Although Corium intends to enter into agreements with critical manufacturers, component fabricators and secondary service providers to secure commercial supply of Twirla, not all of such suppliers and service providers will be under contract. Any delays in obtaining adequate supplies of our potential product candidates could limit our ability to meet clinical and commercial demand for Twirla.\nIn addition, in the event Twirla achieves significant market share, Corium may not possess adequate manufacturing capabilities to meet market demand for Twirla. If it becomes necessary to engage an additional third-party manufacturer to produce Twirla, we may need to license certain manufacturing know-how from Corium, or our commercial supply will be limited while the new third-party manufacturer develops the necessary know-how to manufacture Twirla and while we obtain regulatory approval for the addition of a new manufacturer and processes.\nReliance on a third-party manufacturer subjects us to risks that would not affect us if we manufactured Twirla and our potential product candidates ourselves, including:\n\u2022 Reliance on the third party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance;\n\u2022 Reduced control over the manufacturing process for Twirla and our potential product candidates;\n\u2022 The possible breach of the manufacturing agreements by the third party because of factors beyond our control;\n\u2022 The possibility of termination or nonrenewal of the agreements by the third party because of our breach of the manufacturing agreement or based on their own business priorities;\n\u2022 The inability to identify an alternate manufacturer, or if a manufacturer is identified, to secure services on commercially reasonably terms; and\n\u2022 The disruption and costs associated with changing suppliers.\nTwirla and our potential product candidates may compete with other products and product candidates for access to manufacturing resources and facilities. There are a limited number of manufacturers that operate in compliance with the FDA's manufacturing requirements and that are both capable of manufacturing for us and willing to do so. If our existing third-party manufacturer, or the third parties that we may engage in the future to manufacture a product for commercial sale or for our clinical trials, should cease to continue to manufacture our products or potential product candidates for any reason, we likely would experience delays in obtaining sufficient quantities of our products or potential product candidates for us to meet commercial demand or to advance our clinical trials while we identify and qualify alternative suppliers. If for any reason we are unable to obtain adequate supplies of our products or potential product candidates or the components used to manufacture them, it will be more difficult for us to develop our potential product candidates and compete effectively.\nOur third-party manufacturer is subject to regulatory requirements, covering manufacturing, testing, quality control and record keeping relating to Twirla and our potential product candidates, and subject to ongoing inspections by the regulatory agencies. In addition to the above-described regulatory actions, failures by our third-party manufacturer to comply with applicable regulations may result in long delays and interruptions to our manufacturing capacity while we seek to secure another third-party manufacturer that meets all regulatory requirements.\nWe are dependent on numerous third parties in Corium's supply chain for the supply of Twirla and our potential product candidates, and if Corium fails to maintain supply relationships with these third parties, develop new relationships with other third parties or suffers disruptions in supply, we may be unable to continue to commercialize Twirla or develop our potential product candidates.\nWe, through our manufacturing partner Corium, rely on a number of third parties for the supply of active ingredients, other raw materials and laboratory services for the commercialization or Twirla and supply of our potential product candidates. Our ability to commercialize Twirla and to develop our potential product candidates depends, in part, on Corium's ability to successfully obtain the components used to manufacture Twirla and our potential product candidates, in accordance with regulatory\nrequirements and in sufficient quantities for commercialization and clinical testing meeting the applicable quality standards. If Corium fails to develop and maintain supply relationships with these third parties, or if Corium is unable to develop new relationships to replace any existing relationships that are lost, we may be unable to commercialize Twirla or to continue to develop our potential product candidates. Moreover, these third parties will be subject to FDA inspection. If these third parties do not comply with the FDA's regulatory requirements, we may not be able to maintain approval for Twirla or receive or maintain approval for any of our potential product candidates, and we may be subject to other regulatory enforcement action such as adverse inspectional findings, Warning Letters, Untitled Letters, recall requests, withdrawal of investigational approvals, clinical holds, or termination of clinical trials, refusals to approve pending applications, disgorgement, restitution, exclusion from federal healthcare programs, product seizures and detention, consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, criminal and civil penalties, including imprisonment, refusal to permit import or export of the product and injunction against or restriction of manufacture or distribution.\nWe, through Corium, also rely on certain third parties as the current sole source of the materials they supply. Although many of these materials are produced in more than one location or are available from another supplier, if any of these materials becomes unavailable to us for any reason, we likely would incur added costs and delays in identifying or qualifying replacement materials and there can be no assurance that replacements would be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. In certain cases, we may be required to get regulatory approval to use alternative suppliers, and this process of approval could delay the commercialization of Twirla or the development of our potential product candidates, indefinitely.\nIf Corium's third-party suppliers fail to deliver the required quantities of sub-components and starting materials, in accordance with all regulatory requirements, and on a timely basis and at commercially reasonable prices, and we and Corium are unable to find one or more alternative suppliers capable of production at a substantially equivalent cost in substantially equivalent volumes and quality, and on a timely basis, the commercialization of Twirla and the continued development of our potential product candidates, would be impeded, delayed, limited or prevented, which could harm our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. We could also face regulatory enforcement actions.\nIf the manufacturing facilities of Corium are not maintained in a manner that is compliant with FDA's manufacturing requirements, we may need to find alternative manufacturers and suppliers, which could result in supply interruptions of Twirla and our potential product candidates, additional costs and lost revenues.\nCorium's facilities used for the manufacture of Twirla and our potential product candidates must be maintained in a manner compliant with the FDA's manufacturing requirements, including obtaining favorable inspection reports. We do not control the manufacturing process and are dependent on Corium for compliance with the FDA's requirements for manufacture of Twirla and our potential product candidates. If Corium cannot successfully manufacture material components and finished products that conform to our specifications and the FDA's strict regulatory requirements, they and we may be subject to regulatory action, including adverse inspectional findings, Warning Letters, Untitled Letters, product recall requests, withdrawal of product or investigational approvals, non-approval of marketing applications, clinical holds or termination of clinical trials, disgorgement, restitution, exclusion from federal healthcare programs, detentions or seizures, refusal to allow the import or export of a product, injunction against or restriction of manufacture or distribution, consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, criminal and civil penalties, including imprisonment, and Corium may not be able to maintain FDA approval for its manufacturing facilities or acceptance of its manufacturing data in regulatory filings. If Corium's facilities cannot maintain compliance with FDA requirements, we may need to find and successfully qualify alternative manufacturing facilities, which could result in supply interruptions of Twirla and our potential product candidates and substantial\nadditional costs as a result of such delays, including costs with respect to finding alternative manufacturing facilities, and lost revenues. There is further no guarantee that the FDA would approve these alternative facilities.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct aspects of our clinical trials and post marketing studies. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, meet expected deadlines or comply with applicable regulatory requirements, we may not be able to maintain regulatory approval for Twirla or be delayed in obtaining or ultimately not be able to obtain marketing approval for our potential product candidates.\nWe currently rely and plan to continue to rely on CROs and clinical trial sites for most aspects of our post-marketing study and any other clinical trials of our potential product candidates, such as trial conduct, data management, statistical analysis and electronic compilation of our FDA submission. We may enter into agreements with additional CROs and clinical trial sites to obtain additional resources and expertise in an attempt to accelerate our progress with regard to new or ongoing clinical and preclinical programs. Entering into relationships with CROs and clinical trial sites involves substantial cost and requires extensive management time and focus. In addition, typically there is a transition period between engagement of a CRO and clinical trial sites and the time the CRO and sites commences work. As a result, delays may occur, which may materially impact our ability to meet our desired post-marketing and clinical development timelines and ultimately have a material adverse impact on the commercialization of Twirla, our ability to maintain our marketing authorization for Twirla, our operating results, financial condition or future prospects. For example, as part of Twirla's approval, the FDA is requiring that we conduct a post-marketing study comparing the risks for venous thromboembolism (VTE) and arterial thromboembolism (ATE) in new users of Twirla to new users of oral combined hormonal contraceptives (CHCs) and new users of Xulane in U.S. women of reproductive age. The FDA has also required a second small post-marketing study to assess Twirla's residual drug content, strength, and adhesion. We plan to engage the services of a CRO to design, enroll, and complete this study, which will likely involve thousands of subjects and hundreds of clinical trial sites and will require substantial time and resources. If the CRO cannot enroll subjects and complete the trial in a timely manner, we may be unable to complete the study required by the FDA and subsequently may lose our marketing authorization for Twirla or be subject to other enforcement actions, and be forced to suspend commercial activities regarding the product.\nAs CROs and clinical investigators are not our employees, we cannot control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to our clinical trials for which they are engaged to perform, and whether they comply with the applicable regulatory requirements, known as Current Good Clinical Practices, or cGCPs, which are regulations and guidelines enforced by the FDA, the Competent Authorities of the Member States of the European Economic Area, or EEA, and comparable foreign regulatory authorities for all of our products and potential product candidates in clinical trials, which include requirements related to the conduct of the study, subject informed consent, and IRB approval. Regulatory authorities enforce these cGCPs through routine inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and trial sites. Although we may rely on third parties for the execution of our trials, we are nevertheless responsible for ensuring that each of our studies is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol, legal, regulatory and scientific standards and our reliance on CROs and clinical trial sites does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. If we, any of our CROs, or clinical trial sites fail to comply with applicable cGCPs, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA, European Medicines Agency or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications for potential product candidates in development, or to perform additional post marketing studies for approved products or determine that data from the post marketing study is not sufficient to support maintaining marketing authorization for the product at issue. We cannot assure you that, upon\ninspection by a given regulatory authority, such regulatory authority will determine that any of our clinical trials or post marketing studies complies with cGCP regulations.\nIn addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with product and potential product candidates' materials produced in compliance with the FDA's manufacturing regulations. Our failure to comply with these regulations may require us to discontinue or repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process for our potential product candidates or impact our ability to meet our post-market study requirements. If the CROs or clinical trial sites we engage do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations, conduct the clinical trials in accordance with all regulatory requirements and the applicable protocols, or meet expected deadlines, or if they need to be replaced, or the quality or accuracy of the data they provide is compromised due to the failure to adhere to regulatory requirements or for other reasons, then our development programs may be extended, delayed or terminated, we may not be able to obtain marketing approval for or successfully commercialize our potential product candidates, or we may not be able to meet our post-market study requirements. Failure to comply with clinical trial regulatory requirements may further subject us to regulatory action, including Warning Letters, Untitled Letters, adverse inspectional findings, clinical holds or termination of clinical trials, non-approval of marketing applications, criminal and civil penalties, including imprisonment, injunction against manufacture or distribution and debarment. As a result, our financial results and the commercial prospects for Twirla or our potential product candidates would be harmed and our costs would increase.\nAny collaboration arrangements that we may enter into in the future may not be successful, which could adversely affect our ability commercialize Twirla and to develop and commercialize our potential product candidates.\nWe may seek partnerships, collaborations and other strategic transactions to maximize the commercial potential of Twirla, our potential product candidates and our proprietary technologies in the United States and territories throughout the world. We may enter into such arrangements on a selective basis depending on the merits of retaining commercialization rights for ourselves as compared to entering into selective collaboration arrangements with leading pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies for Twirla and each of our potential product candidates and technologies, both in the United States and internationally. We face competition in seeking appropriate collaborators. Moreover, collaboration arrangements are complex, and time consuming to negotiate, document and implement. We may not be successful in our efforts to establish and implement collaborations or other alternative arrangements should we choose to enter into such arrangements. The terms of any collaborations or other arrangements that we may establish may not be favorable to us.\nAny future collaborations that we enter into may not be successful. The success of our collaboration arrangements will depend heavily on the efforts and activities of our collaborators. Collaborators generally have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to these collaborations. Collaborators, also, may not comply with the applicable regulatory requirements, which may subject them or us to enforcement actions.\nDisagreements between parties to a collaboration arrangement regarding clinical development and commercialization matters could lead to delays in the commercialization of Twirla or the development process or commercialization of our potential product candidates and, in some cases, termination of the collaboration arrangement. These disagreements can be difficult to resolve if neither of the parties has final decision-making authority.\nCollaborations with pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies and other third parties often are terminated or allowed to expire by the other party. Any such termination or expiration could adversely affect us financially and could harm our business reputation.\nIf we fail to establish an effective distribution process our business may be adversely affected.\nWe do not currently have the infrastructure necessary for distributing pharmaceutical products. We intend to contract with a third-party logistics wholesaler to warehouse these products and distribute them to pharmacies. This distribution network will require significant coordination with our sales and marketing and finance organizations. Failure to secure contracts with third party logistics providers s could negatively impact the distribution of Twirla and our potential product candidates, if and when approved, and failure to coordinate financial systems could negatively impact our ability to accurately report product revenue. If we are unable to effectively establish and manage the distribution process, the commercial launch and sales of Twirla and of our potential product candidates, if and when approved, will be delayed or severely compromised and our results of operations may be harmed. Distribution practices will also need to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements and we and our distributors will be required to hold state licenses in the States to which Twirla or any of our potential product candidates, if approved, are distributed. If we or our distributors do not comply with the applicable regulatory requirements, we could be exposed to potential enforcement actions and product distribution may be interrupted or discontinued.\nWe may rely on third parties to perform many essential services for any products that we commercialize, including services related to government price reporting, customer service, accounts receivable management, cash collection, and pharmacovigilance and adverse event reporting. If these third parties fail to perform as expected or to comply with legal and regulatory requirements, our ability to commercialize our potential product candidates will be significantly impacted and we may be subject to regulatory sanctions.\nWe may retain third-party service providers to perform a variety of functions related to Twirla, key aspects of which will be out of our direct control. These service providers may provide key services related to customer service, accounts receivable management, and cash collection. If we retain a service provider, we would substantially rely on it as well as other third-party providers that perform services for us. If these third-party service providers fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, fail to meet expected deadlines, or otherwise do not carry out their contractual duties to us, or encounter physical or natural damage at their facilities, our ability to deliver product to meet commercial demand would be significantly impaired and we may be subject to regulatory enforcement action.\nIn addition, we may engage third parties to perform various other services for us relating to pharmacovigilance and adverse event reporting, safety database management, fulfillment of requests for medical information regarding Twirla and related services. If the quality or accuracy of the data maintained by these service providers is insufficient, or these third parties otherwise fail to comply with regulatory requirements, we could be subject to regulatory sanctions.\nWe may further contract with a third party to calculate and report pricing information mandated by various government programs. If a third party fails to timely report or adjust prices as required, or errors in calculating government pricing information from transactional data in our financial records, it could impact our discount and rebate liability, and potentially subject us to regulatory sanctions or False Claims Act lawsuits.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property Rights\nWe may not be able to protect our proprietary technology in the marketplace.\nWe depend on our ability to protect our proprietary technology. We rely on trade secret, patent, copyright and trademark laws, and confidentiality, licensing and other agreements with employees and third parties, all of which offer only limited protection. Our success depends in large part on our ability and any future licensee's ability to maintain our patents and to obtain additional patent protection in the United States and other countries with respect to our proprietary technology and products. We believe we will be able to obtain, through prosecution of our pending patent applications, additional\npatent protection for our proprietary technology. If we are compelled to spend significant time and money protecting or enforcing our patents, designing around patents held by others or licensing or acquiring, potentially for large fees, patents or other proprietary rights held by others, our business and financial prospects may be harmed. If we are unable to effectively protect the intellectual property that we own, other companies may be able to offer for sale the same or similar products containing the generically available active pharmaceutical ingredients in Twirla and our potential product candidates, which could materially adversely affect our competitive business position and harm our business prospects. Our patents may be challenged, narrowed, invalidated or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing the same or similar products or limit the length of the term of patent protection that we may have for our potential product candidates. Even if our patents are unchallenged, they may not adequately protect our intellectual property, provide exclusivity for our potential product candidates or prevent others from designing around our claims. Any of these outcomes could impair our ability to prevent competition from third parties, which may have an adverse impact on our business.\nThe patent positions of pharmaceutical products are often complex and uncertain. The breadth of claims allowed in pharmaceutical patents in the United States and many jurisdictions outside of the United States is not consistent. For example, in many jurisdictions the support standards for pharmaceutical patents are becoming increasingly strict. Some countries prohibit method of treatment claims in patents. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property or create uncertainty. In addition, publication of information related to our current product and potential product candidates and potential products may prevent us from obtaining or enforcing patents relating to this product and potential product candidates and potential products, including without limitation transdermal delivery systems and methods of using such transdermal delivery systems. Our product and potential product candidates contain generically available active pharmaceutical ingredients. As a result, new chemical entity patents directed to the active pharmaceutical ingredients in our product and potential product candidates, which are generally believed to offer the strongest form of patent protection, are not available for our potential product candidates.\nPatents that we own or may license in the future do not necessarily ensure the protection of our intellectual property for a number of reasons, including without limitation the following:\n\u2022 The active pharmaceutical ingredients in Twirla and our potential product candidates are generic and therefore our patents do not include claims directed solely to the active pharmaceutical ingredients;\n\u2022 Our patents may not be broad or strong enough to prevent competition from other products that are identical or similar to Twirla or our potential product candidates using the same active pharmaceutical ingredients;\n\u2022 There can be no assurance that the term of patent protection will be long enough for our company to realize sufficient economic value under the patents following commercialization of Twirla or our potential product candidates, if approved;\n\u2022 Our issued patents and pending patent applications that may issue as patents in the future may not prevent entry into the U.S. market or other markets of generic versions of Twirla or our other potential product candidates;\n\u2022 Our patents may face paragraph IV challenges from potential generic or 505(b)(2) applicants, asserting that our applicable patents are invalid, unenforceable, or will not be infringed by the manufacture, use, or sale of the competitive drug product;\n\u2022 We do not at this time own or control issued foreign patents in all markets that would prevent generic entry into some markets for Twirla or our potential product candidates;\n\u2022 We may be required to disclaim part of the term of one or more patents;\n\u2022 There may be prior art of which we are not aware that may affect the validity or enforceability of one or more patent claims;\n\u2022 There may be prior art of which we are aware, which we do not believe affects the validity or enforceability of a patent claim, but which, nonetheless, ultimately may be found to affect the validity or enforceability of a patent claim;\n\u2022 There may be other patents issued to others that will affect our freedom to operate;\n\u2022 If our patents are challenged, a patent office or a court could determine that they are invalid or unenforceable;\n\u2022 There might be changes in the law that governs patentability, validity and infringement of our patents that adversely affects the scope or enforceability of our patent rights;\n\u2022 A court could determine that a competitor's technology or product that is the same as or similar to, Twirla or our potential product candidates does not infringe our patents; and\n\u2022 Our patents could irretrievably lapse due to failure to pay fees or otherwise comply with regulations or could be subject to compulsory licensing.\nOur competitors may be able to circumvent our patents by developing similar or alternative technologies or products in a non-infringing manner. Our competitors may seek to market generic, similar or strength modified versions of any approved products by submitting abbreviated new drug or 505(b)(2) NDA applications to the FDA in which our competitors claim that our patents are invalid, unenforceable or not infringed. Alternatively, our competitors may seek approval to market their own products that are the same as, similar to or otherwise competitive with Twirla or our potential product candidates. In these circumstances, we may need to defend or assert our patents, by means including filing lawsuits alleging patent infringement. In any of these types of proceedings, a court or government agency with jurisdiction may find our patents invalid, unenforceable or not infringed. We may also fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development before it is too late to obtain patent protection. Even if we have valid and enforceable patents, these patents still may not provide protection against competing products or processes sufficient to achieve our business objectives.\nThe issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, ownership, priority, validity or enforceability. In that regard, third parties may challenge our patents in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. Such challenges may result in loss of exclusivity or freedom to operate or in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, in whole or in part, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our technology and potential products. In addition, given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review, and commercial launch of new products, patents protecting any approved product we may have might expire or be held invalid or unenforceable before our company can realize sufficient economic value following commercialization.\nOur intellectual property portfolio is currently comprised of issued patents and pending patent applications. If our issued patents are found to be invalid, not enforceable or not infringed by competitor products, or pending patent applications fail to issue or fail to issue with a scope that is meaningful to Twirla or our potential product candidates, our business will be adversely affected.\nThere can be no assurance that our pending patent applications will result in issued patents in the United States or foreign jurisdictions in which such applications are pending. Even if patents do issue on any of these applications, there can be no assurance that a third-party will not challenge their validity or enforceability, that we will obtain sufficient claim scope or term in those patents to prevent a\nthird party from competing successfully with Twirla or our potential product candidates, or that, even if our patents are found to be valid, enforceable, and infringed, a legal tribunal would enjoin infringing activity.\nWe may not be able to enforce our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nThe laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in certain foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of some countries, particularly developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, especially those relating to life sciences. To the extent that we have obtained or are able to obtain patents or other intellectual property rights in any foreign jurisdictions, it may be difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or the misappropriation of other intellectual property rights. For example, some foreign countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner must grant licenses to third parties. In addition, many countries limit the availability of certain types of patent rights and enforceability of patents against third parties, including government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, patents may provide limited or no benefit.\nProceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business. Accordingly, our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights in such countries may be inadequate. In addition, changes in the law and legal decisions by courts in the United States and foreign countries may affect our ability to obtain adequate protection for our technology, Twirla and potential product candidates, and the enforcement of intellectual property.\nRecent patent reform legislation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents.\nOn September 16, 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the Leahy-Smith Act, was signed into law. The Leahy-Smith Act includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law. These include provisions that affect the way patent applications are prosecuted and may also affect patent litigation. In particular, under the Leahy-Smith Act, the United States transitioned in March 2013 to a \"first to file\" system in which the first inventor to file a patent application will be entitled to the patent. Third parties are allowed to submit prior art before the issuance of a patent by the USPTO and may become involved in post-grant proceedings including reexamination, post-grant review, inter partes review, or derivation or interference proceedings challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others. An adverse determination in any such submission, proceeding or litigation could reduce the scope or enforceability of, or invalidate, our patent rights, which could adversely affect our competitive position.\nThe USPTO has developed regulations and procedures to govern administration of the Leahy-Smith Act, and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the Leahy-Smith Act, and in particular, the first to file provisions, did not become effective until March 16, 2013. However, the full impact of the Leahy-Smith Act, as well as the courts' treatment of any appeals to related proceedings, remain unclear. Accordingly, the full impact that the Leahy-Smith Act will have on the operation of our business is not clear. However, the Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, as well as our ability to bring about timely favorable resolution of any disputes involving our patents and the patents of others.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, documentary, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for noncompliance with these requirements.\nPeriodic maintenance fees on any issued patent are due to be paid to the USPTO and foreign patent agencies in several stages over the lifetime of the patent. The USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. While an inadvertent lapse can in many cases be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in unenforceability, invalidity, abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. Noncompliance events that could result in unenforceability, invalidity, abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application include, but are not limited to, failure to respond to official actions within prescribed time limits, non-payment of fees and failure to properly legalize and submit formal documents. If we or any future licensors fail to maintain the patents and patent applications covering Twirla or our potential product candidates, our competitive position would be adversely affected.\nWe may infringe the intellectual property rights of others, which may prevent or delay our commercialization and product development efforts or increase the costs of commercializing Twirla or our potential product candidates, when and if approved.\nOur commercial success depends significantly on our ability to operate without infringing the patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties. For example, there could be issued patents of which we are not aware that Twirla or our current or future potential product candidates infringe. There also could be patents that we believe we do not infringe, but that we may ultimately be found to infringe.\nMoreover, patent applications are in some cases maintained in secrecy until patents are issued. The publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature frequently occurs substantially later than the date on which the underlying discoveries were made and patent applications were filed. There may be currently pending applications of which we are unaware that may later result in issued patents that Twirla or our current or future potential product candidates infringe. For example, pending applications may exist that claim or can be amended to claim subject matter that Twirla or our current or future potential product candidates infringe. Competitors may file continuing patent applications claiming priority to already issued patents in the form of continuation, divisional or continuation-in-part applications, in order to maintain the pendency of a patent family and attempt to cover Twirla or our potential product candidates.\nThird parties may assert that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization and may sue us for patent or other intellectual property infringement or misappropriation. These lawsuits are costly and could adversely affect our results of operations and divert the attention of managerial and scientific personnel. If we are sued for patent infringement, we would need to demonstrate that our product, potential product candidates or methods either do not infringe the claims of the relevant patent or that the patent claims are invalid or unenforceable, and we may not be able to do this. Proving invalidity or unenforceability is difficult. For example, in the United States, proving invalidity requires a showing of clear and convincing evidence to overcome the presumption of validity enjoyed by issued patents. Even if we are successful in these proceedings, we may incur substantial costs and the time and attention of our management and scientific personnel could be diverted in pursuing these proceedings, which could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, we may not have sufficient resources to bring these actions to a successful conclusion. If a court holds that any third-party patents are valid, enforceable and cover our product, potential product candidates, or their use, the holders of any of these patents may be able to block our ability to commercialize\nTwirla or our potential product candidates unless we acquire or obtain a license under the applicable patents or until the patents expire. We may not be able to enter into licensing arrangements or make other arrangements at a reasonable cost or on reasonable terms. Any inability to secure licenses or alternative technology could result in delays in the introduction of our product or potential product candidates or lead to prohibition of the manufacture or sale of our product or potential product candidates by us. Even if we are able to obtain a license, it may be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us. We could be forced, including by court order, to cease commercializing the infringing technology or product. In addition, in any such proceeding or litigation, we could be found liable for monetary damages, including treble damages and attorneys' fees if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent. A finding of infringement could prevent us from commercializing our product or potential product candidates or force us to cease some of our business operations, which could materially harm our business. Any claims by third parties that we have misappropriated their confidential information, know-how or trade secrets could have a similar negative impact on our business. In addition, any uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our operations.\nWe may be subject to claims that we or our employees have misappropriated the intellectual property, including know-how or trade secrets, of a third party, or that claim ownership of what we regard as our own intellectual property.\nMany of our employees, consultants and contractors were previously employed at or engaged by biotechnology companies or other pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Some of these employees, consultants and contractors, including each member of our senior management, executed proprietary rights, non-disclosure and non-competition agreements in connection with such previous employment. Although we try to ensure that our employees, consultants and contractors do not use the intellectual property and other proprietary information or know-how or trade secrets of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or these employees, consultants and contractors have used or disclosed such intellectual property, including know-how, trade secrets or other proprietary information. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. We are not aware of any threatened or pending claims related to these matters or concerning agreements with our senior management, or other of our employees, consultants and contractors, but litigation may be necessary in the future to defend against such claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights, or personnel or access to consultants and contractors. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nIn addition, while we typically require our employees, consultants and contractors who may be involved in the development of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who in fact develops intellectual property that we regard as our own, which may result in claims by or against us related to the ownership of such intellectual property. If we fail in prosecuting or defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights. Even if we are successful in prosecuting or defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to our management and scientific personnel.\nWe may be unable to adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information.\nWe rely on trade secrets to protect our proprietary technological advances and know-how, especially where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. We rely in part on confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, contractors, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors,\nincluding the third parties we rely on to manufacture Twirla and our potential product candidates, to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information. However, any party with whom we have executed such an agreement may breach that agreement and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets. Accordingly, these agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights. In addition, others may independently discover our trade secrets and proprietary information. Further, the FDA, as part of its Transparency Initiative, previously took steps to increase the public disclosure of information regarding FDA-regulated products, including information that we may consider to be trade secrets or other proprietary information. It is not clear at the present time how the FDA's disclosure policies may change in the future, if at all. Failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could enable competitors to use our proprietary information to develop products that compete with our products or cause additional, material adverse effects upon our competitive business position and financial results.\nAny lawsuits relating to infringement of intellectual property rights brought by or against us will be costly and time consuming and may adversely impact the price of our common stock.\nWe may be required to initiate litigation to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights. These lawsuits can be very time consuming and costly. There is a substantial amount of litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the pharmaceutical industry generally. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating expenses and reduce the resources available for development activities or any future sales, marketing or distribution activities.\nIn infringement litigation, any award of monetary damages we receive may not be commercially valuable. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information and trade secrets could be compromised by disclosure during litigation. Moreover, there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient financial or other resources to file and pursue such infringement claims, which typically last for years before they are resolved. Further, any claims we assert against a perceived infringer could provoke these parties to assert counterclaims against us alleging that we have infringed their patents. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their greater financial resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace.\nIn addition, our patents and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions could face other challenges, such as derivation or interference proceedings, opposition proceedings, inter partes review, reexamination proceedings, third party submissions of prior art, and other forms of post-grant challenges. In the United States, for example, post-grant review, which is similar to opposition proceedings available in many countries other than the U.S., was newly established by the Leahy-Smith Act. Any of these challenges, if successful, could result in the invalidation of, or in a narrowing of the scope or preventing the issuance of, any of our patents and patent applications subject to challenge. Any of these challenges, regardless of their success, would likely be time consuming and expensive to defend and resolve and would divert our management and scientific personnel's time and attention.\nIn addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments, and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nIntellectual property disputes could cause us to spend substantial resources and distract our personnel from their normal responsibilities.\nEven if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause us to incur significant expenses and could distract our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce the resources available for development activities or sales, marketing or distribution activities. We may not have sufficient financial or other resources to adequately conduct such litigation or proceedings.\nRisks Related to the Development of Our Additional Potential Product Candidates\nIf we fail to develop and commercialize our current pipeline of additional potential product candidates, our prospects for future growth and our ability to reach or sustain profitability may be limited or never achieved.\nA key element of our long-term strategy is to develop, obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize our portfolio of potential product candidates in addition to Twirla. To do so, we plan to utilize our proprietary transdermal delivery technology, Skinfusion\u00ae, to develop additional potential product candidates. We may not be successful in our efforts to develop our portfolio of additional potential product candidates, and any potential product candidates we do develop may not produce commercially viable products that safely and effectively treat their indicated conditions. To date, our efforts have identified three additional potential product candidates, including AG200-ER, which is a regimen designed to allow a woman to extend the length of her cycle, AG200-SP, which is a regimen designed to provide shorter, lighter periods, and AG890, which is a progestin-only contraceptive patch intended for use by women who are unable or unwilling to take estrogen. AG200-SP and AG200-ER are intended to be Twirla line extensions that would expand the use of Twirla beyond its initial approved use. In July 2016, we began preparations for an initial Phase 2 clinical trial examining the use of AG200-SP along with a smaller lower dose combination EE/LNG patch (SmP) in the fourth week of the woman's cycle. We have decided to postpone the trial and will continue to evaluate the timing for initiating dosing of subjects for this Phase 2 clinical trial, which is dependent on financial and other capital resources. Our planned Phase 2 clinical trial of AG200-SP (SmP) is only the initial clinical trial in this program and AG200-SP (SmP) will require additional clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of this potential product candidate. The other potential product candidates in our pipeline will require additional product development efforts to optimize patch formulations and dosing. In addition, we will need to conduct additional clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of these potential product candidates, which will require additional capital. Substantially all of our resources are currently dedicated to the manufacturing, validation and commercialization of Twirla. We will require additional capital to complete the commercialization plan for Twirla and to advance the development of our other potential product candidates.\nOur development programs may initially show promise in identifying potential product leads yet fail to produce potential product candidates for clinical development. In addition, identifying new treatment needs and potential product candidates requires substantial technical, financial and human resources on our part. If we are unable to obtain development partners or additional development program funding, or to continue to devote substantial technical and human resources to such programs, we may have to delay or abandon these programs. Any potential product candidate that we successfully identify may require substantial additional development efforts prior to commercial sale, including preclinical studies, extensive clinical testing and approval by the FDA and applicable foreign regulatory authorities. All potential product candidates are susceptible to the risks of failure that are inherent in pharmaceutical product development.\nAny clinical development activities, including clinical trials, necessary to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals may not be successfully completed.\nTwirla is our first approved product. While we have one approved product, we may not be successful in conducting and managing the clinical activities, including clinical trials, necessary to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals, which might prevent us from successfully designing, implementing, or completing the clinical trials required to support regulatory approval of our potential product candidates and meet our post-marketing study requirements. The application, approval and maintenance process for the FDA and other regulatory agencies are complex and difficult and vary by regulatory agency, and we might not be able to demonstrate that our potential product candidates or Twirla meet the appropriate standards for initial and continued regulatory approval or initiate and continue to commercialize Twirla or our potential product candidates, if approved, in the U.S. or elsewhere, or we might be significantly delayed in doing so. In such circumstances, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects and the value of our common stock may be materially adversely affected.\nIf we experience any of a number of possible unforeseen events in connection with clinical trials related to our potential product candidates, or Twirla, any potential marketing authorization or commercialization of our potential product candidates could be delayed or prevented or we may not be able to meet our post-marketing study requirements for Twirla.\nWe may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, clinical trials that could delay or prevent our ability to receive marketing authorization or commercialize our potential product candidates, may prevent us from meeting our Twirla post-marketing study requirements, or which may adversely impact our commercialization of Twirla including:\n\u2022 clinical trials may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical trials or abandon product development programs, or we may be required to modify the Twirla label, or regulators may withdraw Twirla approval or impose other conditions or restrictions, such as REMS;\n\u2022 the number of patients required for clinical trials of our product and potential product candidates may be larger than we anticipate, enrollment in these clinical trials may be slower than we anticipate, or participants may drop out of these clinical trials at a higher rate than we anticipate;\n\u2022 we may enroll patients at clinical trial sites in countries that are inexperienced with clinical trials in general;\n\u2022 our third-party contractors may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner, or at all;\n\u2022 regulators, institutional review boards or independent ethics committees may not authorize us or our investigators to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site or may require us to submit additional data, conduct additional studies or amend our investigational new drug application, or IND, or comparable application prior to commencing a clinical trial;\n\u2022 we may have delays in reaching or may fail to reach agreement on acceptable clinical trial contracts or clinical trial protocols with prospective trial sites;\n\u2022 we may have to suspend or terminate clinical trials of our potential product candidates for various reasons, including a finding that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks;\n\u2022 regulators, institutional review boards or independent ethics committees may require that we or our investigators suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements or a finding that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks;\n\u2022 the cost of clinical trials may be greater than we anticipate;\n\u2022 regulators may determine that our studies, study design, or data analyses do not meet their regulatory requirements;\n\u2022 the supply or quality of our potential product candidates, Twirla, or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials may be insufficient or inadequate; or\n\u2022 Twirla or our potential product candidates may have undesirable side effects or other unexpected characteristics, causing us or our investigators, regulators, institutional review boards or independent ethics committees to suspend or terminate the trials.\nOur costs will increase if we experience delays in testing, completion of post-marketing studies, or, for our potential product candidate marketing authorizations. We do not know whether any clinical trials will begin as planned, will need to be restructured or will be completed on schedule, or at all.\nFor Twirla, failure to complete post-marketing studies may also result in enforcement actions or removal of the product from the market. Adverse post-marketing study results may also result in withdrawal or limitations on marketing applications, label changes, or other restrictions or requirements, such as REMS or additional study requirements.\nFor our potential product candidates, we cannot commercialize any potential product candidates in the U.S. without first obtaining FDA approval. Before obtaining regulatory approvals for commercial sale, however, we must demonstrate in, or rely on data from preclinical studies and well controlled clinical trials that the potential product candidate is safe and effective for use in the target indication and that the manufacturing processes, facilities, and controls are adequate. Obtaining marketing approval in the U.S. is a lengthy, expensive and uncertain process, and approval may not be obtained or may be subject to significant restrictions. Significant clinical trial delays also could shorten any periods during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize our potential product candidates, allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do, or impair our ability to successfully commercialize our potential product candidates, and so may harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. Delays in regulatory approvals or failure to obtain regulatory approval for a potential product candidate may result from many factors, including:\n\u2022 Regulatory requests for additional analyses, reports, data, nonclinical and preclinical studies, product design work and testing, and manufacturing development work;\n\u2022 Regulatory questions regarding interpretation of data or new information regarding the potential product candidate or other products;\n\u2022 Regulators may not agree with the design of our studies or our statistical analysis, may interpret our data differently than we do, or may find that our study results are not supportive of approval;\n\u2022 Our studies may reveal unfavorable or inconclusive results, including unfavorable results regarding the potential product candidate's safety or efficacy;\n\u2022 Regulators may determine that our potential product candidates present an unacceptable health risk or that the product's candidate's risks outweigh any benefits;\n\u2022 Regulators may not approve our manufacturing facilities or processes following a facility inspection;\n\u2022 Regulators may determine that our studies were not properly conducted or did not comply with regulatory requirements;\n\u2022 We and regulators may not come to an agreement on product labeling;\n\u2022 We may have insufficient funds to pay FDA's significant application user fees;\n\u2022 We may not be able to use FDA's 505(b)(2) NDA pathway due to changes in FDA's interpretation of the law; and\n\u2022 We may face patent challenges that may result in stays on FDA's ability to approve our potential product candidates.\nDelays or failure to receive regulatory approval for any additional potential product candidates may materially impact our business.\nWe may be unable to license or acquire suitable additional potential product candidates or technologies from third parties for a number of reasons.\nThe licensing and acquisition of pharmaceutical products is competitive. A number of more established companies are also pursuing strategies to license or acquire products. These established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size, cash resources or greater clinical development and commercialization capabilities. In addition, we expect competition in acquiring potential product candidates to increase, which may lead to fewer suitable acquisition opportunities for us as well as higher acquisition prices.\nOther factors that may prevent us from licensing or otherwise acquiring suitable potential product candidates include the following:\n\u2022 We may be unable to license or acquire the relevant technology on terms that would allow us to make an appropriate return on our investment in such product;\n\u2022 Companies that perceive us to be their competitor may be unwilling to assign or license their product rights to us;\n\u2022 We may be unable to identify suitable products or potential product candidates within our areas of expertise; or\n\u2022 We may not have sufficient funds to acquire, develop or commercialize additional potential product candidates or technologies.\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations and Industry\nIn order to establish our sales and marketing infrastructure, we will need to grow the size of our organization, and we may experience difficulties in managing this growth.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had a total of 15 full-time employees reflecting a resumption of hiring to advance the commercialization of Twirla. We use third-party consultants to assist with our sales and marketing functions. As our commercialization of Twirla advances, we expect to need to expand the size of our employee base for managerial, operational, commercial, sales, marketing, compliance, regulatory, finance and other resources. Future growth would impose significant added responsibilities on members of management, including the need to identify, recruit, maintain, motivate and integrate additional employees. In addition, our management may have to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from our day-to-day activities and devote a substantial amount of time to managing these growth activities. Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize Twirla and any other future potential product candidates and our ability to compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to effectively manage any future growth.\nIf we are not successful in attracting and retaining highly qualified personnel, we may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy.\nOur ability to compete in the highly competitive pharmaceuticals industry depends in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified managerial, scientific and medical personnel. We are highly dependent on our management, scientific and medical personnel. In order to induce valuable employees to remain with us, we have provided these employees with stock options that vest over time. The value to employees of stock options that vest over time is significantly affected by movements in our stock price that we cannot control and may at any time be insufficient to counteract more lucrative offers from other companies. Additionally, at times, we have also implemented programs that included cash retention bonuses and/or restricted stock units as incentives to retain employees.\nOur management team has expertise in many different aspects of drug development and commercialization. Competition for skilled personnel in our market is intense and competition for experienced personnel may limit our ability to hire and retain highly qualified personnel on acceptable terms. Despite our efforts to retain valuable employees, members of our management, scientific and medical teams may terminate their employment with us on short notice. We have employment agreements with our named executive officers which includes Alfred Altomari, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. The employment agreements provide for at-will employment, which means that Mr. Altomari or any of our other employees could leave our employment at any time, with or without notice. The loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees could potentially harm our business, operating results or financial condition. In particular, we believe that the loss of the services of Mr. Altomari may have a material adverse effect on our business. We do not currently carry \"key person\" insurance on the lives of members of executive management. Our success also depends on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled junior, mid-level and senior managers as well as junior, mid-level and senior scientific and medical personnel.\nOther pharmaceutical companies with which we compete for qualified personnel have greater financial and other resources, different risk profiles and a longer history in the industry than we do. They also may provide more diverse opportunities and better chances for career advancement. Some of these characteristics may be more appealing to high-quality candidates than those that we have to offer. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain high-quality personnel, the rate of and success with which we can commercialize Twirla, as well as our potential product candidates, would be limited.\nIf product liability lawsuits are brought against us, we may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of Twirla or our potential product candidates, if approved.\nWe face potential risks of product liability as a result of the clinical testing and commercial availability of Twirla and the clinical testing of our other potential product candidates. For example, we may be sued if Twirla or any potential product candidate we develop allegedly causes injury or is found to be otherwise unsuitable during product testing, manufacturing, marketing or sale. Any such product liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product, negligence, strict liability and a breach of warranties. Claims could also be asserted under state consumer protection acts. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit commercialization or development of the product or potential product candidate subject to such claims. Even successful defense would require significant financial and management resources. Regardless of the merits or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u2022 Decreased demand for Twirla or any future potential product candidates that we may develop;\n\u2022 Injury to our reputation;\n\u2022 Withdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u2022 Costs to defend any related litigation;\n\u2022 A diversion of management's time and our resources;\n\u2022 Substantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients;\n\u2022 Product recalls, withdrawals or labeling, marketing or promotional restrictions;\n\u2022 Regulatory authority withdrawal of product approvals or refusal to approve pending applications;\n\u2022 Loss of revenue;\n\u2022 The inability to commercialize Twirla or our potential product candidates, if approved;\n\u2022 A decline in our stock price; and\n\u2022 Exposure to adverse publicity.\nWe have obtained limited product liability insurance coverage for Twirla and our clinical trials with a $10.0 million annual aggregate coverage limit. Our inability to obtain and retain sufficient product liability insurance at an acceptable cost to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization Twirla or of potential product candidates we develop. Although we maintain such insurance, any claim that may be brought against us could result in a court judgment or settlement in an amount that is not covered, in whole or in part, by our insurance or that is in excess of the limits of our insurance coverage. Our insurance policies also have various exclusions, and we may be subject to a product liability claim for which we have no coverage. We may have to pay any amounts awarded by a court or negotiated in a settlement that exceed our coverage limitations or that are not covered by our insurance, and we may not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient capital to pay such amounts.\nWe may acquire businesses or products, or form strategic alliances in the future, and we may not realize the benefits of such acquisitions or alliances.\nWe may acquire additional businesses or products, form strategic alliances or create joint ventures with third parties that we believe will complement or augment our existing business. If we acquire businesses with promising markets or technologies, we may not be able to realize the benefit of acquiring such businesses if we are unable to successfully integrate them with our existing operations and company culture. We may encounter numerous difficulties in developing, manufacturing and marketing any new products resulting from a strategic alliance or acquisition that delay or prevent us from realizing their expected benefits or enhancing our business. We cannot assure you that, following any such acquisition, we will achieve the expected synergies to justify the transaction.\nWe continue to incur significant increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management is required to devote substantial time to compliance initiatives.\nAs a public company, we continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as rules subsequently implemented by the SEC and the Nasdaq Capital Market, impose various requirements on public companies, including requiring the establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting and changes in corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations have increased our legal and financial compliance costs and have made some activities more time-consuming and costly. We estimate that we will annually incur approximately $2.0 million in expenses in response to these requirements.\nSection 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Our testing, and the subsequent testing by\nour independent registered public accounting firm, may reveal deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses. We will incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management efforts to comply with internal control over financial reporting requirements. We currently do not have an internal audit group, and we may need to hire additional accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge. Moreover, if we are not able to comply with these requirements in a timely manner or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identifies deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, the market price of our common stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the Nasdaq Capital Market, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources.\nBusiness interruptions could delay us in the process of developing our potential product candidates and could disrupt our sales.\nOur headquarters are located in Princeton, New Jersey, and Corium, our contract manufacturer, is located in Grand Rapids, Michigan. We are vulnerable to natural disasters, such as severe storms and other events that could disrupt our or Corium's operations. We do not carry insurance for natural disasters, and we may not carry sufficient business interruption insurance to compensate us for losses that may occur. Any losses or damages we incur could have a material adverse effect on our business operations.\nOur business and operations would suffer in the event of system failures.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems, and those of other third parties on which we rely, are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures, cyber-attacks or cyber-intrusions over the internet, attachments to emails, persons inside our organization, or persons with access to systems inside our organization. The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber-attacks or cyber-intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments, and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. If such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our drug development programs. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed or ongoing or planned clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of or damage to our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and the further commercialization of Twirla and/or development of our potential product candidates could be delayed.\nOur employees, independent contractors, principal investigators, CROs, manufacturers, consultants, commercial partners and vendors may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements and insider trading, which could significantly harm our business.\nWe are exposed to the risk that employees, independent contractors, principal investigators, CROs, manufacturers, consultants, commercial partners and vendors may engage in fraudulent or other illegal activity, fraud or other misconduct. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional, reckless or negligent conduct or disclosure of unauthorized activities to us that violates: (i) the law and regulations of the FDA and non-U.S. regulators, including those laws that require the reporting of true, complete and accurate information to the FDA and non-U.S. regulators, (ii) healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations in the United States and abroad and (iii) laws that require the true, complete and accurate\nreporting of financial information or data. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, misconduct, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Misconduct in violation of these laws may also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. We have adopted a code of conduct, but it is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct by our employees and other third parties, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including regulatory enforcement actions, the imposition of significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, corporate integrity agreements, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings and curtailment of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.\nOur ability to use net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and certain built-in losses to reduce future tax payments may be limited by provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and may be subject to further limitation as a result of our initial public offering.\nSections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, contain rules that limit the ability of a company that undergoes an ownership change, which is generally any change in ownership of more than 50% of its stock over a three-year period, to utilize its net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and certain built-in losses recognized in years after the ownership change. These rules generally operate by focusing on ownership changes involving stockholders owning, directly or indirectly, 5% or more of the stock of a company and any change in ownership arising from a new issuance of stock by the company. Generally, if an ownership change occurs, the yearly taxable income limitation on the use of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and certain built-in losses is equal to the product of the applicable long-term tax-exempt rate and the value of the company's stock immediately before the ownership change. We may be unable to offset future taxable income, if any, with losses, or our tax liability with credits, before such losses and credits expire and therefore would incur larger federal income tax liability. Our net operating loss carryforwards arising in taxable years ending on or prior to December 31, 2017 will expire between 2019 and 2037 if we have not used them. Net operating loss carryforwards arising in taxable years ending after December 31, 2017 are no longer subject to expiration under the Code.\nIn addition, it is possible that the transactions relating to our initial public offering or subsequent public offerings, either on a standalone basis or when combined with future transactions, have caused us to undergo one or more additional ownership changes. In that event, we generally would not be able to use our pre-change loss or credit carryovers or certain built-in losses prior to such ownership change to offset future taxable income in excess of the annual limitations imposed by Sections 382 and 383 of the Code. We have not completed a study to assess whether an ownership change has occurred, or whether there have been multiple ownership changes since our inception.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nWe expect that our stock price may fluctuate significantly.\nThe trading price of our common stock is highly volatile and is subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control, including limited trading volume. In\naddition to the factors discussed in this \"Risk Factors\" section and elsewhere in this annual report, these factors include:\n\u2022 Our failure to commercialize Twirla or develop and commercialize additional potential product candidates;\n\u2022 Unanticipated efficacy, safety or tolerability concerns related to the use of Twirla;\n\u2022 Regulatory actions with respect to Twirla;\n\u2022 Inability to obtain adequate product supply of Twirla or inability to do so at acceptable prices;\n\u2022 Adverse results or delays in our clinical trials for our potential product candidates;\n\u2022 Changes in laws or regulations applicable to Twirla or any future potential product candidates, including but not limited to clinical trial requirements for approvals, post-approval requirements, and product marketing, advertising, and promotional requirements and limitations;\n\u2022 Actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and operating results;\n\u2022 Actual or anticipated changes in our growth rate relative to our competitors;\n\u2022 Competition from existing products or new products that may emerge;\n\u2022 Announcements by us, our collaborators or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, collaborations or capital commitments;\n\u2022 Failure to meet or exceed financial estimates and projections of the investment community or that we provide to the public;\n\u2022 Issuance of new or updated research or reports by securities analysts;\n\u2022 Fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us;\n\u2022 Share price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our shares;\n\u2022 Additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022 Disputes or other developments related to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters and our ability to obtain patent protection for our technologies;\n\u2022 Announcement or expectation of additional debt or equity financing efforts;\n\u2022 Sales of our common stock by us, our insiders or our other stockholders; and\n\u2022 General economic and market conditions.\nThese and other market and industry factors may cause the market price and demand for our common stock to fluctuate substantially, regardless of our actual operating performance, which may limit or prevent investors from readily selling their shares of common stock and may otherwise negatively affect the liquidity of our common stock. In addition, the stock market in general, and the Nasdaq Capital Market and the stock prices of pharmaceutical companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies.\nWe may be subject to securities litigation, which is expensive and could divert management attention.\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile, and in the past companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation. Litigation of this type could result in\nsubstantial costs and diversion of management's attention and resources, which could adversely impact our business. Any adverse determination in litigation could also subject us to significant liabilities.\nOur existing principal stockholders, executive officers and directors own a significant percentage of our common stock and will be able to exert a significant control over matters submitted to our stockholders for approval.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our executive officers, directors, director nominees, holders of 5% or more of our capital stock and their respective affiliates together beneficially owned approximately 17.7% of our outstanding voting stock.\nAs a result, these stockholders, if they acted together, could significantly influence all matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions. These stockholders may be able to determine all matters requiring stockholder approval. The interests of these stockholders may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of other stockholders. This may also prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our common stock that other stockholders may feel are in their best interest and our large stockholders may act in a manner that advances their best interests and not necessarily those of other stockholders, including seeking a premium value for their common stock, and might affect the prevailing market price for our common stock.\nWe will have broad discretion in how we use the net proceeds from our public and private offerings. We may not use these proceeds effectively, which could affect our results of operations and cause our stock price to decline.\nWe will have considerable discretion in the application of the net proceeds from our completed public and private offerings. As a result, investors will be relying upon management's judgment with only limited information about our specific intentions for the use of the balance of the net proceeds from our completed public and private offerings. We may use the net proceeds for purposes that do not yield a significant return or any return at all for our stockholders. In addition, pending their use, we may invest the net proceeds from our completed public and private offerings in a manner that does not produce income or that loses value.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting in the future, we may not be able to accurately report our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nEffective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and, together with adequate disclosure controls and procedures, are designed to prevent fraud. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. In addition, any testing by us conducted in connection with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or the subsequent testing by our independent registered public accounting firm, may reveal deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses or that may require prospective or retroactive changes to our financial statements or require us to identify other areas for further attention or improvement. If we are unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm determines we have a material weakness or significant deficiency in our internal control over financial reporting once that firm conducts its Section 404 reviews, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our common stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the Nasdaq Capital Market, the SEC or other regulatory authorities. Failure to remedy any material weakness in our internal control over financial\nreporting, or to implement or maintain other effective control systems required of public companies, could also restrict our future access to the capital markets.\nOur disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud.\nWe are subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. We believe that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.\nThese inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by an unauthorized override of the controls. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in our control system, misstatements or insufficient disclosures due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nWe have never paid dividends on our common stock and we do not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, any gains from an investment in our common stock will likely depend on whether the price of our common stock increases.\nWe have not paid dividends on our common stock to date and we currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future. Consequently, in the foreseeable future, you will likely only experience a gain from your investment in our common stock if the price of our common stock increases.\nIf equity research analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they issue unfavorable commentary or downgrade our common stock, the price of our common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock relies in part on the research and reports that equity research analysts publish about us and our business. We do not control these analysts. The price of our common stock could decline if one or more equity analysts downgrade our common stock or if analysts issue other unfavorable commentary or cease publishing reports about us or our business.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law may discourage or prevent a change of control, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders, which could affect our stock price adversely and prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our board of directors that our stockholders might consider favorable. Some of these provisions:\n\u2022 Authorize the issuance of preferred stock which can be created and issued by the board of directors without prior stockholder approval, with rights senior to those of our common stock;\n\u2022 Provide for a classified board of directors, with each director serving a staggered three-year term;\n\u2022 Prohibit our stockholders from filling board vacancies, calling special stockholder meetings or taking action by written consent;\n\u2022 Provide for the removal of a director only with cause and by the affirmative vote of the holders of 75% or more of the shares then entitled to vote at an election of our directors;\n\u2022 Require advance written notice of stockholder proposals and director nominations; and\n\u2022 Require any action instituted against our officers or directors in connection with their service to the Company to be brought in the state of Delaware.\nIn addition, we are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may prohibit certain business combinations with stockholders owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock. These and other provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws and Delaware law could make it more difficult for stockholders or potential acquirers to obtain control of our board of directors or initiate actions that are opposed by our then-current board of directors, including a merger, tender offer or proxy contest involving our company. This provision could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control, whether or not it is desired by or beneficial to our stockholders. Any delay or prevention of a change of control transaction or changes in our board of directors could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.", "PERMNO": 14645, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "AGRX"}
