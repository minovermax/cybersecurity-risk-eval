We describe below the most significant risks that management believes affect or could affect us. Understanding these risks is important to understanding any statement in this Annual Report and to evaluating an investment in our common stock. You should carefully read and consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all the other information included or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report before you make any decision regarding an investment in our common stock. You should also consider the information set forth above under \u201cForward Looking Statements.\u201d If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. If this were to happen, the value of our common stock could significantly decline, and you could lose some or all of your investment. While the following discussion provides a description of some of the important risks that could cause our results to vary materially from those expressed in public statements or documents, other factors besides those discussed within this Annual Report or elsewhere in other of our reports filed with or furnished to the SEC could also affect our business or results.\nWe have divided this section into the following general risk categories:\n\u2022\nLegal and Regulatory Related Risks\n\u2022\nRisks Related to Our Financial Performance, Financing Our Business, Liquidity and Net Worth and the Economy\n\u2022\nOperational Risks and Other Risks Related to Our Business\n\u2022\nTax Risks\n\u2022\nRisks Relating to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nThe business in which we engage is complex and heavily regulated. If we fail to operate our business in compliance with both existing and future regulations, our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur business is subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local governmental authorities, including the CFPB, HUD, the SEC and various state agencies that license and conduct examinations of our servicing and lending activities. In addition, we operate under a number of regulatory settlements that subject us to ongoing reporting and other obligations. See the next risk factor below for additional detail concerning these regulatory settlements. From time to time, we also receive requests (including requests in the form of subpoenas and civil investigative demands) from federal, state and local agencies for records, documents and information relating to our servicing and lending activities. The GSEs (and their conservator, the FHFA), Ginnie Mae, the United States Treasury Department, various investors, non-Agency securitization trustees and others also subject us to periodic reviews and audits.\nIn the current regulatory environment, we have faced and expect to continue to face heightened regulatory and public scrutiny as an organization as well as stricter and more comprehensive regulation of the entire mortgage sector. We must devote substantial resources to regulatory compliance, and we incurred, and expect to continue to incur, significant ongoing costs to comply with new and existing laws and governmental regulation of our business. If we fail to effectively manage our regulatory and contractual compliance, the resources we are required to devote and our compliance expenses would likely increase. Any significant delay or complication in fulfilling our regulatory commitments and resolving remaining legacy matters may jeopardize our ability to return to profitability.\nWe must comply with a large number of federal, state and local consumer protection laws including, among others, the Dodd-Frank Act, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, RESPA, TILA, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, the Homeowners Protection Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, as well as individual state licensing and foreclosure laws and federal and local bankruptcy rules. These statutes apply to many facets of our business, including loan origination, default servicing and collections, use of credit reports, safeguarding of non-public personally identifiable information about our customers, foreclosure and claims handling, investment of and interest payments on escrow balances and escrow payment features, and mandate certain disclosures and notices to borrowers. These requirements can and do change as statutes and regulations are enacted, promulgated, amended, interpreted and enforced. In addition, we must maintain an effective corporate governance and compliance management system. See \u201cBusiness - Regulation\u201d for additional information regarding our regulators and the laws that apply to us.\nWe must structure and operate our business to comply with applicable laws and regulations and the terms of our regulatory settlements. This can require judgment with respect to the requirements of such laws and regulations and such settlements. While we endeavor to engage proactively with our regulators in an effort to ensure we do so correctly, if we fail to interpret correctly the requirements of such laws and regulations or the terms of our regulatory settlements, we could be found to be in breach of such laws, regulations or settlements.\nOur actual or alleged failure to comply with the terms of our regulatory settlements or applicable federal, state and local consumer protection laws, regulations and licensing requirements could lead to any of the following:\n\u2022\nadministrative fines and penalties and litigation;\n\u2022\nloss of our licenses and approvals to engage in our servicing and lending businesses;\n\u2022\ngovernmental investigations and enforcement actions;\n\u2022\ncivil and criminal liability, including class action lawsuits and actions to recover incentive and other payments made by governmental entities;\n\u2022\nbreaches of covenants and representations under our servicing, debt or other agreements;\n\u2022\ndamage to our reputation;\n\u2022\ninability to raise capital or otherwise secure the necessary financing to operate the business and refinance maturing liabilities;\n\u2022\nchanges to our operations that may otherwise not occur in the normal course, and that could cause us to incur significant costs; or\n\u2022\ninability to execute on our business strategy.\nAny of these outcomes could materially and adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nIn recent years, the general trend among federal, state and local lawmakers and regulators has been toward increasing laws, regulations and investigative proceedings with regard to residential mortgage lenders and servicers. The CFPB continues to take a very active role in the mortgage industry, and its rule-making and regulatory agenda relating to loan servicing and originations continues to evolve. Individual states, including New York and California, have also been active, as have other regulatory organizations such as the MMC. We also believe there has been a shift among certain regulators towards a broader view of the scope of regulatory oversight responsibilities with respect to mortgage originators and servicers. In addition to their traditional focus on licensing and examination matters, certain regulators have begun to make observations, recommendations or demands with respect to such areas as corporate governance, safety and soundness, and risk and compliance management. We must endeavor to work cooperatively with our regulators to understand all their concerns if we are to be successful in our business.\nThe CFPB and state regulators have also increasingly focused on the use, and adequacy, of technology in the mortgage servicing industry, privacy concerns and other topical issues, such as likely discontinuation of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). In 2016, the CFPB issued a special edition supervision report that stressed the need for mortgage servicers to assess and make necessary improvements to their information technology systems in order to ensure compliance with the CFPB\u2019s mortgage servicing requirements. The NY DFS also issued Cybersecurity Requirements for Financial Services Companies, effective in 2017, which require banks, insurance companies, and other financial services institutions regulated by the NY DFS to establish and maintain a cybersecurity program designed to protect consumers and ensure the safety and soundness of New York State\u2019s financial services industry. Likewise, the NY DFS has directed New York-regulated depository and non-depository institutions, insurers and pension funds to submit their plans for managing the risks relating to the likely discontinuation of LIBOR. Similarly, the California Consumer Privacy Act, which was enacted in 2018 and became effective on January 1, 2020, created new consumer rights relating to the access to, deletion of, and sharing of personal information.\nPresently, a level of heightened uncertainty exists with respect to the future of regulation of mortgage lending and servicing, including the future of the Dodd Frank Act and CFPB. We cannot predict the specific legislative or executive actions that may result or what actions federal or state regulators might take in response to potential changes to the Dodd Frank Act or to the federal regulatory environment generally. Such actions could impact the industry generally or us specifically, could impact our relationships with other regulators, and could adversely impact our business and limit our ability to reach an appropriate resolution with the CFPB, with which we are engaged to attempt to resolve certain concerns relating to our mortgage servicing practices, as described in the next risk factor.\nNew regulatory and legislative measures, or changes in enforcement practices, including those related to the technology we use, could, either individually or in the aggregate, require significant changes to our business practices, impose additional costs on us, limit our product offerings, limit our ability to efficiently pursue business opportunities, negatively impact asset values or reduce our revenues. Accordingly, they could materially and adversely affect our business and our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nGovernmental bodies have taken regulatory and legal actions against us in the past and may in the future impose regulatory fines or penalties or impose additional requirements or restrictions on our activities that could increase our operating expenses, reduce our revenues or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, ability to grow and reputation.\nWe are subject to a number of ongoing federal and state regulatory examinations, consent orders, inquiries, subpoenas, civil investigative demands, requests for information and other actions that could result in further adverse regulatory action\nagainst us, including certain matters summarized below. See Note 24 - Regulatory Requirements and Note 26 - Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCFPB\nIn April 2017, the CFPB filed a lawsuit in the federal district court for the Southern District of Florida against Ocwen, OMS and OLS alleging violations of federal consumer financial laws relating to our servicing business dating back to 2014. The CFPB\u2019s claims include allegations regarding (1) the adequacy of Ocwen\u2019s servicing system and integrity of Ocwen\u2019s mortgage servicing data, (2) Ocwen\u2019s foreclosure practices and (3) various purported servicer errors with respect to borrower escrow accounts, hazard insurance policies, timely cancellation of private mortgage insurance, handling of customer complaints, and marketing of optional products. The CFPB alleges violations of unfair, deceptive acts or abusive practices, as well as violations of specific laws or regulations. The CFPB does not claim specific monetary damages, although it does seek consumer relief, disgorgement of allegedly improper gains, and civil money penalties. While we believe we have factual and legal defenses to the CFPB\u2019s allegations and are vigorously defending ourselves, the outcome of the matters raised by the CFPB, whether through negotiated settlements, court rulings or otherwise, could potentially involve monetary fines or penalties or additional restrictions on our business and could have a material adverse impact on our business, reputation, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nState Licensing and State Attorneys General\nOur licensed entities are required to renew their licenses, typically on an annual basis, and to do so they must satisfy the license renewal requirements of each jurisdiction, which generally include financial requirements such as providing audited financial statements or satisfying minimum net worth requirements and non-financial requirements such as satisfactorily completing examinations as to the licensee\u2019s compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The minimum net worth requirements to which our licensed entities are subject are unique to each state and type of license. We believe our licensed entities were in compliance with all of their minimum net worth requirements at December 31, 2019. However, it is possible that regulators could disagree with our calculations, and one state regulator has disagreed with our calculation for a prior year period; we have discussed the matter with the regulator, including why we believe we were in compliance with the applicable net worth requirements. Failure to satisfy any of the requirements to which our licensed entities are subject could result in a variety of regulatory actions ranging from a fine, a directive requiring a certain step to be taken, a suspension or, ultimately, a revocation of a license, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn April 2017 and shortly thereafter, mortgage and banking regulatory agencies from 29 states and the District of Columbia took regulatory actions against OLS and certain other Ocwen companies that alleged deficiencies in our compliance with laws and regulations relating to our servicing and lending activities. These regulatory actions generally took the form of orders styled as \u201ccease and desist orders\u201d and prohibited a range of actions relating to our lending and servicing activities. We entered into agreements with all 29 states plus the District of Columbia to resolve these regulatory actions. These agreements generally contained the Multi-State Common Settlement Terms.\nIn addition, Ocwen entered into settlements with certain states on different or additional terms, which include making additional communications with and for borrowers, certain restrictions, certain review, reporting and remediation obligations, and requirements to make certain monetary payments.\nWe have incurred and will continue to incur, significant costs complying with the terms of these settlements, including in connection with the escrow analysis and the transition to Black Knight MSP. In addition, the remediation of errors identified during the escrow analysis could result in payments, credits or other actions to remediate such errors and legal or other actions could be taken against us by regulators or others with respect to such errors, which could result in additional costs or other adverse impacts. If we fail to comply with the terms of our settlements, additional legal or other actions could be taken against us. Such actions could have a materially adverse impact on our business, reputation, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nAlthough we have resolved all of the administrative actions taken by state regulators in April 2017 and shortly thereafter, we have not resolved all of the legal actions. In April 2017, and concurrent with the issuance of the cease and desist orders and the filing of the CFPB lawsuit discussed above, the Florida Attorney General, together with the Florida Office of Financial Regulation, filed a lawsuit in the federal district court for the Southern District of Florida against Ocwen, OMS and OLS alleging violations of federal and state consumer financial laws relating to our servicing business. These claims are similar to the claims made by the CFPB. The Florida lawsuit seeks injunctive and equitable relief, costs, and civil money penalties in excess of $10,000 per confirmed violation of the applicable statute.\nCertain of the state regulators\u2019 cease and desist orders referenced a confidential supervisory memorandum of understanding (MOU) that we entered into with the MMC and six states relating to a servicing examination from 2013 to 2015. Among other things, the MOU prohibited us from repurchasing stock during the development of a going forward plan and, thereafter, except as permitted by the plan. We submitted a plan in 2016 that contained no stock repurchase restrictions and, therefore, we do not\nbelieve we are currently restricted from repurchasing stock. We requested confirmation from the signatories of the MOU that they agree with this interpretation, and received affirmative responses from the MMC and five states, and a response declining to take a legal position from the remaining state.\nIn January 2018, prior to our acquisition of PHH, PMC entered into a settlement agreement with the MMC and consent orders with certain state attorneys general to resolve and close out findings of an MMC examination of PMC\u2019s legacy mortgage servicing practices. Under the terms of these settlements, PMC agreed to comply with certain servicing standards, to conduct testing of compliance with such servicing standards for a period of three years ending December 31, 2020, and to report to the MMC regarding the same. To the extent PMC does not comply with the terms of the servicing standards, the MMC or state attorneys general could take regulatory action against us, including imposing fines or penalties or otherwise restricting our business activities.\nWe continue to work with the NY DFS to address matters they continue to raise with us as well as to fulfill our commitments under the 2017 NY Consent Order and PHH acquisition conditional approval. To the extent that we fail to address adequately any concerns raised by the NY DFS or fail to fulfill our commitments to the NY DFS, the NY DFS could take regulatory action against us, including imposing fines or penalties or otherwise restricting our business activities. Any such actions could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition liquidity and results of operations.\nWe have certain remaining reporting and other obligations under the 2017 CA Consent Order, including our completion of $198.0 million in debt forgiveness for California borrowers by June 30, 2019. We believe we fulfilled this requirement during the first quarter of 2019. However, our completion of this requirement is subject to testing by the CA DBO\u2019s third-party administrator who must confirm, among other things, that modified loans have remained current for specified time periods. If we are unable to satisfy this requirement or obtain an extension, the 2017 CA Consent Order obligates us to pay the remaining amount to the CA DBO in cash. If the CA DBO were to allege that we failed to comply with our obligations under the 2017 CA Consent Order or that we otherwise were in breach of applicable laws, regulations or licensing requirements, the CA DBO could also take regulatory actions against us, including imposing fines or penalties or otherwise restricting our business activities. Any such actions could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition liquidity and results of operations.\nOther Matters\nOn occasion, we engage with agencies of the federal government on various matters, including the Department of Justice, the Office of Inspector General of HUD, SIGTARP and the VA Office of the Inspector General. In addition to the expense of responding to subpoenas and other requests for information from such agencies, in the event that any of these engagements result in allegations of wrongdoing by us, we may incur fines or penalties or significant legal expenses defending ourselves against such allegations.\nIn recent years, we have entered into significant settlements with the NY DFS, the CA DBO, and the 2013 Ocwen National Mortgage Settlement. These settlements involved payments of significant monetary amounts, monitoring by third-party firms for which we were financially responsible and other restrictions on our business. For example, we recognized $177.5 million in third-party monitoring costs alone relating to these settlements between 2014 and 2017. While we are not currently subject to active monitorships under these settlements, we remain obligated to comply with the commitments made to our regulators and if we violate those commitments one or more of these entities could take regulatory action against us. Any future settlements or other regulatory actions against us could have a material adverse impact on our business, reputation, operating results, liquidity and financial condition will be adversely affected.\nTo the extent that an examination or other regulatory engagement results in an alleged failure by us to comply with applicable laws, regulations or licensing requirements, or if allegations are made that we have failed to comply with applicable laws, regulations or licensing requirements or the commitments we have made in connection with our regulatory settlements (whether such allegations are made through administrative actions such as cease and desist orders, through legal proceedings or otherwise) or if other regulatory actions of a similar or different nature are taken in the future against us, this could lead to (i) administrative fines, penalties and litigation, (ii) loss of our licenses and approvals to engage in our servicing and lending businesses, (iii) governmental investigations and enforcement actions, (iv) civil and criminal liability, including class action lawsuits and actions to recover incentive and other payments made by governmental entities, (v) breaches of covenants and representations under our servicing, debt or other agreements, (vi) damage to our reputation, (vii) inability to raise capital or otherwise secure the necessary funding to operate the business, (viii) changes to our operations that may otherwise not occur in the normal course, and that could cause us to incur significant costs, and (ix) inability to execute on our business strategy. Any of these outcomes could increase our operating expenses and reduce our revenues, hamper our ability to grow or otherwise materially and adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nOur regulatory settlements and public allegations regarding our business practices by regulators and other third parties may affect other regulators\u2019, rating agencies\u2019, and creditors\u2019 perceptions, which could adversely impact our financial results and ongoing operations.\nOur regulatory settlements and public allegations regarding our business practices by regulators and other third parties may affect other regulators\u2019, rating agencies\u2019 and creditors\u2019 perceptions of us. As a result, our ordinary course interactions with regulators may be adversely affected. We may incur additional compliance costs and management time may be diverted from other aspects of our business to address regulatory issues. It is possible that we may incur additional fines or penalties or even that we could lose the licenses and approvals necessary to engage in our servicing and lending businesses. In addition, certain regulators have begun to make observations, recommendations or demands with respect to areas such as corporate governance, safety and soundness and risk and compliance management, which could require us to incur additional expense or which could result in the imposition of additional requirements such as liquidity and capital requirements or restrictions on business conduct such as engaging in stock repurchases. To the extent that rating agencies or creditors perceive us negatively, our servicer or credit ratings could be adversely impacted and our access to funding could be limited.\nIf regulators allege that we do not comply with the terms of our regulatory settlements, or if we enter into future regulatory settlements, it could significantly impact our ability to maintain and grow our servicing portfolio.\nOur servicing portfolio naturally decreases over time as homeowners make regularly scheduled mortgage payments, prepay loans prior to maturity, refinance with a mortgage loan not serviced by us or involuntarily liquidate through foreclosure or other liquidation process. Our ability to maintain or grow the size of our servicing portfolio depends on our ability to acquire the right to service or subservice additional pools of mortgage loans or to originate additional loans for which we retain the MSRs.\nOur regulatory settlements have significantly impacted our ability to maintain or grow our servicing portfolio because we agreed to certain restrictions that effectively prohibited future bulk acquisitions of residential servicing. While certain of these restrictions have been eased in connection with our resolution of state regulatory matters and acquisition of PHH, we are still restricted in our ability to grow our portfolio under the terms of our agreements with the NY DFS. If we are unable to satisfy the conditions of the regulatory commitments we made to these and other regulators, or if a future regulatory settlement restricts our ability to acquire MSRs, we will be unable to grow or even maintain the size of our servicing portfolio through acquisitions and our business could be materially and adversely affected. Moreover, even when regulatory restrictions are lifted, the reputational damage done by these actions may inhibit our ability to acquire new business.\nIf we are unable to respond timely and effectively to routine or other regulatory examinations and borrower complaints, our business and financial conditions may be adversely affected.\nRegulatory examinations by state and federal regulators are part of our ordinary course business activities. If we are unable to respond effectively to regulatory examinations, our business and financial conditions may be adversely affected. For example, our January 2015 consent order with the CA DBO arose out of an alleged failure to respond adequately to requests from the CA DBO as part of a routine regulatory examination. In addition, we receive various escalated borrower complaints and inquiries from our state and federal regulators and state Attorneys General and are required to respond within the time periods prescribed by such entities. If we fail to respond effectively and timely to regulatory examinations and escalations, legal action could be taken against us by such regulators and, as a result, we may incur fines or penalties or we could lose the licenses and approvals necessary to engage in our servicing and lending businesses. We could also suffer from reputational harm and become subject to private litigation.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act has significantly impacted our business and we expect it to continue to do so. In addition, new rules and regulations or more stringent interpretations of existing rules and regulations by the CFPB could result in increased compliance costs and, potentially, regulatory action against us.\nWe have devoted substantial resources and incurred significant compliance costs responding to the Dodd-Frank Act and the rules and regulations issued thereunder, including CFPB rules. We expect to continue to do so. If we fail to comply with the Dodd-Frank Act and the rules and regulations issued thereunder, including CFPB rules and subsequent amendments, we could be subject to financial penalties, restrictions on our business activities, private litigation, breaches of our contractual obligations to counterparties (including our debt agreements) and adverse actions by the GSEs or other entities, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, as discussed in greater detail above, we are currently defending ourselves against a lawsuit brought by the CFPB alleging failures to comply with federal consumer finance laws relating to our servicing business.\nPrivate legal proceedings and related costs alleging failures to comply with applicable laws or regulatory requirements could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to various pending private legal proceedings, including purported class actions, challenging whether certain of our loan servicing practices and other aspects of our business comply with applicable laws and regulatory requirements. For example, we are currently a defendant in various matters alleging that (1) certain fees imposed on borrowers relating to payment processing, payment facilitation, or payment convenience violate state laws similar to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, (2) certain fees we assess on borrowers are marked up improperly in violation of applicable state and federal law,\n(3) we breached fiduciary duties we purportedly owe to benefit plans due to the discretion we exercise in servicing certain securitized mortgage loans and (4) certain legacy mortgage reinsurance arrangements violated RESPA. In the future, we are likely to become subject to other private legal proceedings alleging failures to comply with applicable laws and regulations, including putative class actions, in the ordinary course of our business. While we do not currently believe that the resolution of the vast majority of the legal proceedings we face will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations, we cannot express a view with respect to all of these proceedings. The outcome of any pending legal matter is never certain, and it is possible that adverse results in private legal proceedings could materially and adversely affect our financial results and operations. We have paid significant amounts to settle private legal proceedings in recent periods and paid significant amounts in legal and other costs in connection with defending ourselves in such proceedings. To the extent we are unable to avoid such costs in future periods, our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nNon-compliance with laws and regulations could lead to termination of servicing agreements or defaults under our debt agreements.\nMost of our servicing agreements and debt agreements contain provisions requiring compliance with applicable laws and regulations. While the specific language in these agreements takes many forms and materiality qualifiers are often present, if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could be terminated as a servicer and defaults could be triggered under our debt agreements, which could materially and adversely affect our revenues, cash flows, liquidity, business and financial condition. We could also suffer reputational damage and trustees, lenders and other counterparties could cease wanting to do business with us.\nIf new laws and regulations lengthen foreclosure times or introduce new regulatory requirements regarding foreclosure procedures, our operating costs and liquidity requirements could increase and we could be subject to regulatory action.\nWhen a mortgage loan that we service is in foreclosure, we are generally required to continue to advance delinquent principal and interest to the securitization trust and to make advances for delinquent taxes and insurance and foreclosure costs and the upkeep of vacant property in foreclosure to the extent that we determine that such amounts are recoverable. These servicing advances are generally recovered when the delinquency is resolved or upon liquidation. Regulatory actions that lengthen the foreclosure process will increase the amount of servicing advances that we are required to make, lengthen the time it takes for us to be reimbursed for such advances and increase the costs incurred during the foreclosure process.\nIncreased regulatory scrutiny and new laws and procedures could cause us to adopt additional compliance measures and incur additional compliance costs in connection with our foreclosure processes. We may incur legal and other costs responding to regulatory inquiries or any allegation that we improperly foreclosed on a borrower. We could also suffer reputational damage and could be fined or otherwise penalized if we are found to have breached regulatory requirements.\nIf we fail to comply with the TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure (TRID) rules, our business and operations could be materially and adversely affected and our plans to expand our lending business could be adversely impacted.\nThe TRID rules include requirements relating to consumer facing disclosure and waiting periods to allow consumers to reconsider committing to loans after receiving required disclosures. If we fail to comply with the TRID rules, we may be unable to sell loans that we originate or purchase, or we may be required to sell such loans at a discount compared to other loans. We also could be subject to repurchase or indemnification claims from purchasers of such loans, including the GSEs. Additionally, loans might stay on our warehouse lines for longer periods before sale, which would increase our liquidity needs, holding costs and interest expense. We could also be subject to regulatory actions or private lawsuits.\nIn response to the TRID rules, we have implemented significant modifications and enhancements to our loan production processes and systems, and we continue to devote significant resources to TRID compliance. As regulatory guidance and enforcement and the views of the GSEs and other market participants such as warehouse loan lenders evolve, we may need to modify further our loan production processes and systems in order to adjust to evolution in the regulatory landscape and successfully operate our lending business. In such circumstances, if we are unable to make the necessary adjustments, our business and operations could be adversely affected and we may not be able to execute on our plans to grow our lending business.\nFailure to comply with the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) and related CFPB regulations could adversely impact our business.\nHMDA requires financial institutions to report certain mortgage data in an effort to provide the regulators and the public with information that will help show whether financial institutions are serving the housing credit needs of the neighborhoods and communities in which they are located. The data points include information related to the loan applicant/borrower (e.g., age, ethnicity, race and credit score), the underwriting process, loan terms and fees, lender credits and interest rate, among others. The scope of the information available to the public could increase fair lending regulatory scrutiny and third-party plaintiff litigation, as the changes will expand the ability of regulators and third parties to compare a particular lender to its\npeers in an effort to determine differences among lenders in certain demographic borrower populations. We have devoted, and will need to devote, significant resources to establishing systems and processes for complying with HMDA on an ongoing basis. If we are not successful in capturing and reporting the new HMDA data, and analyzing and correcting any adverse patterns, we could be exposed to regulatory actions and private litigation against us, we could suffer reputational damage and we could incur losses, any of which could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs a participant in the now ended HAMP program, we are subject to review by SIGTARP, which could adversely affect our business, reputation, and financial condition.\nA significant portion of Ocwen\u2019s loan modifications in recent years have been in connection with the now ended HAMP program. SIGTARP has indicated that it is assessing potential unlawful conduct by servicers in the HAMP program. In May 2017, we received a subpoena from SIGTARP requesting various documents and information relating to Ocwen\u2019s participation in the HAMP program, and we have been providing documents and information in response to that subpoena. If SIGTARP were to allege breaches of the HAMP program, such allegations could be referred to the enforcement authorities within the Department of the Treasury or the Department of Justice and if such enforcement authorities elected to take action against Ocwen, it could adversely affect our business, reputation and financial condition, regardless of the outcome of any such enforcement action.\nThere may be material changes to the laws, regulations, rules or practices applicable to reverse mortgage programs sponsored by HUD and FHA, and securitized by Ginnie Mae, which could materially and adversely affect us and the reverse mortgage industry as a whole.\nThe reverse mortgage industry is largely dependent upon rules and regulations implemented by HUD, FHA and Ginnie Mae. There can be no guarantee that HUD/FHA will retain Congressional authorization to continue the HECM program, which provides FHA government insurance for qualifying HECM loans, or that they will not make material changes to the laws, regulations, rules or practices applicable to reverse mortgage programs. For example, HUD previously implemented certain lending limits for the HECM program, and added credit-based underwriting criteria designed to assess a borrower\u2019s ability and willingness to satisfy future tax and insurance obligations. In addition, Ginnie Mae\u2019s participation in the reverse mortgage industry may be subject to economic and political changes that cannot be predicted. Any of the aforementioned circumstances could materially and adversely affect the performance of our reverse mortgage business and the value of our common stock.\nRegulators continue to be active in the reverse mortgage space, including due to the perceived susceptibility of older borrowers to be influenced by deceptive or misleading marketing activities. Regulators have also focused on appraisal practices because reverse mortgages are largely dependent on collateral valuation. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations relating to the origination of reverse mortgages, we could be subject to adverse regulatory actions, including potential fines, penalties or sanctions, and our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nViolations of predatory lending and/or servicing laws could negatively affect our business.\nVarious federal, state and local laws have been enacted that are designed to discourage predatory lending and servicing practices. The federal Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act of 1994 (HOEPA) prohibits inclusion of certain provisions in residential loans that have mortgage rates or origination costs in excess of prescribed levels and requires that borrowers be given certain additional disclosures prior to origination. Some states have enacted, or may enact, similar laws or regulations, which in some cases impose restrictions and requirements greater than are those in HOEPA. In addition, under the anti-predatory lending laws of some states, the origination of certain residential loans, including loans that are not classified as \u201chigh cost\u201d loans under HOEPA or other applicable law, must satisfy a net tangible benefits test with respect to the related borrower. A failure by us to comply with these laws, to the extent we originate, service or acquire residential loans that are non-compliant with HOEPA or other predatory lending or servicing laws, could subject us, as an originator or a servicer, or as an assignee, in the case of acquired loans, to monetary penalties and could result in the borrowers rescinding the affected loans. Lawsuits have been brought in various states making claims against originators, servicers and assignees of high cost loans for violations of state law. Named defendants in these cases have included numerous participants within the secondary mortgage market. If we are found to have violated predatory or abusive lending laws, defaults could be declared under our debt or servicing agreements, we could suffer reputational damage, and we could incur losses, any of which could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to comply with FHA underwriting guidelines could adversely impact our business.\nWe must comply with FHA underwriting guidelines in order to successfully originate FHA loans. If we fail to do so, we may not be able collect on FHA insurance. In addition, we could be subject to allegations of violations of the False Claims Act asserting that we submitted claims for FHA insurance on loans that had not been underwritten in accordance with FHA underwriting guidelines. If we are found to have violated FHA underwriting guidelines, we could face regulatory penalties and\ndamages in litigation, suffer reputational damage, and we could incur losses due to an inability to collect on such insurance, any of which could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to comply with United States and foreign laws and regulations applicable to our global operations could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nAs a business with a global workforce, we need to ensure that our activities, including those of our foreign operations, comply with applicable United States and foreign laws and regulations. Various states have implemented regulations which specifically restrict the ability to perform certain servicing and originations functions offshore and, from time to time, various state regulators have scrutinized the operations of our foreign subsidiaries. For example, as previously disclosed, in 2016, two of our foreign subsidiaries entered into a Consent Order with the Washington State Department of Financial Institutions relating to the activities of those entities in Washington State under the Washington Consumer Loan Act. Our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could, among other things, result in restrictions on our operations, loss of licenses, fines, penalties or reputational damage and have an adverse effect on our business.\nFailure to comply with the S.A.F.E. Act could adversely impact our business.\nThe Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008 (the S.A.F.E. Act) requires the individual licensing and registration of those engaged in the business of loan origination. The S.A.F.E. Act is designed to improve accountability on the part of loan originators, combat fraud and enhance consumer protections by encouraging states to establish a national licensing system and minimum qualification requirements for applicants. Thus, Ocwen must ensure proper licensing for all employees who participate in certain specified loan origination activities. Failure to comply with the S.A.F.E. Act licensing requirements could adversely impact Ocwen\u2019s origination business.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Performance, Financing Our Business, Liquidity and Net Worth and the Economy\nOur strategic plan to return to profitability may not be successful.\nWe are facing certain challenges and uncertainties that could have significant adverse effects on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. The ability of management to appropriately address these challenges and uncertainties in a timely manner is critical to our ability to operate our business successfully.\nHistorical losses have significantly eroded stockholders\u2019 equity and weakened our financial condition. We have established a set of key initiatives to achieve our objective of returning to sustainable profitability in the shortest timeframe possible within an appropriate risk and compliance environment. First, we must expand our originations activities in our lending business and acquisitions of MSRs that are prudent and well-executed with appropriate financial return targets to replenish and grow our servicing portfolio. Second, we must re-engineer our cost structure to go beyond eliminating redundant costs through the integration process and establish continuous cost improvement as a core strength. Third, we must manage our balance sheet to ensure adequate liquidity, finance our ongoing business needs and provide a solid platform for executing on our other key business initiatives. Finally, we must fulfill our regulatory commitments and resolve our remaining legal and regulatory matters on satisfactory terms.\nThere can be no assurance that we will successfully execute on these initiatives, or that even if we do execute on these initiatives we will be able to return to profitability. In addition to successful operational execution of our key initiatives, our success will also depend on market conditions and other factors outside of our control, including continued access to capital. If we continue to experience losses, our share price, business, reputation, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to obtain sufficient capital to meet the financing requirements of our business, or if we fail to comply with our debt agreements, our business, financing activities, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nOur business requires substantial amounts of capital and our financing strategy includes the use of leverage. During 2019, total leverage increased significantly relative to prior periods and we may increase our leverage further during 2020 as we execute on our business initiatives, including investing in owned MSRs to replenish portfolio runoff. Accordingly, our ability to finance our operations and repay maturing obligations rests in large part on our ability to continue to borrow money at reasonable rates. If we are unable to maintain adequate financing, or other sources of capital are not available, we could be forced to suspend, curtail or reduce our revenue generating objectives, which could harm our results of operations, liquidity, financial condition and business prospects. Our ability to borrow money is affected by a variety of factors including:\n\u2022\nlimitations imposed on us by existing debt agreements that contain restrictive covenants that may limit our ability to raise additional debt;\n\u2022\ncredit market conditions;\n\u2022\nthe strength of the lenders from whom we borrow;\n\u2022\nlenders\u2019 perceptions of us or our sector;\n\u2022\ncorporate credit and servicer ratings from rating agencies; and\n\u2022\nlimitations on borrowing under our MSR and advance facilities and mortgage loan warehouse facilities due to structural features in these facilities and the amount of eligible collateral that is pledged.\nIn addition, our advance facilities are revolving facilities, and in a typical monthly cycle, we repay a portion of the borrowings under these facilities from collections. During the remittance cycle, which starts in the middle of each month, we depend on our lenders to provide the cash necessary to make the advances that we are required to make as servicer. If one or more of these lenders were to restrict our ability to access these revolving facilities or were to fail, we may not have sufficient funds to meet our obligations. We typically require significantly more liquidity to meet our advance funding obligations than our available cash on hand.\nOur advance financing facilities are comprised of (i) revolving notes issued to large financial institutions that generally have a revolving period of less than two years, and (ii) term notes issued to institutional investors with one-, two- and three-year periods. At December 31, 2019, we had $679.1 million outstanding under these facilities. The revolving periods for variable funding notes with a total maximum borrowing capacity of $260.0 million end in 2020.\nIn the event we are unable to renew, replace or extend the revolving period of one or more of these advance financing facilities, we would no longer have access to available borrowing capacity and repayment of the outstanding balances on the revolving and term notes must begin at the end of the applicable revolving period and end of the term, respectively. In addition, we use mortgage loan warehouse facilities to fund newly originated loans on a short-term basis until they are sold to secondary market investors, including GSEs or other third-party investors. Currently, our master repurchase and participation agreements for financing new loan originations generally have 364-day terms, and similar to the revolving notes in the advance financing facilities, they are typically renewed, replaced or extended annually. At December 31, 2019, we had $332.2 million outstanding under these warehouse financing arrangements, all under agreements maturing in 2020.\nIn 2019, we entered into three separate MSR financing arrangements related to loans we service for (i) Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, (ii) Ginnie Mae, and (iii) private investors (PLS MSRs). The Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae facilities were provided through bank commitments and had total capacity of $300.0 million and $100.0 million and borrowed amounts of $147.7 million and $72.3 million, respectively at December 31, 2019. The PLS MSR financing was issued as an amortizing note structure to capital markets investors with an initial principal amount of $100.0 million. The Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae facilities terminate in June 2020 and November 2021, respectively and the PLS MSR facility matures in May 2022. MSR financing structures have become more common in recent years and investor appetite has evolved in both the bank and capital markets. As a result, MSR financing has become a lower cost funding alternative to corporate loans and bonds. Despite these positive developments, MSR financing is not as readily available as secured match funded facilities for servicing advances and whole loans via warehouse facilities. In addition, MSR financing may require a higher level of issuer scrutiny despite being principally an asset-based financing structure.\nOur MSR financing facilities provide funding based on an advance rate of MSR value that is subject to periodic mark-to-market valuation adjustments. In the normal course, MSR value is expected to decline over time due to run off of the loan balances in our servicing portfolio. As a result, we anticipate having to repay a portion of our MSR debt over a given time period. The requirements to repay MSR debt including those due to unfavorable fair value adjustment may require us to allocate a substantial amount of our available liquidity or future cash flows to meet these requirements. To the extent we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet these requirements, we may be more constrained to invest in our business and fund other obligations, and our business, financing activities, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nWe currently plan to renew, replace or extend all of the above debt agreements consistent with our historical experience. There can be no assurance that we will be able to renew, replace or extend all our debt agreements on appropriate terms or at all and, if we fail to do so, we may not have adequate sources of funding for our business.\nOur debt agreements contain various qualitative and quantitative covenants, including financial covenants, covenants to operate in material compliance with applicable laws, monitoring and reporting obligations and restrictions on our ability to engage in various activities, including but not limited to incurring additional debt, paying dividends, repurchasing or redeeming capital stock, transferring assets or making loans, investments or acquisitions. As a result of the covenants to which we are subject, we may be limited in the manner in which we conduct our business and may be limited in our ability to engage in favorable business activities or raise additional capital to finance future operations or satisfy future liquidity needs. In addition, breaches or events that may result in a default under our debt agreements include, among other things, noncompliance with our covenants, nonpayment of principal or interest, material misrepresentations, the occurrence of a material adverse effect or change, insolvency, bankruptcy, certain material judgments and changes of control. Covenants and defaults of this type are commonly found in debt agreements such as ours. Certain of these covenants and defaults are open to subjective interpretation and, if our interpretation were contested by a lender, a court may ultimately be required to determine compliance or lack thereof. In addition, our debt agreements generally include cross default provisions such that a default under one agreement\ncould trigger defaults under other agreements. If we fail to comply with our debt agreements and are unable to avoid, remedy or secure a waiver of any resulting default, we may be subject to adverse action by our lenders, including termination of further funding, acceleration of outstanding obligations, enforcement of liens against the assets securing or otherwise supporting our obligations and other legal remedies.\nAn actual or alleged default under any of our debt agreements, negative ratings action by a rating agency (including as a result of our increased leverage or erosion of net worth), the perception of financial weakness, an adverse action by a regulatory authority or GSE, a lengthening of foreclosure timelines or a general deterioration in the economy that constricts the availability of credit may increase our cost of funds and make it difficult for us to renew existing credit facilities or obtain new lines of credit. Any or all the above could have an adverse effect on our business, financing activities, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to obtain sufficient servicer advance financing necessary to meet the financing requirements of our business, which could adversely affect our liquidity position and result in a loss of servicing rights.\nWe currently fund a substantial portion of our servicing advance obligations through our servicing advance facilities. Under normal market conditions, mortgage servicers typically have been able to renew or refinance these facilities. However, market conditions or lenders\u2019 perceptions of us at the time of any renewal or refinancing may mean that we are unable to renew or refinance our advance financing facilities or obtain additional facilities on favorable terms or at all.\nIf we fail to satisfy minimum net worth and liquidity requirements established by regulators, GSEs, Ginnie Mae, lenders, or other counterparties, our business, financing activities, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nAs a result of our servicing and loan origination activities, we are subject to minimum net worth and liquidity requirements established by state regulators, GSEs, Ginnie Mae, lenders, and other counterparties. We have been incurring losses for the last five years, which has eroded our net worth. In addition, we must structure our business so each subsidiary satisfies the net worth and liquidity requirements applicable to it, which can be challenging.\nThe minimum net worth and liquidity requirements to which our licensed entities are subject vary by state and type of license. We must also satisfy the minimum net worth and liquidity requirements of the GSEs and Ginnie Mae in order to maintain our approved status with such agencies and the minimum net worth and liquidity requirements set forth in our agreements with our lenders.\nMinimum net worth requirements and liquidity are generally calculated using specific adjustments that may require interpretation or judgment. Changes to these adjustments have the potential to significantly affect net worth and liquidity calculations and imperil our ability to satisfy future minimum net worth and liquidity requirements. We believe our licensed entities were in compliance with all of their minimum net worth requirements at December 31, 2019. However, it is possible that regulators could disagree with our calculations, and one state regulator has disagreed with our calculation for a prior year period; we have discussed the matter with the regulator, including why we believe we are in compliance with the applicable net worth requirements. If we fail to satisfy minimum net worth requirements, absent a waiver or other accommodation, we could lose our licenses or have other regulatory action taken against us, we could lose our ability to sell and service loans to or on behalf of the GSEs or Ginnie Mae, or it could trigger a default under our debt agreements. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business, financing activities, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe use estimates in measuring or determining the fair value of the majority of our assets and liabilities. If our estimates prove to be incorrect, we may be required to write down the value of these assets or write up the value of these liabilities, which could adversely affect our earnings.\nOur ability to measure and report our financial position and operating results is influenced by the need to estimate the impact or outcome of future events based on information available at the time of the financial statements. An accounting estimate is considered critical if it requires that management make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made. If actual results differ from our judgments and assumptions, then it may have an adverse impact on the results of operations and cash flows.\nFair value is estimated based on a hierarchy that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs. Observable inputs are inputs that reflect the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the reporting entity\u2019s own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. The fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques into three broad levels whereby the highest priority is given to Level 1 inputs and the lowest to Level 3 inputs.\nAt December 31, 2019, 77% and 70% of our consolidated total assets and liabilities are measured at fair value, respectively, on a recurring and nonrecurring basis, 97% and 100% of which are considered Level 3 valuations, including our MSR portfolio. Our largest Level 3 asset and liability carried at fair value on a recurring basis is Loans held for investment - reverse mortgages and the related secured financing. We pool home equity conversion mortgages (reverse mortgages) into Ginnie Mae Home Equity Conversion Mortgage-Backed Securities (HMBS). Because the securitization of reverse mortgage loans do not qualify for sale accounting, we account for these transfers as secured financings and classify the transferred reverse mortgages as Loans held for investment - reverse mortgages and recognize the related Financing liabilities. Holders of HMBS have no recourse against our assets, except for standard representations and warranties and our contractual obligations to service the reverse mortgages and HMBS.\nWe estimate the fair value of our assets and liabilities utilizing assumptions that we believe are appropriate and are used by market participants. We generally engage third party valuation experts to support our fair value determination for Level 3 assets and liabilities. The methodology used to estimate these values is complex and uses asset- and liability-specific data and market inputs for assumptions including interest and discount rates, collateral status and expected future performance. If these assumptions prove to be inaccurate, if market conditions change or if errors are found in our models, the value of certain of our assets may decrease, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, including through negative impacts on our ability to satisfy minimum net worth and liquidity covenants.\nValuations are highly dependent upon the reasonableness of our assumptions and the predictability of the relationships that drive the results of our valuation methodologies. If changes to interest rates or other factors cause prepayment speeds to increase more than estimated, delinquency and default levels are higher than anticipated or financial market illiquidity is greater than anticipated, we may be required to adjust the value of certain assets or liabilities, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are exposed to liquidity, interest rate and foreign currency exchange risks.\nWe are exposed to liquidity risk primarily because of the highly variable daily cash requirements to support our servicing business, including the requirement to make advances pursuant to our servicing agreements and the process of collecting and applying recoveries of advances. We are also exposed to liquidity risk due to potential accelerated repayment of our debt depending on the performance of the underlying collateral, including the fair value of MSRs, and certain covenants, among other factors. We are also exposed to liquidity and interest rate risk by our decision to originate and finance mortgage loans and sell mortgage loans into the secondary market. Further, as discussed below, the economic hedges that we have entered into in order to limit MSR fair value change exposure may include instruments that require margin, thereby leading to liquidity distributions should the hedge instrument lose value. In general, we finance our operations through operating cash flows and various other sources of funding, including match funded borrowing agreements, secured lines of credit and repurchase agreements.\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk to the degree that our interest-bearing liabilities mature or reprice at different speeds, or on different bases, than our interest earning assets or when financed assets are not interest-bearing. Our servicing business is characterized by non-interest earning assets financed by interest-bearing liabilities. Servicing advances are among our more significant non-interest earning assets. At December 31, 2019, we had total advances and match funded advances of $1.1 billion. We are also exposed to interest rate risk because a portion of our advance financing and other outstanding debt at December 31, 2019 is variable rate. Rising interest rates may increase our interest expense. Earnings on float balances partially offset these higher funding costs. At December 31, 2019, we had no interest rate swaps in place to hedge our exposure to rising interest rates.\nOur MSRs, which we carry at fair value, are subject to substantial interest rate risk, primarily because the mortgage loans underlying the servicing rights permit the borrowers to prepay the loans. A decrease in interest rates generally increases prepayment speeds and vice versa. As a result, the valuation assumptions for MSRs are highly correlated to changes across the yield curve. An interest rate decrease could result in an array of fair value changes, the severity of which would depend on several factors, including the magnitude of the change, whether the decrease is across specific rate tenors or a parallel change across the entire yield curve, and impact from market-side adjustments, among others. Beginning in September 2019, we implemented a hedging strategy using economic hedges (derivatives that do not qualify as hedges for accounting purposes) to partially offset the changes in fair value of our MSRs due to interest rate changes. However, as discussed below, there can be no assurance that our hedging strategy will be effective in partially mitigating our exposure to changes in fair value of our MSRs due to interest rate changes.\nIn our lending business, we are subject to interest rate and price risk on our pipeline (i.e., interest rate loan commitments (IRLCs) and mortgage loans held for sale) from the commitment date up until the date the commitment expires or the loan is sold into the secondary market. Generally, the fair value of the pipeline will decline in value when interest rates increase and will rise in value when interest rates decrease. Our interest rate exposure on our pipeline had previously been economically hedged with freestanding derivatives such as forward contracts. Beginning in September 2019, this exposure is no longer\nindividually hedged, but rather used as an offset to our MSR fair value exposure and managed as part of our MSR hedging strategy described above.\nWe are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk in connection with our investment in non-U.S. dollar currency operations to the extent that our foreign exchange positions remain unhedged. Our operations in the Philippines and India expose us to foreign currency exchange rate risk.\nWhile we have established policies and procedures intended to identify, monitor and manage the risks described above, we cannot assure you that our risk management policies and procedures will be effective. Further, such policies and procedures are not designed to mitigate or eliminate all of the risks we face. As a result, these risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur hedging strategy may not be successful in partially mitigating our exposure to interest rate risk.\nOur hedging strategy may not be as effective as desired due to the actual performance of an MSR differing from the expected performance. While we actively track the actual performance of our MSRs across rate change environments, there is potential for our economic hedges to underperform. The underperformance may be a result of various factors, including the following: available hedge instruments have a different profile than the underlying asset, the duration of the hedge is different from the MSR, the convexity of the hedge is not proportional to the valuation change of the MSR asset, the counterparty with which we have traded has failed to deliver under the terms of the contract, or we fail to renew the hedge position in a timely or efficient manner.\nUnexpected changes in market rates or secondary liquidity may have a materially adverse impact on the cash flow or operating performance of the Company. The expected hedge coverage profiled may not correlate to the asset as desired, resulting in poorer performance than had we not hedged at all. In addition, hedging strategies involve transaction and other costs. We cannot be assured that our hedging strategy and the derivatives that we use will adequately offset the risks of interest rate volatility or that our hedging transactions will not result in or magnify losses.\nGSE and Ginnie Mae initiatives and other actions may affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nDue to the significant role that the GSEs play in the secondary mortgage market, new initiatives and other actions that they may implement could become prevalent in the mortgage servicing industry generally. To the extent that FHFA and/or the GSEs implement reforms that materially affect the market not only for conventional and/or government-insured loans but also the non-qualifying loan markets, such reforms could have a material adverse effect on the creation of new MSRs, the economics or performance of any MSRs that we acquire, servicing fees that we can charge and costs that we incur to comply with new servicing requirements.\nIn addition, our ability to generate revenues through mortgage loan sales to institutional investors depends to a significant degree on programs administered by the GSEs, Ginnie Mae, and others that facilitate the issuance of MBS in the secondary market. These entities play a critical role in the residential mortgage industry and we have significant business relationships with many of them. If it is not possible for us to complete the sale or securitization of certain of our mortgage loans due to changes in GSE and Ginnie Mae programs, we may lack liquidity to continue to fund mortgage loans and our revenues and margins on new loan originations would be materially and negatively impacted.\nOur plans to acquire MSRs will require approvals and cooperation by the GSEs and Ginnie Mae. Should approval or cooperation be withheld, we would have difficulty meeting our MSR acquisition objectives.\nThere are various proposals that deal with the future of the GSEs, including with respect to their ownership and role in the mortgage market, as well as proposals to implement GSE reforms relating to borrowers, lenders and investors in the mortgage market. Thus, the long-term future of the GSEs remains uncertain. Any change in the ownership of the GSEs, or in their programs or role within the mortgage market, could materially and adversely affect our business, liquidity, financial position and results of operations.\nAn economic slowdown or a deterioration of the housing market could increase both interest expense on servicing advances and operating expenses and could cause a reduction in income from, and the value of, our servicing portfolio.\nDuring any period in which a borrower is not making payments, we are required under most of our servicing agreements to advance our own funds to meet contractual principal and interest remittance requirements for investors, pay property taxes and insurance premiums and process foreclosures. We also advance funds to maintain, repair and market real estate properties on behalf of investors. Most of our advances have the highest standing and are \u201ctop of the waterfall\u201d so that we are entitled to repayment from respective loan or REO liquidations proceeds before most other claims on these proceeds, and in the majority of cases, advances in excess of respective loan or REO liquidation proceeds may be recovered from pool level proceeds. Consequently, the primary impacts of an increase in advances are generally increased interest expense as we finance a large portion of servicing advance obligations and a decline in the fair value of MSRs as the projected funding cost of existing and future expected servicing advances is a component of the fair value of MSRs. Our liquidity is also negatively impacted because\nwe must fund the portion of our advance obligations that is not financed. Our liquidity would be more severely impacted if we were unable to continue to finance a large portion of servicing advance obligations.\nHigher delinquencies also decrease the fair value of MSRs and increase our cost to service loans, as loans in default require more intensive effort to bring them current or manage the foreclosure process. An increase in delinquencies may delay the timing of revenue recognition because we recognize servicing fees as earned, which is generally upon collection of payments from borrowers or proceeds from REO liquidations. An increase in delinquencies also generally leads to lower balances in custodial and escrow accounts (float balances) and lower net earnings on custodial and escrow accounts (float earnings). Additionally, an increase in delinquencies in our GSE servicing portfolio will result in lower revenue because we collect servicing fees from GSEs only on performing loans.\nForeclosures are involuntary prepayments resulting in a reduction in UPB. This may also result in declines in the value of our MSRs.\nAdverse economic conditions could also negatively impact our lending businesses. For example, declining home prices and increasing loan-to-value ratios may preclude many borrowers from refinancing their existing loans or obtaining new loans.\nAny of the foregoing could adversely affect our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nA significant increase in prepayment speeds could adversely affect our financial results.\nPrepayment speed is a significant driver of our business. Prepayment speed is the measurement of how quickly borrowers pay down the UPB of their loans or how quickly loans are otherwise brought current, modified, liquidated or charged off. Prepayment speeds have a significant impact on our servicing fee revenues, our expenses and on the valuation of our MSRs as follows:\n\u2022\nRevenue. If prepayment speeds increase, our servicing fees will decline more rapidly than anticipated because of the greater decrease in the UPB on which those fees are based. The reduction in servicing fees would be somewhat offset by increased float earnings because the faster repayment of loans will result in higher float balances that generate the float earnings. Conversely, decreases in prepayment speeds result in increased servicing fees but lead to lower float balances and float earnings.\n\u2022\nExpenses. Faster prepayment speeds result in higher compensating interest expense, which represents the difference between the full month of interest we are required to remit in the month a loan pays off and the amount of interest we collect from the borrower for that month. Slower prepayment speeds also lead to lower compensating interest expense.\n\u2022\nValuation of MSRs. The fair value of MSRs is based on, among other things, projection of the cash flows from the related pool of mortgage loans. The expectation of prepayment speeds is a significant assumption underlying those cash flow projections from the perspective of market participants. Increases or decreases in interest rates have an impact on prepayment rates. If prepayment speeds were significantly greater than expected, the fair value of our MSRs, which we carry at fair value, could decrease. When the fair value of these MSRs decreases, we record a loss on fair value, which also has a negative impact on our financial results.\nOperational Risks and Other Risks Related to Our Business\nIf we do not comply with our obligations under our servicing agreements or if others allege non-compliance, our business and results of operations may be harmed.\nWe have contractual obligations under the servicing agreements pursuant to which we service mortgage loans. Our non-Agency servicing agreements generally contain detailed provisions regarding servicing practices, reporting and other matters. In addition, Liberty and PMC are parties to seller/servicer agreements and/or subject to guidelines and regulations (collectively, seller/servicer obligations) with one or more of the GSEs, HUD, FHA, VA and Ginnie Mae. These seller/servicer obligations include financial covenants that include capital requirements related to tangible net worth, as defined by the applicable agency, an obligation to provide audited consolidated financial statements within 90 days of the applicable entity\u2019s fiscal year end as well as extensive requirements regarding servicing, selling and other matters. To the extent that these requirements are not met or waived, the applicable agency may, at its option, utilize a variety of remedies including requirements to provide certain information or take actions at the direction of the applicable agency, requirements to deposit funds as security for our obligations, sanctions, suspension or even termination of approved seller/servicer status, which would prohibit future originations or securitizations of forward or reverse mortgage loans or servicing for the applicable agency.\nMany of our servicing agreements require adherence to general servicing standards, and certain contractual provisions delegate judgment over various servicing matters to us. Our servicing practices, and the judgments that we make in our servicing of loans, could be questioned by parties to these agreements, such as GSEs, Ginnie Mae, trustees or master servicers, or by investors in the trusts which own the mortgage loans or other third parties. As a result, we could be required to repurchase mortgage loans, make whole or otherwise indemnify such mortgage loan investors or other parties. Advances that we have made could be unrecoverable. We could also be terminated as servicer or become subject to litigation or other claims seeking\ndamages or other remedies arising from alleged breaches of our servicing agreements. For example, we are currently involved in a dispute with a former subservicing client relating to alleged violations of our contractual agreements, including that we did not properly submit mortgage insurance and other claims for reimbursement. We are presently engaged in a dispute resolution process relating to these claims. We are unable to predict the outcome of this dispute or the size of any loss we might incur. In addition, several trustees are currently defending themselves against claims by RMBS investors that the trustees failed to properly oversee mortgage servicers - including Ocwen - in the servicing of hundreds of trusts. Trustees subject to those suits have informed Ocwen that they may seek indemnification for losses they suffer as a result of the filings.\nAny of the foregoing could have a significant negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Even if allegations against us lack merit, we may have to spend additional resources and devote additional management time to contesting such allegations, which would reduce the resources available to address, and the time management is able to devote to, other matters.\nGSEs or Ginnie Mae may curtail or terminate our ability to sell, service or securitize newly originated loans to them.\nAs noted in the prior risk factor, if we do not comply with our seller/servicer obligations, the GSEs or Ginnie Mae may utilize a variety of remedies against us. Such remedies include curtailment of our ability to sell newly originated loans or even termination of our ability to sell, service or securitize such loans altogether. Any such curtailment or termination would likely have a material adverse impact on our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nA significant reduction in, or the total loss of, our remaining NRZ-related servicing would significantly impact our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nNRZ is our largest servicing client, accounting for 56% of the UPB in our servicing portfolio as of December 31, 2019. On February 20, 2020, we received a notice of termination from NRZ with respect to the legacy PMC subservicing agreement, which accounted for approximately 20% of the UPB of our servicing portfolio as of December 31, 2019. It is possible that NRZ could exercise its rights to terminate for convenience some or all of the legacy Ocwen servicing agreements. As of December 31, 2019, these agreements accounted for approximately 36.0% of our servicing portfolio.\nIn addition, under the legacy Ocwen agreements, any failure under a financial covenant could result in NRZ terminating Ocwen as subservicer under the subservicing agreements or in directing the transfer of servicing away from Ocwen under the Rights to MSRs agreements. Similarly, failure by Ocwen to meet operational requirements, including service levels, critical reporting and other obligations, could also result in termination or transfer for cause. In addition, if there is a change of control to which NRZ did not consent, NRZ could terminate for cause and direct the transfer of servicing away from Ocwen. A termination for cause and transfer of servicing could materially and adversely affect Ocwen\u2019s business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurther, under our Rights to MSRs agreements, in certain circumstances, NRZ has the right to sell its Rights to MSRs to a third-party and require us to transfer title to the related MSRs, subject to an Ocwen option to acquire at a price based on the winning third-party bid rather than selling to the third party. If NRZ sells its Rights to MSRs to a third party, the transaction can only be completed if the third-party buyer can obtain the necessary third-party consents to transfer the MSRs. NRZ also has the obligation to use reasonable efforts to encourage such third-party buyer to enter into a subservicing agreement with Ocwen. Ocwen may lose future compensation for subservicing, however, if no subservicing agreement is ultimately entered into with the third-party buyer.\nBecause of the large percentage of our servicing business that is represented by the legacy Ocwen agreements with NRZ that provide NRZ with the termination or transfer rights described above, our business, financial condition, results of operations would be significantly impacted if NRZ exercised all or a significant portion of these rights. If this were to occur, we anticipate that we would need to substantially restructure many aspects of our servicing business as well as the related corporate support functions to address our smaller servicing portfolio, which would likely be a complex and expensive undertaking. Such a restructuring of our operations could divert management attention and financial resources required to execute on other strategic objectives, which could delay or prevent our growth or otherwise negatively impact the execution of our plans to return to profitability. In addition, it is possible that the unwinding of all or a significant portion of our relationship may not occur in an orderly or timely manner, which could be disruptive and could result in us incurring additional costs or even in disagreements with NRZ relating to our respective rights and obligations.\nMore generally, if NRZ were to decline to continue doing business with us and we were unable to develop relationships with new servicing clients on a similar scale or otherwise acquire sufficient replacement servicing, our business, liquidity, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, if NRZ were to take actions to limit or terminate our relationship, that could impact perceptions of other servicing clients, lenders, GSEs, regulators or others, which could cause them to take actions that materially and adversely impact our business, liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe believe our remaining NRZ servicing will become increasingly unprofitable over time. If we are not successful in our actions to improve the profitability of our remaining NRZ servicing or to acquire additional profitable client relationships to offset the expected impact on our profitability, our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nDuring 2019, we completed an assessment of the cost-to-service and the profitability of the NRZ servicing portfolio. Based on this analysis, in the fourth quarter of 2019, we estimate that operating expenses, including direct servicing expenses and overhead allocation, exceeded the net revenue retained for the legacy Ocwen servicing agreements by approximately $7.0 million. This estimate excludes the benefits of the lump-sum payment amortization. The estimated loss for these subservicing agreements is partially driven by the declining revenue as the loan portfolio amortizes down without a corresponding reduction to our servicing cost over time. As performing loans in the legacy Ocwen servicing portfolio have run-off, delinquencies have remained high, resulting in a relatively elevated average cost per loan. Because the NRZ portfolio contains a high percentage of delinquent accounts, it has an inherently high level of potential operational and compliance risk and requires a disproportionately high level of operating staff, oversight support infrastructure and overhead which drives the elevated average cost per loan. While we are actively pursuing cost re-engineering initiatives to reduce our cost-to-service and our corporate overhead, we may be unsuccessful in reducing these costs to the level where the legacy Ocwen servicing is profitable during 2020 or beyond. We are also seeking to acquire, maintain and grow profitable client relationships that would offset any negative impact from legacy Ocwen servicing; however, we may not be successful in these efforts. While we have the ability to not to renew the legacy Ocwen agreements in certain circumstances, in such situations, we would not be entitled to termination fees that would help offset the restructuring and transition costs required to adjust our operations to a significantly smaller servicing portfolio. Consequently, absent a termination for convenience by NRZ, our most economically feasible alternative with respect to these agreements may be to continue to service an increasingly unprofitable portfolio, which could materially and adversely impact our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf NRZ were to fail to comply with its servicing advance obligations under its agreements with us, it could materially and adversely affect us.\nUnder the Rights to MSRs agreements, NRZ is responsible for financing all servicing advance obligations in connection with the loans underlying the MSRs. At December 31, 2019, such servicing advances made by NRZ were approximately $704.2 million. However, under the Rights to MSRs structure, we are contractually required under our servicing agreements with the RMBS trusts to make the relevant servicing advances even if NRZ does not perform its contractual obligations to fund those advances. Therefore, if NRZ were unable to meet its advance financing obligations, we would remain obligated to meet any future advance financing obligations with respect to the loans underlying these Rights to MSRs, which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity, financial condition and servicing operations.\nNRZ currently uses advance financing facilities to fund a substantial portion of the servicing advances that NRZ is contractually obligated to make pursuant to the Rights to MSRs agreements. Although we are not an obligor or guarantor under NRZ\u2019s advance financing facilities, we are a party to certain of the facility documents as the entity performing the work of servicing the underlying loans on which advances are being financed. As such, we make certain representations, warranties and covenants, including representations and warranties in connection with our sale of advances to NRZ. If we were to make representations or warranties that were untrue or if we were otherwise to fail to comply with our contractual obligations, we could become subject to claims for damages or events of default under such facilities could be asserted.\nTechnology or process failures or employee misconduct could damage our business operations or reputation, harm our relationships with key stakeholders and lead to regulatory sanctions or penalties.\nWe are responsible for developing and maintaining sophisticated operational systems and infrastructure, which is challenging. As a result, operational risk is inherent in virtually all of our activities. In addition, the CFPB and other regulators have emphasized their focus on the importance of servicers\u2019 and lenders\u2019 systems and infrastructure operating effectively. If our systems and infrastructure fail to operate effectively, such failures could damage our business and reputation, harm our relationships with key stakeholders and lead to regulatory sanctions or penalties.\nOur business is substantially dependent on our ability to process and monitor a large number of transactions, many of which are complex, across various parts of our business. These transactions often must adhere to the terms of a complex set of legal and regulatory standards, as well as the terms of our servicing and other agreements. In addition, given the volume of transactions that we process and monitor, certain errors may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and rectified. For example, in the area of borrower correspondence, in 2014, problems were identified with our letter dating processes such that erroneously dated letters were sent to borrowers, which damaged our reputation and relationships with borrowers, regulators, important counterparties and other stakeholders. Because in an average month we mail over 2 million letters, a process problem such as erroneous letter dating has the potential to negatively affect many parts of our business and have widespread negative implications.\nWe are similarly dependent on our employees. We could be materially adversely affected if an employee or employees, acting alone or in concert with non-affiliated third parties, causes a significant operational break-down or failure, either because of human error or where an individual purposefully sabotages or fraudulently manipulates our operations or systems, including by means of cyberattack or denial-of-service attack. In addition to direct losses from such actions, we could be subject to regulatory sanctions or suffer harm to our reputation, financial condition, customer relationships, and ability to attract future customers or employees. Employee misconduct could prompt regulators to allege or to determine based upon such misconduct that we have not established adequate supervisory systems and procedures to inform employees of applicable rules or to detect and deter violations of such rules. It is not always possible to deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent misconduct may not be effective in all cases. Misconduct by our employees, or even unsubstantiated allegations of misconduct, could result in a material adverse effect on our reputation and our business.\nThird parties with which we do business could also be sources of operational risk to us, including risks relating to break-downs or failures of such parties\u2019 own systems or employees. Any of these occurrences could diminish our ability to operate one or more of our businesses or lead to potential liability to clients, reputational damage or regulatory intervention. We could also be required to take legal action against or replace third-party vendors, which could be costly, involve a diversion of management time and energy and lead to operational disruptions. Any of these occurrences could materially adversely affect us.\nWe are dependent on Black Knight, Altisource and other vendors for much of our technology, business process outsourcing and other services.\nOur vendor relationships subject us to a variety of risks. We have significant exposure to third-party risks, as we are dependent on vendors, including, Black Knight and Altisource, for a number of key services.\nWe use the Black Knight MSP servicing system pursuant to a seven-year agreement with Black Knight, and we are highly dependent on the successful functioning of it to operate our loan servicing business effectively and in compliance with our regulatory and contractual obligations. It would be difficult, costly and complex to transfer all of our loans to another servicing system in the event Black Knight failed to perform under its agreements with us and any such transfer would take considerable time. Any such transfer would also likely be subject us to considerable scrutiny from regulators, GSEs, Ginnie Mae and other counterparties.\nOcwen has entered into various long-term agreements with Altisource, including a Services Agreement under which Altisource provides various services, such as property valuation services, property preservation and inspection services and title services, among other things. Previously, Ocwen\u2019s servicing system ran on an information technology system that we licensed under agreements with Altisource.\nIn February 2019, Ocwen and Altisource signed a Binding Term Sheet, which among other things, confirmed Altisource\u2019s cooperation with the de-boarding of loans from Altisource\u2019s REALServicing servicing system to Black Knight\u2019s MSP servicing system. In addition, Ocwen and Altisource entered into a letter agreement confirming that, except in relation to Ocwen\u2019s transfer off of the REALServicing technology beginning in February 2019 or termination of the REALServicing statement of work, each party reserves its rights and remedies in the event of any disputes between them. While the Binding Term Sheet does not restrict Ocwen\u2019s rights to sell MSRs in any way, the letter agreement specifically includes a reservation of each party\u2019s rights to assert damage claims against the other party regarding such transactions including any transfer by Ocwen to NRZ (or its affiliates) or any third party of the rights to designate a vendor. Ocwen does not believe its agreements with Altisource restrict Ocwen\u2019s rights to sell MSRs or restrict Ocwen from allowing an owner of MSRs, or owner of the economics thereto, the right to designate vendors. As such, Ocwen believes any asserted claims by Altisource against Ocwen arising from Ocwen\u2019s sale of MSRs or related to the rights to designate a vendor to a third party, would be without merit and we have so informed Altisource. However, if Altisource were to assert such claims against us, such disputes could cause us to incur costs, divert the attention of management, and potentially disrupt our operations which rely on Altisource-provided services, regardless of whether such claims were ultimately resolved in our favor.\nIf either Black Knight or Altisource were to fail to properly fulfill its contractual obligations to us, including through a failure to provide services at the required level to maintain and support our systems, our business and operations would suffer. In addition, if Black Knight fails to develop and maintain its technology so as to provide us with an effective and competitive servicing system, our business could suffer. Similarly, we are reliant on other vendors for the proper maintenance and support of our technological systems and our business and operations would suffer if these vendors do not perform as required. If our vendors do not adequately maintain and support our systems, including our servicing systems, loan originations and financial reporting systems, our business and operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nAltisource and other vendors supply us with other services in connection with our business activities such as property preservation and inspection services and valuation services. In the event that a vendor\u2019s activities do not comply with the applicable servicing criteria, we could be exposed to liability as the servicer and it could negatively impact our relationships with our servicing clients, borrowers or regulators, among others. In addition, if our current vendors were to stop providing services to us on acceptable terms, we may be unable to procure alternatives from other vendors in a timely and efficient\nmanner and on acceptable terms, or at all. Further, we may incur significant costs to resolve any such disruptions in service and this could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition to our reliance on the vendors discussed above, our business is reliant on a number of technological vendors that provide services such as integrated cloud applications and financial institutions that provide essential banking services on a daily basis. Even short-terms interruptions in the services provided by these vendors and financial institutions could be disruptive to our business and cause us financial loss. Significant or prolonged disruptions in the ability of these companies to provide services to us could have a material adverse impact on our operations.\nWe have undergone and continue to undergo significant change to our technology infrastructure and business processes. Failure to adequately update our systems and processes could harm our ability to run our business and adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe are currently making, and will continue to make, technology investments and process improvements to improve or replace the information processes and systems that are key to managing our business, to improve our compliance management system, and to reduce costs. Additionally, as part of the transition to Black Knight MSP and the integration of our information processes and systems with PHH, we have undergone and continue to undergo significant changes to our technology infrastructure and business processes. Failure to select the appropriate technology investments, or to implement them correctly and efficiently, could have a significant negative impact on our operations.\nDisagreements with vendors, service providers or other contractual counterparties could materially and adversely affect our business, financing activities, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are dependent on Black Knight, Altisource and other vendors and service providers to operate our business effectively and in compliance with applicable regulatory and contractual obligations and on banks, NRZ and other financing sources to finance our business. Certain provisions of the agreements underlying our relationships with our vendors, service providers, financing sources and other contractual counterparties could be open to subjective interpretation. Disagreements with these counterparties, including disagreements over contract interpretation, could lead to business disruptions or could result in litigation or arbitration or mediation proceedings, any of which could be expensive and divert senior management\u2019s attention from other matters. While we have been able to resolve disagreements with these counterparties in the past, if we were unable to resolve a disagreement, a court, arbitrator or mediator might be required to resolve the matter and there can be no assurance that the outcome of a material disagreement with a contractual counterparty would not materially and adversely affect our business, financing activities, financial condition or results of operations.\nCybersecurity breaches or system failures may interrupt or delay our ability to provide services to our customers, expose our business and our customers to harm and otherwise adversely affect our operations.\nDisruptions and failures of our systems or those of our vendors may interrupt or delay our ability to provide services to our customers, expose us to remedial costs and reputational damage, and otherwise adversely affect our operations. The secure transmission of confidential information over the Internet and other electronic distribution and communication systems is essential to our maintaining consumer confidence in certain of our services. We have programs in place to detect and respond to security incidents. However, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures. While none of the cybersecurity incidents that we have experienced to date have had a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or operations, we cannot assure that future incidents will not so impact us.\nSecurity breaches, computer viruses, cyberattacks, hacking and other acts of vandalism are increasing in frequency and sophistication, and could result in a compromise or breach of the technology that we use to protect our borrowers\u2019 personal information and transaction data and other information that we must keep secure. Our financial, accounting, data processing or other operating systems and facilities (or those of our vendors) may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, such as a cyberattack, a spike in transaction volume or unforeseen catastrophic events, potentially resulting in data loss and adversely affecting our ability to process transactions or otherwise operate our business. If one or more of these events occurs, this could potentially jeopardize data integrity or confidentiality of information processed and stored in, or transmitted through, our computer systems and networks. Any failure, interruption or breach in our cyber security could result in reputational harm, disruption of our customer relationships, or an inability to originate and service loans and otherwise operate our business. Further, any of these cyber security and operational risks could expose us to lawsuits by customers for identity theft or other damages resulting from the misuse of their personal information and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nRegulators may impose penalties or require remedial action if they identify weaknesses in our systems, and we may be required to incur significant costs to address any identified deficiencies or to remediate any harm caused. A number of states\nhave specific reporting and other requirements with respect to cybersecurity in addition to applicable federal laws. For instance, the NY DFS Cybersecurity Regulation requires New York insurance companies, banks, and other regulated financial services institutions - including certain Ocwen entities licensed in the state of New York - to assess their cybersecurity risk profile. Regulated entities are required, among other things, to adopt the core requirements of a cybersecurity program, including a cybersecurity policy, effective access privileges, cybersecurity risk assessments, training and monitoring for all authorized users, and appropriate governance processes. This regulation also requires regulated entities to submit notices to the NY DFS of any security breaches or other cybersecurity events, and to certify their compliance with the regulation on an annual basis. In addition, consumers generally are concerned with security breaches and privacy on the Internet, and Congress or individual states could enact new laws regulating the use of technology in our business that could adversely affect us or result in significant compliance costs.\nAs part of our business, we may share confidential customer information and proprietary information with customers, vendors, service providers, and business partners. The information systems of these third parties may be vulnerable to security breaches as these third parties may not have appropriate security controls in place to protect the information we share with them. If our confidential information is intercepted, stolen, misused, or mishandled while in possession of a third party, it could result in reputational harm to us, loss of customer business, and additional regulatory scrutiny, and it could expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nDamage to our reputation could adversely impact our financial results and ongoing operations.\nOur ability to serve and retain customers and conduct business transactions with our counterparties could be adversely affected to the extent our reputation is damaged. Our failure to address, or to appear to fail to address, the various regulatory, operational and other challenges facing Ocwen could give rise to reputational risk that could cause harm to us and our business prospects. Reputational issues may arise from the following, among other factors:\n\u2022\nnegative news about Ocwen or the mortgage industry generally;\n\u2022\nallegations of non-compliance with legal and regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nethical issues, including alleged deceptive or unfair servicing or lending practices;\n\u2022\nour practices relating to collections, foreclosures, property preservation, modifications, interest rate adjustments, loans impacted by natural disasters, escrow and insurance;\n\u2022\nconsumer privacy concerns;\n\u2022\nconsumer financial fraud;\n\u2022\ndata security issues related to our customers or employees;\n\u2022\ncybersecurity issues and cyber incidents, whether actual, threatened, or perceived;\n\u2022\ncustomer service or consumer complaints;\n\u2022\nlegal, reputational, credit, liquidity and market risks inherent in our businesses;\n\u2022\na downgrade of or negative watch warning on any of our servicer or credit ratings; and\n\u2022\nalleged or perceived conflicts of interest.\nThe proliferation of social media websites as well as the personal use of social media by our employees and others, including personal blogs and social network profiles, also may increase the risk that negative, inappropriate or unauthorized information may be posted or released publicly that could harm our reputation or have other negative consequences, including as a result of our employees interacting with our customers in an unauthorized manner in various social media outlets. The failure to address, or the perception that we have failed to address, any of these issues appropriately could give rise to increased regulatory action, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe industry in which we operate is highly competitive, and, to the extent we fail to meet these competitive challenges, it would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry that could become even more competitive as a result of economic, legislative, regulatory or technological changes. Competition to service mortgage loans and for mortgage loan originations comes primarily from commercial banks and savings institutions and non-bank lenders and mortgage servicers. Many of our competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources, and lower funding costs. Further, our competitors that are national banks may also benefit from a federal exemption from certain state regulatory requirements that is applicable to depository institutions. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of revenue generating options (e.g., originating types of loans that we choose not to originate) and establish more favorable relationships than we can. With the proliferation of smartphones and technological changes enabling improved payment systems and cheaper data storage, newer market participants, often called \u201cdisruptors,\u201d are reinventing aspects of the financial industry and capturing profit pools previously enjoyed by existing market participants. As a result, the lending industry could become even more competitive if new market participants are successful in capturing market share from existing market participants such as ourselves. Competition to service mortgage loans may result in lower margins. Because of the relatively limited number of servicing\nclients, our failure to meet the expectations of any significant client could materially impact our business. Ocwen has suffered reputational damage as a result of our regulatory settlements and the associated scrutiny of our business. We believe this may have weakened our competitive position against both our bank and non-bank mortgage servicing competitors. These competitive pressures could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are highly dependent on an experienced senior management team, including our President and Chief Executive Officer, and the loss of the services of one or more of our senior officers could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, high turnover of management and non-management employees could harm our business.\nWe are highly dependent on an experienced management team. We do not maintain key man life insurance relating to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Glen A. Messina, or any of our other executive officers. The loss of the services of Mr. Messina or any of our other senior officers could have a material adverse effect on us. We could also be harmed by legal actions brought by former senior officers after they have ceased employment with Ocwen.\nWe have experienced elevated turnover among both management and non-management employees in recent years due, in large part, to the acquisition of PHH, our subsequent integration of the combined company\u2019s business units, and our continued cost re-engineering plans, which may include further reductions in staffing levels and in the proportion of our workforce based in the U.S. While planned departures form part of our plan to capture acquisition synergies, there is a risk that employee departures, even if planned, could lead to operational disruptions, loss of important institutional knowledge or other adverse impacts on our business.\nAn inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur future success depends, in part, on our ability to identify, attract and retain highly skilled servicing, lending, finance, risk, compliance and technical personnel. We face intense competition for qualified individuals from numerous financial services and other companies, some of which have greater resources, better recent financial performance, fewer regulatory challenges and better reputations than we do. If we were to be unable to attract and retain the qualified personnel we need to succeed, our business, financial condition and results of operations could suffer.\nWe have operations in India and the Philippines that could be adversely affected by changes in the political or economic stability of these countries or by government policies in India, the Philippines or the U.S.\nApproximately 3,400, or 64%, of our employees as of December 31, 2019 are located in India. A significant change in India\u2019s economic liberalization and deregulation policies could adversely affect business and economic conditions in India generally and our business in particular. The political or regulatory climate in the U.S. or elsewhere also could change so that it would not be lawful or practical for us to use international operations in the manner in which we currently use them. For example, changes in regulatory requirements could require us to curtail our use of lower-cost operations in India to service our businesses. If we had to curtail or cease our operations in India and transfer some or all of these operations to another geographic area, we could incur significant transition costs as well as higher future overhead costs that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe may need to increase the levels of our employee compensation more rapidly than in the past to retain talent in India. Unless we can continue to enhance the efficiency and productivity of our employees, wage increases in the long-term may negatively impact our financial performance.\nPolitical activity or other changes in political or economic stability in India could affect our ability to operate our business effectively. For example, political protests disrupted our Indian operations in multiple cities for a number of days during 2018. While we have implemented and maintain business continuity plans to reduce the disruption such events cause to our critical operations, we cannot guarantee that such plans will eliminate any negative impact on our business. Depending on the frequency and intensity of future occurrences of instability, our Indian operations could be significantly adversely affected.\nOur operations in the Philippines are less substantial than our operations in India. However, they are still at risk of being affected by the same types of risks that affect our Indian operations. If they were to be so affected, our business could be materially and adversely affected.\nThere are a number of foreign laws and regulations that are applicable to our operations in India and the Philippines, including laws and regulations that govern licensing, employment, safety, taxes and insurance and laws and regulations that govern the creation, continuation and winding up of companies as well as the relationships between shareholders, our corporate entities, the public and the government in these countries. Non-compliance with the laws and regulations of India or the Philippines could result in (i) restrictions on our operations in these countries, (ii) fines, penalties or sanctions or (iii) reputational damage.\nOur operations are vulnerable to disruptions resulting from severe weather events.\nOur operations are vulnerable to disruptions resulting from severe weather events, including our operations in India, the Philippines, the USVI and Florida. Approximately 3,400, or 64%, of our employees as of December 31, 2019 are located in India. In recent years, severe weather events caused disruptions to our operations in India, the Philippines, and the USVI and we incurred expense resulting from the evacuation of personnel and from property damage. While we have implemented and maintain business continuity plans to reduce the disruption such events cause to our critical operations, we cannot guarantee that such plans will eliminate any negative impact on our business, including the cost of evacuation and repairs. Consequently, the occurrence of severe weather events in the future could have a significant adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nPursuit of business or asset acquisitions exposes us to financial, execution and operational risks that could adversely affect us.\nWe are actively looking for opportunities to grow our business through acquisitions of businesses and assets. The performance of the businesses and assets we acquire through acquisitions may not match the historical performance of our other assets. Nor can we assure you that the businesses and assets we may acquire will perform at levels meeting our expectations. We may find that we overpaid for the acquired businesses or assets or that the economic conditions underlying our acquisition decision have changed. For example, in 2014, we recognized an impairment loss of the full carrying value of goodwill totaling $420.2 million, which was primarily associated with certain large acquisitions in prior years. It may also take several quarters or longer for us to fully integrate newly acquired business and assets into our business, during which period our results of operations and financial condition may be negatively affected. Further, certain one-time expenses associated with such acquisitions may have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition. We cannot assure you that acquisitions will not adversely affect our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe risks associated with acquisitions include, among others:\n\u2022\nunanticipated issues in integrating servicing, information, communications and other systems;\n\u2022\nunanticipated incompatibility in servicing, lending, purchasing, logistics, marketing and administration methods;\n\u2022\nunanticipated liabilities assumed from the acquired business;\n\u2022\nnot retaining key employees; and\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management\u2019s attention from ongoing business concerns.\nThe acquisition integration process can be complicated and time consuming and could potentially be disruptive to borrowers of loans serviced by the acquired business. If the integration process is not conducted successfully and with minimal effect on the acquired business and its borrowers, we may not realize the anticipated economic benefits of particular acquisitions within our expected timeframe, or we could lose subservicing business or employees of the acquired business. In addition, integrating operations may involve significant reductions in headcount or the closure of facilities, which may be disruptive to operations and impair employee morale. Through acquisitions, we may enter into business lines in which we have not previously operated. Such acquisitions could require additional integration costs and efforts, including significant time from senior management. We may not be able to achieve the synergies we anticipate from acquired businesses, and we may not be able to grow acquired businesses in the manner we anticipate. In fact, the businesses we acquire could decrease in size, even if the integration process is successful.\nFurther, prices at which acquisitions can be made fluctuate with market conditions. We have experienced times during which acquisitions could not be made in specific markets at prices that we considered to be acceptable, and we expect that we will experience this condition in the future. In addition, to finance an acquisition, we may borrow funds, thereby increasing our leverage and diminishing our liquidity, or we could raise additional equity capital, which could dilute the interests of our existing shareholders.\nThe timing of closing of our acquisitions is often uncertain. We have in the past and may in the future experience delays in closing our acquisitions, or certain aspects of them. For example, we and the applicable seller are often required to obtain certain regulatory and contractual consents as a prerequisite to closing, such as the consents of GSEs, the FHFA, RMBS trustees or regulators. Accordingly, even if we and the applicable seller are efficient and proactive, the actions of third parties can impact the timing under which such consents are obtained. We and the applicable seller may not be able to obtain all the required consents, which may mean that we are unable to acquire all the assets that we wish to acquire. Regulators may have questions relating to aspects of our acquisitions and we may be required to devote time and resources responding to those questions. It is also possible that we will expend considerable resources in the pursuit of an acquisition that, ultimately, either does not close or is terminated.\nLoan putbacks and related liabilities for breaches of representations and warranties regarding sold loans could adversely affect our business.\nWe have exposure to representation, warranty and indemnification obligations relating to our lending, sales and securitization activities, and in certain instances, we have assumed these obligations on loans we service. Our contracts with purchasers of originated loans generally contain provisions that require indemnification or repurchase of the related loans under certain circumstances. While the language in the purchase contracts varies, such contracts generally contain provisions that require us to indemnify purchasers of loans or repurchase such loans if:\n\u2022\nrepresentations and warranties concerning loan quality, contents of the loan file or loan underwriting circumstances are inaccurate;\n\u2022\nadequate mortgage insurance is not secured within a certain period after closing;\n\u2022\na mortgage insurance provider denies coverage; or\n\u2022\nthere is a failure to comply, at the individual loan level or otherwise, with regulatory requirements.\nAdditionally, in one of the servicing contracts that Homeward acquired in 2008 from Freddie Mac involving non-prime mortgage loans, it assumed the origination representations and warranties even though it did not originate the loans.\nWe believe that many purchasers of residential mortgage loans are particularly aware of the conditions under which originators must indemnify or repurchase loans and under which such purchasers would benefit from enforcing any indemnification rights and repurchase remedies they may have.\nAt December 31, 2019, we had outstanding representation and warranty repurchase demands of $47.0 million UPB (285 loans).\nIf home values decrease, our realized loan losses from loan repurchases and indemnifications may increase as well. As a result, our liability for repurchases may increase beyond our current expectations. Depending on the magnitude of any such increase, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe originate and securitize reverse mortgages, which subjects us to risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe originate, securitize and service reverse mortgages and we have retained third parties to subservice the reverse mortgages. The reverse mortgage business is subject to substantial risks, including market, credit, interest rate, liquidity, operational, reputational and legal risks. Generally, a reverse mortgage is a loan available to seniors aged 62 or older that allows homeowners to borrow money against the value of their home. No repayment of the mortgage is required until a default event under the terms of the mortgage occurs, the borrower dies, the borrower moves out of the home or the home is sold. A decline in the demand for reverse mortgages may reduce the number of reverse mortgages we originate and adversely affect our ability to sell reverse mortgages in the secondary market. Although foreclosures involving reverse mortgages generally occur less frequently than forward mortgages, loan defaults on reverse mortgages leading to foreclosures may occur if borrowers fail to occupy the home as their primary residence, maintain their property or fail to pay taxes or home insurance premiums. A general increase in foreclosure rates may adversely impact how reverse mortgages are perceived by potential customers and thus reduce demand for reverse mortgages. Additionally, we could become subject to negative headline risk in the event that loan defaults on reverse mortgages lead to foreclosures or evictions of the elderly. The HUD HECM reverse mortgage program has in the past responded to scrutiny around similar issues by implementing rule changes, and may do so in the future. It is not possible to predict whether any such rule changes would negatively impact us. All of the above factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to fund our tail commitments or securitize our HECM loans (including tails), this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nWe have originated and continue to service HECM loans under which the borrower has additional undrawn borrowing capacity in the form of undrawn lines of credit. We are obligated to fund future borrowings drawn on that capacity. As of December 31, 2019, our commitment to fund additional borrowing capacity was $1.5 billion. In addition, we are required to pay mortgage insurance premiums on behalf of HECM borrowers. We normally fund these obligations on a short-term basis using our cash resources, and regularly securitize these amounts (along with our servicing fees) through the issuance of tails. In December 2019, we entered into a revolving credit facility to fund HECM tail advances. However, to the extent our funding commitments exceed our borrowing capacity under this facility, or if we are unable to renew this 364-day facility on acceptable terms, we will be dependent on our cash resources to meet these commitments. If our cash resources are insufficient to fund these amounts and we are unable to fund them through the securitization of such tails, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nOur HMBS repurchase obligations may reduce our liquidity, and if we are unable to comply with such obligations, it could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAs an HMBS issuer, we assume the obligation to purchase loans out of the Ginnie Mae securitization pools once the outstanding principal balance of the related HECM is equal to or greater than 98% of the maximum claim amount (MCA repurchases). Active repurchased loans are assigned to HUD and payment is typically received within 60 days of repurchase.\nHUD reimburses us for the outstanding principal balance on the loan up to the maximum claim amount. We bear the risk of exposure if the amount of the outstanding principal balance on a loan exceeds the maximum claim amount. Inactive repurchased loans (the borrower is deceased, no longer occupies the property or is delinquent on tax and insurance payments) are generally liquidated through foreclosure and subsequent sale of REO, with a claim filed with HUD for recoverable remaining principal and advance balances. The recovery timeline for inactive repurchased loans depends on various factors, including foreclosure status at the time of repurchase, state-level foreclosure timelines, and the post-foreclosure REO liquidation timeline. The timing and amount of our obligations with respect to MCA repurchases are uncertain as repurchase is dependent largely on circumstances outside of our control. MCA repurchases are expected to continue to increase due to the seasoning of our portfolio, and the increased flow of HECMs and REO that are reaching 98% of their maximum claim amount.\nIf we do not have sufficient liquidity to comply with our Ginnie Mae repurchase obligations, Ginnie Mae could take adverse action against us, including terminating us as an approved HMBS issuer. In addition, if we are required to purchase a significant number of loans with respect to which the outstanding principal balances exceed HUD\u2019s maximum claim amount, we could be required to absorb significant losses on such loans following assignment to HUD or, in the case of inactive loans, liquidation and subsequent claim for HUD reimbursement. Further, during the periods in which HUD reimbursement is pending, our liquidity will be reduced by the repurchase amounts and we will have reduced resources with which to further other business objectives. For all of the foregoing reasons, our liquidity, business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted by our HMBS repurchase obligations.\nLiabilities relating to our past sales of Agency MSRs could adversely affect our business.\nWe have made representations, warranties and covenants relating to our past sales of Agency MSRs, including sales made by PHH before we acquired it. To the extent that we (including PHH prior to its acquisition by us) made inaccurate representations or warranties or if we fail otherwise to comply with our sale agreements, we could incur liability to the purchasers of these MSRs pursuant to the contractual provisions of these agreements.\nReinsuring risk through our captive reinsurance entity could adversely impact our results of operation and financial condition.\nIf our captive reinsurance entity incurs losses from a severe catastrophe or series of catastrophes, particularly in areas where a significant portion of the insured properties are located, claims that result could substantially exceed our expectations, which could adversely impact our results of operation and financial condition.\nA significant portion of our business is in the states of California, Florida, Texas, New York and Pennsylvania, and our business may be significantly harmed by a slowdown in the economy or the occurrence of a natural disaster in those states.\nA significant portion of the mortgage loans that we service and originate are secured by properties in California, Florida, Texas, New York and Pennsylvania. Any adverse economic conditions in these markets, including a downturn in real estate values, could increase loan delinquencies. Delinquent loans are more costly to service and require us to advance delinquent principal and interest and to make advances for delinquent taxes and insurance and foreclosure costs and the upkeep of vacant property in foreclosure to the extent that we determine that such amounts are recoverable. We could also be adversely affected by business disruptions triggered by natural disasters or acts or war or terrorism in these geographic areas.\nWe may incur litigation costs and related losses if the validity of a foreclosure action is challenged by a borrower or if a court overturns a foreclosure.\nWe may incur costs if we are required to, or if we elect to, execute or re-file documents or take other action in our capacity as a servicer in connection with pending or completed foreclosures. We may incur litigation costs if the validity of a foreclosure action is challenged by a borrower. If a court were to overturn a foreclosure because of errors or deficiencies in the foreclosure process, we may have liability to a title insurer of the property sold in foreclosure. These costs and liabilities may not be legally or otherwise reimbursable to us, particularly to the extent they relate to securitized mortgage loans. In addition, if certain documents required for a foreclosure action are missing or defective, we could be obligated to cure the defect or repurchase the loan. A significant increase in litigation costs could adversely affect our liquidity, and our inability to be reimbursed for servicing advances could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nA failure to maintain minimum servicer ratings could have an adverse effect on our business, financing activities, financial condition or results of operations.\nS&P, Moody\u2019s, Fitch and others rate us as a mortgage servicer. Failure to maintain minimum servicer ratings could adversely affect our ability to sell or fund servicing advances going forward, could affect the terms and availability of debt financing facilities that we may seek in the future, and could impair our ability to consummate future servicing transactions or adversely affect our dealings with lenders, other contractual counterparties and regulators, including our ability to maintain our status as an approved servicer by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The servicer rating requirements of Fannie Mae do not necessarily require or imply immediate action, as Fannie Mae has discretion with respect to whether we are in compliance with\ntheir requirements and what actions it deems appropriate under the circumstances in the event that we fall below their desired servicer ratings.\nCertain of our servicing agreements require that we maintain specified servicer ratings. As a result of our current servicer ratings, termination rights have been triggered in some non-Agency servicing agreements. While the holders of these termination rights have not exercised them to date, they have not waived the right to do so, and we could, in the future, be subject to terminations either as a result of servicer ratings downgrades or future adverse actions by ratings agencies, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financing activities, financial condition and results of operations. Downgrades in our servicer ratings could also affect the terms and availability of advance financing or other debt facilities that we may seek in the future. Our failure to maintain minimum or specified ratings could adversely affect our dealings with contractual counterparties, including GSEs, Ginnie Mae and regulators, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financing activities, financial condition and results of operations. To date, terminations as servicer as a result of a breach of any of these provisions have been minimal.\nOur earnings are subject to volatility.\nOur operating results have been and may in the future be significantly affected by inter-period variations in our results of operations, including variations due to sales or acquisitions of MSRs or changes in the value of MSRs due to, among other factors, increases or decreases in prepayment speeds, delinquencies or defaults.\nCertain non-recurring gains and losses have significantly affected our operating results in the past, and other non-recurring gains and losses may affect our operating results in future periods, resulting in substantial inter-period variations in financial performance. In particular, our financial results for the year ended December 31, 2019 reflect substantial costs relating to the integration of PHH, including costs relating to severance agreements and technology transitions. These costs may continue to have a significant impact on our future financial results.\nWe are subject to, among other things, requirements regarding the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. If our internal controls over financial reporting are found to be inadequate, our financial condition and results of operations and the trading price of our common stock may be materially and adversely affected.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud. In addition, Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, requires us to evaluate and report on our internal control over financial reporting. As further detailed under Item 9A, Controls and Procedures, we concluded that, as of December 31, 2019, internal control over financial reporting is effective. However, during 2017, we identified a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting that required remediation and subsequent testing and evaluation before we could conclude that our internal control over financial reporting was once again effective. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect fraud or misstatements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Fraud or misstatement could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could harm our results of operations or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. In addition, investors could lose confidence in our financial reports and the trading price of our common stock may be adversely affected if our internal control over financial reporting is found by management or by our independent registered public accounting firm not to be adequate.\nChanges in the method of determining the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), or the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate, may adversely affect interest rates, our business, and financial markets as a whole.\nOn July 27, 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority in the U.K. announced that it would phase out LIBOR as a benchmark by the end of 2021. It is unclear whether new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021, or whether different benchmark rates used to price indebtedness will develop. We presently have no debt facilities with maturities beyond 2021 that incorporate LIBOR and do not provide for its phase-out. As we renew or replace our debt facilities with maturities prior to the end of 2021 that currently incorporate LIBOR, we will need to work with our counterparties to incorporate alternative benchmarks. There is presently substantial uncertainty relating to the process and timeline for developing LIBOR alternatives, how widely any given alternative will be adopted by parties in the financial markets, and the extent to which alternative benchmarks may be subject to volatility or present risks and challenges that LIBOR does not. It is possible that we will disagree with our contractual counterparties over which alternative benchmark to adopt, which could make renewing or replacing our debt facilities and other agreements more complex. In addition, to the extent our adoption of a benchmark alternative impacts the interest rates payable by borrowers, it could lead to borrower complaints and litigation. Consequently, it is difficult to predict what effect, if any, the phase-out of LIBOR and the use of alternative benchmarks may have on our business or on the overall financial markets. If LIBOR alternatives re-allocate risk among parties in a way that is disadvantageous to market participants such as Ocwen, if there is disagreement among market\nparticipants, including borrowers, over which alternative benchmark to adopt, or if uncertainty relating to the LIBOR phase-out disrupts financial markets, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.\nTax Risks\nFailure to retain the tax benefits provided by the USVI would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nDuring 2019, in connection with our acquisition of PHH, overall corporate simplification and cost reduction efforts, we executed a legal entity reorganization whereby OLS, through which we previously conducted a substantial portion of our servicing business, was merged into PMC. OLS was previously the wholly-owned subsidiary of OMS, which was incorporated and headquartered in the USVI prior to its merger with Ocwen USVI Services, LLC, an entity which is also organized and headquartered in the USVI. The USVI has an Economic Development Commission (EDC) that provides certain tax benefits to qualified businesses. OMS received its certificate to operate as a company qualified for EDC benefits in October 2012 and as a result received significant tax benefits. Following our legal entity reorganization, we are no longer able to avail ourselves of favorable tax treatment for our USVI operations on a going forward basis. However, if the EDC were to determine that we failed to conduct our USVI operations in compliance with EDC qualifications prior to our reorganization, the value of the EDC benefits corresponding to the period prior to the reorganization could be reduced or eliminated, resulting in an increase to our tax expense. In addition, under our agreement with the EDC, we remain obligated to continue to operate Ocwen USVI Services, LLC in compliance with EDC requirements through 2042. If we fail to maintain our EDC qualification, we could be alleged to be in violation of our EDC commitments and the EDC could take adverse action against us, which could include demands for payment and reimbursement of past tax benefits, and it could result in the loss of anticipated income tax refunds. If any of these events were to occur, it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to increased United States federal income taxation.\nOMS was incorporated under the laws of the USVI and operated in a manner that caused a substantial amount of its net income to be treated as not related to a trade or business within the United States, which caused such income to be exempt from United States federal income taxation. However, because there are no definitive standards provided by the Internal Revenue Code (the Code), regulations or court decisions as to the specific activities that constitute being engaged in the conduct of a trade or business within the United States, and as any such determination is essentially factual in nature, we cannot assure you that the IRS will not successfully assert that OMS was engaged in a trade or business within the United States with respect to that income.\nIf the IRS were to successfully assert that OMS had been engaged in a trade or business within the United States with respect to that income in any taxable year, it may become subject to United States federal income taxation on such income. Our tax returns and positions are subject to review and audit by federal and state taxing authorities. An unfavorable outcome to a tax audit could result in higher tax expense.\nThe recently enacted comprehensive tax reform legislation could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nOn December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law new legislation that significantly revises the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA) significantly changed the taxation of U.S.-based multinational corporations. The U.S. Treasury Department, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and state tax authorities have issued and are expected to continue to issue guidance on how the provisions of the TCJA will be applied or otherwise administered. As regulations and guidance evolve with respect to the TCJA, the results of newly issued guidance could be adverse and may differ from previous estimates. The TCJA, among other things, contains significant changes to corporate taxation, including reduction of the corporate tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35% to a flat rate of 21%, limitation of the tax deduction for interest expense and net operating loss carryforwards, one time taxation of offshore earnings at reduced rates regardless of whether they are repatriated, elimination of deferral of U.S. tax on foreign earnings (subject to certain important exceptions), a new minimum tax enacted to prevent companies from stripping earnings out of the U.S. through U.S. tax deductible payments made to foreign affiliates, immediate deductions for certain new investments instead of deductions for depreciation expense over time, and modifying or repealing many business deductions and credits. Notwithstanding the reduction in the corporate income tax rate, the overall impact of the new federal tax law is uncertain and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, state legislation and administrative guidance is still evolving. Certain states have recently enacted conformity legislation or decoupling legislation with uncertainty if, and to what extent, the various remaining states will conform to the newly enacted federal tax law. The impact of this tax reform on holders of our common stock is also uncertain and could be adverse.\nChanges in taxation, as well as changes to tax filing positions resulting from examinations of our tax returns, and the ability to quantify such changes could adversely affect Ocwen\u2019s financial results.\nOcwen is subject to taxation by the various taxing authorities at the Federal, state and local levels where it does business, both in the U.S. and outside the U.S. Legislation or regulation, which could affect Ocwen\u2019s tax burden, could be enacted by any of these governmental authorities. Ocwen cannot predict the timing or extent of such tax-related developments, which could have a negative impact on the financial results. In addition, in the ordinary course of business, our tax filings are subject to examination by these same taxing jurisdictions. The results of an examination of a company\u2019s tax positions by various taxing authorities is inherently uncertain and could result in the disallowance of tax deductions, a reduction in the amount of and/or timing for receiving anticipated tax refunds, and other potential adjustments which could have a negative impact on our financial results.\nAny \u201cownership change\u201d as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code could substantially limit our ability to utilize our net operating losses carryforwards and other deferred tax assets.\nAs of December 31, 2019, Ocwen had U.S. federal net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards of approximately $306.5 million, which we estimate to be worth approximately $64.4 million to Ocwen under our present assumptions related to Ocwen\u2019s various relevant jurisdictional tax rates as a result of recently passed tax legislation (which assumptions reflect a significant degree of uncertainty). As of December 31, 2019, Ocwen had state NOL and state tax credit carryforwards which we estimate to be worth approximately $70.3 million. As of December 31, 2019, Ocwen had foreign tax credit carryforwards of $0.01 million in the U.S. jurisdiction. As of December 31, 2019, Ocwen had disallowed interest under Section 163(j) of $51.9 million in the U.S. jurisdiction and $0.0 million in the USVI jurisdiction. NOL carryforwards, Section 163(j) disallowed interest carryforwards and certain built-in losses or deductions may be subject to annual limitations under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 (Section 382) (or comparable provisions of foreign or state law) in the event that certain changes in ownership were to occur as measured under Section 382. In addition, tax credit carryforwards may be subject to annual limitations under Internal Revenue Code Section 383 (Section 383). We periodically evaluate whether certain changes in ownership have occurred as measured under Section 382 that would limit our ability to utilize our NOLs, tax credit carryforwards, deductions and/or certain built-in losses. If it is determined that an ownership change(s) has occurred, there may be annual limitations under Sections 382 and 383 (or comparable provisions of foreign or state law).\nWe have evaluated whether we experienced an ownership change under these provisions, and determined that an ownership change did occur in January 2015 and in December 2017 in the U.S. jurisdiction, which also results in an ownership change under Section 382 in the USVI jurisdiction. In addition, a Section 382 ownership change occurred at PHH when Ocwen acquired the stock of PHH in October 2018. PHH was a loss corporation as defined under Section 382 at the date of the acquisition. PHH also had an existing Section 382 ownership change on March 31, 2018. For certain states, an additional Section 382 ownership change occurred on August 9, 2017. These Section 382 ownership changes may limit our ability to fully utilize NOLs, tax credit carryforwards, deductions and/or certain built-in losses that existed as of each respective ownership change date in the various jurisdictions.\nDue to the Section 382 and 383 limitations and the maximum carryforward period for our NOLs and tax credits, we will be unable to fully recognize certain deferred tax assets. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2018, we reduced our gross deferred tax asset related to our U.S. federal and USVI NOLs by $160.9 million, our foreign tax credit deferred tax asset by $29.5 million and corresponding valuation allowance by $55.7 million. The realization of all or a portion of our deferred income tax assets (including NOLs and tax credits) is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the statutory carryforward periods. In addition, the limitation on the utilization of our NOL and tax credit carryforwards could result in Ocwen incurring a current tax liability in future tax years. Our inability to utilize our pre-ownership change NOL carryforwards, Section 163(j) disallowed interest carryforwards, any future recognized built-in losses or deductions, and tax credit carryforwards could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Finally, any future changes in our ownership or sale of our stock could further limit the use of our NOLs and tax credits in the future.\nAs part of our Section 382 evaluation and consistent with the rules provided within Section 382, Ocwen relies strictly on the existence or absence of, as well as the information contained in, certain publicly available documents (e.g., Schedule 13D, Schedule 13G or other documents filed with the SEC) to identify shareholders that own a 5-percent or greater interest in Ocwen stock throughout the period tested. Further, Ocwen relies on such public filings to identify dates in which such 5-percent shareholders acquired, disposed, or otherwise transacted in Ocwen common stock. As the requirement for filing such notices of ownership from the SEC is to report beneficial ownership, as opposed to actual economic ownership of the stock of Ocwen, certain SEC filings may not represent ownership in Ocwen stock that should be considered in determining whether Ocwen experienced an ownership change under the Section 382 rules. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences (regarding Ocwen\u2019s ability to rely on the existence and absence of information in publicly filed Schedules 13D and 13G), the rules prescribed in Section 382 and the regulations thereunder provide that Ocwen may (but is not required to) seek additional clarification from shareholders filing such Schedules 13D and 13G if there are questions or uncertainty regarding the true economic ownership of shares reported in such filing (whether due to ambiguity in the filing, an overly complex ownership structure, the type of instruments owned and reported in the filings, etc.) (often referred to \u201cactual knowledge\u201d questionnaires). Such information can be sought on a filer by filer basis (i.e., there is no requirement that if actual knowledge is sought with respect to one\nshareholder, actual knowledge must be sought with respect to all shareholders that filed schedules 13D or 13G). While the seeking of actual knowledge can be beneficial in some instances it may be detrimental in others. Once such actual knowledge is received, Section 382 requires the inclusion of such actual knowledge, even if such inclusion is detrimental to the conclusion reached.\nOcwen has performed its analysis of the rules under Section 382 and, based on all currently available information, identified, in 2018, that it experienced an ownership change for Section 382 purposes in January 2015 and December 2017. Prior to 2018, Ocwen was aware of shareholder activity in 2015 and 2017 that may have caused a Section 382 ownership change(s) but determined that additional information could potentially be obtained from certain shareholders that would indicate a Section 382 ownership change had not occurred. In completing this analysis, Ocwen identified several shareholders that filed a schedule 13G during the period disclosing a greater than 5-percent interest in Ocwen stock where beneficial versus economic ownership of the stock was unclear and Ocwen therefore requested further details. As of the date of this Form 10-K, Ocwen has not received all requested responses from selected shareholders and will continue to consider such shareholders as economic owners of Ocwen\u2019s stock until actual knowledge is otherwise received.\nOcwen is continuing to monitor the ownership in its stock to evaluate information that will become available later in 2020 and that may result in a different outcome for Section 382 purposes and our future cash tax obligations. As part of this monitoring, Ocwen periodically evaluates whether it is appropriate and beneficial to retroactively seek actual knowledge on certain previously identified and included 5-percent shareholders, whereby, depending on the responses received, Ocwen may conclude that either the January 2015 or December 2017 Section 382 ownership changes may have instead occurred on a different date, or did not occur at all. As such, our analysis regarding the amount of tax attributes that may be available to offset taxable income in the future without restrictions imposed by Section 382 may continue to evolve.\nThe reorganization of our USVI operations could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nDuring 2019, in connection with our acquisition of PHH, overall corporate simplification and cost reduction efforts, we executed a legal entity reorganization whereby two primary licensed entities (PMC and OLS) would be combined by merging OLS into PMC. OLS was previously the wholly-owned subsidiary of OMS, an entity that was incorporated and headquartered in the USVI. As a result of this merger, a portion of our USVI operations and assets were transferred to the U.S. At this time, we expect the merger to be treated as a reorganization that will result in efficiencies and operational cost savings through reduced complexity and a simplification of our global structure.\nAlthough we expect the reorganization to result in efficiencies and operational cost savings, it is uncertain how the reorganization will ultimately impact Ocwen from a U.S. federal, state and USVI income tax perspective. We are continuing to evaluate the impact of the new U.S. tax legislation and guiding regulations (which are still being promulgated and finalized) on our global tax position. It is possible that our interpretation of the new tax legislation and related guidance that has been provided to date, and for which we are relying on to conclude upon the tax consequences of the reorganization and the future business operations, will not be consistent with final guidance provided by the IRS. In addition, the reorganization of the USVI operations could result in a write-down of our net deferred tax assets, including our NOL carryforwards, as well as a permanent loss of our EDC benefits in the USVI. Finally, the IRS or the Bureau of Internal Revenue may challenge our conclusions regarding the taxation associated with the reorganization and future business operations which could result in an increase to our current income tax obligations. The reorganization and future business operations could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows due to the uncertainty of how the new U.S. tax legislation will impact our global tax position, as well as the other factors noted above.\nRisks Relating to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nOur common stock price experiences substantial volatility and has dropped significantly on a number of occasions in recent periods, which may affect your ability to sell our common stock at an advantageous price.\nThe market price of our shares of common stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile. For example, the closing market price of our common stock on the New York Stock Exchange fluctuated during 2019 between $1.27 per share and $2.41 per share and the closing stock price on February 21, 2020 was $1.40 per share. Therefore, the volatility and recent decline in our stock price may affect your ability to sell our common stock at an advantageous price. Market price fluctuations in our common stock may be due to factors both within and outside our control, including regulatory or legal actions, acquisitions, dispositions or other material public announcements or speculative trading in our stock (e.g., traders \u201cshorting\u201d our common stock), as well as a variety of other factors including, but not limited to those set forth under \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and \u201cForward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nIn addition, the stock markets in general, including the New York Stock Exchange, have, at times, experienced extreme price and trading fluctuations. These fluctuations have resulted in volatility in the market prices of securities that often has been unrelated or disproportionate to changes in operating performance. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market prices of our common stock.\nWhen the market price of a company's shares drops significantly, shareholders often institute securities class action lawsuits against the company. A lawsuit against us, even if unsuccessful, could cause us to incur substantial costs and could divert the time and attention of our management and other resources. Further, if the average closing price of our stock over thirty consecutive trading days were to fall below $1.00, we would need to take immediate steps to avoid de-listing by the New York Stock Exchange. Such measures could cause us to incur substantial costs and divert management attention, and could include implementing a reverse stock split, which would entail additional risk, and success in preventing de-listing would not be assured.\nWe have several large shareholders, and such shareholders may vote their shares to influence matters requiring shareholder approval.\nBased on SEC filings, certain shareholders, such as investors Deer Park Road Management Company, LP and Leon G. Cooperman, own or control significant amounts of our common stock. These and our other large shareholders each have the ability to vote a meaningful percentage of our outstanding common stock on all matters put to a vote of our shareholders. As a result, these shareholders could influence matters requiring shareholder approval, including the amendment of our articles of incorporation, the approval of mergers or similar transactions and the election of directors. For instance, we held a special meeting of shareholders in November 2018 in order to implement an amendment to our articles of incorporation that management believed was necessary to help us preserve certain tax assets, but in part due to the fact that we did not receive the vote of several large shareholders, the proposal was not adopted by our shareholders. If, in the future, situations arise in which management and certain large shareholders have divergent views, we may be unable to take actions management believes to be in the best interests of Ocwen.\nFurther, certain of our large shareholders also hold significant percentages of stock in companies with which we do business. It is possible these interlocking ownership positions could cause these shareholders to take actions based on factors other than solely what is in the best interests of Ocwen.\nOur board of directors may authorize the issuance of additional securities that may cause dilution and may depress the price of our securities.\nOur charter permits our board of directors, without our stockholders\u2019 approval, to:\n\u2022\nauthorize the issuance of additional common stock or preferred stock in connection with future equity offerings or acquisitions of securities or other assets of companies; and\n\u2022\nclassify or reclassify any unissued common stock or preferred stock and to set the preferences, rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares, including the issuance of shares of preferred stock that have preference rights over the common stock and existing preferred stock with respect to dividends, liquidation, voting and other matters or shares of common stock that have preference rights over common stock with respect to voting.\nWhile any such issuance would be subject to compliance with the terms of our debt and other agreements, our issuance of additional securities could be substantially dilutive to our existing stockholders and may depress the price of our common stock.\nFuture offerings of debt securities, which would be senior to our common stock in liquidation, or equity securities, which would dilute our existing stockholders\u2019 interests and may be senior to our common stock in liquidation or for the purposes of distributions, may harm the market price of our securities.\nWe will continue to seek to access the capital markets from time to time and, subject to compliance with our other contractual agreements, may make additional offerings of term loans, debt or equity securities, including senior or subordinated notes, preferred stock or common stock. We are not precluded by the terms of our charter from issuing additional indebtedness. Accordingly, we could become more highly leveraged, resulting in an increase in debt service obligations and an increased risk of default on our obligations. If we were to liquidate, holders of our debt and lenders with respect to other borrowings would receive a distribution of our available assets before the holders of our common stock. Additional equity offerings by us may dilute our existing stockholders\u2019 interest in us or reduce the market price of our existing securities. Because our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings. Further, conditions could require that we accept less favorable terms for the issuance of our securities in the future. Thus, our existing stockholders will bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the market price of our securities and diluting their ownership interest in us.\nBecause of certain provisions in our organizational documents and regulatory restrictions, takeovers may be more difficult, possibly preventing you from obtaining an optimal share price. In addition, significant investments in our common stock may be restricted, which could impact demand for, and the trading price of, our common stock.\nOur amended and restated articles of incorporation provide that the total number of shares of all classes of capital stock that we have authority to issue is 220 million, of which 200 million are common shares and 20 million are preferred shares. Our\nboard of directors has the authority, without a vote of the shareholders, to establish the preferences and rights of any preferred or other class or series of shares to be issued and to issue such shares. The issuance of preferred shares could delay or prevent a change in control. Since our board of directors has the power to establish the preferences and rights of the preferred shares without a shareholder vote, our board of directors may give the holders of preferred shares preferences, powers and rights, including voting rights, senior to the rights of holders of our common shares. In addition, our bylaws include provisions that, among other things, require advance notice for raising business or making nominations at meetings, which could impact the ability of a third party to acquire control of us or the timing of acquiring such control.\nThird parties seeking to acquire us or make significant investments in us must do so in compliance with state regulatory requirements applicable to licensed mortgage servicers and lenders. Many states require change of control applications for acquisitions of \u201ccontrol\u201d as defined under each state\u2019s laws and regulation, which may apply to an investment without regard to the intent of the investor. For example, New York has a control presumption triggered at 10% ownership of the voting stock of the licensee or of any person that controls the licensee. In addition, we have licensed insurance subsidiaries in New York and Vermont. Accordingly, there can be no effective change in control of Ocwen unless the person seeking to acquire control has made the relevant filings and received the requisite approvals in New York and Vermont. These regulatory requirements may discourage potential acquisition proposals or investments, may delay or prevent a change in control of us and may impact demand for, and the trading price of, our common stock.", "PERMNO": 84007, "SIC": 6035, "TIC": "OCN"}
