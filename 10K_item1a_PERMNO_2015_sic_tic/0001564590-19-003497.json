{"cik": "1517228", "company": "CommScope Holding Company, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-02-21", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nThe following is a cautionary discussion of risks, uncertainties and assumptions that we believe are significant to our business. In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following are some of the important factors that, individually or in the aggregate, we believe could make our results differ materially from those described in any forward-looking statements. It is impossible to predict or identify all such factors and, as a result, you should not consider the following factors to be a complete discussion of risks, uncertainties and assumptions related to us or our business.\nARRIS Acquisition Risks\nThe pending acquisition of ARRIS International plc (ARRIS) (the Pending Acquisition) may not be completed on a timely basis, on anticipated terms, or at all, and there are uncertainties and risks to consummating the Pending Acquisition.\nThe obligation of each party to consummate the Pending Acquisition is subject to the satisfaction of a number of conditions set forth in the bid conduct agreement, as amended (the Bid Conduct Agreement) dated November 8, 2018, many of which are not within our control. Several conditions have been satisfied such as approval of the acquisition by the ARRIS stockholders and expiration of the Hart-Scott Rodino Act waiting period in the U.S. Other conditions that still need to be satisfied include the receipt of all remaining required consents, approvals or clearances required by certain other foreign governmental authorities under applicable antitrust laws and the absence of any legal restraint that prohibits the Pending Acquisition. Each party\u2019s obligation to consummate the Pending Acquisition is subject to certain additional closing conditions, including the accuracy of representations and warranties and performance of each parties\u2019 obligations required to be performed as well as others set forth in the Bid Conduct Agreement. The failure to satisfy all of the required conditions could delay the completion of the Pending Acquisition for a significant period of time or prevent it from occurring. Any delay in completing the Pending Acquisition, including as a result of any litigation related to the Pending Acquisition, could prevent us from realizing some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve. Furthermore, subject to certain conditions, ARRIS may at any time terminate the Bid Conduct Agreement as a result of a superior proposal to purchase its business.\nWe face risks and uncertainties due to the announcement of the Pending Acquisition, as well as the potential failure to consummate the Pending Acquisition, including that:\n\u2022\nCommScope does not currently control ARRIS, and will not control ARRIS until completion of the acquisition, and until that time there can be no assurance that ARRIS will be operated in the same way it would under CommScope\u2019s control;\n\u2022\nthe Pending Acquisition could have an adverse impact on our relationships with employees, customers and suppliers, and prospective customers or other third parties may delay or decline entering into agreements with us as a result of the announcement, whether or not the Pending Acquisition is consummated;\n\u2022\nwe incur significant transaction costs, including legal, financial advisory, accounting and other costs relating to the Pending Acquisition, even if it is not consummated, and any delay in consummation of the Pending Acquisition may increase these costs;\n\u2022\nwe have incurred significant indebtedness to fund the Pending Acquisition, and even if the Pending Acquisition is not consummated and we do not utilize the proceeds, we are required to pay interest or ticking fees until the Pending Acquisition is terminated;\n\u2022\nthe attention of our management and employees may be diverted from pursuing other opportunities or running day-to-day operations;\n\u2022\nif the Pending Acquisition is not consummated, we will not realize any of the expected benefits of the Pending Acquisition;\n\u2022\nfailure to consummate the Pending Acquisition could result in negative reactions from the financial markets or in the investment community, including negative impacts on our stock price;\n\u2022\nwe may be subject to shareholder litigation related to the Pending Acquisition or failure to complete the Pending Acquisition; and\n\u2022\nif the Bid Conduct Agreement is terminated before we complete the Pending Acquisition, under some circumstances, including in the event CommScope fails to obtain the required antitrust approvals or is unable to secure the financing necessary to consummate the Pending Acquisition, CommScope may have to pay a termination fee to ARRIS of $250.0 million in cash.\nThe occurrence of any of these events, individually or in combination, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe integration of CommScope and ARRIS will be difficult, costly and time-consuming and the anticipated benefits and cost savings may take longer to realize than expected or may not be realized at all. If we are unable to integrate ARRIS effectively, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the Pending Acquisition.\nWe currently expect to realize annual synergies and cost savings of approximately $150.0 million to be fully achieved within three years of the closing of the Pending Acquisition, with approximately $60.0 million in the first full year. We also expect to incur integration and restructuring costs of approximately $150.0 million to achieve these synergies. These synergies are expected to come from all areas of our company, including sales, marketing, general and administrative, operations and research and development. Our ability to realize the anticipated benefits is dependent, to a large extent, on our ability to complete the integration of the two businesses. The combination of two independent businesses is a complex, costly and time-consuming process and there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully integrate CommScope and ARRIS, or if such integration is successfully accomplished, that such integration will not be more costly or take longer than presently contemplated. If we cannot successfully complete the integration within a reasonable time frame, we may not be able to realize the anticipated benefits of the Pending Acquisition, which could have a material adverse effect on our share price, business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur ability to realize the expected synergies and benefits of the Pending Acquisition is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control. These risks and uncertainties include, among other things:\n\u2022\nthe completion of an effective integration of operations, controls, policies and procedures, and technologies, as well as the harmonization of differences in the business cultures of CommScope and ARRIS;\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management attention from ongoing operation of our business as well as ARRIS\u2019 business during the integration;\n\u2022\nour ability to retain the service of senior management and other key personnel of both CommScope and ARRIS;\n\u2022\nour ability to preserve customer, supplier and other important relationships of CommScope and ARRIS and resolve potential conflicts that may arise;\n\u2022\nthe risk that certain of CommScope\u2019s or ARRIS\u2019 customers and suppliers will opt to discontinue business with CommScope or ARRIS or exercise their right to terminate agreements as a result of the Acquisition pursuant to change of control provisions in these agreements or otherwise;\n\u2022\nthe risk that ARRIS may have liabilities we failed to or were unable to discover in the course of performing due diligence;\n\u2022\nintegrating CommScope\u2019s and ARRIS\u2019 various information systems, including different enterprise resource planning systems, will be complex and challenging and may result in production disruptions or be more costly than anticipated;\n\u2022\nthe risk that integrating ARRIS\u2019 workforce into the CommScope workforce may result in production or other disruptions or be more costly than anticipated;\n\u2022\ngreater than expected difficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings, synergies, business opportunities and growth prospects from the combination; and\n\u2022\ngreater than expected difficulties in managing the expanded operations of a significantly larger and more complex combined business.\nAs a result of the Pending Acquisition, The Carlyle Group (Carlyle) will own a substantial portion of our equity and its interests may not be aligned with yours.\nFunding for the Pending Acquisition will include a convertible preferred stock investment by Carlyle. As a result, Carlyle will own approximately 16% of our common stock on an as-converted basis and we will increase the size of our board of directors to eleven, giving Carlyle the right to designate up to two directors. In addition, certain of our existing directors are senior advisors to Carlyle. Circumstances may occur in which the interests of Carlyle could conflict with the interests of our other stockholders. For example, the existence of Carlyle as a significant stockholder and Carlyle\u2019s board appointment rights may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers, delaying or preventing changes in control or changes in management or limiting the ability of our other stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in the best interests of our company.\nCompetitive Risks\nOur business is dependent on capital spending for data and communication networks, and reductions in such capital spending could adversely affect our business.\nOur performance is dependent on capital spending for constructing, rebuilding, maintaining or upgrading data and communication networks, which can be volatile and difficult to forecast. Capital spending in the communications industry is cyclical and can be curtailed or deferred on short notice. A variety of factors affect the timing and amount of capital spending in the communications industry including: competing technologies; general economic conditions; seasonality of outside deployments; timing and adoption of the global rollout of new technologies; customer specific financial or general market conditions; changes in customer preferences or requirements; availability and cost of capital; governmental regulation; demands for network services; competitive pressures, including pricing pressures; acceptance of new services offered by our customers; industry consolidation; and real or perceived trends or uncertainties in these factors. As a result of these factors, we may not be able to maintain or increase our sales in the future, and our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nA substantial portion of our business is derived from a limited number of key customers and channel partners.\nOur customer base includes direct customers, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and channel partners, which include distributors, system integrators and value-added resellers. We derived 18% of our 2018 consolidated net sales from our top two direct customers. Our largest customer, Anixter International Inc. (Anixter), accounted for 11% of our 2018 consolidated net sales. As a result of the Pending Acquisition, our customer concentration composition will likely change and our largest customer is expected to be Comcast Corporation with 10% or more of our total net sales.\nThe concentration of our net sales among key customers subjects us to a variety of risks including:\n\u2022\nlower sales that could result from the loss of one or more of our key customers;\n\u2022\nless efficient operations that could result in higher costs from an inability to accurately forecast and plan for volatile spending patterns of key customers;\n\u2022\nrenegotiations of agreements with key customers (or consolidation of agreements with common customers in connection with the Pending Acquisition) that could result in materially less favorable terms;\n\u2022\nfinancial difficulties experienced by one or more of our key customers that could result in reduced purchases of our products and/or delays or difficulties in collecting accounts receivable balances; and\n\u2022\nreductions in inventory levels held by channel partners and OEMs, which may be unrelated to purchasing trends by end customers.\nWe are also exposed to similar risks to the extent that we have significant indirect sales to one or more end-users of our products who may also be a direct customer.\nWe generally have no minimum purchase commitments with any of our distributors, system integrators, value-added resellers, operators or OEMs or other customers, and our contracts with these parties do not prohibit them from purchasing or offering products or services that compete with ours. Although we maintain long-term relationships with these parties and have not historically lost key customers, we have experienced variability in the level of purchases by our key customers. Any significant reduction in sales to these customers, including as a result of the inability or unwillingness of these customers to continue purchasing our products, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe face competitive pressures with respect to all of our major product groups.\nCompetition in our industry depends on a number of factors, including innovative product and service solution offerings, the ability to adapt to changing markets and customer preferences, product and service quality, timing of the introduction of new products and services, speed of delivery, pricing, customer service and the total customer experience. In each of our major product groups, we compete with a substantial number of foreign and domestic companies, some of which have greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources or lower operating costs. They may also have broader product offerings and market focus. This gives many of these enterprises a competitive advantage to withstand any significant reduction in capital spending by customers in our markets over the long term. Further, our industry continues to consolidate, and the combination of any of our competitors could further increase these advantages and result in competitors with broader market presence.\nSome competitors may be able to bundle their products and services together and may be capable of delivering more complete solutions than we are able to provide to better meet customer preferences, which may cause us to lose sales opportunities and revenue. Competitors\u2019 actions, such as price reductions, acceptance of higher-risk contractual terms, or the introduction of new innovative products and services, and the use of exclusively price driven auctions by customers have caused lost sales opportunities in the past and may cause us to lose sales opportunities in the future. The rapid technological changes occurring in the communications industry could also lead to the entry of new competitors against whom we may not be able to compete successfully. For example, as networks become more virtualized, our products may be at risk of being subsumed by competitors who provide software solutions that perform the same functionality as our products. In addition, if any of our competitors\u2019 products or technologies were to become the industry standard, our business would be negatively affected. Further, if we are unable to continue to transform our business processes to support changing customer expectations and deliver a superior total customer experience, we may lose sales opportunities in the future. Changes in trade policies could also decrease the price competitiveness of our products and/or increase our operating costs. For a more complete discussion of our risks related to trade policies, see the risk factor \u201cAdditional tariffs or a global trade war could increase the cost of our products, which could adversely impact the competitiveness of our products\u201d under \u201cInternational Risks\u201d in this Item 1A. Risk Factors section.\nWe cannot assure you that we will continue to compete successfully with our existing competitors or with new competitors. If we are unable to compete in any of our markets at the same level as we have in the past or are forced to reduce the prices of our products in order to continue to be competitive, our operating results, financial condition and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nChanges to the regulatory environment in which our customers operate may negatively impact our business.\nThe telecommunications and cable television industries are subject to significant and changing federal and state regulation, both in the U.S. and other countries. We have benefited from government programs that encourage spending on initiatives that utilize our products. Changes to the way in which internet service providers are regulated, changes in government programs in our industry or uncertainty regarding future changes could adversely impact our customers\u2019 decisions regarding capital spending, which could decrease demand for our products. Decreased demand for our products could materially and adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nOperational Risks\nOur future success depends on our ability to anticipate and adapt to changes in technology and customer preferences and develop, implement and market innovative solutions.\nMany of our markets are characterized by advances in information processing and communications capabilities that require increased transmission speeds and greater bandwidth. These advances require significant investments in research and development in order to improve the capabilities of our products and services and develop new offerings or solutions that will meet the needs and preferences of our customers. There can be no assurance that our investments in research and development will yield marketable product innovations.\nWe may not be successful in our ongoing innovation efforts if, among other things, our products and services are not cost effective; brought to market in a timely manner; compliant with evolving industry standards; accepted in the market; or recognized as meeting customer requirements. We could experience a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows if we are not successful in our ongoing innovation efforts.\nAs our products become more complex and customer preferences continue to change, we may encounter difficulties in meeting customer preferences including performance, service and delivery expectations, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIf we do not stay current with product life cycle developments, our business may suffer.\nA significant portion of our revenues is dependent on the commercial deployment of technologies based on 3G and 4G wireless communications equipment and products. If we are not able to support our customers in an effective and cost-efficient manner as they advance from older generation networks or as they expand the capacity of their networks, our business will suffer. If we do not have competitively priced, market-accepted products available to meet our customers\u2019 planned roll-out of 5G wireless communications systems, we may miss a significant opportunity and our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nIn addition, there are several major trends that we expect to continue to impact the enterprise market and product life cycles. Enterprises are shifting toward mobility indoors and adjusting in-building cabling designs to support Wi-Fi, more access points and in-building cellular applications. Due to significant increases in data traffic and migrations of applications to the cloud, enterprises are also shifting spending toward multi-tenant data centers and hyperscale cloud service providers, which offer cloud data centers services as a replacement to in-house corporate data centers. As a result, there is growing demand for fiber solutions and decelerating demand for copper solutions. If we are unable to continue to support customers in these transitions, or if sales of copper products decline faster than expected, we could experience a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIf our service offerings or products, including material purchased from our suppliers, have quality or performance issues, our business may suffer.\nOur business depends on delivering products and services of consistently high quality. Many of our solutions are highly complex and testing procedures used by us and our customers are limited to evaluating them under likely and foreseeable failure scenarios. For various reasons, once deployed, our products may fail to perform as expected. Performance issues could result from faulty design, defective raw materials or components purchased from suppliers, problems in manufacturing or installation errors. We have experienced such performance issues in the past and remain exposed to such performance issues in the future. In some cases, recall of some or all affected products, product redesigns or additional capital expenditures may be required to correct a defect. In addition, we generally offer warranties on most products, the terms and conditions of which depend upon the product subject to the warranty. In many cases, we also indemnify our customers against damages or losses that might arise from certain claims relating to our products and services. Future claims may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Any significant or systemic product or service failure could also result in lost future sales as well as reputational damage.\nOur business depends on effective management information systems.\nWe rely on effective management information systems for critical business operations, to support strategic business decisions and to maintain a competitive edge in the marketplace. We rely on our enterprise resource planning systems to support critical business operations such as processing sales orders and invoicing; manufacturing; shipping; inventory control; purchasing and supply chain management; human resources; and financial reporting. We also rely on management information systems to produce information for business decision-making and planning and to support e-commerce activities. Failure to maintain an adequate digital platform or to make additional investment in our digital platform to support e-commerce activities and improve our customer experience could have a material adverse impact on our business through lost sales opportunities.\nIf we are unable to maintain our management information systems, including our IT infrastructure, to support critical business operations, to produce information for business decision-making activities and to support our e-commerce activities, we could experience a material adverse impact on our business or an inability to timely and accurately report our financial results.\nCyber-security incidents, including data security breaches, ransomware or computer viruses, could harm our business by exposing us to various liabilities, disrupting our delivery of products and services and damaging our reputation.\nWe rely extensively on our management information technology systems and those of third parties to operate our business and store proprietary information about our products and intellectual property. Additionally, we and others acting on our behalf store \u201cpersonally identifiable information\u201d with respect to employees, vendors, customers and others. As the recent rise in cyber-security incidents around the world indicates, all management information technology systems are vulnerable. Despite the security controls we have in place, our facilities, systems and procedures, and those of our third-party service providers, are at risk to security breaches, acts of vandalism, ransomware, software viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors or other similar events. In particular, unauthorized access to our computer systems or stored data could result in the theft or improper disclosure of proprietary, confidential or sensitive information, the deletion or modification of records or interruptions in our operations. Any such events could subject us to civil and criminal penalties; expose us to liabilities to our customers, employees, vendors, governmental authorities or other third parties; allow others to unfairly compete with us; disrupt our delivery of products and services; and have a negative impact on our reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThere has been an increase in the adoption of laws and regulations in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere imposing requirements for the handling of personal data, as well as requirements for remediation actions and financial penalties for noncompliance. For example, we are subject to the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which took effect in May 2018. We employ a variety of security breach countermeasures and security controls that we believe are compliant, but we cannot guarantee that all breach attempts can be successfully thwarted by these measures as the sophistication of attacks increases. In addition, as the regulatory environment related to information security, data collection and use, and privacy becomes increasingly rigorous, with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business, compliance with those requirements could also result in additional costs. Noncompliance with laws and regulations related to cyber-security breaches could have negative consequences, including government investigations, penalties, files, civil and criminal sanctions and reputational harm, and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf our integrated global manufacturing operations suffer production or shipping delays, we may have difficulty meeting customer demands.\nDisruption of our ability to produce at or distribute from our facilities could adversely affect our ability to manufacture products at our other manufacturing facilities in a cost-effective and timely manner. In particular, some of our manufacturing facilities rely on aging production equipment and information technology infrastructure, and if we fail to properly maintain or update this equipment, it could affect our ability to manufacture or ship products. Other disruptions, including those due to failure of our manufacturing infrastructure, information technology outage, labor disturbances, fire, electrical outage, natural disaster, acts of violence or terrorism, shipping interruptions or some other catastrophic event could adversely affect our ability to manufacture products at our other manufacturing facilities in a cost-effective and timely manner, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nSupply Chain Risks\nOur dependence on commodities subjects us to cost volatility and potential availability constraints.\nOur profitability may be materially affected by changes in the market price and availability of certain raw materials, most of which are linked to the commodity markets. The principal raw materials and components we purchase are made of metals such as copper, steel, aluminum or brass; plastics and other polymers; and optical fiber. Fabricated copper, steel and aluminum are used in the production of coaxial and twisted pair cables and polymers are used to insulate and protect cables. Prices for copper, steel, aluminum, fluoropolymers and certain other polymers derived from oil and natural gas have experienced significant volatility as a result of changes in the levels of global demand, supply disruptions and other factors. As a result, we have adjusted our prices for certain products and may have to adjust prices again in the future. Delays in implementing price increases or a failure to achieve market acceptance of price increases has in the past and could in the future have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. In an environment of falling commodities prices, we may be unable to sell higher-cost inventory before implementing price decreases, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are dependent on a limited number of key suppliers for certain raw materials and components.\nWe are dependent on a limited number of key suppliers for certain of our raw material and component purchases, including certain polymers, copper rod, copper and aluminum tapes, fine aluminum wire, steel wire, optical fiber, circuit boards and other electronic components.\nOur key suppliers have experienced in the past, and could experience in the future, production, operational or financial difficulties, or there may be global shortages of certain raw materials or components we use. Our inability to find sufficient sources of supply on reasonable terms could impact our ability to manufacture products in a cost-effective manner, which could have a material adverse effect on our gross margin and results of operations.\nWe also source many of our components from international markets. Any changes in the laws and policies of the U.S. or other countries affecting trade may be a risk to us. To the extent there are unfavorable changes imposed by the U.S. or other countries and/or retaliatory actions taken by trading partners, such as the addition of new tariffs or trade restrictions, we may experience material adverse impacts on earnings. For a more complete discussion of our risks related to tariffs and trade restrictions, see the risk factor, \u201cAdditional tariffs or a global trade war could increase the cost of our products, which could adversely impact the competitiveness of our products\u201d under our \u201cInternational Risk Factors\u201d in this Item 1A. Risk Factors section.\nCapacity constraints with respect to our internal facilities and/or existing or new contract manufacturers could have an adverse impact on our business.\nWe internally produce, both domestically and internationally, a portion of the components used in our finished products. We also rely on unaffiliated contract manufacturers, both domestically and internationally, to produce certain products or key components of products. If we do not have sufficient production capacity, either through our internal facilities or independent contract manufacturers, or if we cannot ramp up capacity for complex products fast enough to meet customer demand, we may experience lost sales opportunities, lost market share and customer relations problems, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf our contract manufacturers encounter production, quality, financial or other difficulties, we may experience difficulty in meeting customer demands.\nWe rely on unaffiliated contract manufacturers, both domestically and internationally, to produce certain products or key components of products. If these contract manufacturers encounter production, quality, financial or other difficulties, including labor disturbances or geopolitical instability, and if acceptable alternative suppliers cannot be identified, we may encounter difficulty in meeting customer demands. Any such difficulties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial results, results of operations and cash flows.\nStrategic Risks\nOur business strategy relies in part on acquisitions to create growth. We may not fully realize anticipated benefits from past or future acquisitions or investments in other companies.\nWe have completed a number of acquisitions and invested in other companies over recent years, most significantly the acquisition of the BNS business from TE Connectivity in 2015. There are significant challenges to integrating an acquired operation into our business, including, but not limited to: successfully managing the operations, manufacturing facilities and technology; integrating the sales organizations; maintaining and increasing the customer base; retaining key employees, suppliers and distributors; integrating management information systems, including enterprise resource planning systems; integrating inventory management and accounting activities; integrating research and development activities; and addressing operating losses that may exist related to individual markets, facilities or product lines. Although we expect to realize strategic, operational and financial benefits as a result of past or future acquisitions and investments, we cannot predict or guarantee whether and to what extent anticipated cost savings, synergies and growth prospects will be achieved.\nWe anticipate that a portion of any future growth of our business may be accomplished by acquiring existing businesses, products or technologies. However, we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities or obtain any necessary financing on acceptable terms. We may spend time and money investigating and negotiating with potential acquisition or investment targets but not complete the transaction.\nAny future acquisition could involve other risks, including the assumption of additional liabilities and expenses, issuances of debt, incurrence of transaction and integration costs, litigation and diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, and such acquisition may be dilutive to our financial results.\nLast November we announced the pending acquisition of ARRIS to be completed in the first half of 2019. For a discussion of the risks associated with the Pending Acquisition, see the \u201cARRIS Acquisition Risks\u201d noted above under this Item 1A. Risk Factors section.\nWe may sell or discontinue one or more of our product lines, as a result of our evaluation of our products and markets.\nWe periodically evaluate our various product lines and may consider the divestiture or discontinuance of one or more of those product lines. Any such divestiture or discontinuance could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial position.\nDivestitures of product lines have inherent risks, including the expense of selling the product line; the possibility that any anticipated sale will not occur; possible delays in closing any sale; the risk of lower-than-expected proceeds from the sale of the divested business; unexpected costs associated with the separation of the business to be sold from our management information and other operating systems; potential post-closing claims for indemnification; and potential loss of customers. Expected cost savings may also be difficult to achieve or maximize due to a fixed cost structure, and we may experience varying success in the timely reduction of fixed costs or transferring of liabilities previously associated with the divested or discontinued business.\nDifficulties may be encountered in the realignment of manufacturing capacity and capabilities among our global manufacturing facilities that could adversely affect our ability to meet customer demand for our products.\nWe periodically realign manufacturing capacity among our global facilities in order to reduce costs by improving manufacturing efficiency and to strengthen our long-term competitive position. The implementation of these initiatives may include significant shifts of production capacity among facilities.\nThere are significant risks inherent in the implementation of these initiatives, including our failure to ensure the following: adequate inventory on hand or production capacity to meet customer demand while capacity is being shifted among facilities; maintenance of product quality as a result of shifting capacity; adequate raw material and other service providers to meet the needs at the new production locations; our ability to successfully remove, transport and re-install equipment; and the availability of adequate supervisory, production and support personnel to accommodate the shifted production.\nIn the event manufacturing realignment initiatives are not successfully implemented, we could experience lost future sales and increased operating costs as well as customer relations problems, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may need to undertake additional restructuring actions in the future.\nWe have previously recognized restructuring charges in response to slowdowns in demand for our products and in conjunction with implementation of initiatives to reduce costs and improve efficiency of our operations. In addition, over the past several years, we have undertaken a number of initiatives to support the BNS integration which included the closure of certain domestic and international manufacturing facilities and various other workforce reductions. As a result of changes in business conditions, the Pending Acquisition and other developments, we may need to initiate additional restructuring actions that could result in workforce reductions and restructuring charges, which could be material.\nFinancial Risks\nOur substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, expose us to interest rate risk to the extent of our variable rate debt and prevent us from meeting our obligations with respect to our indebtedness.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had approximately $4.0 billion of indebtedness on a consolidated basis. See Note 6 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional details of our indebtedness. We had no outstanding loans under our revolving credit facility and approximately $463.1 million in borrowing capacity. Our ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility depends, in part, on inventory, accounts receivable and other assets that fluctuate from time to time and may further depend on lenders\u2019 discretionary ability to impose reserves and availability blocks.\nIn addition, we intend to finance the Pending Acquisition largely with the proceeds of additional indebtedness. On February 19, 2019 we issued $1.25 billion of 5.50% senior secured notes due 2024, $1.5 billion of 6.00% senior secured notes due 2026 and $1.0 billion of 8.25% senior unsecured notes due 2027 and priced the borrowing of $3.2 billion under a new senior secured term loan due 2026 with an interest rate of LIBOR plus 3.25%. The proceeds of the notes were placed into escrow and will be released upon consummation of the Pending Acquisition, and it is expected that the new senior secured term loan will be borrowed at closing of the Pending Acquisition. We expect to use a portion of the new senior secured term loan to pay off our existing senior secured term loan due December 2022. We also expect to enter into a new asset-based revolving credit facility in an amount of up to $1.0 billion, subject to borrowing base capacity. As such, as of December 31, 2018, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Pending Acquisition, we would have had approximately $10.5 billion of indebtedness on a consolidated basis. We expect to enter into certain hedging agreements to reduce our exposure to variable rate debt among other risks.\nOur substantial indebtedness could have important consequences. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, investments and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nrequire a substantial portion of our cash flows to be dedicated to debt service payments and reducing the amount of cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures, investments or acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nexpose us to the risk of increased interest rates as the interest cost on a significant portion of our indebtedness is subject to changes in interest rates (especially if our efforts to mitigate this risk through hedging agreements are unsuccessful);\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to certain of our competitors who have less debt;\n\u2022\nhinder our ability to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to secure adequate bank financing in the future with reasonable terms and conditions; and\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to and limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, a potential downturn in general economic conditions or in one or more of our businesses.\nOur variable rate indebtedness may use LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the rate. On July 27, 2017, the authority that regulates LIBOR announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. It is unclear whether new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, is considering replacing U.S. dollar LIBOR with a newly created index, calculated with a broad set of short-term repurchase agreements backed by treasury securities. It is not possible to predict the effect of these changes, other reforms or the establishment of alternative reference rates in the United Kingdom (U.K.), the U.S. or elsewhere.\nIn addition, the indentures and credit agreements governing our indebtedness contain affirmative and negative covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interests. Our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of our debt.\nDespite current indebtedness levels and restrictive covenants and future anticipated indebtedness and covenants as a result of the Pending Acquisition, we may still incur additional indebtedness that could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial financial leverage.\nWe may incur significant additional indebtedness in the future under the agreements governing our indebtedness. Although the indentures and the credit agreements governing our current indebtedness and our future indebtedness as a result of the Pending Acquisition contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of thresholds, qualifications and exceptions, and the additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. Additionally, these restrictions permit us to incur obligations that, although preferential to our common stock in terms of payment, do not constitute indebtedness.\nTo service our indebtedness, we will require a significant amount of cash and our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control.\nOur operations are conducted through our global subsidiaries and our ability to make cash payments on our indebtedness will depend on the earnings and the distribution of funds from our subsidiaries. Certain of our subsidiaries may have limitations or restrictions on paying dividends and otherwise transferring funds to us. Our ability to make cash payments on and to refinance our indebtedness will depend upon our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. We might not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities or transfer sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness.\nIf we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or are otherwise unable to obtain funds necessary to meet required payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness or if we fail to comply with the various covenants in the instruments governing our indebtedness and we are unable to obtain waivers from the required lenders, we could be in default under the terms of the agreements governing such indebtedness. In the event of such default, the holders of our indebtedness could elect to declare all the funds borrowed to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest. The lenders under our revolving credit facility could elect to terminate their commitments, cease making further loans and institute foreclosure proceedings against our assets. As a result, we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nWe may need to recognize additional impairment charges related to goodwill, identified intangible assets and fixed assets.\nWe have substantial balances of goodwill, identified intangible assets and fixed assets. We are required to test goodwill for possible impairment on the same date each year and on an interim basis if there are indicators of a possible impairment. We are also required to evaluate identified intangible assets and fixed assets for impairment if there are indicators of a possible impairment.\nIn the past, due to revisions in financial performance outlooks or deterioration in certain markets, we have recognized significant impairment charges on our goodwill, identified intangible assets and fixed assets. In the future, we may determine, again, that one or more of our long-lived assets is impaired and additional impairment charges may be recognized that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAs a result of the Pending Acquisition, we expect our goodwill, identified intangible assets and fixed asset balances to increase significantly, which will compound our risk of impairments and any resulting adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may experience significant variability in our quarterly or annual effective income tax rate.\nWe have a large and complex international tax profile and a significant level of foreign tax credit carryforwards in the U.S. and other carryforwards in various jurisdictions. Variability in the mix and profitability of domestic and international activities, identification and resolution of various tax uncertainties and the inability to realize foreign tax credits and other carryforwards included in deferred tax assets, among other matters, have impacted our effective income tax rate in the past and may impact our effective income tax rate in the future. Tax law changes in the U.S. and certain other countries have also impacted our effective income tax rate in the past and may impact our effective tax rate in the future. A significant increase in our quarterly or annual effective income tax rate could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nWe are commonly audited by various tax authorities, and some jurisdictions, both in the U.S. and abroad, have become more aggressive in their approach to audits and their enforcement of their applicable tax laws. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our financial statements in the period or periods for which that determination is made and on our overall effective income tax rate.\nThere is a risk related to the Pending Acquisition that the Internal Revenue Service does not agree that ARRIS was a foreign corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes in pre-acquisition periods and we could be subject to substantial additional U.S. taxes. For U.K. tax purposes, ARRIS is expected to be treated as a U.K. tax resident, regardless of how they are treated in the U.S. Therefore, if ARRIS were treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we could be liable for both U.S. and U.K. taxes in pre-acquisition periods, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nLabor Related Risks\nWe may not be able to attract and retain key employees.\nOur business depends upon our continued ability to hire and retain key employees. Effective succession planning is important to our long-term success. We depend on our senior management team and other key employees for strategic success. Some of our key employees have retired, announced their decision to retire or are at or near retirement age. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution.\nKey employees include individuals in our sales force, operations management, engineers and skilled production workers at our operations around the world. Competition for skilled personnel and highly qualified managers in the industries in which we operate is intense. Our growth by acquisitions creates challenges in retaining employees as well. As the corporate culture evolves to incorporate new workforces, some employees may not find the new culture appealing. In addition, the pace of integration may cause retention issues with our workforce due to integration fatigue.\nAs our workforce ages and leaves the company, we are challenged to find and attract workers to replace them. As a practical matter, we will be required to draw from different generations in order to fill these positions. Workers from these different generations may be motivated by factors that are different from our current workforce, and we may have difficulty meeting the expectations of these workers. Difficulties in obtaining or retaining employees with the necessary management, technical and financial skills needed to achieve our business objectives may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLabor unrest could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAlthough none of our U.S. employees are represented by unions, a significant portion of our international employees are members of unions or subject to workers\u2019 councils or similar statutory arrangements. In addition, many of our direct and indirect customers and vendors have unionized workforces. Strikes, work stoppages or slowdowns experienced by us at our international locations or experienced by our customers or vendors could have a negative impact on us. Organizations responsible for manufacturing or shipping our products may also be impacted by labor disruptions. Any interruption in the delivery of our products and services could harm our reputation with our customers, reduce demand for our products and services, increase costs and have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe have obligations under our defined benefit employee benefit plans and may be required to make plan contributions in excess of current estimates.\nAt December 31, 2018, our net liability for pension and other postretirement benefits was $11.8 million (benefit obligations of $215.2 million and plan assets of $203.4 million). See Note 10 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Significant declines in the valuation of the assets and/or increases in the liabilities related to these obligations as a result of changes in actuarial estimates, asset performance, interest rates or benefit changes, among other assumptions, could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and/or results of operations.\nThe amounts and timing of the contributions we expect to make to our defined benefit plans reflect a number of actuarial estimates and other assumptions. The actual amounts and timing of these contributions may differ materially from those presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If we elect to terminate one or more of these plans and settle the obligation through the purchase of annuities or otherwise, we could incur a charge and/or be required to make additional contributions and such amounts could be material.\nInternational Risks\nOur significant international operations expose us to economic, political and other risks.\nWe have significant international sales, manufacturing and distribution operations. Our major international manufacturing and/or distribution facilities are located in Australia, Belgium, China, the Czech Republic, Germany, India, Ireland, Mexico, Singapore and the U.K. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, international sales represented approximately 44%, 46% and 46%, respectively, of our consolidated net sales. In general, our international sales have lower gross margin percentages than our domestic sales. To the extent international sales represent a greater percentage of our revenue, our overall gross margin percentages may decline.\nOur international sales, manufacturing and distribution operations are subject to the risks inherent in operating abroad, including, but not limited to, risks with respect to currency exchange rate fluctuations; economic and political destabilization; restrictive actions by foreign governments; wage inflation; nationalizations; the laws and policies of the U.S affecting trade, anti-bribery, foreign investment and loans; foreign tax laws, including the ability to recover amounts paid as value-added and similar taxes; potential restrictions on the repatriation of cash; reduced protection of intellectual property; longer customer payment cycles; compliance with local laws and regulations; armed conflict; regional violence; terrorism; shipping interruptions; and major health concerns (such as infectious diseases). A significant portion of our products sold in the U.S. are manufactured outside the U.S. We utilize lower-cost geographies for high labor content products while investing in largely automated plants in higher-cost regions close to customers. Most of our manufacturing employees are located in lower-cost geographies such as Mexico, China, India and the Czech Republic. To the extent there are changes in U.S. trade policies, such as significant increases in tariffs or duties for goods brought into the U.S., our competitive position may be adversely impacted and the resulting effect on our earnings could be material.\nIn June 2016, the U.K. held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the European Union (E.U.), commonly referred to as Brexit. As a result of the referendum, the British government began negotiating the terms of the U.K.\u2019s future relationship with the E.U. in March 2017 with a deadline of March 29, 2019 to complete the negotiations. Although it is still unclear what those terms will be or even if a deal will be reached, it is possible that there will be greater restrictions on imports and exports between the U.K. and E.U. countries and increased regulatory complexities. These changes could cause disruptions to and create uncertainty surrounding our business and the business of existing and future customers and suppliers as well as have an impact on our employees based in Europe, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks related to fluctuations in foreign currency rates can impact our sales, results of operations, cash flows and financial position. Our foreign currency risk exposure is mainly concentrated in Chinese yuan, euro, Czech koruna, Australian dollar, Indian rupee, Mexican peso and Brazilian real. We manage our foreign currency rate risks through regular operating and financing activities and use derivative financial instruments such as foreign exchange forward contracts. There can be no assurance that our risk management strategies will be effective or that the counterparties to our derivative contracts will be able to perform. In addition, foreign currency rates in many of the countries in which we operate have at times been extremely volatile and unpredictable. We may choose not to hedge or determine we are unable to effectively hedge the risks associated with this volatility. In such cases, we may experience declines in sales and adverse impacts on earnings and such changes could be material.\nAdditional tariffs or a global trade war could increase the cost of our products, which could adversely impact the competitiveness of our products.\nDuring 2018, the U.S. administration announced tariffs on certain products imported into the U.S., which has resulted in reciprocal tariffs from other countries, including countries where we operate. The U.S. has renegotiated the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada. The renegotiated agreement remains subject to ratification by the U.S. Congress and by the governments of Mexico and Canada, and the prospects for and timing of approval are uncertain. Note: to confirm status prior to filing.\nThese developments have created uncertainty about the future relationship between the U.S. and certain of its trading partners and may reduce global trade and trade between the U.S. and other nations, including countries in which we currently operate. Changes in policy or continued uncertainty could depress economic activity and restrict our access to suppliers or customers. We have significant international manufacturing operations, particularly in China and Mexico. The tariffs implemented on our products (or on materials, parts or components we use to manufacture our products) by the U.S. will increase the cost of our products manufactured and imported into the U.S. Tariffs and other trade restrictions announced by other countries on products manufactured in the U.S. could likewise increase the costs of those products when imported into other countries. If additional tariffs or trade restrictions are implemented on our products (or on materials, parts or components we use to manufacture our products) by the U.S. or other countries, the cost of our products manufactured in China, Mexico or other countries and imported into the U.S. or other countries could increase further. These cost increases could adversely affect the demand for our products and/or reduce margins, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and our earnings.\nOur international operations expose us to increased challenges in complying with anti-corruption laws and regulations of the U.S. government and various other international jurisdictions.\nWe are required to comply with the laws and regulations of the U.S. government and various other international jurisdictions, and our failure to comply with these rules and regulations may expose us to significant liabilities. These laws and regulations may apply to companies, individual directors, officers, employees and agents, and may restrict our operations, trade practices, investment decisions and partnering activities. In particular, we are subject to U.S. and foreign anti-corruption laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and the U.K. Anti-Bribery Act. Violations of these legal requirements are punishable by criminal fines and imprisonment, civil penalties, disgorgement of profits, injunctions, debarment from government contracts as well as other remedial measures. While we have established policies and procedures designed to assist us and our personnel in complying with applicable U.S. and international laws and regulations, our employees, subcontractors or channel partners could take actions that violate these requirements. In addition, some of the international jurisdictions in which we operate have elevated levels of corruption. As a result, we are exposed to an increased risk of violating anti-corruption laws. Violation of anti-corruption laws could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and such effects could be material.\nWe are subject to governmental export and import controls that could subject us to liability or impair our ability to compete in international markets.\nCertain of our products, including purchased components of such products, are subject to export controls and may be exported only with the required export license or through an export license exception. In addition, we are required to comply with certain U.S. and foreign import and customs rules, sanctions and embargos. If we were to fail to comply with applicable export licensing, customs regulations, economic sanctions and other laws, we could be subject to substantial civil and criminal penalties, including fines, the incarceration of responsible employees and managers, and the possible loss of export or import privileges. In addition, if our distributors fail to obtain appropriate import, export or re-export licenses or permits, we may also be adversely affected through reputational harm and penalties. Obtaining the necessary export license for a particular sale may be time-consuming and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities. Furthermore, export control laws and economic sanctions prohibit the shipment of certain products to embargoed or sanctioned countries, governments and persons. While we train our employees to comply with these regulations, we cannot assure that a violation will not occur, whether knowingly or inadvertently. Any such shipment could have negative consequences including government investigations, penalties, fines, civil and criminal sanctions, and reputational harm. Any change in export or import regulations, economic sanctions or related legislation, shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations, or change in the countries, governments, persons or technologies targeted by such regulations, could result in our decreased ability to export, import or sell our products to existing or potential customers, particularly those with international operations. Any decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability to export, import or sell our products could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and such effects could be material.\nLitigation and Regulatory Risks\nWe may incur costs and may not be successful in protecting our intellectual property and in defending claims that we are infringing on the intellectual property of others.\nWe may encounter difficulties and significant costs in protecting our intellectual property rights or obtaining rights to additional intellectual property to permit us to continue or expand our business. Other companies, including some of our largest competitors, hold intellectual property rights in our industry and the intellectual property rights of others could inhibit our ability to introduce new products unless we secure necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms.\nIn the past, we have initiated litigation in order to enforce patents issued or licensed to us or to determine the scope and/or validity of a third party\u2019s patent or other proprietary rights and we may initiate similar litigation in the future. We also have been and may in the future be subject to lawsuits by third parties seeking to enforce their own intellectual property rights, including against certain of the products or intellectual property that we have acquired through acquisitions. Any such litigation, regardless of outcome, could be costly and could subject us to significant liabilities or require us to cease using proprietary third party technology and, consequently, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Such litigation can also be a significant distraction to management.\nIn certain markets, we may be required to address counterfeit versions of our products. We may incur significant costs in pursuing the originators of such counterfeit products and, if we are unsuccessful in eliminating them from the market, we may experience a reduction in the value of our products and/or a reduction in our net sales.\nCompliance with current and future environmental laws and potential environmental liabilities may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations governing, among other things, discharges to air and water, management of regulated materials, handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste, and investigation and remediation of contaminated sites. In addition, we are subject to laws and regulations regarding the types of substances allowable in certain of our products and the handling of our products at the end of their useful life. Because of the nature of our business, we have incurred and will continue to incur costs relating to compliance with or liability under these environmental laws and regulations and these costs could be material. In addition, new laws and regulations, new or different interpretations of existing laws and regulations, expansion of existing legal requirements related to our products, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new remediation or discharge requirements, could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nEfforts to regulate emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs), such as carbon dioxide, are underway in the U.S. and other countries which could increase the cost of raw materials, production processes and transportation of our products. If we are unable to comply with such regulations or sufficiently increase prices or otherwise reduce costs to offset the increased costs of compliance, GHG regulation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nCertain environmental laws impose strict and, in some circumstances, joint and several liability on current or former owners or operators of a contaminated property, as well as companies that generated, disposed of or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances at a contaminated property, for the costs of investigation and remediation of the contaminated property. Our present and past facilities have been in operation for many years and over that time, in the course of those operations, hazardous substances and wastes have been used, generated and occasionally disposed of at such facilities, and we have disposed of waste products either directly or through third parties at numerous disposal sites. Consequently, it has been necessary to undertake investigation and remediation projects at certain sites and we have been and may in the future be held responsible for a portion of the investigation and clean-up costs at these sites and our share of those costs may be material.\nCommon Stock Ownership Risks\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock and, consequently, the ability of investors to achieve a return on their investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.\nWe do not intend to declare and pay dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. The payment of future dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors; however, the indentures and the credit agreements governing our indebtedness place limitations on our ability to pay dividends. We currently intend to invest our future earnings, if any, to fund our growth and reduce our debt and our Board of Directors may choose to provide returns to our stockholders through share repurchases. The success of an investment in our common stock will largely depend upon future appreciation in value, and there can be no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and, as a result, depress the trading price of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous. These provisions:\n\u2022\nauthorize 1,300,000,000 shares of common stock, which, to the extent unissued, could be issued by the Board of Directors, without stockholder approval, to increase the number of outstanding shares and to discourage a takeover attempt;\n\u2022\nauthorize the issuance, without stockholder approval, of blank check preferred stock that our Board of Directors could issue to increase the number of outstanding shares and to discourage a takeover attempt;\n\u2022\ngrant to the Board of Directors the sole power to set the number of directors and to fill any vacancy on the Board of Directors;\n\u2022\nlimit the ability of stockholders to remove directors only \u201cfor cause\u201d and require any such removal to be approved by holders of at least three-quarters of the outstanding shares of common stock;\n\u2022\nprohibit our stockholders from calling a special meeting of stockholders;\n\u2022\nprohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022\nprovide that the Board of Directors is expressly authorized to adopt, or to alter or repeal our bylaws;\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice and certain information requirements for nominations for election to our Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\nestablish a classified Board of Directors, with three staggered terms; and\n\u2022\nrequire the approval of holders of at least three-quarters of the outstanding shares of common stock to amend the bylaws and certain provisions of the certificate of incorporation.\nThese anti-takeover defenses could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company and may prevent our stockholders from receiving the benefit from any premium to the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a takeover context. Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if the provisions are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for our stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and cause us to take corporate actions other than those our stockholders may desire.\nOur business could be negatively impacted as a result of actions by activist stockholders or others.\nStockholder activism has been increasing in publicly traded companies in recent years and we are subject to the risks associated with such activism, particularly due to the recent decline in our stock price. Our business could be negatively affected as a result of stockholder activism, which could cause us to incur significant legal fees and other costs, hinder execution of our business strategy and impact the trading value of our securities. Additionally, stockholder activism could give rise to perceived uncertainties as to our future direction, adversely affect our relationships with key executives and business partners and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified employees. Any of these impacts could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.", "PERMNO": 14239, "SIC": 3663, "TIC": "COMM"}
