{"cik": "784977", "company": "PORTLAND GENERAL ELECTRIC CO /OR/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-17", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nWhen evaluating PGE and any investment in its securities, investors should consider carefully the following risk factors and all other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These risk factors could have a material impact on PGE\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows, or that materially adversely affect PGE\u2019s actual results and cause such results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by the Company or on its behalf. PGE may also be harmed by risk and uncertainties not currently known to the Company or that are currently deemed to be immaterial. If any of these risks occur, PGE\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, and/or cash flows could be materially adversely affected, and the trading prices of the Company\u2019s securities could substantially decline. These risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in the other documents that the Company files from time to time with the SEC.\nREGULATORY, LEGAL, AND COMPLIANCE RISKS\nPGE is subject to extensive regulation that affects the Company\u2019s operations and costs.\nPGE is subject to regulation by the FERC, the OPUC, and by certain federal, state, and local authorities under environmental and other laws. Such regulation significantly influences the Company\u2019s operating environment and can have an effect on many aspects of its business. Changes to regulations are ongoing, and the Company cannot predict with certainty the future course of such changes or the ultimate affect that they might have on its business. However, changes in regulations could delay or adversely affect business planning and transactions, and substantially increase the Company\u2019s costs.\nRecovery of PGE\u2019s costs is subject to regulatory review and approval, and the inability to recover costs may adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe prices that PGE charges for its retail services, as authorized by the OPUC, are a major factor in determining the Company\u2019s operating income, financial position, liquidity, and credit ratings. As a general matter, PGE seeks to recover in customer prices most of the costs incurred in connection with the operation of its business, including, among other things, costs related to capital projects (such as the construction of new facilities or the modification of existing facilities), the costs of compliance with legislative and regulatory requirements, and the costs of damage from storms and other natural disasters. However, there can be no assurance that such recovery will be granted. The OPUC has the authority to disallow the recovery of any costs that it considers imprudently incurred. Although the OPUC is required to establish customer prices that are fair, just and reasonable, it has significant discretion in the interpretation of this standard.\nPGE attempts to manage its costs at levels consistent with the OPUC approved prices. However, if the Company is unable to do so, or if such cost management results in increased operational risk, the Company\u2019s financial and operating results could be adversely affected.\nPGE is subject to various legal and regulatory proceedings, the outcome of which is uncertain, and resolution unfavorable to PGE could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.\nIn the normal course of its business, PGE is subject to various regulatory proceedings, lawsuits, claims, and other matters, which could result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions, or other relief. Such matters include, but are not limited to, governmental policies, legislative action, and regulatory audits, investigations, and actions, including those of the FERC and OPUC with respect to allowed rates of return, financings, electricity pricing and price structures, acquisition and disposal of facilities and other assets, construction and operation of plant facilities, transmission of electricity, recovery of power costs, operating expenses, deferrals, timely recovery of costs and capital investments, and current or prospective wholesale and retail competition. These matters are subject to many uncertainties, the ultimate outcome of which management cannot predict. The final resolution of certain matters in which PGE is involved could result in disallowance of operating expenses previously deferred or could require that the Company incur expenditures over an extended period of time and in a range of amounts that could have an adverse effect on its cash flows and results of operations. Similarly, the terms of resolution could require the Company to change its business practices and procedures, which could also have an adverse effect on its cash flows, financial position, or results of operations.\nThere are certain pending legal and regulatory proceedings that may have an adverse effect on results of operations and cash flows for future reporting periods. For additional information, see Item 3.-\u201cLegal Proceedings,\u201d Regulatory Matters within the \u201cOverview\u201d of Item 7.- \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d and Note 19, Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.-\u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nCompliance with environmental laws and regulations may result in capital expenditures, increased operating costs and various liabilities, and have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nPGE is subject to various environmental laws, regulations, and other standards including, but not limited to, federal, state and local environmental statutes, rules and regulations relating to air quality, water quality and usage, soil quality, emissions of greenhouse gases, including, but not limited to, carbon dioxide, waste management, hazardous wastes, fish, avian and other wildlife mortality and habitat protection, historical artifact preservation, natural resources, health, and safety. Compliance with such laws and regulations could, among other things, prevent or delay the development of power generation and transmission and distribution facilities, restrict output of facilities, limit the use of some fuels required for power generation, require additional pollution control equipment, investment in non-emitting resources, and otherwise increase costs, and increase capital expenditures.\nThere are significant capital, operating and other costs associated with compliance with these laws and regulations, and violations of these laws and regulations could potentially result in significant civil fines, criminal penalties, and other sanctions. There is no assurance that the OPUC will grant PGE complete recovery of such costs, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nFuture laws and regulations could mandate new or additional GHG emissions reductions that could lead to increased capital and operating costs and have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nFuture legislation or regulations could result in limitations on GHG emissions from the Company\u2019s fossil fuel-fired generation facilities. Compliance with any new or additional GHG emissions reduction requirements could require PGE to incur significant expenditures, including those related to carbon capture and sequestration technology, purchase of emission allowances and offsets, fuel switching, and the replacement of high-emitting generation facilities with non-emitting facilities.\nThe cost to comply with potential GHG emissions reduction requirements is subject to significant uncertainties, including those related to: i) the timing of the implementation of emissions reduction rules; ii) required levels of emissions reductions; iii) requirements with respect to the allocation of emissions allowances; iv) the maturation, regulation, and commercialization of carbon capture, sequestration, and storage technology; and v) PGE\u2019s compliance alternatives. Although the Company cannot currently estimate the effect of future laws and regulations on its results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows, the costs of compliance with such legislation or regulations could be material. There is no assurance that the OPUC will grant PGE complete recovery of such costs, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nOperational changes required to comply with both existing and new environmental laws related to fish and wildlife could adversely affect PGE\u2019s results of operations.\nA portion of PGE\u2019s total system load is supplied with power generated from hydroelectric and wind generating resources. Operation of these facilities is subject to regulation related to the protection of fish and wildlife. The listing of various plants and species of fish, birds, and other wildlife as threatened or endangered has resulted in significant operational changes to these projects. Salmon recovery plans could include further major operational changes to the region\u2019s hydroelectric projects, including those owned by PGE and those from which the Company purchases power under long-term contracts. In addition, laws relating to the protection of migratory birds and other wildlife could impact the development and operation of transmission and distribution lines and wind projects. Also, new interpretations of existing laws and regulations could be adopted or become applicable to such facilities, which could further increase required expenditures for salmon recovery and endangered species protection and reduce the availability of hydroelectric or wind generating resources to meet the Company\u2019s energy requirements.\nThe construction of new facilities and the modifications or replacements of existing facilities, is subject to risks that could result in the disallowance of certain costs for recovery in customer prices or higher operating costs.\nPGE supplements its own generation with wholesale power purchases to meet its retail load requirement. In addition, long-term increases in both the number of customers and demand for energy will require continued expansion and upgrade of PGE\u2019s generation, transmission, and distribution systems. Construction of new facilities and modifications or replacements of existing facilities could be affected by various factors, such as unanticipated delays and cost increases including, but not limited to, supply chain disruption and cost inflation, failure of counterparties to perform under agreements, the failure to obtain, or delay in obtaining, necessary permits from state or federal agencies or tribal entities, which could result in failure to complete the projects, or the abandonment of capital projects, all of which could result in the disallowance of certain costs in the rate determination process. In addition, failure to complete construction projects according to specifications could result in reduced plant efficiency, equipment failure, and plant performance that falls below expected levels, which could increase operating costs.\nECONOMIC, FINANCIAL, AND MARKET RISKS\nEconomic conditions that result in reduced demand for electricity and could impair the financial stability of PGE\u2019s customers could affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nUnfavorable economic conditions in Oregon may result in reduced demand for electricity. Such reductions in demand could adversely affect PGE\u2019s results of operations and cash flows. Economic conditions could also result in an increased level of uncollectible customer accounts and cause the Company\u2019s vendors and service providers to experience cash flow problems and be unable to perform under existing or future contracts.\nCapital and credit market conditions could adversely affect the Company\u2019s access to capital, cost of capital, and ability to execute its strategic plan.\nAccess to capital and credit markets is important to PGE\u2019s ability to operate. The Company expects to issue debt and equity securities, as necessary, to fund its future capital requirements. Volatility of interest rates could negatively impact PGE\u2019s cost of debt and results of operations. In addition, contractual commitments and regulatory requirements may limit the Company\u2019s ability to delay or terminate certain projects.\nIf the capital and credit market conditions in the United States and other parts of the world deteriorate, the Company\u2019s future cost of debt and equity capital, as well as access to capital markets, could be adversely affected. In addition, restrictions on PGE\u2019s ability to access capital markets could affect its ability to execute its strategic plan.\nAdverse changes in PGE\u2019s credit ratings could negatively affect its access to the capital markets and its cost of borrowed funds.\nAccess to capital markets is important to PGE\u2019s ability to operate its business and complete its capital projects. Credit rating agencies evaluate the Company\u2019s credit ratings on a periodic basis and when certain events occur. A ratings downgrade could increase fees on PGE\u2019s syndicated unsecured revolving credit facility, commercial paper program, and letter of credit facilities, increasing the cost of funding day-to-day working capital requirements, and could also result in higher interest rates on future long-term debt. A ratings downgrade could also restrict the Company\u2019s access to the commercial paper market, a principal source of short-term financing, or result in higher interest costs.\nIn addition, if Moody\u2019s Investors Service (Moody\u2019s) and/or S&P Global Ratings (S&P) reduce their rating on PGE\u2019s unsecured debt to below investment grade, the Company could be subject to requests by certain wholesale counterparties to post additional performance assurance collateral, which could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s liquidity and ability to participate in the wholesale markets.\nUnder certain circumstances, banks participating in PGE\u2019s syndicated unsecured revolving credit facility could decline to fund advances requested by the Company or could withdraw from participation in the credit facility.\nPGE currently has a syndicated unsecured revolving credit facility with several banks for an aggregate amount of $650 million. The revolving credit facility provides a primary source of liquidity and may be used to supplement operating cash flow and as backup for commercial paper borrowings. The revolving credit facility represents commitments by the participating banks to make loans and, in certain cases, to issue letters of credit. The Company is required to make certain representations to the banks each time it requests an advance under the credit facility. However, in the event certain circumstances occur that could result in a material adverse change in the business, financial condition, or results of operations of PGE, the Company may not be able to make such representations, in which case the banks would not be required to lend. PGE is also subject to the risk that one or more of the participating banks may default on their obligation to make loans under the credit facility.\nAdverse capital market performance could result in reductions in the fair value of benefit plan assets and increase the Company\u2019s liabilities related to such plans. Sustained declines in the fair value of the plans\u2019 assets could result in significant increases in funding requirements, which could adversely affect PGE\u2019s liquidity and results of operations.\nPerformance of the capital markets affects the value of assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under PGE\u2019s defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans. Sustained adverse market performance could result in lower rates of return for these assets than projected by the Company and could increase PGE\u2019s funding requirements related to the plans. Additionally, changes in interest rates affect PGE\u2019s liabilities under the plans. As interest rates decrease, the Company\u2019s liabilities increase, potentially requiring additional funding.\nPerformance of the capital markets also affects the fair value of assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under the Company\u2019s non-qualified employee benefit plans, which include deferred compensation plans. As changes in the fair value of these assets are recorded in current earnings, decreases can adversely affect the Company\u2019s operating results. In addition, such decreases can require that PGE make additional payments to satisfy its obligations under these plans.\nMarket prices for power and natural gas are subject to forces that are often not predictable and that can result in price volatility and general market disruption, adversely affecting PGE\u2019s costs and ability to manage its energy portfolio and procure required energy supply, which ultimately could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s liquidity and results of operations.\nAs part of its normal business operations, PGE purchases and sells power and natural gas in the open market under short- and long-term contracts, which may specify variable prices or volumes. Market prices for power and natural gas are influenced primarily by factors related to supply and demand. These factors generally include the adequacy of generating capacity, scheduled and unscheduled outages of generating facilities, hydroelectric and wind generation levels, prices and availability of fuel sources for generation, disruptions or constraints to transmission facilities, weather conditions, economic growth, and changes in technology.\nVolatility in these markets can affect the availability, price, and demand for power and natural gas. Disruption in power and natural gas markets could result in a deterioration of market liquidity, increase the risk of counterparty default, affect regulatory and legislative processes in unpredictable ways, affect wholesale power prices, and impair PGE\u2019s ability to manage its energy portfolio. Changes in power and natural gas prices can also affect the fair value of derivative instruments and cash requirements to purchase power and natural gas. If power and natural gas prices decrease from those contained in the Company\u2019s existing purchased power and natural gas agreements, PGE may be required to provide increased collateral, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s liquidity. Conversely, if power and natural gas prices rise, especially during periods when the Company requires greater-than-expected volumes that must be purchased at market or short-term prices, PGE could incur greater costs than originally estimated.\nThe risk of volatility in power costs is partially mitigated through the AUT and the PCAM. Application of the PCAM requires that PGE absorb certain power cost increases before the Company is allowed to recover any amount from customers. Accordingly, the PCAM is expected to only partially mitigate the potentially adverse financial impacts of forced generating plant outages, reduced hydro and wind availability, interruptions in fuel supplies, and volatile wholesale energy prices.\nRapidly changing stakeholder expectations and standards with respect to PGE\u2019s environmental, social, and governance (ESG) programs could result in increased costs and exposure to incremental risk.\nInvestors, lenders, rating agencies, customers, regulators, employees, and other stakeholders are increasing their focus on evaluating companies as corporate citizens based on their ESG programs and metrics. Based on PGE\u2019s ESG profile, investors and lenders may elect to increase their required returns on capital offered to the Company, reallocate capital, or not commit capital as a result of their assessment of the Company\u2019s ESG profile. Such actions by investors and lenders could increase PGE\u2019s cost of, or access to, capital and financing.\nPGE is committed to the success of its ESG programs; however, if the Company fails to adapt or execute on its ESG strategies, or is perceived to have failed in addressing stakeholder ESG expectations or standards, which continue to evolve, PGE may suffer reputational damage which could have a material and adverse effect on its business, results of operations, and financial condition. Additionally, the cost of implementing and complying with such ESG programs could be material.\nActions of activist shareholders could have a negative impact on PGE\u2019s business.\nActions of activist shareholders, which can take many forms and arise in a variety of situations, could include engaging in proxy solicitations, advancing shareholder proposals, or otherwise attempting to effect changes and assert influence on the Company\u2019s board of directors and management. Dealing with such actions could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s and the Company\u2019s board\u2019s attention and resources from PGE\u2019s business and execution of its strategy.\nSuch shareholder activism could give rise to perceived uncertainties regarding PGE\u2019s future, adversely affecting PGE\u2019s business opportunities, ability to access capital markets, relationships with its customers and employees, and make it more difficult to attract and retain a qualified workforce. Any such actions could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations and could cause significant fluctuations in the trading prices of its common stock based on market perceptions or other factors.\nBUSINESS AND OPERATIONAL RISKS\nThe spread of COVID-19 could have a material adverse effect on PGE\u2019s business.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted economic activity and conditions worldwide. Measures to control the spread of COVID-19 have affected the demand for the products and services of many businesses in PGE\u2019s service territory and disrupted supply chains around the world. Due to COVID-19, PGE has observed an increase in past due accounts and late customer payments resulting in incremental bad debt expense that has been deferred pursuant to the OPUC\u2019s COVID-19 deferral. PGE has also observed a change in the trend of customer demand with an increase in residential usage as customers stay at home and a decrease in commercial usage due to COVID-19 related closures or restrictions and economic conditions. Although these trends have not had a material impact on the Company to date, management believes that these trends will continue and the full scope and extent of the impacts of COVID-19 on the Company\u2019s operations remains uncertain and depends on multiple variables. PGE continues to monitor the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on its workforce, liquidity, capital markets, reliability, cybersecurity, customers, and suppliers, along with overall macroeconomic conditions. Although the Company cannot predict with certainty the full extent of the COVID-19 pandemic\u2019s impact on its business, a protracted slowdown of broad sectors of the economy, changes in demand for commodities, or significant changes in legislation or regulatory policy to address the COVID-19 pandemic could ultimately result in a significant reduction in demand for electricity in PGE\u2019s service territory, increased late customer payments or uncollectible accounts, and the inability of the Company\u2019s contractors, suppliers, and other business partners to fulfill their contractual obligations, any of which could have, or continue to have, a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nGovernment imposed COVID-19 vaccine mandates could have a material adverse effect on PGE\u2019s business.\nOn September 9, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order requiring all employers with U.S. government contracts to ensure that their U.S.-based employees, contractors and subcontractors, that work on or in support of U.S. government contracts, are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 as required by the executive order. The executive order includes on-site and remote U.S.-based employees, contractors, and subcontractors and provides for limited medical and religious exceptions.\nIn addition, on September 9, 2021, President Biden announced that he has directed Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to develop an Emergency Temporary Standard (ETS) mandating either the full vaccination against COVID-19 or weekly testing of employees for employers with 100 or more employees. The executive order was challenged in the courts, and on January 13, 2022, the United States Supreme Court held that OSHA\u2019s ETS exceeded its authority, and issued a stay on enforcement of the ETS mandate for large private employers. On January 25, 2022, OSHA issued an announcement it would withdraw the vaccination and testing ETS that was issued on November 5, 2021.\nAlthough the ETS mandate was withdrawn by OSHA, it is currently not possible to predict with certainty the impact future potential mandates will have on PGE\u2019s workforce. Additional vaccine mandates may be announced in jurisdictions in which the Company operates. PGE\u2019s implementation of these requirements may result in attrition, including attrition of critically skilled labor, and difficulty securing future labor needs, which could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nChanges in tax laws may have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nPGE makes judgments and interpretations about the application of tax law when determining the provision for taxes. Such judgments include the timing and probability of recognition of income, deductions, and tax credits, which are subject to challenge by taxing authorities. Additionally, treatment of tax benefits and costs for ratemaking purposes could be different than what the Company anticipates or requests from the state regulatory commission, which could have a negative effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nPGE owns and operates wind generating facilities, which generate federal production tax credits (PTCs) that PGE uses to reduce its federal tax obligations. The amount of PTCs earned depends on the level of electricity output generated and the applicable tax credit rate. A variety of operating and economic parameters, including adverse weather conditions and equipment reliability, could significantly reduce the PTCs generated by the Company\u2019s wind facilities resulting in a material adverse impact on PGE\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. These PTCs generate tax credit carryforwards that the Company plans to utilize in the future to reduce income tax obligations. If PGE cannot generate enough taxable income in the future to utilize all of the tax credit carryforwards before the credits expire, the Company may incur material charges to earnings.\nThe effects of unseasonable or extreme weather and other natural phenomena can adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations, and the effects of climate change could result in more intense, frequent, and extreme weather events.\nWeather conditions can adversely affect PGE\u2019s revenues and costs, impacting the Company\u2019s results of operations. Variations in temperatures can affect customer demand for electricity, with warmer-than-normal winter seasons or cooler-than-normal summer seasons reducing the demand for energy. Weather conditions are the dominant cause of usage variations from normal seasonal patterns, particularly for residential customers. Rapid increases in load requirements resulting from unexpected weather changes, particularly if coupled with transmission constraints, could adversely impact PGE\u2019s cost and ability to meet the energy needs of its customers. Conversely, rapid decreases in load requirements could result in the sale of excess energy at depressed market prices.\nChanges in the global and local climate could result in more intense, frequent, and extreme weather events such as ice and snowstorms, flooding, changes in regional rainfall and snowpack levels, high heat events, drought conditions, and increased risk of wildfires and can disrupt energy delivery, cause power outages, and damage the Company\u2019s facilities and transmission and distribution system. Such events could result in a reduction in revenue and an increase in additional costs to restore service, repair facilities, purchase power and fuel to serve PGE load, and procure insurance related to such impacts. In response to more intense, frequent, and extreme weather events, PGE may need to make additional investments in generation, transmission, and distribution assets in order to enhance reliability and resiliency.\nThe greater size and prevalence of wildfires in Oregon in recent years could negatively affect public safety, customers\u2019 demand for power and PGE\u2019s ability and cost to procure adequate power and fuel supplies to serve its customers, PGE\u2019s ability to access the wholesale energy market, PGE\u2019s ability to operate its generating facilities and transmission and distribution systems, the Company\u2019s costs to maintain, repair, and replace such facilities and systems, and recovery of costs. In addition, there is a risk that PGE may be unable to effectively implement a public safety power shutoff (PSPS) and de-energize its system in the event of heightened wildfire risk, which could lead to potential liability if energized systems are determined to be the cause of wildfires that result in harm.\nCapital investment and operating expenses related to this risk may not be recoverable.\nReduced river flows can adversely affect generation from hydroelectric resources and unfavorable wind conditions can similarly affect wind generating resources. The Company could be required to replace energy expected from these sources with higher cost power from other facilities or with wholesale market purchases, which could have an adverse effect on results of operations.\nPGE derives a significant portion of its power supply from its own hydroelectric facilities and through long-term purchase contracts with certain public utility districts in the state of Washington. Regional rainfall and snowpack levels affect river flows and the resulting amount of energy generated by these facilities. Shortfalls in energy expected from lower cost hydroelectric generating resources would require increased energy from the Company\u2019s other generating resources and/or power purchases in the wholesale market, which could have an adverse effect on results of operations.\nPGE also derives a portion of its power supply from wind generating resources, for which the output is dependent upon wind conditions. Unfavorable wind conditions could require increased reliance on power from the Company\u2019s thermal generating resources or power purchases in the wholesale market, both of which could have an adverse effect on results of operations.\nAlthough the application of the PCAM could help mitigate adverse financial effects from any decrease in power provided by hydroelectric and wind generating resources, full recovery of any increase in power costs is not assured. Inability to fully recover such costs in future prices could have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations, as well as a reduction in renewable energy credits and loss of PTCs related to wind generating resources.\nThe capacity provided by the Company\u2019s generating resources and third-party purchased power may not be sufficient to meet its customers\u2019 energy demand requirements.\nPGE meets its customers\u2019 energy demand requirements based on capacity obtained from its generating facilities and third-party power purchase agreements. The Company continuously evaluates how much capacity it will need to meet reasonably expected demands of customers and provide reasonable reserves. PGE is also required to file Integrated Resource Plans with the OPUC that detail the Company\u2019s plan to meet the future energy and capacity needs of its customers through a least-cost, least-risk combination of energy generation and demand reduction, while also aggressively reducing GHG emissions from the power supply. If the capacity provided by the Company\u2019s generating facilities and purchased power is not adequate to meet customers\u2019 energy demands, PGE may be required to purchase more power from third parties, invest in acquiring additional generating or battery storage facilities, or invest in extending the operating life of existing generating assets. Any failure to obtain adequate capacity to meet customers\u2019 energy demand requirements could increase its costs and could negatively impact PGE\u2019s customer satisfaction, all of which could have an adverse impact on PGE\u2019s business and results of operations.\nNatural or human-caused disasters and other risks could damage the Company\u2019s facilities and disrupt delivery of electricity resulting in significant property loss, repair costs, and reduced customer satisfaction.\nPGE has exposure to natural or human-caused disasters and other risks, including, but not limited to, earthquake, flood, ice, drought, extreme heat, lightning, wind, fire, accidents, equipment failure, acts of terrorism, computer system outages and other events. Such events could disrupt PGE operations, damage PGE facilities and systems, interrupt the delivery of electricity, increase repair and service restoration expenses, reduce revenues, cause the release of harmful materials, cause fires, and subject the Company to liability. Such events, if repeated or prolonged, can also affect customer satisfaction and the level of regulatory oversight. As a regulated utility, the Company is required to provide service to all customers within its service territory and generally has been afforded liability protection against customer claims related to service failures beyond the Company\u2019s reasonable control.\nPGE could be vulnerable to cybersecurity attacks, data security breaches, physical security breaches, acts of terrorism, or other similar events that could disrupt its operations, require significant expenditures, or result in claims against the Company.\nIn the normal course of business, PGE collects, processes, and retains sensitive and confidential customer and employee information, as well as proprietary business information, and operates systems that directly impact the availability of electric power and the transmission of electric power in its service territory. PGE owns and operates generation, transmission, distribution, and other facilities that are deemed as critical infrastructure and depend on certain information technology systems. There is a risk that a goal of a cyber-attack is to cause large-scale disruption to the U.S. bulk power system or PGE operations and target the Company\u2019s computer systems, software, or networks to achieve such disruption. Despite the security measures in place, the Company\u2019s systems, and those of third-party service providers, could be vulnerable to cybersecurity attacks, data security breaches, physical security breaches, acts of terrorism, or other similar events that could disrupt operations, cause damage to the Company\u2019s generation, transmission, or distribution facilities, impact reliability of the transmission and distribution system, information technology systems, inhibit the capability of equipment or systems to function as designed or expected, prevent service to customers or collection of revenues, or result in the release of sensitive or confidential customer, employee, or Company information. Such events could cause a shutdown of service, expose PGE to liability, or cause reputational damage. In addition, the Company may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by security breaches. A breach of certain business systems could impact PGE\u2019s ability to initiate, authorize, process, record, and report financial information. PGE maintains insurance coverage against some, but not all, potential losses resulting from these risks. However, insurance may not be adequate to protect the Company against liability in all cases. In addition, PGE is subject to the risk that insurers will dispute or be unable to perform their obligations to the Company.\nForced outages at generating facilities and battery storage facilities, both PGE-owned or under purchased power agreements, can increase the cost of power required to serve customers because the cost of replacement power purchased in the wholesale market generally exceeds the Company\u2019s cost of generation.\nForced outages at generating facilities and battery storage facilities, both PGE-owned or under purchased power agreements, could result in power costs greater than those included in customer prices, in addition to increased repair and maintenance costs. As indicated above, application of the Company\u2019s PCAM could help mitigate adverse financial impacts of such outages; however, the cost sharing features of the mechanism do not provide full recovery in customer prices. Inability to recover such costs in future prices could have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nElectric utility operations may pose risk to public and workers\u2019 safety.\nThe operation of electric generation, transmission, and distribution infrastructure involves inherent risks, including breakdown or failure of equipment, fires involving the utility\u2019s equipment, dam failure at company-owned hydroelectric facilities, public and worker safety, human contact with energized equipment, and operator error. A portion of the Company\u2019s operations relies on Company-owned or third party owned natural gas transmission and distribution infrastructure and involves inherent risks, such as leaks, explosions, mechanical problems, and worker and public safety.\nThese risks could cause significant harm to workers and the public including loss of human life, significant damage to property, adverse impacts on the environment and impairment of PGE\u2019s operations, all of which could result in financial losses that would have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition. PGE is also required to comply with new and changing regulatory standards involving safety compliance. The cost to comply with such requirements could be significant, and failure to meet these regulatory standards could result in substantial fines.\nPGE\u2019s risk management procedures may not prevent or mitigate material losses.\nPGE has put in place risk management policies, procedures, and controls to identify, quantify, and manage risk, however, these systems, processes, tools, and controls may not prevent material losses. Risk management procedures may not always be followed as intended, may not operate as designed, or may not identify all potential risks, including, without limitation, employee misconduct. There is no assurance that PGE\u2019s risk management procedures will be effective in preventing or mitigating losses, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operation and financial condition.\nDevelopment of alternative technologies and changes in legislation and regulation may negatively impact the value of PGE\u2019s facilities.\nA basic premise of PGE\u2019s business as a vertically integrated utility is the ability to produce electricity at competitive prices due to economies of scale. Furthermore, a key component of PGE\u2019s growth is its ability to construct, own, and operate facilities. Many companies and organizations conduct research and development activities to seek improvements in alternative technologies and distributed generation. New technologies could include fuel cells and micro turbines, wind turbines, photovoltaic solar cells, distributed generation, ongoing customer energy efficiency, two-way grid enabling customer-owned generation, and advances in batteries or energy storage. It is possible that advances in such technologies, or other current technologies, will reduce the cost of alternative methods of electricity production or storage to a level that is equal to or below that of existing methods.\nIt is also possible that alternative generation or storage resources are mandated, subsidized, or encouraged through legislation or regulation or otherwise are economically competitive and added to the available generation supply. Competitors may not be subject to the same operating, regulatory and financial requirements that the Company is, potentially causing a substantial competitive disadvantage for PGE. Changes in public policy, such as new tax incentives that PGE cannot take advantage of or efforts to deregulate the utility industry, could provide an advantage to competitors. Such alternative resources and regulatory or legislative actions could displace higher marginal cost generating units or make PGE less competitive in constructing, owning, and operating such facilities. Such a development could limit the Company\u2019s future growth opportunities and limit growth in demand for PGE\u2019s electric service.\nThe Company's ability to compete successfully depends heavily on its ability to ensure a continued and timely introduction of new products and new services to our customers as well as exploring new ways to further improve the reliability, efficiency, and flexibility of our power supply with innovative service offerings. Our operating results may be impacted if our products and services are not responsive to our customer needs or are burdened with significant regulatory complexities.\nA decrease in customer demand for electricity may negatively impact PGE\u2019s business.\nThe reduction in customer demand for electricity could reduce utility revenues or negatively impact customer load growth. Reduced customer demand could be impacted by PGE\u2019s ability to attract and retain customers, mandated energy efficiency measures, demand side management programs, potential formation of community choice aggregation programs, distributed generation resources and economic and demographic conditions, such as population changes, job and income growth, new construction, new business formation and the overall level of economic activity. Development, improvement, and adoption of technological advances could lead to declines in energy use per customer. Some or all of these factors, could impact the demand for electricity.\nThe decline in revenues due to decreased customer demand for electricity may increase customer prices for remaining customers, as PGE\u2019s revenue requirement is designed to cover its fixed utility operating expenses. Increased customer prices could further reduce customer demand for electricity and strain PGE\u2019s ability to attract and retain customers. The loss of customers, the inability to replace those customers with new customers, and the decrease in demand for electricity could negatively impact PGE\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe inability to attract and retain a qualified workforce and to maintain satisfactory collective bargaining agreements without prolonged labor disruptions, may adversely affect PGE\u2019s results of operations.\nPGE\u2019s workforce includes a diverse mix of skilled professional, managerial, and technical employees, including employees represented under collective bargaining agreements. Workforce management risks include the risk of retaining key employees, turnover due to demographic challenges as employees approach retirement age, and turnover due to macroeconomic trends such as voluntary resignation of large numbers of employees similar to that experienced by other employers and industries since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. PGE also faces competition from other employers for key skills and experience within the industry or local geography. The Company also faces the risk of labor disruption due to the outcomes of labor negotiations or the possibility that employees not currently subject to collective bargaining agreements may organize.\nChanges in market conditions and environmental laws and regulations could negatively impact PGE\u2019s non-utility real estate investments.\nPGE owns, through a wholly owned subsidiary, its corporate headquarters building located in Portland, Oregon. A significant change in real estate values could adversely affect PGE\u2019s results of operations.\nPGE also owns unregulated properties that are currently or previously leased to third parties and located adjacent to PGE\u2019s T.W. Sullivan hydro generating facility. PGE has recorded a non-utility asset retirement obligation (ARO) for this site related to assets that are no longer in service. Significant changes in estimates for this non-utility ARO due to changes in environmental laws or regulations could adversely affect PGE\u2019s results of operations.\nPGE\u2019s business activities are concentrated in one region and future performance may be affected by events and factors unique to Oregon or the region.\nThe Company\u2019s industry and geographic concentrations may increase exposure to risks arising from regional regulation or legislation, such as legislative action related to carbon emissions. These concentrations may also increase exposure to credit and operational risks due to counterparties, suppliers, and customers being similarly affected by changing conditions.", "PERMNO": 91204, "SIC": 4911, "TIC": "POR"}
