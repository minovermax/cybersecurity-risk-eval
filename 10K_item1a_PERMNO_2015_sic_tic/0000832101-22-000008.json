{"cik": "832101", "company": "IDEX CORP /DE/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-24", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nFor an enterprise as diverse and complex as the Company, a wide range of factors present risks to the Company and could materially affect future developments and performance. In addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in connection with the description of the Company\u2019s operations and the financial results of its operations elsewhere in this report, the most material of these factors are included below. Current global economic events and conditions may amplify many of these risks. These risks are not the only risks that may affect the Company. Additional risks that the Company is not aware of or does not believe are material at the time of this filing may also become important factors that adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Operations\nThe Company and its Results of Operations and Financial Condition Have Been and May Continue To Be Materially Adversely Impacted by the Ongoing COVID-19 Pandemic.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic continues to be a rapidly-changing situation that has negatively impacted and could continue to negatively impact the global economy. The extent to which COVID-19 and the emergence of variant strains continues to impact the Company will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, such as the duration of the outbreak and business closures or business disruptions for the Company, its suppliers and its customers. Any changes in or resurgence of COVID-19 could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s ability to get the raw materials, parts and components it needs to manufacture its products as its suppliers face disruptions in their businesses, closures or bankruptcy as a result of COVID-19. The Company depends greatly on its suppliers for items that are essential to the manufacturing of its products. If its suppliers fail to meet its manufacturing needs in the future, it would delay the Company\u2019s production and product shipments to customers and negatively affect operations.\nThe Company has implemented work-from-home policies for certain \u201cnon-essential\u201d employees. Although these work-from-home policies have not negatively impacted the Company in any material respect to date, COVID-19 is dynamic and any future resurgences could negatively impact productivity, disrupt conduct of the Company\u2019s business in the ordinary course and delay production timelines. Due to the large remote workforce populations, the Company may also face informational technology infrastructure and connectivity issues from the vendors that it relies on for certain information technologies to administer, store and support the Company\u2019s multiple business activities. IDEX is heavily dependent on the availability and support of its technology landscape, several of which are provided by external third party service providers (e.g., Microsoft, AT&T and Verizon). Although the Company has not suffered any disruptions to date, any future disruptions in their operations could also negatively impact the Company and its operating results and financial condition.\nTo the extent COVID-19 adversely affects the Company and its financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors\u201d of this annual report, such as those relating to international operations, the Company\u2019s ability to develop new products, the Company\u2019s ability to execute on its growth strategy of acquisitions, the Company\u2019s dependency on raw materials, parts and components, the effects on movements in foreign currency exchange rates on the Company, the effects on the Company that result from declines in commodity prices and the Company\u2019s reliance on labor availability to operate and grow the business.\nThe Company\u2019s Inability to Continue to Develop New Products Could Limit Sales Growth.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to continue to grow organically is tied in large part to its ability to continue to develop new products. A failure to continue to develop and deliver new, innovative and competitive products to the market could limit sales growth and negatively impact the Company and its financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nThe Company\u2019s Growth Strategy Includes Acquisitions and the Company May Not be Able to Make Acquisitions of Suitable Candidates or Integrate Acquisitions Successfully.\nThe Company\u2019s historical growth has included, and the Company\u2019s future growth is likely to continue to include, acquisitions. The Company intends to continue to seek acquisition opportunities both to expand into new markets and to enhance its position in existing markets throughout the world. The Company may not be able to successfully identify suitable candidates, negotiate appropriate acquisition terms, obtain financing needed to consummate those acquisitions, complete proposed acquisitions or successfully integrate acquired businesses into its existing operations. In addition, any acquisition, once successfully integrated, may not perform as planned, be accretive to earnings, or otherwise prove beneficial to the Company.\nAcquisitions involve numerous risks, including the assumption of undisclosed or unindemnified liabilities, difficulties in the assimilation of the operations, technologies, services and products of the acquired companies and the diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns. In addition, prior acquisitions have resulted in, and future acquisitions could result in, the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness and other expenses.\nThe Markets Served by the Company are Highly Competitive and this Competition Could Reduce Sales and Operating Margins.\nMost of the Company\u2019s products are sold in competitive markets. Maintaining and improving a competitive position will require continued investment in manufacturing, engineering, quality standards, marketing, customer service and support and distribution networks. The Company may not be successful in maintaining its competitive position. The Company\u2019s competitors may develop products that are superior, may develop methods of more efficiently and effectively providing products and services or may adapt quicker to new technologies or evolving customer requirements. The Company may not be able to compete successfully with existing competitors or with new competitors. Pricing pressures may require the Company to adjust the prices of products to stay competitive. Failure to continue competing successfully could reduce sales, operating margins and overall financial performance.\nThe Company is Dependent on the Availability of Raw Materials, Parts and Components Used in Its Products.\nWhile the Company manufactures certain parts and components used in its products, the Company also requires substantial amounts of raw materials and purchases certain parts and components from suppliers. The availability of and prices for raw materials, parts and components may be subject to curtailment or change due to, among other things, suppliers\u2019 allocations to other purchasers, interruptions in production by suppliers, including due to geopolitical or civil unrest, unfavorable economic or industry conditions, labor disruptions, supply chain disruptions, catastrophic weather events, natural disasters, the occurrence of a contagious disease or illness, changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels. Any change in the supply of, or price for, these raw materials or parts and components could materially affect the Company and its financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nThe Company\u2019s Business Operations May Be Adversely Affected by Information Systems Interruptions or Intrusion.\nThe Company depends on various information technologies to administer, store and support multiple business activities. If these systems (or the systems of the Company\u2019s customers or third-party hosting services) are damaged, cease to function properly or are subject to cyber-security attacks, such as those involving unauthorized access, malicious software and/or other intrusions, the Company could experience production downtimes, operational delays, other detrimental impacts on operations or the ability to provide products and services to its customers, the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, other manipulation or improper use of the Company\u2019s systems or networks, financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability, penalties, fines and/or damage to the Company\u2019s reputation. While the Company attempts to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures, including employee training, technical security controls and maintenance of backup and protective systems, the Company\u2019s systems, networks, products and services remain potentially vulnerable to known or unknown threats, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its financial condition or results of operations. Further, given the unpredictability, nature and scope of cyber-security attacks, it is possible that potential vulnerabilities could go undetected for an extended period.\nUncertainty Related to Environmental Regulation and Industry Standards, as well as Physical Risks of Climate Change, Could Impact the Company's Results of Operations and Financial Position.\nIncreased public awareness and concern regarding environmental risks, including global climate change, may result in more international, regional and/or federal requirements or industry standards to reduce or mitigate global warming and other environmental risks. New climate change laws and regulations could require the Company to change its manufacturing processes or obtain substitute materials that may cost more or be less available for its manufacturing operations. Various jurisdictions in which the Company does business have implemented, or in the future could implement or amend, restrictions on emissions of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases, limitations or restrictions on water use, the production of single use plastics, regulations on energy management and waste management and other climate change-based rules and regulations, which may increase the Company\u2019s expenses and adversely affect its operating results. In addition, the physical risks of climate change may impact the availability and cost of materials, sources and supply of energy, product demand and manufacturing and could increase insurance and other operating costs. The expected future increased worldwide regulatory activity relating to climate change could expand the nature, scope and complexity of matters that the Company is required to control, assess and report. If environmental laws or regulations or industry standards are either changed or adopted and impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon the Company, its suppliers, its customers or its products, or the\nCompany's operations are disrupted due to physical impacts of climate change on the Company, its customers or its suppliers, the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted.\nRisks Related to Economic Conditions\nA Slowdown in the U.S. or International Economy Could Materially Adversely Affect the Sales and Profitability of the Company\u2019s Businesses.\nIn 2021, 48% of the Company\u2019s sales were derived from domestic operations while 52% were derived from international operations. The Company\u2019s largest end markets include industrial, semiconductor, automotive, life sciences and medical technologies, fire and rescue, oil and gas, paint and coatings, chemical processing, agriculture, water and wastewater treatment and optical filters and components. A slowdown in the U.S. or global economy and, in particular, any of these specific end markets could materially reduce the Company\u2019s sales and profitability.\nChanges to Geopolitical and Economic Conditions in the U.S. and Foreign Countries in Which the Company Operates Could Adversely Affect the Company.\nThe Company expects international operations and export sales to continue to be significant for the foreseeable future. The Company\u2019s sales from international operations and sales from export are both subject in varying degrees to risks inherent in doing business outside the U.S. These risks include the following:\n\u2022possibility of unfavorable circumstances arising from host country laws or regulations and the risks related to required compliance with local laws;\n\u2022risks of economic instability, including due to inflation;\n\u2022currency exchange rate fluctuations and restrictions on currency repatriation;\n\u2022potential negative consequences from changes to taxation policies;\n\u2022disruption of operations from labor and political disturbances;\n\u2022withdrawal from or renegotiation of international trade agreements and other restrictions on the trade between the United States and other countries;\n\u2022the effects of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement between the European Union, the European Atomic Energy Community and the United Kingdom that was entered into on December 30, 2020 following the United Kingdom\u2019s decision to exit the European Union;\n\u2022changes in tariff and trade barriers, including uncertainty caused by the evolving relations between the United States and China; and\n\u2022geopolitical events, including natural disasters, climate change, public health issues, political instability (such as increasing tensions between Ukraine and Russia), terrorism, insurrection or war.\nAny of these events could have a materially adverse impact on the Company and its operations.\nSignificant Movements in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates May Harm the Company\u2019s Financial Results.\nThe Company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly with respect to the Euro, Swiss Franc, Canadian Dollar, British Pound, Indian Rupee, Chinese Renminbi and Swedish Krona. Any significant change in the value of the currencies of the countries in which the Company does business against the U.S. Dollar could affect the Company\u2019s ability to sell products competitively and control its cost structure, which could have a material adverse effect on results of operations. For additional detail related to this risk, see Part II, Item 7A, \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\u201d\nFluctuations in Interest Rates Could Adversely Affect the Company\u2019s Results of Operations and Financial Position.\nThe Company\u2019s profitability may be adversely affected during any periods of unexpected or rapid increases in interest rates. The Company maintains a revolving credit facility (the \u201cRevolving Facility\u201d), which bears interest at either an alternate base rate or adjusted LIBOR plus, in each case, an applicable margin based on the lower of the Company's senior, unsecured, long-term debt rating or the Company\u2019s applicable leverage ratio. A significant increase in LIBOR or the other rates the Company has agreed to use as a successor to LIBOR under the Revolving Facility, as amended, would significantly increase the Company\u2019s cost of borrowings. Further, any changes in regulatory standards or industry practices, such as the ultimate discontinuation of the use of LIBOR and the transition to alternative benchmark rates may result in the usage of higher interest rates under the Revolving Facility, and the Company\u2019s current or future indebtedness may be adversely affected. The Company is also exposed to risks if the U.S. Federal Reserve raises its benchmark interest rate, which may reduce the availability of and\nincrease the cost of obtaining new debt and refinancing existing indebtedness. For additional detail related to this risk, see Part II, Item 7A, \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\"\nA Significant or Sustained Decline in Commodity Prices, Including Oil, Could Negatively Impact the Levels of Expenditures by Certain of the Company\u2019s Customers.\nDemand for the Company\u2019s products depends, in part, on the level of new and planned expenditures by certain of its customers. The level of expenditures by the Company\u2019s customers is dependent on, among other factors, general economic conditions, availability of credit, economic conditions within their respective industries and expectations of future market behavior. Volatility in commodity prices, including oil, can negatively affect the level of these activities and can result in postponement of capital spending decisions or the delay or cancellation of existing orders. The ability of the Company\u2019s customers to finance capital investment and maintenance may also be affected by the conditions in their industries. Reduced demand for the Company\u2019s products could result in the delay or cancellation of existing orders or lead to excess manufacturing capacity, which unfavorably impacts the absorption of fixed manufacturing costs. This reduced demand could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Legal, Accounting and Regulatory Matters\nAn Unfavorable Outcome of Any Pending Contingencies or Litigation Could Adversely Affect the Company.\nThe Company is currently involved in pending and threatened legal, regulatory and other proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. These proceedings may pertain to matters such as product liability or contract disputes, and may also involve governmental inquiries, inspections, audits or investigations relating to issues such as tax matters, intellectual property, environmental, health and safety issues, governmental regulations, employment and other matters. Where it is reasonably possible to do so, the Company accrues estimates of the probable costs for the resolution of these matters. These estimates are developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results and the availability of insurance coverage, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. It is possible, however, that future operating results for any particular quarter or annual period could be materially affected by changes in assumptions, the continued availability of insurance coverage or the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s strategies related to these proceedings. For additional detail related to this risk, see Item 3, \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d and Note 11 in Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nThe Company\u2019s Intangible Assets, Including Goodwill, are a Significant Portion of Total Assets and a Write-off of Intangible Assets or Goodwill Would Adversely Impact the Company\u2019s Operating Results and Significantly Reduce the Company\u2019s Net Worth.\nThe Company\u2019s total assets reflect substantial intangible assets, primarily goodwill and identifiable intangible assets. At December 31, 2021, goodwill and intangible assets totaled $2,167.7 million and $597.3 million, respectively. These assets primarily result from acquisitions, representing the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the tangible net assets acquired. Annually, or when certain events occur that require a more current valuation, the Company assesses whether there has been an impairment in the value of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets. If future operating performance at one or more of the Company\u2019s reporting units were to fall significantly below forecasted levels, the Company could be required to reflect, under current applicable accounting rules, a non-cash charge to operating income for an impairment. Any determination requiring the write-off of a significant portion of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets would adversely impact the Company\u2019s results of operations and net worth. See Note 6 in Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for further discussion on goodwill and intangible assets.\nFailure To Comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act or Other Applicable Anti-bribery Laws Could Have an Adverse Effect on the Company.\nThe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Recent years have seen a substantial increase in anti-bribery law enforcement activity with more frequent and aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings by both the Department of Justice and the SEC, increased enforcement activity by non-U.S. regulators and increases in criminal and civil proceedings brought against companies and individuals. The Company\u2019s policies mandate compliance with all anti-bribery laws. However, the Company operates in certain countries that are recognized as having governmental and commercial corruption. The Company\u2019s internal control policies and procedures may not always protect it from reckless or criminal acts committed by employees or third-party intermediaries. Violations of these anti-bribery\nlaws may result in criminal or civil sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its financial condition and results of operations.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nThe Company\u2019s Success Depends on Its Executive Management and Other Key Personnel.\nThe Company\u2019s future success depends to a significant degree on the skills, experience and efforts of its executive management and other key personnel and their ability to provide the Company with uninterrupted leadership and direction. The loss of the services of any of the executive officers or a failure to provide adequate succession plans for key personnel could have an adverse impact on the Company. The availability of highly qualified talent is limited and the competition for talent is robust. However, the Company provides long-term equity awards and certain other benefits for its executive officers which provides incentives for them to make a commitment to the Company. The Company\u2019s future success will depend on its ability to have adequate succession plans in place and to attract, retain and develop qualified personnel. A failure to efficiently replace executive management members and other key personnel and to attract, retain and develop new qualified personnel could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s operations and implementation of its strategic plan.\nChallenges with Respect to Labor Availability Could Negatively Impact the Company\u2019s Ability to Operate or Grow the Business.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends in part on the ability of its businesses to proactively attract, motivate and retain a qualified and highly skilled workforce in an intensely competitive labor market. A failure to attract, motivate and retain highly skilled personnel could adversely affect the Company\u2019s operating results or its ability to operate or grow the business. Additionally, any labor stoppages or labor disruptions, including due to geopolitical unrest, unfavorable economic or industry conditions, catastrophic weather events, natural disasters or the occurrence of a contagious disease or illness could adversely affect the Company\u2019s operating results or its ability to operate or grow the business.", "PERMNO": 75591, "SIC": 3561, "TIC": "IEX"}
