{"cik": "886346", "company": "KADANT INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business, results of operations and financial condition, and an investment in our securities, are subject to a number of risks. Among the risks that could materially negatively affect our results or cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected or indicated in any forward-looking statements are the following.\nAdverse changes in global and local economic conditions may negatively affect our industry, business and results of operations.\nWe sell products worldwide to global process industries and a significant portion of our revenues are from customers based in North America, Europe and China. Uncertainties in global and regional economic outlooks have negatively affected, and may in the future negatively affect, demand for our customers' products and, as a consequence, our products and services, especially our capital equipment systems and products, and our operating results. Also, uncertainty regarding economic conditions has caused, and may in the future cause, liquidity and credit issues for many businesses, including our customers in the pulp and paper industry as well as other process industries, and may result in their inability to fund projects, capacity expansion plans, and to some extent, routine operations and capital expenditures. These conditions have resulted, and may in the future result, in a number of structural changes in process industries, including decreased spending, mill closures, consolidations, and bankruptcies, all of which negatively affect our business, revenue, and profitability. Financial and economic turmoil affecting the worldwide economy or the banking system and financial markets, in particular due to political or economic developments, could cause the expectations for our business to differ materially in the future.\nRevenues from the sale of large capital equipment and systems projects are often difficult to predict accurately, especially in periods of economic uncertainty.\nWe manufacture capital equipment and systems used in process industries, including the paper industry. The demand for capital equipment is variable and depends on a number of factors, including consumer demand for end products, existing manufacturing capacity, the level of capital spending by our customers and economic conditions. As a consequence, our bookings and revenues for capital projects tend to be variable and difficult to predict. It is especially difficult to accurately forecast our operating results during periods of economic uncertainty. Paper and OSB companies curtail their capital and operating spending during periods of economic uncertainty and are cautious about resuming spending as market conditions improve. Levels of consumer spending on non-durable goods, demand for food and beverage packaging, and demand for new housing and remodeling are all factors that affect paper and OSB companies' demand for our products, and reductions in these demand levels can negatively impact our business. As paper and OSB companies consolidate operations in response to market weakness, they frequently reduce capacity, increase downtime, defer maintenance and upgrades, and postpone or even cancel capacity additions or expansion projects. Capacity growth and investment can be uneven and the larger paper producers have delayed, and may in the future delay, additional new capacity start-ups in reaction to softer market conditions. In general, as significant capacity additions come online and the economic growth rate slows, paper producers have deferred and could in the future defer further investments or the delivery of previously-ordered equipment until the market absorbs the new production. This has negatively affected our bookings and revenues in the past, particularly in China, and may negatively affect our operating results in the future.\nOur sales of capital equipment in China tend to be more variable and are subject to a number of uncertainties.\nOur bookings and revenues from China tend to be more variable than in other geographic regions, as the Chinese pulp and paper industry experiences periods of significant capacity expansion to meet demand followed by periods of reduced activity while overcapacity is absorbed. These cycles result in periods of significant bookings activity for our capital products and increased revenues followed by a significant decrease in bookings or potential delays in shipments and order placements by our customers as they attempt to balance supply and demand.\nIn addition, orders from customers in China, particularly for large stock-preparation systems that have been tailored to a customer's specific requirements, have credit risks higher than we generally incur elsewhere, and some orders are subject to the receipt of financing approvals from the Chinese government or can be impacted by the availability of credit and more restrictive monetary policies. For example, we reversed a booking of $16 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 due to uncertainty regarding financing for a project in China. We generally do not record bookings for signed contracts from customers in China for large stock-preparation systems until we receive the down payments for such contracts. The timing of the receipt of these orders and the down payments are uncertain and there is no assurance that we will be able to recognize revenue on these contracts. Delays in the receipt of payments and letters of credit affect when revenues can be recognized on these contracts, making it difficult to accurately forecast our future financial performance. We may experience a loss if a contract is canceled prior to the receipt of a down payment if we have commenced engineering or other work associated with the contract. We typically have inventory awaiting shipment to customers. We could incur a loss if contracts are canceled and we cannot re-sell the equipment. In addition, we may experience a loss if the contract is canceled, or the customer does not fulfill its obligations under the contract, prior to the receipt of a letter of credit or final payments covering the remaining balance of the contract, which could represent 80% or more of the total order.\nA significant portion of our revenue in China is recognized upon shipment once we have secured final payment. In some cases, we will be unable to recognize any revenue on completed orders until after installation or acceptance of the equipment.\nKadant Inc.\n2015 Annual Report\nFurthermore, customers in China often demand that deliveries of previously-ordered equipment be delayed to future periods for any number of reasons. As a result of these factors, our revenues recognized in China have varied, and will in the future vary, greatly from period to period and be difficult to predict.\nOur results of operations may be adversely affected by currency fluctuations.\nAs a multinational corporation, we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that impact our business in many ways. We are exposed to both translation as well as transaction risk associated with transactions denominated in currencies that differ from our subsidiaries' functional currencies. Although in general our subsidiaries' costs are in the same currency as their revenues, changes in the relative values of currencies occur from time to time and can adversely affect our operating results. Some of the foreign currency translation risk is mitigated when foreign subsidiaries have revenue and expenses in the same foreign currency. Further, certain foreign subsidiaries may hold U.S. dollar assets or liabilities which, as the U.S. dollar strengthens versus the applicable functional currencies, will result in currency transaction gains on assets or losses on liabilities. While some foreign currency risks can be hedged using derivatives or other financial instruments, or may be insurable, such attempts to mitigate these risks may be costly and not always successful.\nWhen we translate the local currency results of our foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars during a period in which the U.S. dollar is strengthening, our financial results will reflect decreases due to foreign currency translation. In addition, our consolidated financial results are adversely affected when foreign governments devalue their currencies, and we expect our consolidated financial results to be adversely affected in 2016 by the recent devaluation of the Chinese currency. Our major foreign currency translation exposures involve the currencies in Europe, China, Brazil, and Canada. Foreign currency translation had a negative effect on our financial results in 2015, and is expected to continue to adversely affect our operating results in 2016. We do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments to hedge this type of foreign currency translation risk.\nThe inability of our customers to obtain financing for capital equipment projects may affect our ability to recognize revenue and income.\nApproximately 35% of our revenue in 2015 was from the sale of capital equipment to be used in process industries. Large capital equipment projects require a significant investment and may require our customers to secure financing from external sources. Our financial performance will be negatively impacted if there are delays in customers securing financing or our customers become unable to secure such financing due to any number of factors, including a tightening of monetary policy. For example, we reversed a booking of $16 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 due to uncertainty regarding financing for a project in China, originally recorded in 2014. Financing has been a significant problem for customers in Russia and China, and has caused us to delay the booking of some pending orders, as well as the shipment of some orders currently in our backlog. The inability of our customers to obtain credit may affect our ability to recognize revenue and income, particularly on large capital equipment orders from new customers for which we may require letters of credit. We may also be unable to issue letters of credit to our customers, which are required in some cases to guarantee performance, during periods of economic uncertainty.\nOur global operations subject us to economic risk as our results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in government regulations and policies.\nOperating globally subjects us to changes in government regulations and policies in multiple jurisdictions around the world, including those related to tariffs and trade barriers, taxation, exchange controls and political risks. Changes in government policies, political unrest, economic sanctions, trade embargoes, or other adverse trade regulations can negatively impact our business. For example, we operate significant manufacturing facilities in and derive significant revenue from China. Changes in the policies of the Chinese government, devaluation of the Chinese currency, political unrest, unstable economic conditions, or other developments in China or in U.S.-China relations that are adverse to trade, including enactment of protectionist legislation or trade or currency restrictions, could negatively impact our business and operating results. Policies of the Chinese government to target slower economic growth may negatively affect our business in China if customers are unable to expand capacity or obtain financing for expansion or improvement projects.\nWe manufacture equipment used in the production of OSB and our financial performance may be adversely affected by lower levels of residential construction activity.\nWe manufacture stranders and related equipment used in the production of OSB, an engineered wood panel product used primarily in home construction. Our customers produce OSB principally for new residential construction, home repair and remodeling activities. As such, the operating results for our Wood Processing Systems segment correlate to a significant degree to the level of this residential construction activity, primarily in North America and, to a lesser extent, in Europe. Residential construction activity is influenced by a number of factors, including the supply of and demand for new and existing homes, new housing starts, unemployment rates, interest rate levels, availability of mortgage financing, mortgage foreclosure rates, seasonal and unusual weather conditions, general economic conditions and consumer confidence. A significant increase in long-term interest\nKadant Inc.\n2015 Annual Report\nrates, tightened lending standards, high unemployment rates and other factors that reduce levels of residential construction activity could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance.\nThe OSB market is highly concentrated and the market for building products is highly competitive. The loss of a significant customer or our customers' reductions in capital spending or OSB production could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance.\nThe OSB market is highly concentrated and there are a limited number of OSB manufacturers. The loss of one or more of these customers to a competitor could adversely affect our revenues and profitability. In addition, the market for building products is highly competitive. Competitive products with OSB include other wood panel products and substitutes for wood building products, such as nonfiber-based alternatives. For example, plastic, wood/plastic or composite materials may be used by builders as alternatives to OSB products. Changes in component prices, such as energy, chemicals, wood-based fibers, and nonfiber alternatives can change the competitive position of OSB relative to other available alternatives and could increase substitution. Our customers' OSB production can be adversely affected by lower-cost producers of other wood panel products and substitutes for wood building products. Lower demand for OSB products or a decline in the profitability of one or more of our customers could result in a reduction in spending on capital equipment or the shutdown or closure of an OSB mill, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance.\nThe development and increasing use of digital media has had, and will continue to have, an adverse impact on our Papermaking Systems segment.\nDevelopments in digital media have adversely affected demand for newsprint and for printing and writing grades of paper, particularly in North America and Europe, a trend which is expected to continue. Approximately 12% of our revenue in 2015 was to customers producing newsprint and printing and writing grades of paper. Significant declines in the production of printing and writing paper grades has also led to a drop in the construction of recycled tissue mills, as those mills use printing and writing grades of waste paper as their fiber source. The increased use of digital media has had, and will continue to have, an adverse effect on demand for our products in those markets.\nPrice increases and shortages in raw materials and components could adversely impact our operating results.\nWe use a variety of raw materials and commodities to manufacture our products. Increases in the prices of such raw materials and commodities could adversely affect our operating results if we were unable to fully offset the effect of these increased costs through price increases, productivity improvements, or cost reduction programs.\nWe rely on suppliers to secure commodity and component products required for the manufacture of our products. A disruption in deliveries to or from suppliers or decreased availability of such components or commodities could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs. We believe our sources of raw materials and component products will generally be sufficient for our needs in the foreseeable future. However, our operating results could be negatively impacted if supply is insufficient for our operations.\nThe raw material used in the manufacture of our fiber-based granules is obtained from two paper mills. Although we believe that our relationships with the mills are good, the mills may not continue to supply sufficient raw material. From time to time, we have experienced some difficulty in obtaining sufficient raw material to operate at optimal production levels. We continue to work with the mills to ensure a stable supply of raw material. To date, we have been able to meet all of our customer delivery requirements, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to meet future delivery requirements. If the mills were to be unable or unwilling to supply us sufficient fiber, we would be forced to find one or more alternative suppliers for this raw material.\nWe are dependent upon certain suppliers for components and raw materials.\nSome of our businesses depend on certain suppliers to provide raw materials or other critical components of our equipment. If we could not obtain sufficient supplies of these components or these sources of supply ceased to be available to us, we could experience shortages in raw materials or be unable to meet our delivery commitments. Alternative sources of supply could be more expensive. Such events would have an adverse effect on our operating results.\nOur business is subject to economic, currency, political, and other risks associated with international sales and operations.\nWe operate multiple manufacturing operations worldwide, including operations in Canada, China, Europe, Mexico, and Brazil, and sell our products globally. International revenues and operations are subject to a number of risks, including the following:\nKadant Inc.\n2015 Annual Report\n-\nagreements may be difficult to enforce and receivables difficult to collect through a foreign country's legal system;\n-\nforeign customers may have longer payment cycles;\n-\nforeign countries may impose additional withholding taxes or otherwise tax our foreign income, impose tariffs, adopt other restrictions on foreign trade, impose currency restrictions or enact other protectionist or anti-trade measures;\n-\nworsening economic conditions may result in worker unrest, labor actions, and potential work stoppages;\n-\npolitical unrest may disrupt commercial activities of ours or our customers;\n-\nit may be difficult to repatriate funds, due to unfavorable domestic and foreign tax consequences or other restrictions or limitations imposed by foreign governments; and\n-\nthe protection of intellectual property in foreign countries may be more difficult to enforce.\nWe operate manufacturing facilities throughout the world, which subjects us to varying risks of disrupted production.\nWe operate businesses with significant manufacturing facilities throughout the world. Our manufacturing facilities and operations could be disrupted by natural disaster, failure of equipment and operating systems, labor strike, war, political unrest, terrorist activity, or economic upheaval. Some of these conditions are more likely to occur in certain geographic regions in which we operate. In addition, equipment and operating systems necessary for our manufacturing businesses may break down, perform poorly, or fail. Any such disruption could cause losses in efficiencies, delays in shipments of our products and the loss of sales and customers, and insurance proceeds may not adequately compensate us for our losses.\nOur inability to successfully identify and complete acquisitions or successfully integrate any new or previous acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur strategy includes the acquisition of technologies and businesses that complement or augment our existing products and services or may involve entry into a new process industry. Any such acquisition involves numerous risks that may adversely affect our future financial performance and cash flows. These risks include:\n-\ncompetition with other prospective buyers resulting in our inability to complete an acquisition or in our paying a substantial premium over the fair value of the net assets of the acquired business;\n-\ninability to obtain regulatory approvals, including antitrust approvals;\n-\ndifficulty in assimilating operations, technologies, products and the key employees of the acquired business;\n-\ninability to maintain existing customers or to sell the products and services of the acquired business to our existing customers;\n-\ninability to retain key management of the acquired business;\n-\ndiversion of management's attention from other business concerns;\n-\ninability to improve the revenues and profitability or realize the cost savings and synergies expected of the acquisition;\n-\nassumption of significant liabilities, some of which may be unknown at the time;\n-\npotential future impairment of the value of goodwill and intangible assets acquired; and\n-\nidentification of internal control deficiencies of the acquired business.\nWe are required to record transaction and acquisition-related costs in the period incurred. Once completed, acquisitions may involve significant integration costs. These acquisition-related costs could be significant in a reporting period and have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nAny acquisition we complete may be made at a substantial premium over the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the acquired business. We are required to assess the realizability of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that these assets may be impaired. These events or circumstances would generally include operating losses or a significant decline in earnings associated with the acquired business or asset, and our ability to realize the value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets will depend on the future cash flows of these businesses. We may incur impairment charges to write down the value of our goodwill and acquired intangible assets in the future if the assets are not deemed recoverable, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nIt may be difficult for us to implement our strategies for improving internal growth.\nSome of the markets in which we compete are mature and have relatively low growth rates. We pursue a number of strategies to improve our internal growth, including:\nKadant Inc.\n2015 Annual Report\n-\nstrengthening our presence in selected geographic markets, including emerging markets and existing markets where we see opportunities;\n-\nfocusing on parts and consumables sales;\n-\nusing low-cost manufacturing bases, such as China and Mexico;\n-\nallocating research and development funding to products with higher growth prospects;\n-\ndeveloping new applications for our technologies;\n-\ncombining sales and marketing operations in appropriate markets to compete more effectively;\n-\nfinding new markets for our products; and\n-\ncontinuing to develop cross-selling opportunities for our products and services to take advantage of our depth of product offerings.\nWe may not be able to successfully implement these strategies and these strategies may not result in the expected growth of our business.\nWe are subject to intense competition in all our markets.\nWe believe that the principal competitive factors affecting the markets for our products include technical expertise and process knowledge, product innovation, product quality, and price. Our competitors include a number of large multinational corporations that may have substantially greater financial, marketing, and other resources than we do. As a result, they may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, or to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their services and products. Competitors' technologies may prove to be superior to ours. Our current products, those under development, and our ability to develop new technologies may not be sufficient to enable us to compete effectively. Competition, especially in China, has increased as new companies enter the market and existing competitors expand their product lines and manufacturing operations.\nAdverse changes to the soundness of our suppliers and customers could affect our business and results of operations.\nAll of our businesses are exposed to risk associated with the creditworthiness of our key suppliers and customers, including pulp and paper manufacturers and other industrial customers, many of which may be adversely affected by volatile conditions in the financial markets, worldwide economic downturns, and difficult economic conditions. These conditions could result in financial instability, bankruptcy, or other adverse effects at any of our suppliers or customers. The consequences of such adverse effects could include the interruption of production at the facilities of our suppliers, the reduction, delay or cancellation of customer orders, delays in or the inability of customers to obtain financing to purchase our products or pay amounts due, and bankruptcy of customers or other creditors. Any adverse changes to the soundness of our suppliers or customers may adversely affect our cash flows, profitability, or financial condition.\nChanges in our effective tax rate may impact our results of operations.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenue and earnings from our international operations, and are subject to income and other taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. A number of factors may cause our effective tax rate to fluctuate, including: changes in tax rates in various jurisdictions; unanticipated changes in the amount of profit in jurisdictions with low statutory tax rates; the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities; changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of various tax returns; increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including impairments of goodwill in connection with acquisitions; changes in available tax credits or our ability to utilize foreign tax credits; and changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws. Any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from that of prior periods or current expectations, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows.\nWe may be required to reorganize our operations in response to changing conditions in the worldwide economy and the pulp and paper industry, and such actions may require significant expenditures and may not be successful.\nWe have undertaken various restructuring measures in the past in response to changing market conditions in the countries in which we operate and we may engage in additional cost reduction programs in the future. The costs of these programs may be significant and we may not recoup the costs of these programs. In connection with any future plant closures, delays or failures in the transition of production from existing facilities to our other facilities in other geographic regions could also adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, it is difficult to accurately forecast our financial performance in periods of economic uncertainty in a region or globally, and the efforts we have made or may make to align our cost structure may not be sufficient or able to keep pace with rapidly changing business conditions. Our profitability may decline if our restructuring efforts do not sufficiently reduce our future costs and position us to maintain or increase our sales.\nKadant Inc.\n2015 Annual Report\nAdverse changes to the soundness of financial institutions could affect us.\nWe have relationships with many financial institutions, including lenders under our credit facilities and insurance underwriters, and from time to time we execute transactions with counterparties in the financial industry, such as our interest rate swap arrangements and other hedging transactions. In addition, our subsidiaries in China often hold banker's acceptance drafts that are received from customers in the normal course of business. These drafts may be discounted or used to pay vendors prior to the scheduled maturity date or submitted to an acceptance bank for payment at the scheduled maturity date. These financial institutions or counterparties could be adversely affected by volatile conditions in the financial markets, economic downturns, and difficult economic conditions. These conditions could result in financial instability, bankruptcy, or other adverse effects at these financial institutions or counterparties. We may not be able to access credit facilities in the future, complete transactions as intended, or otherwise obtain the benefit of the arrangements we have entered into with such financial parties, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur debt may adversely affect our cash flow and may restrict our investment opportunities.\nWe entered into a five-year unsecured revolving credit facility (2012 Credit Agreement) in the aggregate principal amount of up to $100 million on August 3, 2012 and amended it on November 1, 2013. The 2012 Credit Agreement also includes an uncommitted unsecured incremental borrowing facility of up to an additional $50 million. We have borrowed amounts under the 2012 Credit Agreement and under other agreements to fund our operations. We may also obtain additional long-term debt and working capital lines of credit to meet future financing needs, which would have the effect of increasing our total leverage. Our indebtedness could have negative consequences, including:\n-\nincreasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions;\n-\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing;\n-\nlimiting our ability to pay dividends on or to repurchase our capital stock;\n-\nlimiting our ability to complete a merger or an acquisition;\n-\nlimiting our ability to acquire new products and technologies through acquisitions or licensing agreements; and\n-\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we compete.\nOur existing indebtedness bears interest at floating rates and as a result, our interest payment obligations on our indebtedness will increase if interest rates increase. A portion of our variable rate interest payment obligations is hedged through interest rate swap agreements entered into in May 2006 and January 2015. The counterparty to the swap agreements could demand an early termination of the swap agreements if we were to be in default under the 2012 Credit Agreement, or any agreement that amends or replaces the 2012 Credit Agreement in which the counterparty is a member, and we were unable to cure the default. If either of these swap agreements were to be terminated prior to the scheduled maturity date and if we were required to pay cash for the value of the swap, we would incur a loss, which would adversely affect our financial results.\nOur ability to satisfy our obligations and to reduce our total debt depends on our future operating performance and on economic, financial, competitive, and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flows to meet these obligations or to successfully execute our business strategy. The 2012 Credit Agreement includes certain financial covenants, and our failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default under the 2012 Credit Agreement, the swap agreements, and our other credit facilities, and would have significant negative consequences for our current operations and our future ability to fund our operations and grow our business. If we were unable to service our debt and fund our business, we could be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures or research and development expenditures, seek additional financing or equity capital, restructure or refinance our debt, curtail or eliminate our cash dividend to stockholders, or sell assets.\nRestrictions in our 2012 Credit Agreement may limit our activities.\nOur 2012 Credit Agreement contains, and future debt instruments to which we may become subject may contain, restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit us, including restrictions on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to:\n-\nincur additional indebtedness;\n-\npay dividends on, redeem, or repurchase our capital stock;\n-\nmake investments;\n-\ncreate liens;\n-\nsell assets;\n-\nenter into transactions with affiliates; and\n-\nconsolidate, merge, or transfer all or substantially all of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries.\nKadant Inc.\n2015 Annual Report\nWe are also required to meet specified financial covenants under the terms of our 2012 Credit Agreement. Our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance, which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors, including factors that are beyond our control such as currency exchange rates, interest rates, changes in technology, and changes in the level of competition. Our failure to comply with any of these restrictions or covenants may result in an event of default under our 2012 Credit Agreement and other loan obligations, which could permit acceleration of the debt under those instruments and require us to repay the debt before its scheduled due date. If an event of default were to occur, we might not have sufficient funds available to make the payments required under our indebtedness. If we are unable to repay amounts owed under our debt agreements, those lenders may be entitled to foreclose on and sell the collateral that secures our borrowings under the agreements.\nFurthermore, our 2012 Credit Agreement requires that any amounts borrowed under the facility be repaid by the maturity date in 2018. If we are unable to roll over the amounts borrowed into a new credit facility and we do not have sufficient cash in the U.S. to repay our borrowings, we may need to repatriate cash from our overseas operations to fund the repayment and we would be required to pay taxes on the repatriated amounts. Such repatriation would have an adverse effect on our effective tax rate and cash flows.\nOur future success is substantially dependent on the continued service of our senior management and other key employees.\nOur future success is substantially dependent on the continued service of our senior management and other key employees. The loss of the services of our senior management or other key employees could make it more difficult to successfully operate our business and achieve our business goals. We also may be unable to retain existing management, product development, sales, operational and other support personnel that are critical to our success, which could result in harm to key customer relationships, loss of key information, expertise, or know-how, and unanticipated recruitment and training costs.\nWe have not independently verified the results of third-party research or confirmed assumptions or judgments on which they may be based, and the forecasted and other forward-looking information contained therein is subject to inherent uncertainties.\nWe refer in this report and other documents that we file with the SEC to historical, forecasted and other forward-looking information published by sources such as Resource Information Systems Inc., Forest Economic Advisors, the U.S. Census Bureau, and various market news agencies that we believe to be reliable. However, we have not independently verified this information, and with respect to the forecasted and forward-looking information, have not independently confirmed the assumptions and judgments upon which such information is based. Forecasted and other forward-looking information is necessarily based on assumptions regarding future occurrences, events, conditions and circumstances and subjective judgments relating to various matters, and is subject to inherent uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from the results expressed or implied by, or based upon, such forecasted and forward-looking information.\nOur inability to protect our intellectual property or defend ourselves against the intellectual property claims of others could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, litigation to enforce our intellectual property and contractual rights or defend ourselves could result in significant litigation or licensing expense.\nWe seek patent and trade secret protection for significant new technologies, products, and processes because of the length of time and expense associated with bringing new products through the development process and into the marketplace. We own numerous U.S. and foreign patents and we intend to file additional applications, as appropriate, for patents covering our products. Patents may not be issued for any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us, and the claims allowed under any issued patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. Any issued patents owned by or licensed to us may be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, and the rights under these patents may not provide us with competitive advantages. In addition, competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies. Intellectual property rights may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries, which could make it easier for competitors to capture increased market share. In addition, as our patents expire, we rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how to protect our products. We cannot be sure the steps we have taken, or will take in the future, will be adequate to deter misappropriation of our proprietary information and intellectual property. Of particular concern are developing countries, such as China, where the laws, courts, and administrative agencies may not protect our intellectual property rights as fully as in the U.S. or Europe.\nWe seek to protect trade secrets and proprietary know-how, in part, through confidentiality and non-competition agreements with our collaborators, employees, and consultants. These agreements may be breached, we may not have adequate remedies for any breach, and our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by our competitors, or our competitors may otherwise gain access to our intellectual property.\nWe could incur substantial costs to defend ourselves in suits brought against us, including for alleged infringement of third-party rights, or in suits in which we may assert our intellectual property or contractual rights against others. An unfavorable outcome of any such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nKadant Inc.\n2015 Annual Report\nFailure of our information systems or breaches of data security could impact our business.\nWe operate a geographically dispersed business and rely on the electronic storage and transmission of proprietary and confidential information, including technical and financial information, among our operations, customers and suppliers. In addition, for some of our operations, we rely on information systems controlled by third parties. As part of our ongoing effort to upgrade our current information systems, we are implementing new enterprise resource planning software to manage certain of our business operations. As we implement and add functionality, problems could arise that we have not foreseen. System failures, network disruptions, and breaches of data security could limit our ability to conduct business as usual, including our ability to communicate and transact business with our customers and suppliers; result in the loss or misuse of this information, the loss of business or customers, or damage to our brand or reputation; or interrupt or delay reporting our financial results. Such system failures or unauthorized access could be caused by external theft or attack, misconduct by our employees, suppliers, or competitors, or natural disasters. In addition, the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures could be significant.\nOur share price fluctuates and experiences price and volume volatility.\nStock markets in general and our common stock in particular experience significant price and volume volatility from time to time. The market price and trading volume of our common stock may continue to be subject to significant fluctuations due not only to general stock market conditions but also to a change in sentiment in the market regarding our operations, business prospects, or future funding. Given the nature of the markets in which we participate and the volatility of orders, we may not be able to reliably predict future revenues and profitability, and unexpected changes may cause us to adjust our operations. A large proportion of our costs are fixed, due in part to our significant selling, research and development, and manufacturing costs. Thus, small declines in revenues could disproportionately affect our operating results. Other factors that could affect our share price and quarterly operating results include:\n-\nfailure of our products to pass contractually agreed upon acceptance tests, which would delay or prohibit recognition of revenues under applicable accounting guidelines;\n-\nchanges in the assumptions used for revenue recognized under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting;\n-\nfluctuations in revenues due to customer-initiated delays in product shipments;\n-\nfailure of a customer to comply with an order's contractual obligations or inability of a customer to provide financial assurances of performance;\n-\nadverse changes in demand for and market acceptance of our products;\n-\ncompetitive pressures resulting in lower sales prices for our products;\n-\nadverse changes in the process industries we serve;\n-\ndelays or problems in our introduction of new products;\n-\ndelays or problems in the manufacture of our products;\n-\nour competitors' announcements of new products, services, or technological innovations;\n-\ncontractual liabilities incurred by us related to guarantees of our product performance;\n-\nincreased costs of raw materials or supplies, including the cost of energy;\n-\nchanges in the timing of product orders;\n-\nchanges in the estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, or expenses;\n-\nthe impact of acquisition accounting, including the treatment of acquisition and restructuring costs as period costs;\n-\nfluctuations in our effective tax rate;\n-\nthe operating and share price performance of companies that investors consider to be comparable to us; and\n-\nchanges in global financial markets and global economies and general market conditions.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could prevent or delay transactions that our shareholders may favor.\nProvisions of our charter and bylaws may discourage, delay, or prevent a merger or acquisition that our shareholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which shareholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. For example, these provisions:\nKadant Inc.\n2015 Annual Report\n-\nauthorize the issuance of \"blank check\" preferred stock without any need for action by shareholders;\n-\nprovide for a classified board of directors with staggered three-year terms;\n-\nrequire supermajority shareholder voting to effect various amendments to our charter and bylaws;\n-\neliminate the ability of our shareholders to call special meetings of shareholders;\n-\nprohibit shareholder action by written consent; and\n-\nestablish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by shareholders at shareholder meetings.\nPrior to July 2011, we had a shareholder rights plan, which may have had anti-takeover effects under certain circumstances. This shareholder rights plan expired by its terms in July 2011 and was not renewed by our board of directors. However, our board of directors could adopt a new shareholder rights plan in the future that could have anti-takeover effects and might discourage, delay, or prevent a merger or acquisition that our board of directors does not believe is in our best interests and those of our shareholders, including transactions in which shareholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares.", "PERMNO": 78077, "SIC": 3550, "TIC": "KAI"}
