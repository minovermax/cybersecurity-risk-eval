RISK FACTORS\nSummary of Risk Factors\nBelow is a summary of the principal factors that make an investment in our Class A common stock speculative or risky. This summary does not address all of the risks that we face. Additional discussion of the risks summarized in this risk factor summary, and other risks that we face, can be found below under the heading \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and should be carefully considered, together with other information in this Form 10-K and our other filings with the SEC before making an investment decision regarding our Class A common stock.\n\u2022\nOur operating results may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control.\n\u2022\nWe have incurred significant losses since our inception and, while we reported positive net income in the year ended December 31, 2020, we may incur losses in the future.\n\u2022\nOur success will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for the costs of our products and related treatments will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other third-party payers and we do not know whether such reimbursement will be available or, if such reimbursement is available, the rate at which it will be available. The rate of reimbursement and coverage for the purchase of our products has been and may continue to be unstable, unpredictable and subject to changes in government and private payer policies that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Currently, not all of our products are covered by all payers.\n\u2022\nMany existing and potential customers for our products are members of GPOs and/or IDNs, including accountable care organizations or public-based purchasing organizations, and our business is partly dependent on major contracts with these organizations. Cost-containment efforts of our customers, GPOs, IDNs, third-party payers and governmental organizations could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\u2022\nMedicare, which is the major source of revenue for most of our customers, reimburses the same amount for most of our products and the products of our competitors targeting the same indication in the hospital outpatient setting. Because in some sites of care the reimbursement amount is not based on the cost we charge our customers for our products or the cost our competitors charge for products targeting the same indication, our customers may elect to use products cheaper than ours in order to increase their margins, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\u2022\nWe have identified a material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, and our management has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective. While we are working to remediate any material weakness or significant deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting, we cannot assure you that additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies will not occur in the future. If our internal control over financial reporting or our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud, which may cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and may lead to a decline in our stock price.\n\u2022\nWe face significant and continuing competition, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\u2022\nRapid technological change could cause our products to become obsolete and if we do not enhance our product offerings through our research and development efforts, we may be unable to effectively compete.\n\u2022\nTo be commercially successful, we must convince physicians that our products are safe and effective alternatives to existing treatments and that our products should be used in their procedures.\n\u2022\nOur failure to comply with regulatory obligations could result in negative effects on our business.\n\u2022\nThe FDA may determine that certain of our products that are, or are derived from, human cells or tissues, such as Affinity, NuCel, NuShield and ReNu, do not qualify for regulation solely under Section 361 of the Public Health Services Act, or PHSA. To the extent that any of these products are deemed not to be HCT/Ps or Section 361 HCT/Ps, the FDA may require that we revise our labeling and marketing claims for these products or that we suspend sales of such products until FDA approval is obtained, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\u2022\nBecause we depend upon a limited group of suppliers and manufacturers for our Apligraf, Affinity, Dermagraft and NuShield products, we may incur significant product development costs or experience material delivery delays if there is an interruption in supply from any one of these suppliers or manufacturers, which could materially impact sales of our products.\n\u2022\nWe are dependent on the proper functioning of our and third-party manufacturing facilities, our supply chain and our sales force, all of which could be negatively impacted by the global COVID-19 pandemic, or other factors, in a manner that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n\u2022\nSignificant disruptions of our information technology systems or breaches of information security could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\u2022\nOur patents and other intellectual property rights may not adequately protect our products.\n\u2022\nWe engage in transactions with related parties and the transactions present possible conflicts of interest that could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\u2022\nWe are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of Nasdaq Global Market rules and, as a result, qualify for exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements. The Controlling Entities, which include affiliates of certain members of our board of directors, will effectively control the outcome of all matters requiring shareholder approval, including charter amendments, mergers, consolidations and asset sales.\nRisk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with the information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other documents we file with the SEC. The risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material, but are not the only risks and uncertainties facing us. Our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies, such as overall U.S. and non-U.S. economic and industry conditions including a global economic slowdown, geopolitical events, changes in laws or accounting rules, fluctuations in interest and exchange rates, terrorism, international conflicts, major health concerns, natural disasters or other disruptions of expected economic and business conditions. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business operations and liquidity.\nRisks Related to Organogenesis and its business\nOur operating results may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control.\nWe are subject to the following factors, among others, that may negatively affect our operating results:\n\u2022\nthe announcement or introduction of new products by our competitors;\n\u2022\nfailure of government health benefit programs and private health plans to cover our products or to timely and adequately reimburse the users of our products;\n\u2022\nthe rate of reimbursement for purchases of our products by government and private insurers;\n\u2022\nany change in Medicare payment policy which provides a competitive advantage to our competitor\u2019s products;\n\u2022\nany change in government health benefit programs\u2019 and private health plans\u2019 policies regarding sales and reimbursement of durable medical equipment, including a prohibition on physician-owned DME supplier entities;\n\u2022\nwhether our products or our competitors\u2019 products are granted pass-through reimbursement status or included in the \u201cbundled\u201d reimbursement structure;\n\u2022\nour ability to upgrade and develop our systems and infrastructure to accommodate growth;\n\u2022\nour ability to attract and retain key personnel in a timely and cost effective manner;\n\u2022\nour ability to offer our wound care and surgical products and supplies using our existing sales force and distribution network;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to the expansion of our business, operations and infrastructure;\n\u2022\nchanges in, or enactment of new laws or regulations promulgated by federal, state or local governments;\n\u2022\ncost containment initiatives or policies developed by government and commercial payers that create financial incentives not to use our products;\n\u2022\nour inability to demonstrate that our products are cost-effective or superior to competing products;\n\u2022\nour ability to develop new products;\n\u2022\ndiscovery of product defects during the manufacturing process;\n\u2022\ninitiation of a government investigation into potential non-compliance with laws or regulations;\n\u2022\nissuance of government advisory opinions or program bulletins that could negatively affect one or more of our sales models;\n\u2022\nsanctions imposed by federal or state governments due to non-compliance with laws or regulations;\n\u2022\nrecall of one or more of our products by the FDA due to noncompliance with FDA requirements; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions as well as economic conditions specific to the healthcare industry.\nWe have based our current and future expense levels largely on our investment plans and estimates of future events, although certain of our expense levels are, to a large extent, fixed. We may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall. Accordingly, any significant shortfall in revenue relative to our planned expenditures would have an immediate adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Further, as a strategic response to changes in the competitive environment or to changes in laws and regulations, we may from time to time make certain pricing, service or marketing decisions (e.g., reduce prices) that could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Due to the foregoing factors, our revenue and operating results are and will remain difficult to forecast.\nWe have incurred significant losses since our inception, and may incur losses in the future.\nTo date, we have financed our operations primarily through debt and equity financings, and, with the exception of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, in which we are reporting net income of $17.9 million, we have incurred losses from operations in many years since our inception. Our loss was $40.5 million and $64.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $153.1 million. We expect to incur significant sales and marketing costs as we expand our operations to support the sale of our products. Our prior losses, combined with any potential future losses, may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, and our management has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective. While we are working to remediate any material weakness or significant deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting, we cannot assure you that additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies will not occur in the future. If our internal control over financial reporting or our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud, which may cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and may lead to a decline in our stock price.\nWe have historically had a small internal accounting and finance staff. This lack of adequate accounting resources has resulted in the identification of a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting. A \u201cmaterial weakness\u201d is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nAs disclosed in the Company\u2019s annual report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, our management team identified the following material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting: we did not design and maintain formal accounting, business operations, and information technology policies, procedures and controls to achieve complete, accurate and timely financial accounting, reporting and disclosures, including (i) formalized policies and procedures for reviews over account reconciliations, journal entries, and other accounting analyses and memos and procedures to ensure completeness and accuracy of information used in these review controls and (ii) controls to support the objectives of proper segregation of the initiation of transactions, the recording of transactions, and the custody of assets.\nAlthough we have made significant progress in remediating this material weakness, we concluded that the material weakness described above continued to exist as of December 31, 2020. Specifically, we are unable to conclude that the controls were operating effectively for a reasonable period of time. We commenced remediation efforts during 2018 that continued through 2020. We added additional accounting resources with requisite background and knowledge; we engaged external experts to complement internal resources; we began implementation of a new companywide enterprise resource planning system and we have designed more effective controls that should remediate these deficiencies once they have been implemented and have had sufficient time for them to operate effectively. We plan to continue to take additional steps to remediate the material weakness and improve our financial reporting systems and implement new policies, procedures and controls. If we do not successfully remediate the material weakness described above, or if other material weaknesses or other deficiencies arise in the future, we may be unable to accurately report our financial results, which could cause our financial results to be materially misstated and require restatement.\nRapid technological change could cause our products to become obsolete and if we do not enhance our product offerings through our research and development efforts, we may be unable to effectively compete.\nThe technologies underlying our products are subject to rapid and profound technological change. Competition intensifies as technical advances in each field are made and become more widely known. We can give no assurance that others will not develop services, products, or processes with significant advantages over the products, services, and processes that we offer or are seeking to develop. Any such occurrence could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe plan to enhance and broaden our product offerings in response to changing customer demands and competitive pressure and technologies, but we may not be successful. The success of any new product offering or enhancement to an existing product will depend on numerous factors, including our ability to:\n\u2022\nproperly identify and anticipate physician and patient needs;\n\u2022\ndevelop and introduce new products or product enhancements in a timely manner;\n\u2022\nadequately protect our intellectual property and avoid infringing upon the intellectual property rights of third parties;\n\u2022\ndemonstrate the safety and efficacy of new products, including through the conduct of additional clinical trials;\n\u2022\nobtain the necessary regulatory clearances or approvals for new products or product enhancements;\n\u2022\nachieve adequate coverage and reimbursement for our products; and\n\u2022\ncompete successfully against other skin substitutes and other modalities for treating wounds such as negative-pressure wound therapy and hyperbaric oxygen.\nIf we do not develop and, when necessary, obtain regulatory clearance or approval for new products or product enhancements in time to meet market demand, or if there is insufficient demand for these products or enhancements, our results of operations will suffer. Our research and development efforts may require a substantial investment of time and resources before we are adequately able to determine the commercial viability of a new product, technology, material or other innovation. In addition, even if we are able to successfully develop enhancements or new generations of our products, these enhancements or new generations of products may not be covered or reimbursed by government health benefit programs such as Medicare or private health plans, may not produce sales in excess of the costs of development and/or may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences or the introduction by our competitors of products embodying new technologies or features.\nTo be commercially successful, we must convince physicians that our products are safe and effective alternatives to existing treatments and that our products should be used in their procedures.\nWe believe physicians will only adopt our products if they determine, based on experience, clinical data and published peer reviewed journal articles, that the use of our products in a particular procedure is a favorable alternative to conventional methods. Physicians also are more interested in using cost-effective products and may practice in settings like Accountable Care Organizations, or ACOs, or Medical Homes, where they face considerable cost-containment pressure. In general, physicians may be slow to change their medical treatment practices and use of our products for the following reasons, among others:\n\u2022\ntheir lack of experience using our products;\n\u2022\nlack of evidence supporting additional patient benefits from use of our products over conventional methods;\n\u2022\npressure to contain costs;\n\u2022\npreference for other treatment modalities or our competitors\u2019 products;\n\u2022\nperceived liability risks generally associated with the use of new products and procedures;\n\u2022\nlimited availability of coverage and/or reimbursement from third-party payers; and\n\u2022\nthe time that must be dedicated to training.\nThe degree of market acceptance of our products will continue to depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe safety and efficacy of our products;\n\u2022\nthe potential and perceived advantages of our products over alternative treatments;\n\u2022\nclinical data and the clinical indications for which our products are approved;\n\u2022\nproduct labeling or product insert requirements of the FDA or other regulatory authorities, including any limitations or warnings contained in approved labeling;\n\u2022\nthe cost of, and relative reimbursement rate for, using our products relative to the use of our competitors\u2019 products or alternative treatment modalities;\n\u2022\nrelative convenience and ease of administration;\n\u2022\nthe strength of marketing and distribution support;\n\u2022\nthe timing of market introduction of competitive products;\n\u2022\npublicity concerning our products or competing products and treatments;\n\u2022\nour reputation and the reputation of the products;\n\u2022\nthe shelf life of our products and our ability to manage the logistics of the end-user supply chain; and\n\u2022\nsufficient and readily accessible third-party insurance coverage and reimbursement.\nIn addition, we are currently conducting clinical studies for some of our products that were brought to market as 361 HCT/Ps to generate efficacy data in various clinical applications. Unfavorable results from these 361 HCT/P clinical trials such as lack of clinical efficacy or serious treatment-related side effects could negatively affect the use and adoption of our products by physicians and hospitals, thereby compromising our market acceptance.\nWe believe recommendations for, and support of our products by, influential physicians are essential for market acceptance and adoption. If we do not receive this support (e.g., because we are unable to demonstrate favorable long-term clinical data), physicians and hospitals may not use our products, which would significantly reduce our ability to achieve expected revenue and would prevent us from sustaining profitability.\nIn the course of conducting our business, we must comply with regulatory quality requirements, adequately address quality issues that may arise with our products, as well as defects in third-party components included in our products. Although we have established internal procedures to minimize risks that may arise from quality issues, we may not be able to eliminate or mitigate these risks and quality issues may arise in which case we would be subject to liability. If the quality of our products does not meet the expectations of regulators, physicians or patients, then we could be subject to regulatory sanctions and our brand and reputation could suffer and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted.\nWe face the risk of product liability claims and may not be able to obtain or maintain adequate product liability insurance.\nOur business exposes us to the risk of product liability claims that are inherent in the manufacturing, processing, investigating and marketing of medical devices and human tissue products. We are, and may in the future be, subject to product liability claims and lawsuits, including potential class actions or mass tort claims, alleging that our products have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition or injury. Product liability claims may be made by patients and their families, healthcare providers or others selling our products. Defending a lawsuit, regardless of merit, could be costly, divert management attention and result in adverse publicity, which could result in the withdrawal of, or reduced acceptance of, our products in the market. If we cannot successfully defend against product liability claims, we could incur substantial liability and costs. In addition, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in:\n\u2022\nharm to our business reputation;\n\u2022\ninvestigations by regulators;\n\u2022\nsignificant defense costs;\n\u2022\ndistraction of management\u2019s attention from our primary business;\n\u2022\nsubstantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants;\n\u2022\nloss of revenue;\n\u2022\nexhaustion of any available insurance and our capital resources; and\n\u2022\ndecreased demand for our products.\nAlthough we have product liability insurance that we believe is adequate, this insurance is subject to deductibles and coverage limitations and we may not be able to maintain this insurance. Also, it is possible that claims could exceed the limits of our coverage or be excluded from coverage under our policy. If we are unable to maintain product liability insurance at an acceptable cost or on acceptable terms with adequate coverage or otherwise protect ourselves against potential product liability claims or we underestimate the amount of insurance we need, we could be exposed to significant liabilities, which may harm our business. One or more product liability claims could cause our stock price to decline and, if our liability exceeds our insurance coverage, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nInterruptions in the supply of our products or inventory loss may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur products are manufactured using technically complex processes requiring specialized facilities, highly specific raw materials and other production constraints. The complexity of these processes, as well as strict company and government standards for the manufacture and storage of our products, subjects us to production risks. In addition to ongoing production risks, process deviations or unanticipated effects of approved process changes may result in non-compliance with regulatory requirements including stability requirements or specifications. Most of our products must be stored and transported within a specified temperature range. For example, if environmental conditions deviate from that range, our products\u2019 remaining shelf-lives could be impaired or their safety and efficacy could be adversely affected, making them unsuitable for use. These deviations may go undetected. The occurrence of actual or suspected production and distribution problems can lead to lost inventories, and in some cases recalls, with consequential reputational damage and the risk of product liability. The investigation and remediation of any identified problems can cause production delays and result in substantial additional expenses. Production of our Affinity product, for example, was suspended in the first quarter of 2019 due to production issues at one of our suppliers. Although our supplier has implemented certain corrective measures, we have determined that the current process does not meet our production standards. As a result, we identified an alternate supplier, and were only able to resume commercial-scale production in the second quarter of 2020. This disruption in supply resulted\nin reduced Affinity revenue. Although we were able to partially offset the lost Affinity revenue by increasing production of our other products, there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in the event of any future suspensions or failures in the storage or manufacturing of Affinity, Dermagraft (including in connection with the expected suspension of manufacturing of Dermagraft in the fourth quarter of 2021) or our other products. Any future failure in the storage or manufacture of our products or loss in supply could result in a loss of our market share and negatively affect our revenues and operations.\nBecause we depend upon a limited group of suppliers and manufacturers for our products, including our NuShield, Affinity, Apligraf, Puraply Antimicrobial and Dermagraft products, we may incur significant product development costs and experience material delivery delays if we lose any significant supplier, which could materially impact sales of our products.\nWe obtain some of the components for our products from a limited group of suppliers. For us to be successful, our suppliers must be able to provide us with these components in substantial quantities, in compliance with regulatory requirements, in accordance with agreed upon specifications, at acceptable costs and on a timely basis. Our efforts to maintain a continuity of supply and high quality and reliability may not be successful. Manufacturing disruptions experienced by our suppliers may jeopardize our supply of these components. Due to the stringent regulations and requirements of the FDA regarding the manufacture of our products, we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for certain components or materials. A change in suppliers could require significant effort or investment in circumstances where the items supplied are integral to product performance or incorporate unique technology. A reduction or interruption in manufacturing, or an inability to secure alternative sources of raw materials or components, could have a material effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Due to our substantial indebtedness, one or more of our suppliers may refuse to extend us credit with respect to our purchasing or leasing equipment, supplies, products or components, or may only agree to extend us credit on significantly less favorable terms or subject to more onerous conditions. This could significantly disrupt our ability to purchase or lease required equipment, supplies, products and components in a cost-effective and timely manner and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Any casualty, natural disaster or other disruption of any of our sole-source suppliers\u2019 operations, or any unexpected loss of any existing exclusive supply contract, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur products are dependent on the availability of tissue from human donors, and any disruption in supply could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nMany of the products that we manufacture require that we obtain human tissue. The success of our business depends upon, among other factors, the availability of tissue from human donors. Any failure to obtain tissue from our sources will interfere with our ability to effectively meet demand for our products incorporating human tissue. The processing of human tissue for our products is very labor-intensive and it is therefore difficult to maintain a steady supply stream. The availability of donated tissue could also be adversely impacted by regulatory changes, public opinion of the donor process as well as our own reputation in the industry. The challenges we may face in obtaining adequate supplies of human tissue involve several risks, including limited control over availability, quality and delivery schedules. In addition, any interruption in the supply of any human tissue component could materially harm our ability to manufacture our products until a new source of supply, if any, could be found. We may be unable to find a sufficient alternative supply channel in a reasonable time period or on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIncreased prices for, or unavailability of, raw materials used in our products could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur profitability is affected by the prices of the raw materials used in the manufacture of our products. These prices may fluctuate based on a number of factors beyond our control, including changes in supply and demand, general economic conditions, labor costs, fuel related delivery costs, competition, import duties, excises and other indirect taxes, currency exchange rates, and government regulation. Due to the highly competitive nature of the healthcare industry and the cost containment efforts of our customers and third-party payers, we may be unable to pass along cost increases for key components or raw materials through higher prices to our customers. If the cost of key components or raw materials increases, and we are unable fully to recover these increased costs through price increases or offset these increases through other cost reductions, we could experience lower margins and profitability. Significant increases in the prices of raw materials that cannot be recovered through productivity gains, price increases or other methods could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe continue to invest significant capital in expanding our internal sales force, and there can be no assurance that these efforts will result in significant increases in sales.\nWe are committed to building and further expanding our internal sales and marketing capabilities, including the expansion of our sales force to support the marketing and sales of the products acquired in connection with our 2017 acquisition of NuTech Medical and our 2020 acquisition of CPN Biosciences. As a result, we continue to invest in a direct sales force for our products to allow us to reach new customers and potentially increase sales. These expenses impact our operating results, and there can be no assurance that we will continue to be successful in significantly expanding the sales of our products.\nThe impairment or termination of our relationships with independent sales agencies, whom we do not control, could materially and adversely affect our ability to generate revenues and profits. We intend to develop additional relationships with independent sales agencies in order to increase revenue from certain of our products; our inability to do so may prevent us from increasing sales.\nWe derive a portion of our revenues through our relationships with independent sales agencies. The impairment or termination of these relationships for any reason could materially and adversely affect our ability to generate revenues and profits. Because the independent sales agency often controls the customer relationships within its territory, there is a risk that if our relationship with the independent sales agency ends, our relationship with the customer will be lost. Also, because we do not control an independent sales agency\u2019s field sales agents, there is a risk we will be unable to ensure that our sales processes, regulatory compliance, and other priorities will be consistently communicated and executed by the distributor. If we fail to maintain relationships with our key independent sales agencies, or fail to ensure that our independent sales agencies adhere to our sales processes, regulatory compliance, and other priorities, this could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We may have liability for the actions of independent sales agencies in marketing our products and our lack of control over their activities impedes our ability to prevent, detect or address such non-compliance.\nWe intend to develop relationships and arrangements with additional independent sales agencies in order to increase our sales with respect to certain of our products. However, we may fail to develop such relationships, in which case we may not be able to increase our sales. Our success is partially dependent upon our ability to retain and motivate our independent sales agencies and their representatives to sell our products in certain territories. They may not be successful in implementing our marketing plans. Some of our independent sales agencies may not sell our products exclusively and may offer similar products from other companies. Our independent sales agencies may terminate their contracts with us, may devote insufficient sales efforts to our products, or may focus their sales efforts on other products that produce greater commissions for them, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We also may not be able to find additional independent sales agencies who will agree to market and/or distribute those products on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If we are unable to establish new independent sales agency relationships or renew current sales agency agreements on commercially acceptable terms, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, because we do not control these independent sales agencies as closely as our employees, while we may take steps to mitigate the risks associated with noncompliance by independent sales agencies, there remains a risk they do not comply with regulatory requirements or our requirements or our policies which could also adversely affect our business.\nWe will need to continue to expand our organization, and managing growth may be more difficult than expected.\nManaging our growth may be more difficult than we expect. We anticipate that a period of significant expansion will be required to penetrate and service the markets for our existing and anticipated future products and to continue to develop new products. This expansion will place a significant strain on management, operational and financial resources. To manage the expected growth of our operations and personnel, we must both modify our existing operational and financial systems, procedures and controls and implement new systems, procedures and controls. We must also expand our finance, administrative, and operations staff. Management may be unable to hire, train, retain, motivate and manage necessary personnel or to identify, manage and exploit existing and potential strategic relationships and market opportunities.\nWe may expand our business through acquisitions, similar to our acquisitions of NuTech Medical and CPN Biosciences, licenses, investments, and other commercial arrangements in other companies or technologies. Such acquisitions or commercial arrangements may entail significant risks.\nWe periodically evaluate strategic opportunities to acquire companies, divisions, technologies, products, and rights through licenses, distribution agreements, investments, and outright acquisitions to grow our business, such as our acquisitions of NuTech Medical and CPN Biosciences. In connection with one or more of those transactions, we may:\n\u2022 issue additional equity securities that would dilute our stockholders\u2019 value;\n\u2022 use cash that we may need in the future to operate our business;\n\u2022 incur debt that could have terms unfavorable to us or that we might be unable to repay;\n\u2022 structure the transaction in a manner that has unfavorable tax consequences, such as a stock purchase that does not permit a step-up in the tax basis for the assets acquired;\n\u2022\nbe unable to realize the anticipated benefits, such as increased revenues, cost savings, or synergies from additional sales of existing or newly acquired products;\n\u2022\nbe unable to successfully integrate, operate, maintain and manage our newly acquired operations;\n\u2022\ndivert management\u2019s attention from the existing business to integrate, operate, maintain and manage our newly acquired operations and personnel;\n\u2022\nacquire unknown liabilities that could subject us to government investigations and/or litigation or other actions that make it impossible to realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction;\n\u2022\nbe unable to secure the services of key employees related to the acquisition; and\n\u2022\nbe unable to succeed in the marketplace with the acquisition.\nAny of these items could materially and adversely affect our revenues, financial condition, and profitability. Business acquisitions also involve the risk of unknown liabilities associated with the acquired business, which could be material. Our acquisition of NuTech Medical and CPN Biosciences expanded our wound care portfolio and our acquisition of NuTech Medical broadened our addressable market to include the Surgical & Sports Medicine market. We may not realize the increased revenues, cost savings and synergies that we anticipate from this acquisition in the near term or at all due to many factors, including delays in the integration process, an inability to successfully penetrate the amniotic category of the wound care market or an inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals. Additional liabilities related to acquisitions could include lack of compliance with government regulations that could subject us to investigation and civil and criminal sanctions. For example, we may acquire a company that was not compliant with FDA quality requirements or was making payments or other forms of remuneration to physicians to induce them to use their products. Incurring unknown liabilities or the failure to realize the anticipated benefits of an acquisition could materially and adversely affect our business and we may lose our entire investment or be unable to recover our initial investment, which could include the cost of acquiring licenses or distribution rights, acquiring products, purchasing initial inventory, or investments in early stage companies. Inability to recover our investment, or any write off of such investment, associated goodwill, or assets, could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nNew lines of business or new products and services may subject us to additional risks.\nFrom time to time, we may implement or may acquire new lines of business, such as our Surgical & Sports Medicine products that were acquired in connection with our acquisition of NuTech Medical, or we may offer new products and services within existing lines of business. There are risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts, particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed or are evolving. In developing and marketing new lines of business and new products and services, we may invest significant time and resources. External factors, such as regulatory compliance obligations, competitive alternatives, lack of market acceptance, and shifting market preferences, may also affect the successful implementation of a new line of business or a new product or service. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business or new products or services could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nSignificant disruptions of information technology systems or breaches of information security could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe rely to a large extent upon sophisticated information technology systems to operate our business. In the ordinary course of business, we collect, store and transmit large amounts of confidential information (including, but not limited to, personal information and intellectual property). We also have outsourced significant elements of our operations to third parties, including significant elements of our information technology infrastructure and, as a result, we are managing many independent vendor relationships with third parties who may or could have access to our confidential information. The size and complexity of our information technology and information security systems, and those of our third-party vendors with whom we contract (and the large amounts of confidential information that is present on them), make such systems potentially vulnerable to service interruptions or to security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees or vendors, or from malicious attacks by third parties. Such attacks are of ever-increasing levels of sophistication and are made by groups and individuals with a wide range of motives (including, but not limited to, industrial espionage and market manipulation) and expertise. While we have invested significantly in the protection of data and information technology, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent service interruptions or security breaches. For example, in August 2020, our information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) systems were exposed to a ransomware attack, which partially impaired certain IT systems for a short period of time. We finished investigating the incident, together with legal counsel and other incident response professionals. We did not experience any material losses related to the ransomware attack and were able to recover all data quickly, with only a minimal and temporary interruption to our business. While we have implemented measures to protect our data security and information technology systems, such measures may not prevent these events. Although we have cyber-insurance coverage that may cover certain events described above, this insurance is subject to deductibles and coverage limitations and we may not be able to maintain this insurance. Also, it is possible that claims could exceed the limits of our coverage. Any interruption or breach in our systems could adversely affect our business operations and/or result in the loss of critical or sensitive confidential information or intellectual property, and could result in financial, legal, business and reputational harm to us or allow third parties to gain material, inside information that they use to trade in our securities.\nIf a breach of our measures protecting personal data covered by HIPAA, the HITECH Act, or the CCPA occurs, we may incur significant liabilities.\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the HITECH Act, and the regulations that have been issued under it, impose certain obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of protected health information. The requirements and restrictions apply to \u201ccovered entities\u201d (which include health care providers and insurers) as well as to their business associates that receive protected health information from them in order to provide services to or perform certain activities on their behalf. The statute and regulations also impose notification obligations on covered entities and their business associates in the event of a breach of the privacy or security of protected health information. We occasionally receive protected health information from our customers in the course of our business. As such, we believe that we are business associates and therefore subject to HIPAA\u2019s requirements and restrictions with respect to handling such protected health information, and have executed business associate agreements with certain customers.\nIn addition, California has enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d), which came into effect on January 1, 2020. Pursuant to the CCPA, certain businesses are required, among other things, to make certain enhanced disclosures related to California residents regarding the use or disclosure of their personal information, allow California residents to opt-out of certain uses and disclosures of their personal information without penalty, provide Californians with other choices related to personal data in our possession, and obtain opt-in consent before engaging in certain uses of personal information relating to Californians under the age of 16. The California Attorney General may seek substantial monetary penalties and injunctive relief in the event of our non-compliance with the CCPA. The CCPA also allows for private lawsuits from Californians in the event of certain data breaches. Aspects of the CCPA remain uncertain, and we may be required to make modifications to our policies or practices in order to comply.\nIt is possible the data protection laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our practices. If so, this could result in government-imposed fines or orders requiring that we change our practices, which could adversely affect our business. In addition, these privacy regulations may differ from country to country and state to state, and may vary based on whether testing is performed in the United States or in the local country. Complying with these various laws and regulations could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices and compliance procedures in a manner adverse to our business. Further, compliance with data protection laws and regulations could require us to take on more onerous obligations in our contracts, restrict our ability to collect, use and disclose data, or in some cases, impact our ability to operate in certain jurisdictions. We can provide no assurance that we are or will remain in compliance with diverse privacy and security requirements in all of the jurisdictions in which we do business. If we fail to comply or are deemed to have failed to comply with applicable privacy protection laws and regulations such failure could result in government enforcement actions and create liability for us, which could include substantial civil and/or criminal penalties, as well as private litigation and/or adverse publicity that could negatively affect our operating results and business.\nWe engage in transactions with related parties and such transactions present possible conflicts of interest that could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have entered into a significant number of transactions with related parties. Related party transactions create the possibility of conflicts of interest with regard to our management, including that:\n\u2022\nwe may enter into contracts between us, on the one hand, and related parties, on the other, that are not as a result of arm\u2019s-length transactions;\n\u2022\nour executive officers and directors that hold positions of responsibility with related parties may be aware of certain business opportunities that are appropriate for presentation to us as well as to such other related parties and may present such business opportunities to such other parties; and\n\u2022\nour executive officers and directors that hold positions of responsibility with related parties may have significant duties with, and spend significant time serving, other entities and may have conflicts of interest in allocating time.\nSuch conflicts could cause an executive officer or a director to seek to advance his or her economic interests or the economic interests of certain related parties above ours. Conversely, we may not be able to enter into transactions with third parties on terms as favorable as the terms of existing transactions with related parties. Further, the appearance of conflicts of interest created by related party transactions could impair the confidence of our investors. It is possible that a conflict of interest could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur financial performance may be adversely affected by medical device tax provisions in healthcare reform laws.\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the \u201cPPACA\u201d) imposed, among other things, an excise tax of 2.3% on any entity that manufactures or imports medical devices offered for sale in the United States. Under these provisions, the Congressional Research Service predicted that the total cost to the medical device industry may be up to $20 billion over a decade. The Internal Revenue Service issued final regulations implementing the tax in December 2012, which required, among other things, bi-monthly payments and quarterly reporting. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 (Pub. L. 114-113), signed into law in December 2015, included a two-year moratorium on the medical device excise tax. A second two-year moratorium on the medical device excise tax was signed into law in January 2018 as part of the Extension of Continuing Appropriations Act, 2018 (Pub. L. 115-120), extending the moratorium through December 31, 2019. On December 20, 2019, President Trump signed into law a permanent repeal of the medical device tax under the PPACA, but there is no guarantee that Congress or the President will not reverse course in the future. If such an excise tax on sales of our products in the United States is enacted, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe could incur asset impairment charges related to certain leasehold improvements, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur long-term assets include property, plant and equipment of $60.1 million and $47.2 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Approximately $21.7 million of each of these amounts is attributable to certain leasehold improvements that we made to the buildings we lease at 275 Dan Road as part of our Canton, Massachusetts corporate headquarters. We review our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The build out to this property was suspended prior to completion and we are currently evaluating our future use of this property. If we decide that we do not intend to complete this buildout, either due to insufficient funding for this purpose or other business reasons, then these assets would be impaired. If an asset is determined to be impaired, the asset is written down to fair value, which is determined based on appraised value. Any such impairment could result in a non-cash charge equal to the full value of these improvements. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we did not recognize an impairment charge in relation to these leasehold improvements. Changes in our assumptions with respect to our expected use of these assets may result in an impairment charge in the future, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if our goodwill and other amortizable intangible assets, or other investments become impaired.\nWe are required under generally accepted accounting principles to test goodwill for impairment at least annually and to review our goodwill, amortizable intangible assets, and other assets acquired through merger and acquisition activity, for impairment when events or changes in circumstance indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors that could lead to impairment of goodwill, amortizable intangible assets, and other assets acquired via acquisitions include significant adverse changes in the business climate and actual or projected operating results (affecting our company as a whole or affecting any particular segment) and declines in the financial condition of our business. We may be required in the future to record additional charges to earnings if our goodwill, amortizable intangible assets or other investments become impaired. Any such charge would adversely impact our financial results.\nWe are dependent on the proper functioning of our and third-party manufacturing facilities, our supply chain and our sales force, all of which could be negatively impacted by the global COVID-19 pandemic, or other factors, in a manner that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur ability to manufacture products may be materially adversely impacted by the coronavirus.\nCOVID-19 is continuing to impact worldwide economic activity. Estimates for economic growth have been reduced and may have a corresponding effect on our sales activity. The virus has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization and has spread globally to over 180 countries, including the United States. The impact of this pandemic has been and will likely continue to be extensive in many aspects of society, which has resulted in and will likely continue to result in significant disruptions to the global economy, as well as businesses and capital markets around the world. We, like many employers in the United States, have required (with limited exceptions) employees to work from home or not come into their offices or facilities. We manufacture our non-amniotic products and use third-party manufacturers for our amniotic products and we use third-party raw material suppliers to support our internal manufacturing processes. Our manufacturing facilities have, thus far, remained operational as \u201cessential\u201d services under applicable regulatory orders. If our manufacturing capabilities or the manufacturing capabilities of our suppliers are impacted as a result of COVID-19, it may not be possible for us to timely manufacture relevant products at the required levels or at all. A reduction or interruption in any of our manufacturing processes could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Further, remote work may disrupt our operations or increase the risk of a cybersecurity incident.\nWe also may be unable to obtain the raw materials necessary to support our internal manufacturing processes due to the additional constraints on suppliers created by COVID-19. Any delays in the delivery of these raw materials and delay manufacturing of our products may result in the cancellation of orders for our products.\nIn addition, the manufacture of our products is dependent on the availability of sufficient quantities of source tissue, which is the primary component of our products. Source tissue includes donated human tissue, porcine tissue and bovine tissue. We acquire donated human tissue directly through institutional review board approved protocols at multiple hospitals, as well as through tissue procurement firms engaged by us or by our contract manufacturers. Any failure to obtain tissue from our sources, including any failures related to COVID-19, will interfere with our ability to effectively meet demand for our products. Any interruption in the supply of source tissue could materially harm our ability to manufacture our products until a new source of supply, if any, could be found. We may be unable to find a sufficient alternative supply channel in a reasonable time period or on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur sales may be materially adversely impacted by the coronavirus.\nOur current Advanced Wound Care portfolio is sold throughout the United States via an experienced direct sales force, which focuses its efforts on wound care in various sites of care. We use a mix of direct sales representatives and independent agencies to service the Surgical & Sports Medicine market. These sales representatives are supported by teams of professionals focused on sales management, sales operations and effectiveness, ongoing training, analytics and marketing.\nOur direct sales force functions by meeting in person with physicians and health care providers to discuss our products. COVID-19 may negatively affect demand for our products by limiting the ability of our sales personnel to maintain their customary contacts with physicians and health care providers. We may also find that the independent agencies that we use will have to prioritize their workload and may be forced to slow their activities as a result of COVID-19. As a result, we cannot assure you that our direct sales representatives or independent agencies will increase or maintain our current sales levels, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. The support for our sales force may also be impacted, thereby reducing the effectiveness of our sales force.\nWe may also experience significant and unpredictable reductions in demand for certain of our products if patients are unable to access certain advanced therapies due to stay-at-home orders or providers prioritizing resources to address the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe impact of COVID-19 on economic activity, and its effect on our manufacturing facilities, supply chain and sales force is uncertain at this time and could have a material adverse effect on our results, especially to the extent theses effects persist or exacerbate over an extended period of time.\nOur ability to comply with financial covenants under our credit agreement and raise capital may be materially adversely impacted by COVID-19.\nWe have funded our operations and capital spending, in part, through third-party debt and proceeds from the sale of our Class A common stock. Our 2019 Credit Agreement requires that we comply with certain financial covenants that include maintaining Minimum Trailing Twelve Month Consolidated Revenue and Non-PuraPly Revenue, each tested quarterly. If we are unable to meet these financial covenants due to the economic impact of COVID-19 or otherwise, the borrowings under the 2019 Credit Agreement may become due and payable immediately unless we obtain an amendment from our lenders and we would be prohibited from making additional borrowings under the Revolving Facility if we have availably under that facility in the future. There can be no assurance that our lenders would agree to any such amendment on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, any sustained disruption in the capital markets from the COVID-19 pandemic could negatively impact our ability to raise capital from the offering of equity or debt securities.\nRisks Related to Regulation of Our Products and Other Government Regulations\nWe may encounter substantial delays or difficulties in our clinical trials.\nBefore obtaining marketing approval from regulatory authorities for the sale of our product candidates, we must conduct extensive clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the product candidates. Clinical testing is expensive, time-consuming and uncertain as to outcome. We have limited experience with clinical trials. We cannot guarantee that any clinical trials will be conducted as planned or completed on schedule, if at all. A failure of one or more clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing. Events that may prevent successful or timely completion of clinical development include:\n\u2022\nthe FDA may require additional clinical trials in connection with the approval of product candidates;\n\u2022\ndelays in reaching a consensus with the FDA or other regulatory authorities on trial design;\n\u2022\ndelays in reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations, or CROs, and clinical trial sites;\n\u2022\ndelays in opening clinical trial sites or obtaining required IRB or independent ethics committee approval at each clinical trial site;\n\u2022\nour decision or the requirement of regulators or IRBs to suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements, a finding that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks, or the imposition of a clinical hold as a result of a serious adverse event or after an inspection of our clinical trial operations or clinical trial sites;\n\u2022\ndelays in recruiting suitable patients to participate in our future clinical trials;\n\u2022\nfailure by us, any CROs we engage or any other third parties to adhere to clinical trial or regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nfailure by us, any CROs we engage or any other third parties to perform in accordance with Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, cGMPs, or applicable regulatory guidelines in the United States and other international markets;\n\u2022\nfailure by physicians to adhere to delivery protocols leading to variable results;\n\u2022\ndelays in the testing, validation, manufacturing and delivery of our product candidates to the clinical trial sites, including delays by third parties with whom we have contracted to perform certain of those functions;\n\u2022\ninsufficient or inadequate supply or quality of our product candidates or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials of our product candidates;\n\u2022\ndelays in having patients complete participation in a clinical trial or return for post-treatment follow-up;\n\u2022\nclinical trial sites or patients dropping out of a clinical trial at a rate higher than we anticipate;\n\u2022\nselection of clinical endpoints that require prolonged periods of clinical observation or analysis of the resulting data;\n\u2022\nreceipt of negative or inconclusive clinical trial results;\n\u2022\noccurrence of serious adverse events associated with the product candidate that are viewed to outweigh its potential benefits;\n\u2022\noccurrence of serious adverse events in clinical trials of the same class of agents conducted by other sponsors; and\n\u2022\nchanges in regulatory requirements and guidance that require amending or submitting new clinical protocols;\nReNu is in Phase 3 clinical development for the management of symptoms associated with knee OA. Simultaneously efforts are ongoing to initiate a clinical program to secure BLA approval for NuCel. Our anticipated timeline for these and other trials and studies on our clinical trial candidates may be subject to delays due to factors such as those discussed above.\nAny inability to successfully complete preclinical and clinical development could result in additional costs to us or impair our ability to generate revenues from product sales, regulatory, development and commercialization milestones and royalties. In addition, if we make manufacturing or formulation changes to our product candidates, we may need to conduct additional studies to bridge our modified product candidates to earlier versions. Clinical trial delays also could shorten any periods during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize our product candidates or allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do, which could impair our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates and may harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nSuccess in research and preclinical studies or early clinical trial results may not be indicative of results obtained in later trials. Likewise, preliminary, initial or interim data from clinical trials should be considered carefully and with caution since the final data may be materially different from the preliminary, initial or interim data, particularly as more patient data become available.\nResults from preclinical studies or early clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of future clinical trial results, and interim results of a clinical trial are not necessarily indicative of final results. Our clinical trial candidates, including ReNu, may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy in clinical development despite demonstrating positive results in preclinical studies or having successfully advanced through initial clinical trials or preliminary stages of clinical trials. From time to time, we have and may in the future publish or report preliminary, initial or interim data. Preliminary, initial or interim data from our clinical trials and those of our partners may not be indicative of the final results of the trial and are subject to the risk that one or more of the clinical outcomes may materially change as patient enrollment continues and/or more patient data become available. In this regard, such data may show initial evidence of clinical benefit, but as patients continue to be followed and more patient data becomes available, there is a risk that any therapeutic effects will not be durable in patients and/or will decrease over time, or cease entirely. Preliminary, initial or interim data also remain subject to audit and verification procedures that may result in the final data being materially different from such preliminary, initial or interim data. As a result, preliminary, initial or interim data should be considered carefully and with caution until the final data are available.\nThere is no guarantee that any of our clinical trials will be successful. In addition, there is a high failure rate for drugs, biologic products and cell therapies proceeding through clinical trials. Many companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in late-stage clinical trials even after achieving promising results in preclinical testing and earlier-stage clinical trials. Data obtained from preclinical and clinical activities are subject to varying interpretations, which may delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. Any such setbacks could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nObtaining the necessary regulatory approvals or clearances for certain of our products will be expensive and time-consuming and may impede our ability to fully exploit our technologies or otherwise limit our ability to meet other business objectives.\nAs biological products and medical devices, many of the products that we market require regulatory approvals or clearances from the FDA, or from similar regulatory authorities outside of the United States, before they may legally be distributed in commerce. In particular, such products may require FDA approval of Biologics License Applications, or BLAs, under Section 351 of the Public Health Service Act (the \u201cPHSA\u201d), Premarket Approval, or PMA, submissions under Section 515 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, or may require clearance under Section 510(k) of the FDCA. Although we believe that we have all necessary regulatory approvals or clearances legally required for the products that we currently market, the introduction of new or modified products may require us to secure new approvals or clearances. Additionally, the FDA may take the position that some of the products that we currently market without premarket approval or clearance in fact require such approval or clearance. The process of obtaining an approved BLA or PMA requires the expenditure of substantial time, effort and financial resources and may take years to complete. Although obtaining clearance under section 510(k) is somewhat less burdensome, it is also associated with significant costs and resource commitments. The fee for filing a BLA, PMA or 510(k) notification, and the annual user fees for any establishment that manufactures biologics or medical devices, as well as product fees applicable to each approved product are substantial.\nIn January 2021, we announced that the first patient was enrolled in the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of ReNu for the management of symptoms associated with knee OA. There are significant costs associated with conducting clinical trials to support approvals that cannot necessarily be estimated with any accuracy until investigational plans have been developed. Moreover, data obtained from clinical activities may show a lack of safety or efficacy or may be inconclusive or susceptible to varying interpretations, any of which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. Failure or delay can occur at any time during the clinical trial process. Success in preclinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful. Even product candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the required safety profile or meet the efficacy endpoints despite having progressed through preclinical studies and initial clinical trials. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials due to lack of efficacy or adverse safety profiles, notwithstanding promising results in earlier trials. We cannot be certain that we will not face similar setbacks. Even with positive clinical trial results, there may be other barriers to approval or clearance, and the FDA may not grant approval or clearance on a timely basis, or at all. Even if the FDA clears or approves our products, the clinical data submitted to the FDA may not be sufficient for payers to cover and/or adequately reimburse our customers for use of our products. Additionally, the FDA may limit the indications for use in an approval or clearance, or place other conditions on an approval, that could restrict the commercial application of the products.\nRegenerative medicine advanced therapy, or RMAT, designation for our product candidates may not lead to faster development or regulatory processes nor does it increase the likelihood that such product candidates will receive marketing approval.\nRMAT was introduced as a new designation under the 21st Century Cures Act for the development and review of certain regenerative medicine therapies. To receive RMAT designation, a regenerative medicine product candidate must be intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition with preliminary clinical evidence indicating that the drug has the potential to address unmet medical need. RMAT designation does not require evidence to indicate that the drug may offer a substantial improvement over available therapies, as breakthrough designation requires.\nAn RMAT product candidate receives intensive guidance on an efficient product development program; involvement of senior managers and experienced staff on a proactive, collaborative and cross-disciplinary review; and a rolling review. Regenerative medicine therapies that qualify for RMAT designation may also qualify for other FDA expedited programs, including fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, accelerated approval and priority review designation, if they meet the criteria for such programs. However, RMAT designation does not assure that marketing approval will be granted and, if granted, that the approval process would be any faster than it would have otherwise been.\nIn June 2021, we announced RMAT designation for ReNu for the management of symptoms associated with knee osteoarthritis (OA). However, there is no guarantee that the receipt of RMAT designation will result in a faster development process, review or approval for ReNu for the management of symptoms associated with knee OA or increase the likelihood that ReNu will be granted marketing approval for the management of symptoms associated with knee OA. Likewise, any future RMAT designation or other\nexpedited review status such as breakthrough therapy designation for any of our other product candidates neither guarantees a faster development process, review or approval nor improves the likelihood of the grant of marketing approval by FDA for any such product candidate compared to drugs considered for approval under conventional FDA procedures. In addition, the FDA may withdraw any RMAT or other expedited review status at any time. We may seek RMAT or breakthrough therapy designation for our other product candidates, but the FDA may not grant this status to any such product candidates.\nWe may seek fast track designation by the FDA for one or more of our product candidates, but we might not receive such designation, and even if we do, such designation may not actually lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process.\nIf a product is intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition and the product demonstrates the potential to address unmet needs for this condition, the treatment sponsor may apply for FDA fast track designation. Even if we receive fast track designation, fast track designation does not ensure that we will receive marketing approval or that approval will be granted within any particular timeframe. We may not experience a faster development, regulatory review or approval process with fast track designation compared to conventional FDA procedures. Additionally, the FDA may withdraw fast track designation if it believes that the designation is no longer supported by data from our clinical development program. Fast track designation alone does not guarantee qualification for the FDA\u2019s priority review procedures.\nA breakthrough therapy designation by the FDA for a product candidate may not lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process, and it would not increase the likelihood that the product candidate will receive marketing approval.\nWe may seek a breakthrough therapy designation for one or more product candidates. A breakthrough therapy is defined as a product candidate that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product candidate may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. For product candidates that have been designated as breakthrough therapies, interaction and communication between the FDA and the sponsor of the trial can help to identify the most efficient path for clinical development while minimizing the number of patients placed in ineffective control regimens. Product candidates designated as breakthrough therapies by the FDA are also eligible for priority review if supported by clinical data at the time of the submission of the NDA.\nDesignation as a breakthrough therapy is within the discretion of the FDA. Accordingly, even if we believe that one of our product candidates meets the criteria for designation as a breakthrough therapy, the FDA may disagree and instead determine not to make such designation. In any event, the receipt of a breakthrough therapy designation for a product candidate may not result in a faster development process, review or approval compared to product candidates considered for approval under conventional FDA procedures and it would not assure ultimate approval by the FDA. In addition, even if one or more of our product candidates qualify as breakthrough therapies, the FDA may later decide that the product candidate no longer meets the conditions for qualification or it may decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened.\nWe must comply with applicable post-marketing regulatory obligations, which could include obtaining new regulatory approvals or clearances.\nFollowing approval or clearance, some types of changes to the approved or cleared product, such as adding new indications or additional labeling claims or introducing manufacturing changes, are subject to FDA review and approval, which may require further nonclinical or clinical testing. The costs and other resource burdens associated with obtaining new regulatory approvals or clearances for existing or future products may limit the resources available to us to fully exploit our technologies or may otherwise limit our ability to carry out other business activities. Depending on the nature of the change, we may determine that the change may be carried out without obtaining premarket approval or clearance. The FDA or another regulatory body could disagree with our conclusion and require such premarket approval or clearance, which would disrupt the marketing of these products, potentially expose us to regulatory sanctions, and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe FDA may determine that certain of our products that are, or are derived from, human cells or tissues do not qualify for regulation solely under Section 361 of the PHSA, and may require that the products be removed from the market until we obtain premarket clearance or approval.\nCertain of the products that we manufacture, process and distribute are, or are derived from, human cells or tissues, including amniotic tissue. The FDA has specific regulations governing human cells, tissues and cellular and tissue-based products, or HCT/Ps. In particular, HCT/Ps that meet certain criteria set forth in the FDA\u2019s regulations at 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 1271.10 are regulated solely under Section 361 of the PHSA, so-called \u201cSection 361 HCT/Ps\u201d, and are not subject to any premarket clearance or approval requirements. They are also subject to less stringent post-market regulatory requirements than products regulated under Section 351 of the PHSA and/or under Sections 505, 510 or 515 of the FDCA. The Company has believed that certain of our HCT/Ps, including our products derived from amniotic membrane, qualify for regulation as Section 361 HCT/Ps. However, the regulatory classification of an HCT/P as a Section 361 HCT/P depends in part on the purposes for which the product is intended and in part on the processing to which an HCT/P is subject. On November 16, 2017, the FDA issued a final guidance document entitled, \u201cRegulatory Considerations for Human Cells, Tissues, and Cellular and Tissue-Based Products: Minimal Manipulation and Homologous Use\u201d, or 361 HCT/P Guidance, which provides FDA\u2019s current thinking on how to apply the existing regulatory criteria for regulation as a Section 361 HCT/P. These include, in addition to other requirements, requirements that an HCT/P be both minimally manipulated and intended for homologous use. In general, \u201cminimal manipulation\u201d is a standard referring to the degree to which the original characteristics of an HCT/P have been altered by processing and \u201chomologous use\u201d refers to the requirement that an HCT/P perform the same basic function in the donor as in the recipient. In light of the 361 HCT/P Guidance, our labeling and marketing claims for our amniotic membrane products, including our Affinity and NuShield products, clarify that they are intended as wound coverings, and thus meet the homologous use requirement to qualify as Section 361 HCT/Ps. However, the FDA could disagree with our conclusion and require premarket approval or clearance for Affinity, NuShield, or any amniotic or chorion-based sheet product we market, which would disrupt the marketing of these products, potentially expose us to regulatory sanctions, and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Cell- or tissue-based product that we distribute is deemed not to be an HCT/P or a Section 361 HCT/P, it will be subject to premarket clearance or approval requirements, as well as additional, more stringent post-market regulatory requirements. Further, we believe it is necessary to obtain FDA approval of a BLA for NuCel and ReNu because those products may be deemed to be more than minimally manipulated, not for homologous use, or otherwise not regulated as Section 361 HCT/Ps. We have begun enrolling patients in a Phase 3 trial for ReNu for the management of symptoms associated with knee OA. Simultaneously, efforts are ongoing to initiate a clinical program to secure BLA approval for NuCel.\nCompliance with applicable pre- and post-market regulatory requirements will involve significant time and substantial costs. We may also be required to suspend sales of NuCel and ReNu until FDA approval is obtained. Thus, any action by the FDA to apply the principles set forth in the 361 HCT/P Guidance to the HCT/Ps that we distribute could have adverse consequences for us and make it more difficult or expensive for us to conduct our business. The 361 HCT/P Guidance originally indicated that the FDA was providing a 36-month enforcement grace period to allow time for distributors of HCT/Ps to make any regulatory submissions and obtain any premarket approvals necessary to comply with the guidance. In July 2020, the FDA announced that the enforcement grace period would be extended until May 2021 as a result of the challenges presented by the COVID-19 public health emergency. If we are unable to obtain BLA approvals for NuCel and ReNu within the enforcement grace period, we may be required to suspend sales of those products until FDA approval is obtained. The ability to obtain approval for the uses for which the product is currently marketed cannot be assured. We cannot guarantee that the FDA will not take enforcement action during or after the grace period. Moreover, even for those products that will remain regulated as Section 361 HCT/Ps, increasing regulatory scrutiny within the industry in which we operate could lead to heightened requirements, compliance with which could be costly. The costs and other resource burdens associated with any of these regulatory outcomes may limit the resources available to us to fully exploit our technologies or may otherwise limit our ability to carry out other business activities.\nTo the extent that the FDA may determine that certain of our products that are, or are derived from, human cells or tissues do not qualify for regulation solely under Section 361 of the PHSA, the introduction of new tissue products would become more expensive, expansion of our tissue product offerings could be significantly delayed, and we could be subject to additional post-market regulatory requirements or suspension of product sales until FDA approval is obtained.\nAs stated above, in light of the 361 HCT/P Guidance, the FDA may determine that the types of cell- and tissue-based products that we distribute-and in particular, products derived from allografts consisting of human skin or amniotic tissue-are subject to premarket clearance or approval requirements. Should the FDA make such a determination, products of this type, including future products that we seek to introduce, will be much more costly to commercialize, as we will likely have to carry out preclinical work in animals and/or clinical trials in humans to support approval. Such preclinical work and clinical trials are expensive and time-consuming with no guarantee of success. In addition, these products will be subject to more stringent post-market regulatory requirements than those that currently apply, including but not limited to more stringent restrictions on advertising and promotion of these products, as well as more extensive adverse event reporting. In the future, we may also wish to market our existing HCT/P products for new intended uses that may render them ineligible for regulation as Section 361 HCT/Ps and cause them to require premarket clearance or approval under the medical device or biological product provisions of the FDCA and/or PHSA instead. Compliance with these requirements will involve significant time and substantial costs and could limit the resources available to us to fully exploit our technologies, including limiting our ability to introduce new allograft-derived products. Additionally, the FDA may not grant the necessary clearances or approvals or require us to suspend sales of NuCel and ReNu until FDA approval is obtained.\nWe conduct a range of nonclinical, as well as clinical trials, comparative effectiveness, economic and other studies of our products. Unfavorable results from these trials or studies or from similar trials or studies conducted by others may negatively affect the use or adoption of our products by physicians, hospitals and payers, which could have a negative impact on the market acceptance of these products and their profitability.\nWe conduct a variety of nonclinical and clinical trials, comparative effectiveness studies and economic and other studies of our products, including our ongoing clinical trial for ReNu, in an effort to generate comprehensive clinical and real-world outcomes data and cost effectiveness data in order to obtain product approval and drive further penetration in the markets we serve. In the event that these trials and studies, or similar trials and studies conducted by others, yield unfavorable results, those results could negatively affect the use or adoption of our products by physicians, hospitals and payers, thereby compromising market acceptance and profitability.\nOur business is subject to continuing significant regulatory obligations by the FDA and other authorities, compliance with which is expensive and time-consuming and may impede our ability to fully exploit our technologies or otherwise limit our ability to meet other business objectives.\nAside from the obligation to obtain regulatory approvals or clearances, companies such as ours have ongoing regulatory obligations that are expensive and time-consuming to meet. In particular, the production and marketing of our products are subject to extensive regulation and review by the FDA and numerous other governmental authorities both in the United States and abroad. As noted above, some of the products that we distribute are considered Section 361 HCT/Ps. The FDA\u2019s regulation of HCT/Ps includes requirements for registration and listing of products; donor screening and testing; processing and distribution, known as \u201cCurrent Good Tissue Practices,\u201d or cGTP; labeling; record keeping and adverse-reaction reporting; and inspection and enforcement. Moreover, it is likely that the FDA\u2019s regulation of HCT/Ps will continue to evolve in the future. Complying with any such new regulatory requirements may entail significant time delays and expense, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our other products are regulated as biologics and medical devices, which are subject to even more stringent regulation by the FDA. As noted above, these products are subject to rigorous premarket review processes, and an approval or clearance may place substantial restrictions on the indications for which the product may be marketed or the population for whom it may be marketed, may require warnings to accompany the product or may impose other restrictions on the sale and/or use of the product. In addition, approved and cleared products are subject to continuing obligations to comply with other substantial regulatory requirements, including the FDA\u2019s cGTP regulations, the FDA\u2019s QSR and/or the FDA\u2019s Current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP regulations, adverse event reporting, and FDA inspections. The costs and other resource burdens associated with maintaining regulatory approvals or clearances for our products and otherwise meeting our regulatory obligations may limit the resources available to us to fully exploit our technologies or may otherwise limit our ability to carry out other business activities\nIn some states, the manufacture, storage, or distribution of HCT/Ps requires a license or permit to operate as a tissue bank or tissue distributor. We believe that we have all required state licenses or permits applicable to the distribution of HCT/Ps, but there is a risk that there may be state or local license or permit requirements of which we are unaware or with which we have not complied. In the event that such noncompliance exists in a given jurisdiction, we could be precluded from distributing HCT/Ps in that jurisdiction and also could be subject to fines or other penalties. If any such actions were to be instituted against us, it could adversely affect our business and/or financial condition.\nThe American Association of Tissue Banks, or AATB, has issued operating standards for tissue banking. Compliance with these standards is a requirement in order to become an accredited tissue bank. In addition, some states have their own tissue banking regulations. In addition, procurement of certain human organs and tissue for transplantation is subject to the restrictions of the National Organ Transplant Act, or NOTA, which prohibits the transfer of certain human organs, including skin and related tissue for valuable consideration, but permits the reasonable payment associated with the removal, transportation, implantation, processing, preservation, quality control and storage of human tissue and skin. We reimburse tissue banks, hospitals and physicians for their services associated with the recovery, storage and transportation of donated human tissue. Although we have independent third-party appraisals that confirm the reasonableness of the service fees we pay, if we were to be found to have violated NOTA\u2019s prohibition on the sale or transfer of human tissue for valuable consideration, we, our officers, or employees, would potentially be subject to criminal enforcement sanctions, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nMany of the products we manufacture and process are derived from human tissue and therefore have the potential for disease transmission.\nThe utilization of human tissue creates the potential for transmission of communicable disease, including, but not limited to, human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, viral hepatitis, syphilis and other viral, fungal or bacterial pathogens. We are required to comply with federal and state regulations intended to prevent communicable disease transmission.\nAlthough we maintain strict quality controls over the procurement and processing of our tissue, there is no assurance that these quality controls will be adequate. In addition, negative publicity concerning disease transmission from other companies\u2019 improperly processed donated tissue could have a negative impact on the demand for our products. If any of our products are implicated in the transmission of any communicable disease, our officers, employees and we could be subject to government sanctions including but not limited to recalls, and civil and criminal liability, with sanctions that include exclusion from doing business with the federal government. We could also be exposed to product liability claims from those who used or received our products as well as loss of our reputation.\nDefects, failures or quality issues associated with our products could lead to product recalls or safety alerts, adverse regulatory actions, litigation, including product liability claims, and negative publicity that could erode our competitive advantage and market share and materially adversely affect our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition.\nQuality is extremely important to us and our customers due to the serious and costly consequences of product failure. Quality and safety issues may occur with respect to any of our products, and our future operating results will depend on our ability to maintain an effective quality control system and effectively train and manage our workforce with respect to our quality system. The development, manufacture and control of our products are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by numerous government agencies, including the FDA and similar foreign agencies. Compliance with these regulatory requirements, including but not limited to the FDA\u2019s QSR, GMPs and adverse events/recall reporting requirements in the United States and other applicable regulations worldwide, is subject to continual review and is monitored rigorously through periodic inspections by the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities. The FDA and foreign regulatory authorities may also require post-market testing and surveillance to monitor the performance of approved products. Our manufacturing facilities and those of our suppliers and independent sales agencies are also subject to periodic regulatory inspections. If the FDA or a foreign authority were to conclude that we have failed to comply with any of these requirements, it could institute a wide variety of enforcement actions, ranging from a public warning letter to more severe sanctions, such as product recalls or seizures, withdrawals, monetary penalties, consent decrees, injunctive actions to halt the manufacture or distribution of products, import detentions of products made outside the United States, export restrictions, restrictions on operations or other civil or criminal sanctions. Civil or criminal sanctions could be assessed against our officers, employees, or us. Any adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may restrict us from effectively manufacturing, marketing and selling our products.\nIn addition, we cannot predict the results of future legislative activity or future court decisions, any of which could increase regulatory requirements, subject us to government investigations or expose us to unexpected litigation. Any regulatory action or litigation, regardless of the merits, may result in substantial costs, divert management\u2019s attention from other business concerns and place additional restrictions on our sales or the use of our products. In addition, negative publicity, including regarding a quality or safety issue, could damage our reputation, reduce market acceptance of our products, cause us to lose customers and decrease demand for our products. Any actual or perceived quality issues may also result in issuances of physician\u2019s advisories against our products or cause us to conduct voluntary recalls. Any product defects or problems, regulatory action, litigation, negative publicity or recalls could disrupt our business and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may implement a product recall or voluntary market withdrawal, which could significantly increase our costs, damage our reputation and disrupt our business.\nThe manufacturing, marketing and processing of our products involve an inherent risk that our products or processes may not meet manufacturing specifications, applicable regulatory requirements or quality standards. In that event, we may voluntarily implement a recall or market withdrawal or may be required to do so by a regulatory authority. A recall or market withdrawal of one of our products would be costly and would divert management resources. A recall or withdrawal of one of our products, or a similar product processed by another entity, also could impair sales of our products as a result of confusion concerning the scope of the recall or withdrawal, or as a result of the damage to our reputation for quality and safety.\nAs a condition of our Gintuit BLA, a pediatric study was required to be conducted, and we did not complete this study by the deadline set forth in the BLA approval letter. Gintuit could therefore be subject to enforcement action if marketing is resumed without completion of the required pediatric study.\nSponsors of products for which the FDA has approved a BLA are obligated by the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, to carry out clinical trials of the products in pediatric populations, unless those requirements are waived. In 2012, we obtained FDA approval of a BLA for an oral tissue-engineered product to be marketed under the trade name Gintuit. Although Gintuit was not intended to be used in pediatric populations, the FDA imposed a requirement to conduct a pediatric study following approval. We originally planned to complete these studies within the timeframes established in the Gintuit approval letter. However, in 2014, we made a business decision to suspend commercialization of Gintuit; all manufacturing, commercial and clinical activities for the product were discontinued. At that time, we informed the FDA of this decision and requested suspension of the pediatric study requirement, at which time the FDA placed Gintuit on its discontinued products list. Notwithstanding our request that the pediatric study requirement be suspended, we were notified by the FDA on June 29, 2017 that the FDA had determined that we had not\ncomplied with our PREA obligations. We responded and submitted a formal request for an extension for the pediatric study requirement for Gintuit. However, on October 5, 2017, the FDA advised that our request had been denied. Although we believe that we are not currently subject to penalties for noncompliance because Gintuit is not on the market and there is accordingly no foreseeable use of the product in pediatric populations, the product could be viewed as misbranded and subject to seizure or other enforcement action if marketing is resumed without completion of the required pediatric study.\nWe are subject to various governmental regulations relating to the labeling, marketing and sale of our products.\nBoth before and after a product is commercially released, we have ongoing responsibilities under regulations promulgated by the FDA, the Federal Trade Commission, and similar U.S. and foreign regulations governing product labeling and advertising, distribution, sale and marketing of our products.\nManufacturers of medical devices and biological products are permitted to promote products solely for the uses and indications set forth in the approved or cleared product labeling. A number of enforcement actions have been taken against manufacturers that promote products for \u201coff-label\u201d uses (i.e., uses that are not described in the approved or cleared labeling), including actions alleging that claims submitted to government healthcare programs for reimbursement of products that were promoted for \u201coff-label\u201d uses are fraudulent in violation of the Federal False Claims Act or other federal and state statutes and that the submission of those claims was caused by off-label promotion. The failure to comply with prohibitions on \u201coff-label\u201d promotion can result in significant monetary penalties, revocation or suspension of a company\u2019s business license, suspension of sales of certain products, product recalls, civil or criminal sanctions, exclusion from participating in federal healthcare programs, or other enforcement actions. In the United States, allegations of such wrongful conduct could also result in a corporate integrity agreement with the U.S. government that imposes significant administrative obligations and costs.\nWe and our employees and contractors are subject, directly or indirectly, to federal, state and foreign healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including false claims laws. If we are unable to comply, or have not fully complied, with such laws, we could face substantial penalties.\nOur operations are subject to various federal, state and foreign fraud and abuse laws. These laws may constrain our operations, including the financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute our products.\nU.S. federal and state laws that affect our ability to operate include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe, or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind in return for, the purchase, recommendation, leasing or furnishing of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;\n\u2022\nfederal physician self-referral law, which prohibits a physician from referring a patient to an entity with which the physician (or an immediate family member) has a financial relationship, for the furnishing of certain designated health services for which payment may be made by Medicare, unless an exception applies;\n\u2022\nfederal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment or approval from Medicare, Medicaid, or other government payers that are false or fraudulent;\n\u2022\nSection 242 of HIPAA codified at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1347, which created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit a person from knowingly and willfully executing a scheme or from making false or fraudulent statements to defraud any healthcare benefit program (i.e., public or private);\n\u2022\nfederal transparency laws, including the so-called federal \u201csunshine\u201d law, which requires the tracking and disclosure to the federal government by pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers of payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals as well as ownership and investment interests that are held by physicians and their immediate family members; and\n\u2022\nstate law equivalents of each of these federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws that may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including commercial insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical and medical device companies to comply with their industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict certain payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws that require drug and medical device manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; state laws that prohibit giving gifts to licensed healthcare professionals; and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts in certain circumstances, such as specific disease states.\nIn particular, activities and arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, waste and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of activities or other arrangements related to the development, marketing or promotion of products, including pricing and discounting of products, provision of customer incentives, provision of reimbursement support, other customer support services, provision of sales commissions or other incentives to employees and independent contractors and other interactions with healthcare practitioners, other healthcare providers and patients.\nBecause of the breadth of these laws and the narrow scope of the statutory or regulatory exceptions and safe harbors available, our business activities could be challenged under one or more of these laws. Relationships between medical product manufacturers and health care providers are an area of heightened scrutiny by the government. We engage in various types of activities, including the conduct of speaker programs to educate physicians, the provision of reimbursement advice and support to customers, and the provision of customer and patient support services, that have been the subject of government scrutiny and enforcement action within the medical device industry.\nGovernment expectations and industry best practices for compliance continue to evolve and past activities may not always be consistent with current industry best practices. Further, there is a lack of government guidance as to whether various industry practices comply with these laws, and government interpretations of these laws continue to evolve, all of which create compliance uncertainties. Any non-compliance could result in regulatory sanctions, criminal or civil liability and serious harm to our reputation. Although we have a comprehensive compliance program designed to ensure that our employees\u2019 and commercial partners\u2019 activities and interactions with healthcare professionals and patients are appropriate, ethical, and consistent with all applicable laws, regulations, guidelines, policies and standards, it is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in preventing such conduct, mitigating risks, or reducing the chance of governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these laws or regulations.\nIf a government entity opens an investigation into possible violations of any of these laws (which may include the issuance of subpoenas or civil investigative demands), we would have to expend significant resources to defend ourselves against the allegations. Allegations that we, our officers, or our employees violated any one of these laws can be made by individuals called \u201cwhistleblowers\u201d who may be our employees, customers, competitors or other parties. Government policy is to encourage individuals to become whistleblowers and file a complaint in federal court alleging wrongful conduct. The government is required to investigate all of these complaints and decide whether to intervene. If the government intervenes and we are required to pay money back to the government, the whistleblower, as a reward, is awarded a percentage. If the government declines to intervene, the whistleblower may proceed on her own and, if she is successful, she will receive a percentage of any judgment or settlement amount the company is required to pay. The government may also initiate an investigation on its own. If any such actions are instituted against us, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant fines, and other sanctions that may materially impair our ability to run a profitable business. In particular, if our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or if we agree to settle with the government without admitting to any wrongful conduct or if we are found to be in violation of any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we, our officers and employees may be subject to sanctions, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from participation in government health care programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, imprisonment, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations and the imposition of a corporate integrity agreement, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe could be subject to legal exposure if we do not report the average sales prices, or ASP, to government agencies or if our reporting is not accurate and complete.\nOur products are reimbursed by Medicare in physician office settings at a rate of ASP plus 6%. Beginning on April 1, 2021, Medicare will again withhold 2% of the government\u2019s payment portion, which is 80% of the total payment amount. Currently, we are not required to report ASP for our products because they are regulated as medical devices by the FDA, although we have chosen to report ASP for some of our products. Starting in January 2022, we will be required to report ASP for all our products as a result of provisions included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2020. Government price reporting requirements are complex. If we do not report ASP correctly, we could be subject to civil monetary penalties and/or, if the violation is knowing or reckless, be subject to false claims act liability. In the case of very serious or repeated violations, we could be excluded from doing business with the Medicare program and other federal healthcare programs.\nWe face significant uncertainty in the industry due to government healthcare reform and other legislative action.\nThere have been and continue to be laws enacted by the federal government, state governments, regulators and third-party payers to control healthcare costs, and generally, to reform the healthcare system in the United States. For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (\u201cPPACA\u201d) and the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 substantially changed the way healthcare is delivered and financed by both governmental and private insurers. These changes included the creation of demonstration programs and other value-based purchasing initiatives that provide financial incentives for physicians and hospitals to reduce costs, including incentives for furnishing low cost therapies for chronic wounds even if those therapies are less effective than our products. There are ongoing efforts to modify or repeal all or part of PPACA. Tax reform legislation was passed that includes provisions that impact healthcare insurance coverage and payment such as the elimination of the tax penalty for individuals who do not maintain health insurance coverage (the so-called \u201cindividual mandate\u201d). Such actions or similar actions could have a negative effect on the utilization of our products. We expect such efforts to continue and that there may be additional reform proposals at federal and state levels. On December 18, 2019, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit upheld a lower court\u2019s determination in Texas v. Azar, 4:18-cv-00167, that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and remanded the case to the lower court for further analysis as to whether PPACA as a whole is unconstitutional because the individual mandate is not severable from other provisions of the law. The United States Supreme Court agreed to review the case and held oral argument on November 10, 2020. The Biden Administration has repealed executive acts that curtailed PPACA under the preceding administration and has declared its intent to vigorously defend the law against new and persisting legal challenges. The administration has also committed to seek legislative and administrative reforms that will build on innovations relating to health care reimbursement, coordinated care and law enforcement introduced by PPACA. We cannot predict the ultimate results of the Texas case or whether additional legislative reform proposals will be adopted, when they will be adopted, or what impact they may have on us, but any such proposals could have a negative impact on our business and provide incentives for hospitals and physicians to not use our products.\nGeneral legislative action may also affect our business. For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011 included provisions to reduce the federal deficit. The Budget Control Act, as amended, resulted in the imposition of reductions of up to 2% in Medicare payments to providers which began in April 2013 and are scheduled to remain in effect through 2025. However, the sequestration was suspended by Congressional action in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, which suspended the payment adjustment percentage of 2% applied to all Medicare Fee-For-Service (FFS) claims from May 1 through December 31, 2020. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021, signed into law on December 27, 2020, further extended the suspension period through March 31, 2021. Congressional action will be required to suspend the sequestration after March 31, 2021. These or other similar reductions in government healthcare spending could result in reduced demand for our products or additional pricing pressure.\nOur sales into foreign markets expose us to risks associated with international sales and operations.\nWe are currently selling into foreign markets and plan to expand such sales. Managing a global organization is difficult, time consuming, and expensive. Conducting international operations subjects us to risks that could be different than those faced by us in the United States. The sale and shipment of our products across international borders, as well as the purchase of components and products from international sources, subject us to extensive U.S. and foreign governmental trade, import and export and customs regulations and laws, including but not limited to, the Export Administration Regulations and trade sanctions against embargoed countries, which are administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control within the Department of the Treasury, as well as the laws and regulations administered by the Department of Commerce. These regulations limit our ability to market, sell, distribute or otherwise transfer our products or technology to prohibited countries or persons.\nCompliance with these regulations and laws is costly, and failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory obligations could adversely affect us in a variety of ways that include, but are not limited to, significant criminal, civil and administrative penalties, including imprisonment of individuals, fines and penalties, denial of export privileges, seizure of shipments and restrictions on certain business activities. Also, the failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory obligations could result in the disruption of our distribution and sales activities.\nThese risks may limit or disrupt our expansion, restrict the movement of funds or result in the deprivation of contractual rights or the taking of property by nationalization or expropriation without fair compensation. Operating in international markets also requires significant management attention and financial resources.\nWe could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws.\nThe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010, and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws, including the requirements to maintain accurate information and internal controls. We operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. There is no assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will protect us from acts committed by our employees or agents. If we are found to be liable for FCPA or other violations (either due to our own acts or our inadvertence, or due to the acts or inadvertence of others), we could suffer from civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions, including contract cancellations or debarment, and loss of reputation, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Reimbursement for our Products\nThe rate of reimbursement and coverage for the purchase of our products by government and private insurance is subject to change.\nSales of almost all of our products depend partly on the ability of our customers to obtain reimbursement for the cost of our products under government health benefit programs such as Medicare and Medicaid and from other global government authorities. Government health benefit programs and private health plans continuously seek to reduce healthcare costs. For example, in 2014, Medicare unexpectedly established a policy to stop making separate payment for our products in certain clinical settings. This policy required us to reduce prices for our products which caused significant reduction in our revenue. As of January 1, 2018, our PuraPly AM and PuraPly products no longer qualified for separate payments under Medicare and this change resulted in a reduction in our revenue as compared to prior periods.\nIn March 2018, the United States Congress passed, and the President signed into law, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018, or the Appropriations Act. The Appropriations Act restored the pass-through status effective October 1, 2018 for drugs or biologicals whose period of pass-through payment status ended on December 31, 2018 and for which payment was packaged into a covered hospital outpatient service furnished beginning on January 1, 2018; PuraPly and PuraPly AM met these conditions. As a result, PuraPly and PuraPly AM were included in the \u201cbundled\u201d payment structure from January 1, 2018 through September 30, 2018 after which time Medicare resumed making pass-through payments to hospitals when they use PuraPly and PuraPly AM in the outpatient hospital setting and in ASCs. PuraPly and PuraPly AM retained this \u201cpass-through\u201d reimbursement status through September 30, 2020. After September 30, 2020, PuraPly and PuraPly AM are bundled as are all of our other products. Our success will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for the costs of such products and related treatments will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other third-party payers and we do not know whether such reimbursement will be available. For example, currently most private payers provide limited coverage for our PuraPly AM, PuraPly, Affinity and NuShield products and as a result there is limited use of these products for patients covered by private payers.\nThe continuing efforts of government agencies, private health plans and other payers of healthcare services to contain or reduce costs of healthcare may adversely affect:\n\u2022\nthe availability of our products due to restricted coverage;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our customers to pay for our products;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain pricing so as to generate revenues or achieve or maintain profitability; and\n\u2022\nour ability to access capital.\nPayers are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both the breadth of coverage and the level of reimbursement, particularly for new therapeutic products generally or specifically for new therapeutic products that target an indication that is perceived to be well served by existing treatments. Specifically, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or PPACA, enacted in 2010 contains provisions for Medicare demonstration programs that create financial incentives to treat patients with chronic wounds conservatively and not use our products. Furthermore, all our products are not paid separately in the outpatient hospital setting which is our largest customer base. This payment policy has created incentives to use our competitors\u2019 products. Accordingly, even if coverage and reimbursement are provided, market acceptance of our products has been and will be adversely affected if access to coverage is administratively burdensome to obtain and/or use of our products is administratively burdensome or unprofitable for healthcare providers or less profitable than alternative treatments. In addition, reimbursement from Medicare, Medicaid and other third-party payers is usually adjusted yearly as a result of legislative, regulatory and policy changes as well as budgetary pressures. In fact, Medicare has signaled that it may discontinue its two-tier bundling policy because it solicited comments on alternatives in its calendar year 2019 rulemaking. Changes in the policy could occur as early as calendar year 2022 and could include the establishment of a single bundle for all products which could place our products at a significant competitive disadvantage. Possible reductions in, or eliminations of, coverage or reimbursement by third-party payers, or the denial of, or provision of uneconomical reimbursement for new products, as a result of these changes may affect our customers\u2019 revenue and ability to purchase our products. Any changes in the healthcare regulatory, payment or enforcement landscape relative to our customers\u2019 healthcare services also have the potential to significantly affect our operations and revenue. In addition, Medicare uses regional contractors called Medicare Administrative Contractors, or MACs, to process claims, develop coverage policies and make payments within designated geographic jurisdictions. While our products are currently covered by most MACs, we cannot be certain they will be in the future.\nWound care supplies, such as our product line acquired from CPN Biosciences, are subject to coding verification from CMS\u2019s Pricing, Data Analysis and Coding contractor (the \u201cPDAC\u201d). The PDAC is responsible for verifying the HCPCS Level II DMEPOS Codes for all wound care supplies. Our current wound care supplies sold through CPN have received coding verification from the PDAC and all products have HCPCS Level II codes. Additional wound care supplies that we develop or acquire will also be subject the PDAC coding verification process. We cannot guarantee the outcome of the PDAC coding verification process. If we are unsuccessful in receiving verification of the applicable HCPCS codes for our products, our wound care supplies could be ineligible for reimbursement or reimbursed at a lower rate than appropriate for our supplies.\nWhile we cannot predict the outcome of current or future legislation, we anticipate, particularly given the recent focus on healthcare reform legislation, that governmental authorities will continue to introduce initiatives directed at lowering the total cost of healthcare and restricting coverage and reimbursement for our products. If we are not successful in obtaining adequate reimbursement for our products from third-party payers, the market\u2019s acceptance of our products could be adversely affected. Inadequate reimbursement levels also likely would create downward price pressure on our products. Even if we do succeed in obtaining widespread reimbursement for our products, future changes in reimbursement policies could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe rate of reimbursement and coverage for the purchase of our products by government and private insurance (including by Medicare Administrative Contractors) is subject to uncertainty.\nOur products are subject to varying forms of governmental and private payor reimbursement, and fluctuations in these forms of payment may adversely affect our business. For example, in sites of service where payment for skin substitutes is based on the Average Sales Price (\u201cASP\u201d) methodology, Medicare pays for skin substitutes separately from the application procedure. In this case, the Medicare payment rate for all skin substitutes (including ours) is calculated based on the manufacturer\u2019s reported ASP on a per square centimeter basis. These rates are adjusted quarterly based on manufacturer ASP reporting, and the payment amount is ASP plus 6%; starting on April 1, 2021, the payment rate will be adjusted to ASP plus 4.3% under the statutorily-mandated sequestration. Currently, the Medicare statute does not require us to report ASP for our products because they are regulated by the FDA as medical devices. However, starting in January 2022, we may be required to report ASP for our products based on a provision within the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2020, signed into law on December 27, 2020.\nWhen ASP data are not available in the quarterly ASP file published by CMS (for instance for newer products), the Part A/B MACs establish payment for drugs and biologics in their jurisdiction(s). In these situations, MACs can update their reimbursement methodology as frequently as quarterly, without notice. MACs also have the discretion to establish coverage policies for all skin substitute products (including ours). Accordingly, even if coverage and reimbursement are provided, market acceptance of our products has been and will be adversely affected if access to coverage is administratively burdensome to obtain, use of our products is administratively burdensome, or is unprofitable for healthcare providers or less profitable than alternative treatments.\nOur PuraPly AM and PuraPly products transitioned off \u201cpass-through\u201d reimbursement status to a \u201cbundled\u201d reimbursement structure beginning on January 1, 2018, which has resulted in a decline in our PuraPly AM and PuraPly revenues as compared to prior periods. Although new legislation restored pass-through status for these products beginning on October 1, 2018, they again lost this preferred status on October 1, 2020, which could have a material adverse effect on our PuraPly revenue.\nUnder Medicare, our PuraPly AM and PuraPly products had pass-through reimbursement status through December 31, 2018 when used in the hospital outpatient and ASC setting. Hospitals and ASCs that use products with \u201cpass-through\u201d status receive a separate payment for the product in addition to the bundled payment, known as a \u201cpass through\u201d payment, resulting in a higher total reimbursement for procedures that use these products. \u201cPass through\u201d status is typically granted for a two to three year period in order to encourage the development of innovative medical devices, drugs and biologics. As of January 1, 2018, PuraPly AM and PuraPly transitioned to the \u201cbundled\u201d payment structure applicable to other skin substitutes, which provides for a two-tiered payment system in the hospital outpatient and ASC setting and results in a single payment to the provider that covers both the application of the product and the product itself. Under the Appropriations Act, the pass-through status of certain products, including PuraPly AM and PuraPly, was restored effective October 1, 2018 and they retained that status through September 30, 2020. As a result of the transition to the bundled payment structure, total Medicare reimbursement for procedures using our PuraPly AM and PuraPly products decreased substantially during the first nine months of 2018. This reduction in reimbursement resulted in a substantial decrease in revenue from our PuraPly AM and PuraPly products, which are key products in our portfolio, during the first nine months of 2018 and had a negative effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Although Medicare resumed making pass through payments for PuraPly AM and PuraPly products in the outpatient hospital and ASC setting on October 1, 2018 pursuant to the Appropriations Act, all other skin substitute products, including all of our other products, remain in the bundled payment structure. PuraPly AM and PuraPly transitioned back into the bundled payment structure on October 1, 2020. The loss of the pass-through payment status on October 1, 2020 may once again result in lower revenue for PuraPly AM and PuraPly which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFurthermore, Medicare has signaled that it may revise its two-tiered bundled payment policy for skin substitutes. Medicare solicited comments in rulemaking for calendar year 2019 related to proposed updates and policy changes under the Medicare Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS) and Ambulatory Surgical Center (ASC) Payment System. Medicare specifically solicited comments on whether it should eliminate the two-tiered bundle policy and establish a single bundle for all products. Based on the statements made in the proposed rule, it is possible that Medicare will revise its payment policy in calendar year 2022 or calendar year 2023. Any revised policy could result in decreased reimbursement for our products which could decrease utilization and reduce our revenues. Moreover, any new policy could result in a financial incentive for hospitals and ASCs to use our competitor\u2019s products, thereby reducing our market share and revenue.\nCost-containment efforts of our customers, purchasing groups, third-party payers and governmental organizations could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nMany existing and potential customers for our products within the United States are members of GPOs and/or IDNs, including accountable care organizations or public-based purchasing organizations, and our business is partly dependent on major contracts with these organizations. Our products can be contracted under national tenders or with larger hospital GPOs. GPOs and IDNs negotiate pricing arrangements with healthcare product manufacturers and distributors and offer the negotiated prices to affiliated hospitals and other members. GPOs and IDNs typically award contracts on a category-by-category basis through a competitive bidding process. At any given time, we are typically at various stages of responding to bids and negotiating and renewing GPO and IDN agreements, including agreements that would otherwise expire. Bids are generally solicited from multiple manufacturers or service providers with the intention of obtaining lower pricing. Due to the highly competitive nature of the bidding process and the GPO and IDN contracting processes in the United States, we may not be able to obtain or maintain contract positions with major GPOs and IDNs across our product portfolio. Failure to be included in certain of these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, while having a contract with a major purchaser, such as a GPO or IDN, for a given product category can facilitate sales, sales volumes of those products may not be maintained. For example, GPOs and IDNs are increasingly awarding contracts to multiple suppliers for the same product category. Even when we are the sole contracted supplier of a GPO or IDN for a certain product category, members of the GPO or IDN generally are free to purchase from other suppliers. Furthermore, GPO and IDN contracts typically are terminable without cause upon 60 to 90 days\u2019 notice. The healthcare industry has been consolidating, and the consolidation among third-party payers into larger purchasing groups will increase their negotiating and purchasing power. Such consolidation may result in greater pricing pressure on us due to pricing concessions and may further exacerbate the risks described above.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nOur patents and other intellectual property rights may not adequately protect our products.\nOur ability to compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology and manufacturing processes. We rely on manufacturing and other know-how, patents, trade secrets, trademarks, license agreements and contractual provisions to establish our intellectual property rights and protect our products. These legal means, however, afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights. The failure to obtain, maintain, enforce or defend such intellectual property rights, for any reason, could allow third parties to make competing products or impact our ability to develop, manufacture and market our own products on a commercially viable basis, or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn particular, we rely primarily on trade secrets, know-how and other unpatented technology, which are difficult to protect. Although we seek such protection in part by entering into confidentiality agreements with our vendors, employees, consultants and others who may have access to proprietary information, we cannot be certain that these agreements will not be breached, adequate remedies for any breach would be available or our trade secrets, know-how and other unpatented proprietary technology will not otherwise become known to or be independently developed by our competitors. If we are unsuccessful in protecting our intellectual property rights, sales of our products may suffer and our ability to generate revenue could be severely impacted.\nWe have filed applications to register various trademarks for use in connection with our products in various countries and also, with respect to certain products, rely on the trademarks of third parties. These trademarks may not afford adequate protection. We or these third parties also may not have the financial resources to enforce the rights under these trademarks which may enable others to use the trademarks and dilute their value. Additionally, our marks may be found to conflict with the trademarks of third parties. In such a case, we may not be able to derive any value from such trademarks or, even, may be required to cease using the conflicting mark. The value of our trademarks may also be diminished by our own actions, such as failing to impose appropriate quality control when licensing our trademarks. Any of the foregoing could impair the value of, or ability to use, our trademarks and have an adverse effect on our business.\nMost of the key patents related to our marketed products are expired. We have no patent protection covering, for example, our Apligraf, Dermagraft, or NuShield products. However, in addition to trade secrets, trademarks, know-how and other unpatented technology, we have pursued and plan to continue to pursue patent protection where we believe that doing so offers potential commercial benefits. However, we may be incorrect in our assessments of whether or when to pursue patent protection. Moreover, patents may not issue from any of our pending patent applications. Even if we obtain or in-license issued patents, such patent rights may not provide valid patent protection sufficiently broad to prevent any third party from developing, using or commercializing products that are similar or functionally equivalent to our products or technologies, or otherwise provide any competitive advantage. In addition, these patent rights may be challenged, revoked, invalidated, infringed or circumvented by third parties. Laws relating to such rights may in the future be changed or withdrawn in a manner adverse to us.\nAdditionally, our products or the technologies or processes used to formulate or manufacture our products may now, or in the future, infringe the patent rights of third parties. It is also possible that third parties will obtain patent or other proprietary rights that might be necessary or useful for the development, manufacture or sale of our products. In such cases, we may need or choose to obtain licenses for intellectual property rights from others and it is possible that we may not be able to obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.\nPending and future intellectual property litigation could be costly and disruptive and may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe operate in an industry characterized by extensive intellectual property litigation. Defending intellectual property litigation is expensive and complex, takes significant time and diverts management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, and the outcomes are difficult to predict. We have in the past been subject to claims that our products or technology violate a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, and we may be subject to such assertions in the future. Any pending or future intellectual property litigation may result in significant damage awards, including treble damages under certain circumstances, and injunctions that could prevent the manufacture and sale of affected products or could force us to seek a license and/or make significant royalty or other payments in order to continue selling the affected products. Such licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. We have in the past and may in the future choose to settle disputes involving third-party intellectual property by taking a license. Such licenses or other settlements may involve, for example, upfront payments, yearly maintenance fees and royalties. At any given time, we are involved as either a plaintiff or a defendant in a number of intellectual property actions, the outcomes of which may not be known for prolonged periods of time. A successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement or misappropriation against us could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be subject to damages resulting from claims that we, our employees, or our independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets, proprietary or confidential information of our competitors or are in breach of non-competition or non-solicitation agreements with our competitors.\nSome of our employees were previously employed at other medical device, pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies. We may also hire additional employees who are currently employed at other medical device, pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies, including our competitors. Additionally, consultants or other independent agents with which we may contract may be or have been in a contractual arrangement with one or more of our competitors. Although no claims are currently pending, we may be subject to claims that we, our employees, or our independent contractors have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of these former employers or competitors. In addition, we have been and may in the future be subject to claims that we caused an employee to breach the terms of his or her non-competition or non-solicitation agreement. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management. If we fail to defend such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. There can be no assurance that this type of litigation will not continue, and any future litigation or the threat thereof may adversely affect our ability to hire additional direct sales representatives, or other personnel. A loss of key personnel or their work product could hamper or prevent our ability to market existing or new products, which could severely harm our business.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or other intellectual property, which could be expensive, time-consuming and ultimately unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe or misappropriate the patents or other intellectual property that we own or license. In response, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming. Any claims we assert against perceived infringers could provoke these parties to assert counterclaims against us, such as alleging that we infringe their patents. In addition, in a patent infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent that we own or license is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, construe the patent\u2019s claims narrowly or conclude that there is no infringement. An adverse result in any litigation or defense proceeding could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing.\nInterference proceedings provoked by third parties or brought by us may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to the patents or patent applications that we own or license. An unfavorable outcome could require us to cease using the invention or attempt to license rights to it from the prevailing party. Our business could be harmed if the prevailing party does not offer us a license on commercially reasonable terms. Our defense of litigation or interference proceedings may fail and, even if successful, may result in substantial costs and distract our management and other employees. We may not be able to prevent, alone or with our licensors, misappropriation of our intellectual property rights, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect those rights as fully as in the United States.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets and know-how, our business and competitive position would be harmed.\nWe seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by entering into confidentiality and assignment of inventions agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and contractors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. Despite our efforts, agreements may be breached and security measures may fail, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach or failure. In addition, our trade secrets and know-how may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. Moreover, if any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent them, or those to whom they communicate it, from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor, our competitive position would be harmed.\nWe may be subject to claims challenging the inventorship or ownership of the patents and other intellectual property that we own or license.\nWe may be subject to claims that former employees, collaborators or other third parties have an ownership interest in the patents and intellectual property that we own or license. While it is our policy to require our employees and contractors who may be involved in the development of intellectual property to execute agreements obligating them to assign such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who in fact develops intellectual property that we regard as our own; our licensors may face similar obstacles. We could be subject to ownership disputes arising, for example, from conflicting obligations of consultants or others who are involved in developing our product candidates. Litigation may be necessary to defend against any claims challenging inventorship or ownership. If we fail in defending any such claims, we may have to pay monetary damages and may lose valuable intellectual property rights, such as exclusive ownership of, or right to use, intellectual property, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nObtaining and maintaining patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nPeriodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees and other fees on patents and patent applications will be due to be paid to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and similar foreign agencies in several stages over the lifetime of the patents and patent applications. We rely on our outside counsel to pay these fees due to foreign patent agencies. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and various foreign patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other provisions during the patent application process. We employ law firms and other professionals to help us comply, and in many cases, an inadvertent lapse can be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules. However, there are situations in which non-compliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, potential competitors might be able to enter the market, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in U.S. patent law could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our products.\nSuccess in the biopharmaceutical industry is heavily dependent on intellectual property, particularly patents. Obtaining and enforcing patents in the pharmaceutical industry involve both technological and legal complexity, and therefore obtaining and enforcing pharmaceutical patents is costly, time-consuming and inherently uncertain.\nRecent patent reform legislation could increase the uncertainties and costs of prosecuting patent applications and enforcing and defending patents. Enacted in 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the Leahy-Smith Act, made significant changes to U.S. patent law, including provisions that affect the prosecution of patent applications and also affect patent litigation. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office developed new regulations and procedures to govern administration of the Leahy-Smith Act, and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the Leahy-Smith Act, including the first to file provisions, only became effective in March 2013. The full impact of the Leahy-Smith Act on our business is not yet clear, but it could result in increased costs and more limited patent protection, either of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nMoreover, recent U.S. Supreme Court rulings have narrowed the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances and weakened the rights of patent owners in certain situations. In addition to increasing uncertainty regarding our ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty regarding the value of any patents we do obtain. Depending on decisions by the U.S. Congress, the federal courts, and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce any current or future patents that we may own or license.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nOur substantial indebtedness may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $70 million of aggregate principal amount of indebtedness outstanding under our 2019 Credit Agreement. Our substantial level of indebtedness increases the risk that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay amounts due in respect of our indebtedness. Our substantial indebtedness could have other important consequences to our debt holders and significant effects on our business. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to making payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022\nexpose us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings are at variable rates, and we may not be able to enter into interest rate swaps and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk;\n\u2022\nrestrict us from capitalizing on business opportunities;\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult to satisfy our financial obligations, including payments on our indebtedness;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our business strategy or other general corporate purposes.\nIn addition, the credit agreements governing our senior secured and subordinated credit facilities collateralize substantially all of our personal property and assets, including our intellectual property, and contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interests. Our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of our indebtedness.\nDespite our current level of indebtedness, we may incur substantially more debt. This could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial leverage.\nWe may incur significant additional indebtedness in the future. Although the credit agreements governing our senior secured and subordinated credit facilities limit our ability and the ability of our present and future subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness, the terms of the senior secured and subordinated credit facilities permit us to incur significant additional indebtedness under certain circumstances. In addition, the credit agreements governing our senior secured and subordinated credit facilities do not prohibit us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness as defined therein. To the extent that we incur additional indebtedness or such other obligations, the risk associated with our substantial indebtedness described above, including our potential inability to service our debt, will increase.\nWe will require a significant amount of cash to service our debt, and our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control, and any failure to meet our debt service obligations could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund working capital needs and planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.\nIf our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or if future borrowings are not available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before the maturity thereof, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments or seek to raise additional capital, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we may not be able to effect any of these actions, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our ability to restructure or refinance our indebtedness will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. The terms of existing or future debt instruments, including the credit agreements governing our senior and subordinated secured credit facilities, may limit or prevent us from taking any of these actions. In addition, any failure to make scheduled payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service obligations, or to refinance or restructure our obligations on commercially reasonable terms or at all, would have an adverse effect, which could be material, on our business, results of operations and financial condition, as well as on our ability to satisfy our obligations in respect of the senior and subordinated secured credit facilities and our other indebtedness.\nOur failure to comply with the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness, including as a result of events beyond our control, could result in an event of default that could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf there were an event of default under any of the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness, the holders of the defaulted debt could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to be due and payable immediately. We cannot guarantee that our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments if accelerated upon an event of default. Further, if we are unable to repay, refinance or restructure our indebtedness under our secured debt, the holders of such debt could proceed against the collateral securing that indebtedness. In addition, any event of default or declaration of acceleration under one debt instrument could also result in an event of default under one or more of our other debt instruments. As a result, any default by us on our indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe credit agreements governing our senior secured credit facility and our subordinated credit facility restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions.\nThe credit agreements governing our senior secured credit facility and our subordinated credit facility are collateralized by substantially all of our assets, including our intellectual property, and impose significant operating and financial restrictions and limit our ability and our other restricted subsidiaries\u2019 ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness for borrowed money and guarantee indebtedness;\n\u2022\npay dividends or make other distributions in respect of, or repurchase or redeem, capital stock;\n\u2022\nenter into any new line of business not reasonably related to our existing business;\n\u2022\nprepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt;\n\u2022\nmake loans and investments;\n\u2022\nsell or otherwise dispose of assets;\n\u2022\nincur liens;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022\nenter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to pay dividends; and consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets.\nAs a result of these covenants and restrictions, we are and will be limited in how we conduct our business, and we may be unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities. In addition, our senior secured credit facility requires us to comply with a minimum consolidated revenue covenant (measured on a trailing twelve month basis) and a minimum monthly liquidity ratio (measured as of the last day of each month). The operating and financial restrictions and covenants in the senior secured credit facility, as well as any future financing agreements that we may enter into, may restrict our ability to finance our operations, engage in business activities or expand or fully pursue our business strategies. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, and we may not be able to meet those covenants. For example, in the past, we have not been in compliance with certain financial covenants in our debt agreements, which may occur again in the future. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to maintain compliance with these covenants in the future and, if we fail to do so, that we will be able to obtain waivers from the lenders and/or amend the covenants.\nOur failure to comply with the restrictive covenants described above as well as others contained in our future debt instruments from time to time could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could result in our being required to repay these borrowings before their due date. If we are forced to refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Class A Common Stock\nThere can be no assurance that the Company\u2019s Class A common stock will continue to be listed on Nasdaq or that that the Company will be able to comply with the continued listing standards of Nasdaq.\nOur Class A common stock is listed on Nasdaq under the symbol \u201cORGO\u201d. Trading of our Class A common stock and public warrants was suspended as a result of the redemption on October 31, 2018 of all of AHPAC\u2019s public shares. On November 2, 2018, as a result of the redemption of the public shares, Nasdaq issued a delisting notice in respect of the AHPAC units, AHPAC Class A ordinary shares and AHPAC warrants to purchase Class A ordinary shares. On November 9, 2018, AHPAC submitted a request for an oral hearing before the Hearings Panel to appeal the delisting determination pursuant to the procedures set forth in the Nasdaq rules. That hearing occurred on December 13, 2018 and on January 4, 2019, Nasdaq notified us that the Hearings Panel granted our request for the continued listing of our Class A common stock and lifted the trading suspension at the open of the market on January 8, 2019. Pursuant to the Hearing Panel\u2019s decision, on or before March 31, 2019, we were required to demonstrate to the satisfaction of Staff and the Hearings Panel that we had a minimum of 300 round lot stockholders and that we otherwise meet all applicable requirements for listing on Nasdaq. The Hearings Panel determined to delist our public warrants due to our non-compliance with the minimum 400 round lot holder requirement for initial listing on Nasdaq, as required by Nasdaq Listing Rule 5515(a)(4). On March 12, 2019, the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC filed a Form 25 with the SEC to delist the public warrants. The delisting became effective on March 22, 2019 (ten days after the Form 25 was filed). In connection with our exchange offer in the summer of 2019, we issued an aggregate of 2,925,731 shares of our Class A commons stock in exchange for all outstanding public warrants, which, until such time, traded \u201cover-the-counter\u201d under the trading symbol \u201cORGOW.\u201d Even though the Company was able to regain compliance with the Nasdaq listing standards with respect to its Class A common stock, the Company can provide no assurance that it can maintain compliance with those standards.\nIf Nasdaq delists the Company\u2019s Class A common stock from trading on its exchange for failure to meet the listing standards, the Company\u2019s stockholders could face significant material adverse consequences including:\n\u2022\na limited availability of market quotations for the Company\u2019s securities;\n\u2022\nreduced liquidity for the Company\u2019s securities;\n\u2022\na determination that the Company\u2019s Class A common stock is a \u201cpenny stock\u201d which will require brokers trading in the Company\u2019s Class A common stock to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for the Company\u2019s securities;\n\u2022\na limited amount of news and analyst coverage; and\n\u2022\na decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nWe are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of Nasdaq rules and, as a result, qualify for exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements.\nAlan A. Ades, Albert Erani and Glenn H. Nussdorf, members of our Board of Directors, together with Dennis Erani, Starr Wisdom and certain of their respective affiliates, who we refer to collectively as the Controlling Entities, control a majority of the voting power of the Company\u2019s outstanding Class A common stock. Such Controlling Entities entered into a Controlling Stockholders Agreement providing for nomination rights of the Controlling Entities with respect to four directors of the Company and qualifying the Company as a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d under the Nasdaq listing rules. Under the Nasdaq rules, a listed company of which more than 50.0% of the voting power for the election of directors is held by any person or group of persons acting together is a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d and may elect not to comply with certain Nasdaq corporate governance requirements, including the requirement (i) that a majority of the Board of Directors consist of independent directors, (ii) to have a governance committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee\u2019s purpose and responsibilities, (iii) to have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee\u2019s purpose and responsibilities, (iv) that the compensation committee consider certain independence factors when engaging legal counsel and other committee advisors and (v) for an annual performance evaluation of the governance and compensation committees. We expect to continue to be treated as a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, you may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the Nasdaq corporate governance requirements.\nThe Controlling Entities control us, and their interests may conflict with yours in the future.\nAs of February 28, 2021, the Controlling Entities collectively beneficially own approximately 54% of the Company\u2019s Class A common stock. As a result of this voting control, the Controlling Entities collectively can effectively determine the outcome of all matters requiring stockholder approval, including, but not limited to, the election and removal of the Company\u2019s directors (subject to any contractual designation rights), as well as other matters of corporate or management policy (such as potential mergers or acquisitions, payment of dividends, asset sales, and amendments to the Company\u2019s certificate of incorporation and bylaws). This concentration of ownership may delay or deter possible changes in control and limit the liquidity of the trading market for the Company\u2019s Class A common stock, which may reduce the value of an investment in its Class A common stock. This voting control could also deprive stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their shares of Class A common stock as part of a potential sale of the Company. So long as the Controlling Entities and their affiliates continue to own a significant amount of the Company\u2019s combined voting power, even if less than 50.0%, they may continue to be able to strongly influence or effectively control its decisions. The interests of the Controlling Entities and their affiliates may not coincide with the interests of other holders of the Company Class A common stock.\nIn the ordinary course of their business activities, the Controlling Entities and their affiliates may engage in activities where their interests conflict with our interests or those of our other stockholders. In addition, the Controlling Entities may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures and other transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance their investment, even though such transactions might involve risks to you.\nThe Company bylaws designate the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, to the fullest extent permitted by law, as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by the Company stockholders, which could limit the ability of the Company stockholders to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with the Company or with directors, officers or employees of the Company and may discourage stockholders from bringing such claims.\nUnder the Company bylaws, unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the sole and exclusive forum will be the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware for:\n\u2022\nany derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company;\n\u2022\nany action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by, or any wrongdoing by, any director, officer or employee of the Company to the Company or the Company\u2019s stockholders;\n\u2022\nany action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, the certificate of incorporation (including as it may be amended from time to time), or the bylaws;\n\u2022\nany action to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of the certificate of incorporation or the bylaws; or\n\u2022\nany action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in each case, except for, (1) any action as to which the Court of Chancery determines that there is an indispensable party not subject to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery (and the indispensable party does not consent to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery within ten (10) days following such determination) and (2) any action asserted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, for which federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction.\nThese provisions of the Company\u2019s certificate of incorporation and bylaws could limit the ability of the Company stockholders to obtain a favorable judicial forum for certain disputes with the Company or with its directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against the Company and its directors, officers and employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of the Company\u2019s certificate of incorporation or bylaws inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the types of actions or proceedings listed above including, without limitation, any actions asserted under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Company may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, there is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce the Company\u2019s forum selection provision with respect to any actions asserted under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, as investors cannot waive compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.\nProvisions in the Company\u2019s charter may inhibit a takeover of the Company, which could limit the price investors might be willing to pay in the future for the Company Class A common stock and could entrench management.\nThe Company\u2019s certificate of incorporation contains provisions that may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals that shareholders may consider to be in their best interests. These provisions include the ability of the Board of Directors to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred shares, which may make more difficult the removal of management and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for the Company\u2019s securities.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d which permits us to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies or smaller reporting companies.\nThe Company qualifies as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, which we refer to as the \u201cJOBS Act.\u201d As such, the Company takes advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies for as long as it continues to be an emerging growth company, including (i) the exemption from the auditor attestation requirements with respect to internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, (ii) the exemptions from say-on-pay, say-on-frequency and say-on-golden parachute voting requirements and (iii) reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements. As a result, the Company\u2019s stockholders may not have access to certain information they deem important. the Company will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following October 14, 2021, the fifth anniversary of the IPO, (b) in which the Company has total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion or (c) in which the Company is deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of the Company Class A common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700.0 million as of the last business day of the Company\u2019s prior second fiscal quarter, and (ii) the date on which the Company has issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period.\nIn addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the exemption from complying with new or revised accounting standards provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act as long as the Company is an emerging growth company. An emerging growth company can therefore delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies, but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period, which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. For example, the Company will adopt ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) on January 1, 2021 and ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326) on January 1, 2023. This may make comparison of the Company\u2019s financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.\nThe Company is also a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d as defined in the Exchange Act. The Company may continue to be a smaller reporting company even after it is no longer an emerging growth company. The Company may take advantage of certain of the scaled disclosures available to smaller reporting companies until the fiscal year following the determination that its voting and non-voting common stock held by non-affiliates is more than $250 million measured on the last business day of its second fiscal quarter, or its annual revenues are more than $100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and its voting and non-voting common stock held by non-affiliates is more than $700 million measured on the last business day of its second fiscal quarter.\nThe Company cannot predict if investors will find the Company Class A common stock less attractive because the Company will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find the Company Class A common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for the Company Class A common stock and the Company\u2019s stock price may be more volatile.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nWe face significant and continuing competition, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe face significant and continuing competition in our business, which is characterized by rapid technological change and significant price competition. Market share can shift as a result of technological innovation and other business factors. Our customers consider many factors when selecting a product, including product reliability, clinical outcomes, economic outcomes, price and services provided by the manufacturer. Our ability to compete depends in large part on our ability to provide compelling clinical and economic benefits to our customers and payers, develop and commercialize new products and technologies and anticipate technological advances. Product introductions or enhancements by competitors which may have advanced technology, better features or lower pricing may make our products obsolete or less competitive. In addition, consolidation in the healthcare industry continues to lead the demand for price concessions or to the exclusion of some suppliers from certain of our markets, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. The presence of this competition in our market may lead to pricing pressure, which would make it more difficult to sell our products at a price that will make us profitable or prevent us from selling our products at all. As a result, we will be required to devote continued efforts and financial resources to bring our products under development to market, deliver cost-effective clinical outcomes, expand our geographic reach, enhance our existing products and develop new products for the advanced wound care and soft tissue repair markets. Even if we develop cost effective and/or new products, they may not be covered or reimbursed due to cost-containment and other financial pressures from payers.\nOur future capital needs are uncertain and we may need to raise funds in the future, and such funds may not be available on acceptable terms or at all.\nContinued expansion of our business will be expensive and we may seek funds from stock offerings, borrowings under our existing or future credit facilities or other sources. Our capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe revenues generated by sales of our products;\n\u2022\nthe costs associated with expanding our sales and marketing efforts;\n\u2022\nthe expenses we incur in manufacturing and selling our products;\n\u2022\nthe costs of developing and commercializing new products or technologies;\n\u2022\nthe cost of obtaining and maintaining regulatory approval or clearance of certain products and products in development;\n\u2022\nthe number and timing of acquisitions and other strategic transactions such as our acquisition of NuTech Medical, and integration costs associated with such acquisitions;\n\u2022\nthe costs associated with capital expenditures; and\n\u2022\nunanticipated general, legal and administrative expenses.\nOur operating plan may change as a result of many factors currently unknown to us and we may need additional funds sooner than planned. Additional funds may not be available when we need them on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. Furthermore, if we issue equity or convertible debt securities to raise capital, you may experience dilution, and the new equity or convertible debt securities may have rights, preferences and privileges that are senior to or otherwise adversely affect your rights as a stockholder. In addition, if we raise capital through collaboration, licensing or other similar arrangements, it may be necessary to relinquish valuable rights to our products, potential products or proprietary technologies, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. If we cannot raise capital on acceptable terms, we may not be able to develop our product candidates, enhance our existing products, execute our business plan, take advantage of future opportunities, or respond to competitive pressure, changes in our supplier relationships, or unanticipated customer requirements. Any of these events could adversely affect our ability to achieve our development and commercialization goals, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur future success depends on our ability to retain key employees, consultants and advisors and to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel.\nWe are highly dependent on our executive officers, the loss of whose services may adversely impact the achievement of our objectives. In particular, we depend on Gary Gillheeney, our President and Chief Executive Officer. Recruiting and retaining other qualified employees, consultants and advisors for our business, including scientific and technical personnel, will also be critical to our success. There is currently a shortage of skilled executives and scientific personnel in our industry, which is likely to continue. As a result, competition for skilled personnel is intense and the turnover rate can be high. We may not be able to attract and retain personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous medical device companies for individuals with similar skill sets. The inability to recruit or loss of the services of any executive, key employee, consultant or advisor may impede the progress of our research, development and sales growth objectives.\nOur ability to recruit, retain and motivate our employees and consultants will depend in part on our ability to offer attractive compensation. We may also need to increase the level of cash compensation that we pay to them, which may reduce funds available for research and development and support of our sales growth objectives. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient cash available to offer our employees and consultants attractive compensation.\nDespite our efforts to retain valuable employees, members of our management, scientific and development teams may terminate their employment with us. The loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees and our inability to find suitable replacements could potentially harm our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations. We do not maintain \u201ckey person\u201d insurance policies on the lives of these individuals or any of our other employees.\nMany of the companies that we compete against for qualified personnel have substantially greater financial and other resources and different risk profiles than we do. They may also provide more diverse opportunities and better chances for career advancement. Some of these characteristics may be more appealing to high quality candidates than what we can offer. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain high quality personnel, the rate and success at which we can discover, develop and commercialize product candidates will be limited.\nBusiness or economic disruptions or global health concerns could seriously harm our business.\nBroad-based business or economic disruptions could adversely affect our business and the sale of our products. For example, in December 2019 an outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus originated in Wuhan, China, and has since spread to a number of other countries, including the United States. To date, this outbreak has already resulted in extended shutdowns of certain businesses in the Wuhan region and has had ripple effects to businesses around the world. We cannot presently predict the scope and severity of any potential business shutdowns or disruptions, but if we or any of the third parties with whom we engage, including the suppliers, clinical trial sites, regulators, health care providers and other third parties with whom we conduct business, were to experience shutdowns or other business disruptions, our ability to conduct our business could be materially and negatively impacted. It is also possible that global health concerns such as this one could disproportionately impact the hospitals, clinics and healthcare providers to whom we sell our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and our results of operation and financial condition.\nChanges in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nGenerally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business are highly complex. These matters include, but are not limited to, revenue recognition, leases, income taxes, impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets and equity-based compensation. Changes in these rules, guidelines or interpretations could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition.\nIn addition, the preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities and equity, and the amount of net revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our operating results may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in our stock price.\nOur failure to comply with regulatory obligations could result in negative effects on our business.\nThe failure by us or one of our suppliers to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in, among other things, the FDA or other governmental authorities:\n\u2022\nimposing fines and penalties on us;\n\u2022\npreventing us from manufacturing or selling our products;\n\u2022\ndelaying or denying pending applications for approval or clearance of our products or of new uses or modifications to our existing products, or withdrawing or suspending current approvals or clearances;\n\u2022\nordering or requesting a recall of our products;\n\u2022\nissuing warning letters;\n\u2022\nimposing operating restrictions, including a partial or total shutdown of production or investigation of any or all of our products;\n\u2022\nrefusing to permit to import or export of our products;\n\u2022\ndetaining or seizing our products;\n\u2022\nobtaining injunctions preventing us from manufacturing or distributing any or all of our products;\n\u2022\ncommencing criminal prosecutions or seeking civil penalties; and\n\u2022\nrequiring changes in our advertising and promotion practices.\nFailure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could also result in civil actions against us by private parties (e.g., under the federal Lanham Act and/or state unfair competition laws), and other unanticipated negative consequences. If any of these actions were to occur it could harm our reputation and cause our product sales to suffer and may prevent us from generating revenue.\nOur officers, employees, independent contractors, principal investigators, consultants and commercial partners may engage in misconduct or activities that are improper under other laws and regulations, which would create liability for us.\nWe are exposed to the risk that our officers, employees, independent contractors (including contract research organizations, or CROs), principal investigators, consultants and commercial partners may engage in fraudulent conduct or other illegal activity and/or may fail to disclose unauthorized activities to us. Misconduct by these parties could include, but is not limited to, intentional, reckless and/or negligent failures to comply with:\n\u2022\nthe laws and regulations of the FDA and its foreign counterparts requiring the reporting of true, complete and accurate information to such regulatory bodies, including but not limited to safety problems associated with the use of our products;\n\u2022\nlaws and regulations of the FDA and its foreign counterparts concerning the conduct of clinical trials and the protection of human research subjects;\n\u2022\nother laws and regulations of the FDA and its foreign counterparts relating to the manufacture, processing, packing, holding, investigating or distributing in commerce of medical devices, biological products and/or HCT/Ps; or\n\u2022\nmanufacturing standards we have established.\nIn particular, companies involved in the manufacture of medical products are subject to laws and regulations intended to ensure that medical products that will be used in patients are safe and effective, and specifically that they are not adulterated or contaminated, that they are properly labeled, and have the identity, strength, quality and purity that which they are represented to possess. Further, companies involved in the research and development of medical products are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to protect research subjects and ensure the integrity of data generated from clinical trials and of the regulatory review process. Any misconduct in any of these areas - whether by our own employees or by contractors, vendors, business associates, consultants, or other entities acting as our agents - could result in regulatory sanctions, criminal or civil liability and serious harm to our reputation. Although we have a comprehensive compliance program designed to ensure that our employees\u2019, CRO partners\u2019, principal investigators\u2019, consultants\u2019, and commercial partners\u2019 activities and interactions with healthcare professionals and patients are appropriate, ethical, and consistent with all applicable laws, regulations, guidelines, policies and standards, it is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in preventing such conduct, mitigating risks, or reducing the chance of governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant fines, and other sanctions that may materially impair our ability to run a profitable business.\nIf we fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment, manufacture and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. Our operations involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological materials. Our operations also produce hazardous waste products. We generally contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and wastes. We cannot eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from our use of hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties.\nAlthough we maintain workers\u2019 compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of hazardous materials or other work-related injuries, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. In addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These current or future laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.\nUnanticipated changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of the Company\u2019s income or other tax returns could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company is subject to income tax in the United States and Switzerland, and the Company\u2019s domestic tax liabilities will be subject to the allocation of expenses in differing jurisdictions. The Company\u2019s future effective tax rates could be subject to volatility or adversely affected by a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nchanges in the valuation of the Company\u2019s deferred tax assets and liabilities;\n\u2022\nexpected timing and amount of the release of any tax valuation allowances;\n\u2022\ntax effects of stock-based compensation;\n\u2022\ncosts related to intercompany restructurings;\n\u2022\nchanges in tax laws, regulations or interpretations thereof; and\n\u2022\nlower than anticipated future earnings in jurisdictions where the Company has lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated future earnings in jurisdictions where the Company has higher statutory tax rates.\nIn addition, the Company may be subject to audits of the Company\u2019s income, sales and other taxes by U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. taxing authorities. Outcomes from these audits could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nA market for the Company\u2019s securities may not continue, which would adversely affect the liquidity and price of the Company\u2019s securities.\nThe price of the Company\u2019s securities may fluctuate significantly due to general market and economic conditions. An active trading market for the Company\u2019s securities may never develop or, if developed, it may not be sustained. In addition, the price of the Company\u2019s securities can vary due to general economic conditions and forecasts, the Company\u2019s general business condition and the release of the Company\u2019s financial reports. Additionally, if the Company\u2019s securities are not listed on, or become delisted from, Nasdaq for any reason, and are quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board, an inter-dealer automated quotation system for equity securities that is not a national securities exchange, the liquidity and price of the Company\u2019s securities may be more limited than if the Company was quoted or listed on Nasdaq or another national securities exchange. You may be unable to sell your securities unless a market can be established or sustained.\nThe Company\u2019s quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly and could fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors due to seasonality and other factors, some of which are beyond the Company\u2019s control, resulting in a decline in the Company\u2019s stock price.\nThe Company\u2019s quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly because of several factors, including:\n\u2022\nlabor availability and costs for hourly and management personnel;\n\u2022\nprofitability of the Company\u2019s products, especially in new markets and due to seasonal fluctuations;\n\u2022\nchanges in interest or exchange rates;\n\u2022\nimpairment of long-lived assets;\n\u2022\nmacroeconomic conditions, both nationally and locally;\n\u2022\nnegative publicity relating to our products;\n\u2022\nchanges in consumer preferences and competitive conditions; and\n\u2022\nexpansion to new markets.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about the Company, its business, or its market, or if they change their recommendations regarding the Company Class A common stock adversely, then the price and trading volume of the Company Class A common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for the Company Class A common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about us, the Company\u2019s business, the Company\u2019s market, or the Company\u2019s competitors. Securities and industry analysts do not currently, and may never, publish research on the Company. If no securities or industry analysts commence coverage of the Company, the Company\u2019s stock price and trading volume would likely be negatively impacted. If any of the analysts who may cover the Company change their recommendation regarding the Company\u2019s stock adversely, or provide more favorable relative recommendations about the Company\u2019s competitors, the price of the Company Class A common stock would likely decline. If any analyst who may cover the Company were to cease coverage of the Company or fail to regularly publish reports on it, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause the Company\u2019s stock price or trading volume to decline.\nChanges in laws, regulations or rules, or a failure to comply with any laws, regulations or rules, may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, investments and results of operations.\nThe Company will be subject to laws, regulations and rules enacted by national, regional and local governments and Nasdaq. In particular, the Company will be required to comply with certain SEC, Nasdaq and other legal or regulatory requirements. Compliance with, and monitoring of, applicable laws, regulations and rules may be difficult, time consuming and costly. Those laws, regulations or rules and their interpretation and application may also change from time to time and those changes could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, investments and results of operations. In addition, a failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations or rules, as interpreted and applied, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 16522, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "ORGO"}
